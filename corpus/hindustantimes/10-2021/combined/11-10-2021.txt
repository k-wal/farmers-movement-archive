11-10-2021||Lucknow||Prayagraj: Count of police escorts to be hiked in trains during festive season||Security onboard running trains has been reviewed and tightened following the recent shocking incident of gang rape of a 20-year-old woman by eight robbers on the Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express train in Maharashtra. Taking a serious view of the incident and the forthcoming festive season during which rush onboard trains, especially of women, increases significantly, the North Central Railway (NCR) has decided to increase the vigil by armed police escort teams on all trains and also hike their numbers as per need. The counts of women police personnel to maintain on running trains are also being increased so that they can better establish contact with women passengers and extend help for any security-related trouble that they may be experiencing during the journey, informed NCR officials. NCR has asked all its three divisions including Prayagraj, Agra and Jhansi to ensure heightened vigil on board the trains during the entire festive season, especially of women passengers, said chief public relations officer (CPRO) of NCR Shivam Sharma. He informed that to improve the security of women passengers on board trains, the Indian Railways has already implemented the “Meri Saheli” initiative which is further being strengthened. This initiative was launched as a pilot project by the railway protection force (RPF) across the South-eastern Railway for the security of women passengers in trains originating in that zone. Considering its success in instilling a sense of security among women passengers, this initiative has been rolled over to all zonal railways across the Indian Railways’ network from October 17, 2020, including NCR. “Meri Saheli” initiative has been launched to provide safety and security to lady passengers travelling by trains for their entire journey from originating station to terminating station. Dedicated teams of lady RPF personnel have been formed across all zonal railways for its implementation. Officials said that the deployment of RPF guards including women RPF personnel in ladies’ coaches is decided based on the vulnerability of the trains/sections concerned, timing, location of the area, threat perception of the hinterland, analysis of the past crime of data among others. Therefore, the deployment is dynamic and keeps changing from time to time. Under the initiative, a team of women officers and staff visit all of the passenger coaches including ladies’ coaches to identify women passengers. Details of their journey like coach number and seat number are noted down by the team, especially if a woman is travelling alone on the train. The passengers are briefed about integrated helpline number 139 and other precautions, for example, not to take food from strangers, buying food from IRCTC authorized stalls only and taking care of luggage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-count-of-police-escorts-to-be-hiked-in-trains-during-festive-season-101633975567499.html

Senior police officials reached the spot and carried out investigations. On the complaint of one of the injured, an FIR has been lodged against two named and some unidentified persons, police said. It is reported that the assault was a fallout of the suicide of a woman married to one of the sons of the deceased. According to reports, 62-year-old Mithialal Bind, his wife Rajjo Devi 58, his sons Abhishek 24 and Arvind 32 were asleep in his house situated close to the main road. Late in the night, around a dozen miscreants barged into their house and attacked them with iron rods and other weapons. The assailants tried to flee when locals rushed to the house on hearing the cries of family members. However, Mithialal caught the hand of one of the attackers despite being seriously injured. In a bid to rescue himself, the attacker whipped out a pistol and shot at Mithialal in the chest. The attackers fled while Mithialal died before he could be taken to the hospital. Sarai Inayat police reached the spot and admitted the injured to the nearest community health centre where the doctors referred them to SRN hospital. The body of the aged man was sent for autopsy, police added. Mithialal’s wife Rajjo Devi informed police that her son Arvind was married to Arti of Kathauta village in Phulpur. However, the couple was not in good relations and Arti committed suicide by hanging herself in November 2019. On the complaint of Arti’s brother Mahesh, an FIR was lodged against Arvind and other members of the family. Arvind was released on bail around two and half months back. Police questioning further revealed that Arvind was threatened by his in-laws after his marriage was fixed to a woman. Arti’s kin was pressuring him to give half of his land in the name of his two children Riya and Ritik who live with their maternal grandparents. SHO of Sarai Inayat police station Rakesh Chaurasia said on the complaint of Arvind, an FIR has been lodged against Mahesh Bind, Rohit and some unidentified persons.

11-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi begins using Pusa bio-decomposer spray in fields to curb stubble burning||The Delhi government started spraying the Pusa bio-decomposer across farms in the city, environment minister Gopal Rai said on Monday. Rai said the process began in the fields at Fatehpur Jat village, adding that it will be done at more villages in the coming weeks. The bio-decomposer has been developed to resolve the problem of stubble burning, a major contributor to air pollution in the capital. The solution decomposes the stubble and can turn the residue into organic manure in just 15-20 days. “The bio-decomposer has helped the Delhi government achieve great results in making stubble management pollution-free. The number of farmers getting the spraying done has doubled as compared to last year. Those farmers who have still not taken part in this environment-friendly practice can register themselves by calling on- 9643844287,” Rai told reporters. He added, “Pollution in Delhi increases during winters. It includes pollution from dust, vehicles, garbage burning, and biomass but the most crucial problem is stubble burning. This time the Delhi government has decided to sprinkle twice as much decomposer on more farms in Delhi.” The minister said the government has received applications for about 4,000 acres of farmland that will be sprayed with the decomposer. Last year, it was sprayed on 2,000 acres of farmland. Rai said, “The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has asked us to get a third-party audit done. We got it done by a central government agency, which heaped praises on its performance. We submitted the reports to the CAQM and also approached the union environment minister and state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Punjab.” Rai said the problem of stubble burning will require coordination among all state governments concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-begins-using-pusa-bio-decomposer-spray-in-fields-to-curb-stubble-burning-101633974307823.html

11-10-2021||Noida||Repair of CISF Road in Ghaziabad: UPPCB may act against contractor||The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) may initiate legal action against the contractor hired by the UP Jal Nigam for allegedly delaying the repair work of CISF Road in Indirapuram. Officials of UPPCB said that the dug-up road is impacting the air quality of the area. The CISF Road, which is used by thousands of commuters from Sahibabad, Vasundhara, and Indirapuram, among other areas, was dug up last year by the Jal Nigam for laying of pipeline to augment the discharge of treated water from the sewage treatment plants at Indirapuram. Though the work for the pipeline project ended in January this year, the road is yet to be repaired, the officials said, adding that the Vasundhara to NH-9 side of the road is causing massive air pollution due to numerous potholes and dust. “In May, we sent a letter to the Jal Nigam after which they intimated their vendor to expedite the repair work. But as of today, the road revamp work has not taken place. So, we have written to our headquarters for permission to prosecute Jal Nigam’s contractor. Once this is obtained, we will move the court under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. Ghaziabad has four air quality monitoring stations at Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Sanjay Nagar and Loni. Recently, the state government directed that all roads should be made pothole-free by October 30, citing a rise in pollution levels during the winter season. When asked, officials of the Jal Nigam said that the road repair and restoration work will be expedited. “The repair work for the road will start from tomorrow while the restoration works will begin from Monday next week. The work got delayed as the hot mix plant of our contractor was submerged in water last month. It is likely that the road will get repaired by October 30 as directed by the state government,” said Sanjay Gautam, general manager of UP Jal Nigam.The dug-up road is not only causing issues to commuters but also affecting residents of high-rises built near the road. “Our high-rise is adjacent to the road and residents have been suffering from polluted surroundings for more than a year now. Due to pending road repair, the works of utility services like cleaning of drains and streetlights have also suffered. We approached authorities many times, but to no avail,” said Kapil Tyagi, president of Divyansh Pratham, a high-rise. “The pending work has affected about 22 high-rises in the area. We even carried out protests against the bad condition of the CISF Road. But no one listened to us,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/repair-of-cisf-road-in-ghaziabad-uppcb-may-act-against-contractor-101633973348710.html
11-10-2021||Noida||Noida fails to hire agency to deliver quality drinking water, residents worried||Residents are worried about the supply of drinking water amid news of Ganga water supply being halted temporarily from October 17 due to cleaning work in the Upper Ganga canal.The Noida authority has also failed to rope in an agency that is supposed to improve the quality of drinking water in the region for the last three years.“For the last three years, the Noida authority has failed to hire an agency that can repair or make defunct Ranney wells (a type of radial well used to extract water from an aquifer with direct connection to a surface water source) and tubewells functional, and improve the quality of drinking water. The authority is not supplying quality drinking water as the groundwater here is saline. This festive season, we will have to depend on salty groundwater. We do not understand why the authority is failing on this important issue,” said Amit Gupta, a member of Progressive Community Foundation, a residents’ group in Noida.The authority, however, issued a tender yet again on Monday to hire an agency for a ₹9 crore project to take care of different water-related works--help treat water, increase the quantity and improve quality of drinking water.The last date to upload bids for the project is October 20, 2021. The authority issued a similar tender seven months ago, but no agency applied.The Noida authority issued a tender for the project for the first time towards the end of 2018. It re-issued the tender in October, 2019. It then invited an expression of interest (EOI) from firms to undertake the supply, installation, operation and maintenance of groundwater (Ranney wells and tube wells) treatment technology to supply potable water within Noida for five years. The authority had hoped to finalise a firm by the end of 2019.“We are repeatedly trying to rope in private firms, but are yet to succeed because agencies are not applying for the project. We hope this time we will be successful,” said RP Singh, deputy general manager of the Noida authority and head of the water works department.The present demand for water in Noida is 332mld [million litres per day]. To meet it, the authority supplies 56% Ganga water and 44% groundwater. There are 11 Ranney wells in Noida, besides hundreds of tubewells. Each Ranney well extracts stored groundwater and supplies it to households as well as other consumers. One Ranney well supplies 18mld water to the city.“The latest technology can address taste-related issues. The water in Noida is salty and has high levels of TDS [total dissolved solids]. We hope that with new technology, the firm will be able to improve the quality,” Singh.According to the authority’s water department, five of the 11 Ranney wells are completely shut. And 126 tubewells of the total 431 are not functional due to technical issues. As a result, the supply of groundwater will also be affected during the festive season, troubling residents. Like last year, when the Ganga water supply was halted for a month around Diwali while the canal was cleaned, the residents will have to make do with groundwater supply only this year as well, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-fails-to-hire-agency-to-deliver-quality-drinking-water-residents-worried-101633973227163.html
11-10-2021||Noida||Abadi land issue: Farmers break Noida authority lock, clash with cops||Agitating farmers on Monday clashed with the police force after allegedly breaking the lock of a gate on the Noida authority’s main administrative office premises.The protesting farmers were demanding additional compensation for their land the authority acquired for development about a decade ago.The police lathi-charged the farmers to disperse them while they were trying to enter the authority’s main office. During the clash, many farmers, and police constables, and officers sustained minor injuries.The Noida authority and the police filed FIRs against 25 farmer leaders and at least 1,000 unnamed protesters under Indian Penal Code sections 147, 148, 332, 324 and 353, said police.“We have been protesting for the last 41 days demanding more compensation, residential plots, settlement of abadi issues other benefits. But the Noida authority is trying to cheat us instead of addressing our demands. When we tried entering the authority office to strongly put forth our demands, the police started beating us and injured many. We will intensify our protest further,” said Sukhbir Yadav, a leader of Kisan Ekta Parishad, a farmer union.The farmers reached the authority’s Sector 6 office around 2.30pm, breaking the lock of a gate in the process. They also pushed aside a police barricade and managed to get to the entrance of the reception at the office.“When they broke the lock, we tried to calm them down, but they did not stop and pushed aside the barricade. They misbehaved with constables and also tore my uniform in the scuffle. We are taking strong action against those who broke the law,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, who led the police force at the protest site.Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari said farmers were trying to cross legal boundaries.“We have already accepted their justified demands. We cannot give in to their unjustified demands just because they want to disturb official work by force. We cannot accept their terms, which are against the law. The police will act in this matter as it pertains to the breaking of the law,” said Maheshwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/abadi-land-issue-farmers-break-noida-authority-lock-clash-with-cops-101633973167456.html
11-10-2021||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad air quality starts deteriorating slightly||The air quality of the region, which was stable over the past few months, has started to deteriorating slightly, according to data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).While Noida’s air quality is still in the moderate category, that of Greater Noida and Ghaziabad has slipped into the poor category, a first since the onset of monsoon in July.An air quality index (AQI) reading between 101 and 200 is considered moderate, between 201 and 300 is considered poor, between 301 and 400 is considered very poor, and above 400 is considered severe.According to the weather analysts, the air quality of the region may deteriorate further as dry winds will lead to dust particles being suspended in the air, thereby polluting it further.According to CPCB, the AQI reading of Greater Noida on Monday was 224 against 199 a day earlier. Similarly, Ghaziabad’s AQI reading also went up to 225 against 222 on Sunday.The AQI reading of Noida, meanwhile, managed to remain in the moderate category despite an increase--188 on Monday against 168 on Sunday.“The region is seeing dry westerly and northwesterly winds. Also, since the monsoon has passed, dust particles, which had settled on the ground earlier, have dried and are getting raised up by the already dust-carrying winds from Rajashtan and elsewhere. In the next week, as the mercury reduces, the entire region will experience haze and that’s when the air quality will fall further,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), further infusion of dust into the region’s air is likely.“Due to very dry conditions, local dust gets re-suspended, leading to high concentrations of PM10. The anticyclonic condition over northwest India helps in meso-scale transport of dust from the desert region,” said a Safar statement on Monday. Particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 are considered the main pollutants in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-ghaziabad-air-quality-starts-deteriorating-slightly-101633973107195.html

MCG officials said that they had been carrying out fogging only at places from where they received complaints from residents due to lack of proper equipment until now.The development comes amid a spike in dengue cases in Gurugram. According to the district administration’s release, until Monday, the city had recorded 126 cases of dengue this season. Of the 126, 43 new cases have been recorded since October 6. According to MCG officials privy to the matter, the civic body has around 65 fogging machines, of which 15 were found to be non-operational, due to which fogging operations were getting affected at several parts of the city.The details of the drive were shared by MCG joint commissioner Hariom Attri during the civic body’s House meeting at John Hall in Civil Lines.“Until now, we have been carrying out fogging as per complaints received from residents. Around a dozen fogging machines have been fixed and 38 teams have been formed to initiate a citywide fogging drive next week onwards,” Attri said in the House meeting.The issue of inadequate and non-functional fogging machines was also raised by Sheetal Bagri, the councillor of Ward 10, in the House meeting for discussion. Bagri asked the MCG to procure more machines for fogging purposes, which was approved by the House.During the House meeting, mayor Madhu Azad said that she found water ATMs across the city to be non-functional during a surprise inspection and found all of them being used as a board for advertisements. A decision was taken subsequently by the House that the contract of agencies found to be violating MCG’s work order would be terminated and given to a new contractor while notices will also be served to make around 45 ATMs operational across the city.The matter of constructing a model road in each of MCG’s 35 wards, which was approved in a previous House meeting, was also discussed on Monday. The House unanimously decided that the project should be carried out by an agency with experience in executing large-scale construction projects, rather than localised contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-full-scale-fogging-to-start-next-week-lack-of-equipment-hinders-drive-101633972873443.html
11-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG chief directs officials to take over DLF Phases 1-3 immediately||The commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Monday directed the officials concerned to start the takeover process of DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3 from Tuesday, bringing an end to an issue that has been pending since February 2016.Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, the MCG commissioner, took the decision during the MCG’s House meeting held at the John Hall in Civil Lines on Monday, while discussing an agenda that was proposed in the meeting regarding an update on MCG’s takeover of 19 privately developed colonies. While discussing the issue, Rama Rathee, the newly elected councillor of Ward 34, raised the issue that in February, the developer, DLF, had been given a June 30 deadline by the MCG for handing over DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3 to the civic body for maintenance. To this, chief engineer TL Sharma said that the MCG has scheduled a meeting with the developer on Tuesday to review the matter, and added that construction of only a few roads was pending, which was delayed due to the monsoon. Besides the roads, all other constructions and repairs to infrastructure have been completed by the developer, he said. In response to this, Ahuja said, “During Tuesday’s meeting, take a fresh commitment (a deadline) from DLF for completing the remaining deficiency work. However, in the interim, initiate the formal process for taking over the three colonies from tomorrow so that all paperwork and other formalities are completed and the colony can be taken over immediately.”“We will abide by the directions of MCG and extend all our support for a smooth transition,” a spokesperson for DLF said.According to MCG’s 2017 deficiency assessment report, ₹14.12 crore was required to fix civic deficiencies in DLF Phase-1, ₹9.43 crore for DLF Phase-2, and ₹11.89 crore for DLF Phase-3. Some of the deficiencies included repairs to roads, stormwater, sewerage drains, green belts, and parks.“We have been waiting for the takeover of the three colonies for the past five years. We have seen the upgrade in civic infrastructure in colonies taken over by the MCG, and want to avail of similar facilities in our area,” Dhruv Bansal, the spokesperson for Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city, including DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3, said.Besides the three colonies, the MCG also discussed the pending takeover of 11 more privately developed colonies.The MCG takeover of DLF Phase 1, 2 and 3, Sushant Lok-1, Palam Vihar, Nirvana Country, South City-1, Suncity, and South City-2 was decided by the Haryana government in 2016 and 2017 and most of them were taken over by the MCG in 2019.In a second phase of colony transfers, 11 privately developed colonies were added to the list by the government in 2019. The areas included Mayfield Garden, Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Sushant Lok-2, Sushant Lok-3, Greenwood City, Ardee City, Uppal Southend, DLF Phase-4, and DLF-5. However, the process is yet to take off in full force.In the meeting, Ahuja directed Sharma to submit a detailed project report (DPR) by November 1 on the deficiencies found in the 11 colonies during a survey carried out by the civic body earlier this year. Ahuja said that after the DPR is approved, it would be sent to the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) for further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-chief-directs-officials-to-take-over-dlf-phases-1-3-immediately-101633972872177.html
11-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram to get nine air quality monitors to check pollution||For better tracking of ambient air quality, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is working on installing real-time air quality display monitors at nine locations in the city where outdoor air purifiers are already installed, officials said on Monday. Further, the authority will also install 48 more such air purifiers in the city in the coming months. Under Project Air Care, 71 outdoor air purifiers or wind augmentation purifying units (Wayu), were installed in November last year at Sikanderpur Metro station, Arya Samaj Chowk, GMDA office, Iffco Chowk, Max Hospital Road, Bakhtawar Chowk, Medanta Hospital Road, AIT Chowk and Sector 54 Chowk Metro station. Subhash Yadav, head of the urban environment division, GMDA, said, “As it is difficult to check whether the devices are being cleaned on time, whether the air quality is actually improving or when the data is being collected, we have asked the partnering agencies to install low-cost sensors along with the purifiers from which data will directly be available with us at the GMDA dashboard. Only then it makes sense to go ahead with the next phase of the project, where 48 more such devices are to be installed in the city.” Officials said that the range of efficacy of these devices lies between 35 and 50%. This means that when the device is turned on, it can reduce at least a third of the total dust pollution load, if not more, in an area of 500 square metres. However, experts working and tracking air pollution said that a method like this does not work outdoors as the volume of ambient air is too much for these devices to be effective. Abhishek Srivastava, a city-based environmental engineer, said, “A concept like this can work only in closed spaces where there is limited volume of air, but in the open, such machines do not work. Traffic cross-sections are usually breezy as cars keep pushing the air, making these air purifiers redundant. Rather, what can work is to ensure that is there is lesser dust around traffic cross-sections by increasing plantation, holding the soil and better traffic movement.” The purifiers have been designed and developed by researchers at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Meanwhile, the air quality index in the city remained in the moderate zone for a second consecutive day on Monday after deteriorating to the poor zone of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index on Saturday. The city recorded an AQI of 152 with PM 10 and PM 2.5 as the prominent pollutants. Over the next two to three days the air quality is likely to improve marginally but largely remain in the moderate category, according to a weather bulletin issued for Delhi-NCR by the Air Quality Early Warning System. On Wednesday, the predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from the northwest direction of Delhi, with wind speed 8-16 kmph, mainly clear sky and mist in the morning predicted. Usually, winds coming from the northwest direction carry pollutants along with it, leading to a dip in air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-to-get-nine-air-quality-monitors-to-check-pollution-101633972870994.html

The state has an overall target of inoculating 1.8 million people over the next three days and issued directions in this regard on Monday evening. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “With the aim of covering maximum population during the festive season, this mega vaccination drive will be conducted. We will try our best to achieve the target.” Officials said that directions have been issued to all states by the Centre to achieve the target of administering 1 billion coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine doses this month. On Monday, a total of 10,065 people were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district with 4,926 people being given the first dose and 5,139 people being given the second dose of the vaccine. With this, over 3.3 million have been vaccinated in the district. At present, 67% of the eligible population in the district have been given both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, said officials.

11-10-2021||Noida||Work on two elevated roads expedited in Noida||The Noida authority on Monday restarted work on the Chilla elevated road project, which will ease traffic snarls on the Delhi-Noida Link Road. The authority also expedited work on the Bhangel elevated road project, adding the first girder on the road planned to address traffic congestion issues on Dadri Road, officials said.The authority had halted work on the Chilla elevated road project a year ago due to fund-related issues.On Monday, the authority used earth movers to remove sand at the stretch where the foundation had to be dug up.Though budgetary provisions have not been made yet by the Uttar Pradesh government that is likely to approve them in its cabinet meeting at the earliest, the authority decided to go ahead and complete the work using its own funds. Initially, the government had approved ₹605 crore for the 6km-long elevated road in 2020.However, half the amount was to be provided by the Public Works Department (PWD) of the UP government.“The Noida authority will pay the funds for now, as the payment of 50% from PWD will soon be done after approvals,” said a Noida authority official.The initial deadline for wrapping up the project was December 2021, but officials said that work will continue for another year. Once ready, Chilla elevated road will link Mayur Vihar in East Delhi with Mahamaya Flyover in Noida.The authority has also expedited work on the Bhangel elevated road project. Officials said Covid-19-induced lockdown had hit the progress of the infrastructure projects and, post that, the graded action plan to keep pollution levels in check had hit the construction timeline during the last winter season.“On Monday, the first girder was placed using cranes. We are hopeful of finishing the rest of the work in less than a year. The project is on track and we will try to maintain momentum before the onset of the winter season. Both the elevated roads will address congestion issues and offer smooth seamless connectivity to the thousands of commuters, who have to face hassles daily,” said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority.The deadline for the Bhangel elevated road fixed by the authority is December 2022. Two exit ramps will be also built to provide access to commuters travelling towards Vishwakarma Marg from the elevated road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-two-elevated-roads-expedited-in-noida-101633972868517.html
11-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram real estate: Demand for independent floors, plots on the up, states report||Independent floors and plots are getting increasingly popular in Gurugram and Faridabad since the Covid-19 pandemic started and over 20,000 such units are expected to be launched in the next year, according to a report released by a private consultancy, Anarock, on Monday. Experts said that the reason these floors are gaining traction is that they are larger than flats, delivery is quicker and can be customised to buyers’ requirements. The report stated that a major reason for these properties becoming popular is the fact that turnaround time for independent floors is lesser than group housing projects, and builders also get money faster. Also, money generated from builder floors starts flowing in within a year, while high-rises take at least four years to pay off. The average size of a builder floor flat is presently 2,000 square feet (sq ft) while that of an apartment is 1,375 sq ft, a difference of 625 sq ft. Santhosh Kumar, the vice-chairman, Anarock, said, “As many as 4,500 independent floors have already been launched in Gurugram and Faridabad in the first three quarters of 2021, accounting for over a 40% share of this period’s total supply in these two cities. Approximately 10,970 units, across different property types, have been launched in Gurugram and Faridabad between January and September 2021, of which 4,500 units are independent floor units.”According to the data, independent floors were popular between 2006 and 2010, when 21,300 such units were sold in these two cities. However, the demand dropped considerably between 2011 and 2015 as high-rise flats were preferred. The demand dropped further between 2016 and 2020, when only 2,900 such units were sold but the trend seems to have reversed over a decade on, with the demand for independent floors going up. Pankaj Tomar, a Gurugram-based broker, confirmed the development and said that quick delivery time and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Scheme, under which cheaper plots are being launched by developers, has helped in boosting the sale of independent floors and plots. “The sale of floors has also increased after Haryana government allowed the construction of four floors along with stilt,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-real-estate-demand-for-independent-floors-plots-on-the-up-states-report-101633972867113.html

Station Road police station in-charge Ashish Rajput said when the news of the incident reached the law enforcers, they went to the spot and held Jatav under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In another incident of a person killing his family member, a court in Kerala’s Kollam on Monday convicted a man, named P Sooraj, 32, of murder for letting loose a cobra on his wife, 25, and making the deadly reptile bite her when she was asleep, last year.The court said the accused did not deserve any sympathy for the brutal crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-man-beats-minor-daughter-to-death-for-coming-home-late-from-navratri-pandal-101633971631039.html
11-10-2021||Mumbai||Certificate of unsoundness of mind after attack not reliable, says Bombay high court||The Bombay high court recently rejected the petition filed by a 27-year-old architect and resident of South Mumbai wherein he had sought quashing of the proceedings arising out of an FIR against him. The man was booked by the Marine Drive police station as he had attacked and injured two police personnel who tried to stop him as he was carrying a chopper and was moving suspiciously in the area. The architect’s counsel had claimed that his client was not in a proper frame of mind when the incident occurred and as the attack was not premeditated, he should not be made to undergo a trial for intent to murder and other sections of the Indian Penal Code under which he is booked. The court however held that as no proof was placed before the court to prove the unsoundness of the man before, during or after the incident, it was not inclined to quash the proceedings arising out of the FIR and rejected the petition. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the petition filed by Karan Nair was informed by advocate Rizwan Merchant that his client was booked on May 8, 2020, as police inspector Jitendra Kadam and a sub-inspector from Marine Drive police station received cuts on their shoulder and hand respectively by the chopper which Nair was wielding. Merchant claimed that his client was not aware of what he was doing as he had suffered a bout of insanity and had no intention to harm anyone. In light of these submissions Merchant sought reliefs. According to the complaint filed at the behest of Kadam, on May 8, while on patrol Kadam spotted Nair roaming around with a chopper in his hand. Nair was not wearing a mask which was mandatory due to the Covid-19 pandemic which was at its peak at the time. The complaint states that when Kadam confronted Nair, the knife wielding man threatened to attack the police personnel and ran off. Kadam gave chase and when he managed to catch Nair, he was hit by the chopper on his shoulder. The sub-inspector who had joined Kadam in the chase also received a gash on his right arm by the chopper. The police finally managed to overpower Nair and brought him to the police station where he was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act. Merchant submitted that when Nair was produced before the magistrate for remand he had claimed to be of unsound mind at the time of the incident, but the magistrate refused to accept and assigned the case for trial. Merchant added that as the act of assaulting the police personnel was not premeditated and Nair was not aware of the outcome of his act he could not be subjected to the rigours of the trial. However, additional public prosecutor S R Shinde for the state and Kadam submitted that the claim of unsoundness of mind could not be accepted as there was no proof of Nair suffering from any such ailment prior, during or after the incident. Nair assaulted the cops fully aware of what he was doing and was also aware of the consequence of his act, hence the petition should not be entertained. After hearing submissions the bench held that the claim of unsoundness of mind could not be accepted as the mental health certificate submitted by Nair was secured after he was released on bail and it was prepared based on the statements of the mother of Nair. The bench held that as the certificate did not throw light on the mental state of Nair at the time of the incident and as the narrative of the incident showed that he was aware of his act and its consequences, it was not inclined to grant the reliefs sought and rejected the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/certificate-of-unsoundness-of-mind-after-attack-not-reliable-says-bombay-high-court-101633972087334.html

The anti-corruption agency has now started an open inquiry to check if she has amassed assets disproportionate to her known source of income. Patil, an ACP of Meghwadi division, was trapped on October 8 in her office for allegedly demanding ₹1 lakh bribe and accepting ₹40,000 bribe from a shop owner. The shop owner had approached Patil as the local police was not taking his complaint regarding a case of trespassing. Patil had allegedly demanded ₹1 lakh from the complainant, promising him that his complaint would be lodged and the accused would also not trouble him in the future. The complainant gave Patil the first installment of ₹10,000 on the same day, the ACB said The ACB on Friday trapped Patil red handed while accepting ₹40,000 of the bribe money at her office. “We have commenced an open inquiry. If the inquiry prima facie reveals that Patil had amassed disproportionate assets then a separate case of DPA would be registered against her,” said an ACB officer. The ACB has also sent a proposal to Mumbai police seeking her suspension. Patil has been booked under section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. On Monday an ACB court remanded Patil to magistrate custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/acb-starts-open-inquiry-into-assets-of-arrested-acp-in-mumbai-101633971667113.html
11-10-2021||Patna||Bihar Cong stages silent protest against Lakhimpur Kheri killings||Expressing their solidarities with the farmers’ issues, the leaders and workers of the state Congress staged a silent dharna here in front of the Income Tax office on Monday and sought immediate dismissal of Central minister Ajay Kumar Teni whose son Ashish Mishra allegedly mowed down at least four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh last week. All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar Bhakta Charan Das, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha and a host of other leaders sat on dharna, holding placards in their hands, seeking the expulsion of Teni and justice for those killed in Lakhimpur Kehri violence. Four farmers, three BJP workers and a journalist were killed during the farmers’ protest. AICC media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the BPCC’s protest was part of the nationwide party’s programme to sympathise with farmers who have been agitating for the past ten months for the scrapping of three controversial farms’ acts. “Hundreds of farmers have died during the stir, but the government is not listening to them. Instead, the BJP leaders have been applying all sorts of conspiracy to defame them and attacking them like terrorists,” said Mishra. Even as senior state Congress leaders, including the Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma, former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad, chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore, staged the protest with party workers, farmers were conspicuous by their absence. Explaining the purpose of the dharna, Mishra said that it was aimed at throwing moral support to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and other states, which have been witnessing protests from the agriculturists. “Bihar’s farmers are not restive, as they could not perceive the fallout of the draconian acts. There is hardly any strong farmers’ body in Bihar that can sensitise them about the consequences of the new laws,” added the MLC..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cong-stages-silent-protest-against-lakhimpur-kheri-killings-101633971547259.html
11-10-2021||Noida||Noida to get two ART centres for AIDS patients by next month||By next month, Gautam Budh Nagar will have two Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres for treatment of patients of human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). ART is a lifelong therapy given to patients suffering from HIV/AIDS. The two centres are to be set up at the district hospital in Noida’s Sector 30 and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida. Currently, the district does not have a single ART centre and patients have to go to Ghaziabad or Meerut every month to collect their ART kits. “The process for hiring of the medical staff is underway and the ART centre will be ready by next month,” said Dr Sushma Chandra, chief medical superintendent of the district hospital. The hospital already has an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) for HIV patients. Currently, there are three ICTCs under the district health department -- one each at district Hospital, community health centre (CHC) Dadri and CHC Bhangel . Apart from this, testing facilities are also available at all CHCs and PHCs in the district.Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS said, “A proposal was placed in the meeting of the governing body last week and after getting the approval, space has been earmarked in the hospital for the ART centre. The hospital already has an ICTC that is functional since March this year,” said Dr Gupta.Since April this year, GIMS has tested 282 patients for HIV, of which two have been found positive. Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “Setting up of ART Centres in the district is priority for the district health department and officials have been asked to expedite the process and start the centres as soon as possible.” Dr Shirish Jain, district tuberculosis officer, said, “This year till July, 16,481 people have been tested for HIV/AIDS, of which 68 have been found positive. Since 2015, a total of 197,164 people have been tested for HIV/AIDS in the district, of which 868 have been found positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-to-get-two-art-centres-for-aids-patients-by-next-month-101633971011528.html
11-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad misses target during two mega Covid-19 vaccination drives||The pace of daily vaccinations in the district has started slowing in the last one week, and health department officials have attributed it to the ongoing festival season. The officials said that due to low turnout, the district could not meet its targets during the two mega Covid-19 vaccination drives held on October 8 and 11. The target for October 8 mega drive was 45,000 and the district could vaccinate only 30,584 people, while on Monday only 35,732 people were inoculated against the target of 55,000, according to the Co-WIN portal figures. “It is due to the ongoing festivals that beneficiaries are not coming in large numbers and there is a dip in daily average turnout. Before the start of the festive season, the daily average turnout was about 29,000, which has now come down to about 20,000. So, the mega vaccination drives held on October 8 and 11 also suffered and the targets could not be achieved,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. During the first mega vaccination drive on August 3, the district administered 79,822 doses; 42,444 doses during the second drive on August 16; 67,040 during third mega drive on August 27 and 69,248 during the fourth drive held on September 6. The district achieved its highest single day coverage of 110,664 on September 27 during the sixth mega vaccination drive. Ghaziabad has so far given 3,000,750 doses that include 888,195 second doses, according to the Co-WIN portal figures. “At present, we have a sufficient stock of Covid vaccines as our allotment has also increased from 16,000 to 23,000 per day. To speed up the coverage, our teams, through tele-calling, are urging beneficiaries to come to Covid vaccination centres and get themselves vaccinated,” Dr Mathuria added. Experts said that the beneficiaries should not be complacent. “It is generally seen that people do not move out during the festival season as they usually devote more time to prayers. So, the vaccination turnout has slowed down. But it is essential to get fully vaccinated to get maximum protection against Covid-19,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-misses-target-during-two-mega-covid-19-vaccination-drives-101633971009083.html
11-10-2021||Mumbai||Coal supply improves, power generation still hit in Maharashtra||With the improvement in the coal supply in the last couple of days, the state authorities expect the situation to regularise by bridging the demand-supply gap by the end of the week. Currently, the state authorities are compelled to purchase power from the open market at a high rate, and cutting the supply to the agricultural pump by two hours to meet the demand. The short supply of coal for thermal power generation in the last two weeks has resulted in shutting down of 13 units of state-owned and private power stations resulting in drop in generation of more than 3,300 MW. The state government’s six units with a total capacity of 1,860 MW and seven other units of two private players with a total capacity of 1,450 MW were shut for the past few days. Few of them have now resumed power generation. This has forced the state to buy power from open market at high rate ranging between ₹2.98 and ₹20 per unit. The state has purchased 800MW to 2200 MW power per day since October 1 and has spent ₹140 crore on it. The current per day demand of power hovers between 17,500-18,000 MW, but the state expects it to go to 22,000MW because of the rise in temperature in October, increase in agricultural activities and ongoing festive season. “The current shortfall of about 4,000MW is met through a hike in hydro-power generation at Koyana and other stations to 2,000MW and remaining from the power purchase through energy exchange. We have also reduced the supply of the power to agricultural pumps by 2 hours in the night and have appealed people to utilise the power judiciously during peak hours in the morning and evening. We have started receiving 1 lakh MT coals in the past few days against the daily requirement of 1.15 lakh MT and expect the supply to improve further. With the improvement in the supply, we are resuming Bhusawal unit of 500MW from tomorrow and expect all other units to go operational in next eight days,” said an official from MSEDCL. Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary, energy department, said, “The coal supply is improving and we have started resuming the power generation in the units which were shut.

11-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur Kheri: People start arriving for antim ardas of killed farmers||People from other states have started arriving in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri for the “antim ardas” of the farmers killed in the violence there on October 3.No politician will be allowed to share the dais with farm leaders during the last prayers for the four farmers killed in the incident, said a Bhartiya Kisan Union leader. The programme will be held at Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri.The collective antim ardas is expected to be attended by farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait arrived on Monday for the last prayers.BKU-Tikait’s district president Amandeep Singh Sandhu said, “Preparations are under way for the antim ardas (final prayers) at a field, away from the spot where the violence took place in Tikunia village.Rashtriya Lok Dal national secretary Anil Dubey said his party leader Jayant Chaudhary is scheduled to go to Lakhimpur Kheri.However, BKU-Tikait district vice-president Balkar Singh said, “No political leader will be allowed to share the stage where only Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders will be present”.The SKM is an umbrella organisation of farmer unions spearheading the protest against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws, which were enacted last year.Asked whether political leaders would participate in the prayers, the BKU-Tikait district office-bearers said, “Only Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders would share the stage.”They said the programme was being organised by Samyukta Kisan Morcha.The venue of the function spans 15-acre land over a kilometre from the flashpoint in Tikunia.Agricultural fields were levelled to accommodate the stage, audience seating area, parking and create space for langar (community meal).Security has been tightened in and around Tikunia to maintain law and order during the antim ardas programme.Apart from the Lakhimpur Kheri police, Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel have been deployed.

11-10-2021||Bhopal||Social media influencer booked for shooting video at Mahakaleshwar temple in MP||A 28-year-old woman was booked for shooting a video on a Bollywood song at Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, police said.A resident of Indore, Manisha Roshan shot a video clad in a saree at the temple premises on a Bollywood song and later posted it on her Instagram account a week ago.After the video went viral on social media, the temple’s main priest Mahesh Pujari called the video objectionable and asked the police to take action against her for hurting religious sentiments.After the objection raised by the priest and a few others, Roshan deleted the video and also apologized for her action. But another resident, Rakesh Parmar, filed a complaint at Mahakaal police station against the woman on Sunday.Ujjain, city superintendent of police, Pallavi Shukla said, “A case has been registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code against Roshan as nobody is allowed to disturb the sanctity of the temple.”Roshan said her intention was not to hurt anyone. “I didn’t shoot any obscene video but a small video which was later synced with a Bollywood song. I already tendered my apology for that,” she added. This is the third case in a month when an FIR has been registered against social influencers for shooting a video in a public space or a place of worship.The first case was registered in Indore against a woman for dancing on a road while another case was registered against a woman in Chhatarpur for dancing in a temple.Home minister Narottam Mishra said, “The state government or any other person has no problem in people shooting videos for posting them on social media but people should take care of decency and mind the place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/social-media-influencer-booked-for-shooting-video-at-mahakaleshwar-temple-in-mp-101633969987789.html
11-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh: Shops stay shut, transport hit, office-goers impacted in Mumbai||In wake of the state-wide bandh called by the ruling coalition of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, the road transport services were largely suspended, affecting Mumbaiites on Monday. Largely shops, restaurants, and establishments stayed shut in the Maximum City through the day, with workers of the ruling coalition enforcing the bandh in some parts.In Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking’s buses stayed off the roads after isolated incidents of stone-pelting in some areas, affecting office-goers in the morning. The black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws continued to ply, but at some locations, the drivers reportedly charged almost double the fare to ferry passengers. Mumbai suburban local trains and the Metro line were operational and remained unaffected.As Mumbaiites were unaware that BEST buses were not plying, initially there was crowding at bus stops. Bus services were majorly affected as BEST employees’ union had supported the bandh. After 11 am, bus stops wore a deserted look as the services stopped after buses were vandalised in the morning.A total of 11 buses were vandalised on Monday, according to a BEST spokesperson. BEST administration had sought for police protection around 9am in order to operate the services. BEST operated 1,833 buses till 6.45pm on Monday evening, a BEST spokesperson added. It operates above 3,000-3,300 buses everyday and has a daily ridership of around 2.5 million passengers.The ruling coalition has claimed that the call for the shutdown had received an “overwhelming” response. Party workers of the coalition carried out protests and an enforced bandh by asking shop keepers to down their shutters. The impact of the bandh would have been greater on people in the city had the work-from-home not been underway at most corporate offices and had the ruling coalition staged rail roko and disrupted the suburban train services.The pulse of Mumbai’s commercial areas, Fort and Nariman Point, had less hustle-bustle during the peak office hours. Government and private offices saw less attendance that usual. Street vendors, too, in Fort were absent. Popular markets in south Mumbai, such as Crawford Market, Colaba Causeway and Fashion Street, which buzz with street vendors and shoppers on other days, were shut. In Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), attendance in offices of financial and other sectors was low as staffers could not get public transport for travel. Some corporate houses hired private buses for their staff to commute. A few managements also asked their employees to work from home. The bandh’s impact was seen in most in parts of central Mumbai, where markets of Dadar and Matunga were closed, and all shops in these areas along with Worli, Parel, Lower Parel and Mahim had downed their shutters. The main entrances of the wholesale vegetable markets of Dadar and Matunga were locked. The Hindamata cloth market in Dadar (East), which is the largest wholesale market in the city, was also closed on Monday, as shopkeepers showed solidarity with the state-wide bandh.“Who is going to take a risk as Shiv Sena is known for violence,” said a shopkeeper. However, local Sena leaders said they had approached various associations on Sunday asking them to shut shop on Monday. “We requested the shopkeepers’ associations and they agreed. It was a successful bandh,” said former Sena corporator Parag Chavan.Shivaji Park in Dadar, which is sees many sporting activities every morning, wore a deserted look on Monday, even though the gymkhana office was open. While roads in Dadar, Worli, and Matunga appeared deserted, south Mumbai’s Marine Drive, Girgaum Chowpatty and Churchgate areas saw usual traffic. In the suburbs, tourists were spotted at Versova and Juhu beaches, but the shops around the beaches were shut.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar led the Shiv Sena protest at Worli. She, along with part workers, staged a dharna on Worli junction road to prevent vehicles from passing by.“We are protesting against the anti-farmers’ policy and the gruesome murder [of farmers] by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),” said Pednekar. Shiv Sainiks also staged protests in Chembur and Shivaji Park and on the Western Express Highway to prevent vehicles from plying. Several party workers of Sena, NCP and Congress were detained by the police.The Shiv Sena was all buoyant in its stronghold of Dadar and Parel, Worli, Lalbaug and Byculla. Its workers roamed the streets, ensuring that the bandh is enforced strictly.At Shivaji Park, former mayor Vishaka Raut led the workers from Sena Bhavan to the nearby Shiv Sena shakha. The Sena workers seemed electrified as they had enforced bandhs for years when its founder, late Bal Thackeray,reigned over the party.In the western suburbs, shopkeepers gave a mixed response to the bandh as only a few downed their shutters. Many shops were open in Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, etc. “We were asked by workers of a political party to keep our shops shut. Hence, did so and are planning to open in the evening. It is better to keep the shop shut without profits rather than bear losses, in case of vandalism,” a Kandivli shopkeeper Nayan Khatri said earlier in the day. Natraj Market, one of the largest retail shopping centres in Malad, too remained shut. Shops at Irla Market, Bandra’s Linking and Hill Roads and Elco Market also remained closed. However, some shops were open at Pali Hill in Bandra.Similarly, lone shops of electronics, hardware, clothing and accessories, stationaries and groceries in and around Mohammad Ali Road operated as usual. But most shops in the markets under JJ flyover in south Mumbai had downed their shutters.Viren Shah, chief of the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association (FRTWA), said the traders had decided to keep shops closed till 4pm in support of the bandh at the “request” of Shiv Sena leaders. Earlier, FRTWA had opposed the shutdown, citing the huge losses endured by the shop owners in the past 18 months.At Byculla’s Clair Road, which houses many children, mothers and women’s clothing stores, it was business as usual. A shopkeeper said, “We do not want our business to be affected. We do not believe that one day of protest, where we lose our income for the day completely, will make any difference. Business has been slow, but we had a few customers walking in during the day.” Many shops in Byculla and Nagpada in south Mumbai remained open on Monday. BJP and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had opposed the bandh. “People have hardly recovered from the Covid-19 lockdowns and here the Shiv Sena is forcing people to observe a bandh. If the Sena wants to show its empathy for farmers, they should donate one-day’s salary to them instead of troubling the people,” said MNS leader Ameya Khopkar.Nariman Point and Fort, which are busy commercial areas, saw thin attendance in offices. Many office goers who take their private vehicles to work did not do so fearing violence. In addition, many offices told their employees to work from home. “I could not risk taking my vehicle to Fort as there was a danger of it being ransacked on the way,” said Jitu Damania, who runs an export business and travels from Kandivli to Nariman Point daily. Similarly Kaveri Sharma, who works in a private office, said she was told to work from home. “My office staff was told not to take the risk of coming to office,” said Sharma.Meanwhile, first information reports (FIR) have been registered in other parts of the state in connection with the incidents of violence reported during the Maharashtra Bandh on Monday. These incidents were reported in Navi Mumbai, Amravati, Kolhapur, Nagpur and Mira-Bhayander regions. Police sources said there was a huge clash between members of BJP and workers of MVA allies in Jalgaon. BJP members were allegedly trying to open a few shops while MVA activists were trying to ensure that they remain shut. At few places, political party activists also tried to close the highway and burn tires. At the time of going to press, the state police headquarters was in the process of collecting information about violence reported in other districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-shops-stay-shut-transport-hit-office-goers-impacted-in-mumbai-101633969686983.html
11-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh: Show of strength by MVA over UP violence to counter BJP’s attacks||Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the three-party coalition which formed the government in the state two years ago, put up its first joint show of strength on Monday’s state-wide shutdown or bandh. Though it was in solidarity with farmers in the wake of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, the ruling coalition has now taken an aggressive stand against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Narendra Modi-led Central government. At Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri, farmers were allegedly mowed down by the son of a minister in Modi’s government.The MVA parties, while expressing solidarity with the farmers, have tried to paint the picture that the BJP was against them. MVA was criticised for bringing inconvenience to the citizens who are already troubled due to the Covid-enforced lockdown, but it succeeded in making the Lakhimpur Kheri incident a talking point across the state. Besides, by enforcing the bandh together, the three parties have also put up a united face, which could help them in forthcoming local body elections. Significantly, the ruling coalition’s aggression is seen as its response to the Centre’s action – several MVA leaders are facing probe by central agencies. The MVA government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, has been facing challenges posed by the opposition BJP and the Central government led by it ever since it came to power in November 2019. It began with the clashes between the Centre and MVA government over the transfer of probe in the Bhima-Koregaon violence and the Sushant Singh Rajput death cases. The state government has been cornered by BJP over the issues of corruption by its leaders and ministers regularly. Many Shiv Sena and NCP leaders have been facing action by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Income-Tax (I-T) authorities. The ruling party leaders have claimed the action to be out of political vendetta and have also raised questions on why the agencies do not go after any BJP leader.“Fed up with the daily bashing, the three parties saw the outrage over mowing down the farmers as an opportunity. Our leadership was upset over the treatment meted out to its leader Priyanka Gandhi in UP during the incident, while the other two parties [Shiv Sena and NCP] were already upset over action against their leaders by the Centre using the agencies. The success of the bandh has helped MVA combine in many ways to score over the opposition,” said a senior Congress leader, requesting anonymity of name.The three ruling parties ensured that the bandh, which was happening after a long duration in the state, was successful. “Keeping auto-taxis and buses off the road and shutting shops in Mumbai, Thane and other parts of MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) without Shiv Sena’s involvement was not possible. The other two parties [Congress and NCP] took responsibility of the region of their dominance in Vidarbha, western Maharashtra etc. Traders and their unions were taken into confidence to ensure that they keep the establishments shut. In some cases, state administration, too, was utilised to keep the activities shut,” said an NCP leader.The state cabinet on Wednesday had passed a resolution to condemn the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Any such resolution in the cabinet for an incident in some other state is rarely passed, but the three ruling parties were unanimous on it. Similarly, the decision of the bandh was taken unanimously, though it was initiated by NCP. Party chief Sharad Pawar’s appeal to the people in the backdrop of the I-T raids on his nieces, too, had helped charge up NCP leaders to actively participate in bandh.Political analyst Hemant Desai said that the bandh was successful and it could politically help the three ruling parties. “They have put up a joint show of strength against BJP, which is their common political rival. It was necessary for MVA for two reasons: first, BJP is leaving no opportunity to target the three ruling parties, and giving it back was necessary for the ruling alliance. Secondly, MVA government has not been able to perform anything big that can be showcased. The bandh was an attempt to keep that failure under the carpet. The success of the bandh will, however, help the ruling parties in the forthcoming local body as well as in the 2024-Assembly elections,” he said.Leader of opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said that the three ruling parties are trying to gain political mileage out of the issue. “They have nothing to do with the farmers. Farmers had been fired at in Pune’s Maval 10 years ago during the Congress-led government’s rule. The Congress-led Rajasthan government had heavily lathicharged farmers two days ago. The state government has not been able to offer any relief to the flood-affected farmers in Marathwada and now they are protesting the incident in Lakhimpur. They are shredding crocodile’s tears,” he said.“This is a state-sponsored bandh implemented with the help of the police and administration. Traders and their unions were threatened to participate in it. The ruling parties misused the police and administration to impose the bandh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-show-of-strength-by-mva-over-up-violence-to-counter-bjp-s-attacks-101633969507059.html
11-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh 100% success, says MVA||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), a three-party coalition of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, enforced a Maharashtra bandh (statewide shutdown), which they termed a 100% success, on Monday, protesting the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. Shops, commercial activities and public transport largely remained shut in the state, including commercial capital Mumbai, affecting normal life. The bandh was by and large peaceful. barring a few incidents of stone pelting at BEST buses in Mumbai and minor skirmishes between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and MVA workers at a few places. The opposition, BJP, accused the ruling coalition of misusing police machinery to enforce bandh in the state. They also accused the MVA coalition of state-sponsored terror over forcing the people for a shutdown. Refuting the allegations, MVA responded, saying whatever happened in Lakhimpur Kheri can be called a terror act.Leaders and workers from the MVA coalition took to the streets to ensure the shutdown was observed in Mumbai and in the state that was called to condemn the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which four cultivators were mowed down by a SUV during a protest that triggered the violence. The farmers alleged that Ashish Mishra, son of Ajay Mishra, Union minister of state for home, was driving the vehicle that killed the farmers.The bandh was followed by protests and agitations such as blocking of roads and highways, bike rallies and silent protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre, which also led to traffic snarls at several places in the state.The essential services, however, remained unaffected as they were allowed to be operated during the shutdown.Shops and commercial establishments at most of the places were shut since morning. Those who refused to support the bandh were forced to do so by the ruling party workers. The bandh affected the commuters in the morning rush hour in Mumbai and neighbouring areas as bus services were stalled, following incidents of stone pelting at some places. Eight BEST buses and one leased bus were vandalised between midnight yesterday and Monday morning in Dharavi, Mankhurd, Shivaji Nagar, Charkop, Oshiwara, Deonar and Inorbit Mall, the officials said.While the BEST bus services were affected in the wake of the bandh, the local trains that are considered the lifeline of Mumbai, were operating normally as no incident of “rail roko” was reported anywhere in the city. However, they were running fully packed as commuters shifted to suburban rail services. “Our services are running as per schedule,” Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer of the Central Railway, told PTI.The Metro rail services were also operating normally in the city. According to the Union leaders, most of the black-yellow cabs and auto-rickshaws were off roads in the metropolis. “The black-yellow taxis are operating, but their number was less,” said AL Quadros, general secretary, Mumbai Taximens’ Union.City’s renowned lunchbox deliverymen popularly known as “Dabbawala”, supported the bandh by discontinuing their services on Monday. Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA) that had earlier declared not to support the bandh, also later changed their stand, after Sena leaders spoke to them. “After the request of Shiv Sena and other party leaders, we have decided to keep shops closed till 4pm in support of the bandh call by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in protest against the killing of farmers,” said Viren Shah, FRTWA chief.At some places, Sena workers were also seen beating autorickshaw drivers to force them to go off the road. There were also complaints of Sena workers puncturing tyres of vehicles to stall the traffic movement at a few places. They burned tyres on the eastern express highway during bandh at Vikhroli in Mumbai. MVA party workers have taken to the streets across Mumbai and several areas in the state, including Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Solapur, and Nagpur. Activists of the Sena also found caning autorickshaw drivers who were ferrying passengers and defying the bandh in Thane. A joint protest by workers from all the three ruling parties was also held at Samvidhan Chowk at Nagpur. Sena workers were detained by the police when they were staging a rasta roko on Pune-Bengaluru national highway in Kolhapur.In Pune, traders at wholesale vegetable and fruit markets supported bandh by choosing not to operate while several auto rickshaw unions also participated in the protest by not bringing out their vehicles on the street. Public transport such as PMPML also chose not to ply buses till 12pm, but the state transport (ST) buses operated as normal. According to PMPML officials, they have decided not to ply buses in view of bandh and to avoid any damage.Most of the APMC (agriculture produce market committee) markets were closed in solidarity with the bandh including Navi Mumbai, Nashik, Pune, Dhule, Nandurbar, Manmad, among others. All the prominent farmers’ organisations have already declared support to the bandh.This was the first time the three ruling partners together held a state-wide protest. It got good response in Thane, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Sangli, Parbhani, Amravati, among other districts. In Jalgaon, NCP and BJP workers clashed against each over enforcing the bandh. A similar incident was recorded in Buldhana where a skirmish took place after BJP and MVA workers came face to face.In Mumbai, mayor Kishori Pednekar held a protest at Worli along with Sena workers by sitting on the road. Shiv Sena leader and former minister Sachin Ahir detained by the police for agitating at Worli.Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed that the statewide bandh was 100% successful. “Bandh in state was 100% successful, as people have shown their anger against the incident of mowing down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri,” Raut said. “If someone is opposing this Maharashtra bandh then they must ask themselves if they are citizens of this country,” he said in response to the BJP and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) who opposed the shutdown.To participate in the bandh, state NCP chief Jayant Patil, Baramati member of parliament (MP) Supriya Sule and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik held a protest at Hutatma Chowk in south Mumbai.“The major reason behind the bandh is that the BJP government neglected the farmers’ protest at the borders of Delhi, but Lakhimpur Kheri incident is a clear murder. They were killed by a BJP minister’s son. It appears that BJP wants to crush the farmers’ agitation and to condemn the incident we have called this bandh,” said Patil. “BJP has unfortunately opposed it. It means they are supporting those who have murdered the farmers by mowing them down,” he added“It is unfortunate to say that humanity has died. There was a time when humanity was alive in politics, but the current BJP government at the Centre has finished it off. We have called this bandh against the murder of the farmers. If you watch the video, you will get goosebumps even today. Have you ever seen such cruelty? It was a cruel incident. Condemning the incident will not be enough and he (Ashish Mishra) should be brought to justice. The union minister Ajay Mishra should have resigned from his position by taking moral responsibility for the incident,” Sule said.While all key Congress leaders, including PWD minister Ashok Chavan, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, state president Nana Patole, Mumbai chief Bhai Jagtap, women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur, state working president Arif Naseem Khan, among others, held a Maun Vrat (silence protest) agitation outside Raj Bhavan against farmers killing in Lakhimpur Kheri.Patole said they have received spontaneous response from traders, businessmen to the bandh as they, too, were upset against BJP rule after GST implementation. “The spontaneous response to the band is an indication that the people have stood up against the rule of oppression by the BJP government. We will stand firmly with the farmers,” said Congress minister Yashomati Thakur.Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said this is a state sponsored bandh imposed and implemented with the help of administration. “The traders and businessmen and their unions are being threatened to participate in it. The ruling parties are misusing police and GST administrations to impose bandh,” Fadnavis told reporters.He said the state government should first give relief to the farmers who have suffered losses in the recent downpour in Marathwada and Vidarbha. “The MVA government is imposter and humbug. The Congress-led government had killed farmers protesting on water shortage in Maval in Pune a few years ago. Congress-led Rajasthan government heavily lathicharged against protesting farmers two days ago. This government is anti-farmers and the farmers have realised it,” Fadnavis alleged.In response, Patole said that Fadnavis has shown his double face when it comes to farmers’ issues. “I had advised him to speak to the BJP-led central government against the step-motherly given treatment to Maharashtra instead of visiting flood affected areas. The state government has sought a relief package of Rs15,000 crore, but the Centre has agreed to provide nominal financial assistance. He should have taken up the issue with the Centre, but his hypocrisy is clear with what he is saying,” Patole remarked.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that the ruling parties in the state are trying to reap political mileage by giving the bandh call for what happened in Uttar Pradesh. “We condemn the bandh as it has posed a hardship to the general public. Instead of observing a bandh, the state government should first give relief to the farmers affected due to the floods in Marathwada and Vidarbha recently. The state government has done nothing except making tall assurances,” Patil said.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), too, opposed the bandh. MNS leader Ameya Khopkar said, “Instead of troubling citizens, the state government should have contributed one day’s salary to these farmers or worked overtime. People are already bruised by the consecutive lockdowns and this is like rubbing salts on their wounds,” he said.Senior Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat said that being political outfits, MVA coalition wants to save the democracy of the country by holding the bandh. “For them (BJP) whatever happened in Lakhimpur Kheri with the farmers is a petty incident. Moreover, attempts are going on to save the culprit (Ashish Mishra) and this needs to be condemned by all… We decided to hold a bandh to save democracy, though we are part of the government. The politics of terror to remain in power is unfortunate. The incident is a loud and clear message for the farmers that if you hold protests against us then you will be crushed,” Thorat said.Later in the evening, Fadnavis charged the MVA coalition with state sponsored terror over forcing the people for a shutdown. “This is a ‘Bandh Sarkar’ having stopped all schemes, all aid to the farmers. During Covid-19 pandemic, when the entire country was open, it kept Maharashtra shut. Today, when small traders, shopkeepers are somehow opened for business, it is using police and various agencies to enforce the bandh and this is a form of state sponsored terrorism,” Fadnavis accused.Responding to the allegations, Raut said what has happened in Lakhimpur Kheri can be called a terror act. “Whatever happened in Lakhimpur Kheri can be called as an act of terror and not the bandh called to condemn the massacre,” the Sena leader said.There was heavy police deployment across the state in the wake of the bandh. In Mumbai alone, security has been deployed at strategic points with three companies of state reserve police force (SRPF), 500 home guards, and 700 men from local arms units, according to the Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-100-success-says-mva-101633969331385.html
11-10-2021||Ranchi||Cong silent protest:BJP has different law for ‘the high and mighty’, say Jharkhand leaders||As part of its nationwide exercise, the Congress leaders and workers of the party’s Jharkhand unit organised a five-hour long silent protest outside Raj Bhawan in Ranchi, demanding resignation of Union minister Ajay Mishra after his son was arrested for his alleged role in the recent Lakhimpur-Kheri violence.The protest was led by Jharkhand Congress chief Rajesh Thakur, with Congress ministers Rameshwar Oraon, Alamgir Alam, Badal Patralekh and Banna Gupta in attendance, besides other party legislators, office bearers and party workers.Addressing the media at the protest, Thakur said in the BJP, the rule is that law is applicable only on commoners, while they have “different standards for the high and mighty.”“We are seeing what is happening from Gorakhpur to Lakhimpur. It seems that the BJP implements the law only when it deals with commoners. However, they need to understand that the rule of law is established when examples are set by action against the powerful, who have committed a crime. By not acting against the erring powerful, the BJP has demeaned the democracy itself,” said Thakur.On the other hand, state agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said MoS Ajay Mishra has lost moral standing to continue in his post. “In our government, many a times ministers have resigned if any untoward incident happened even if they were not responsible for it, but just out of political morality and ethics. We are expecting the same from the minister,” he said.Eight people, including four farmers and a local journalist, died during the violence in UP’s Lakhimpur-Kheri after an SUV belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra and a convoy of cars mowed down a group of protesting farmers from behind on October 3.Earlier this week, the state Congress had set off for Lakhimpur to show their support for the agitating farmers, besides protesting against the house arrest of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. However, they were not allowed to enter Uttar Pradesh at the Wyndhamganj-Garhwa border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/cong-silent-protest-bjp-has-different-law-for-the-high-and-mighty-say-jharkhand-leaders-101633969031458.html
11-10-2021||Patna||Twelve cops among 32 injured in mob attack, lathicharge at Muz village||At least 12 policemen, including two sub-inspectors, were injured and a police vehicle damaged when an irate mob allegedly attacked them with stones, weapons and sticks following an alleged liquor raid at Muzaffarpur’s Jhitkahiatola village on Sunday midnight, said officials of Sakra police station on Monday. This is the second such incident in the state within 48 hours.The police team, in defence, opened fire in air and used baton to control the crowd, according to eyewitnesses. Over 20 people were said to be injured in the lathicharge.All the injured persons--both policemen and locals--were currently undergoing treatment at nearby hospitals. The police have arrested seven persons, who were part of the mob, while a case has been registered against over a dozen people in this connection, said Muzaffarpur senior superintendent of the police (SSP) Jayant Kant.According to the police, the incident took place when the Sakra police team raided a village house following a complaint that a liquor party was being held there allegedly to celebrate victory in the panchayat election. “As the policemen were searching for the house of one Baliram, who won the panchayat election as a ward member, police could not find anything. However, his family members and other village residents gheraoed and made hostage the police team, forcing them to reveal the identity of the person who gave the false input to the police,” said one of the injured sub-inspectors Ashish Kumar. He added that when additional forces reached the spot to rescue them, the villagers pelted stones on the police team and beat them with bamboo sticks and sharp-edged weapons. As per station house officer of Sakra police station Saroj Kumar, the raid was conducted on the alleged liquor party after a complaint to the excise department. “A case has been registered against dozens of people from Jhitkahiatola village of Raghunathpur-Donwa panchayat. This is a very serious issue. None of those involved in the planned attack on the police party will be spared. Seven persons have been arrested so far, but there will be large scale arrests of those involved in the incident,” said the Muzaffarpur SSP. Earlier on Saturday, a sand mafia attacked the police and a mining team, and damaged their vehicles after a raid at at Bhagalpur’s Kamalpur village falling under Sajaur police station area.As per the state police data, as many as 24 such incidents have been reported from across Bihar in the month of August alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/twelve-cops-among-32-injured-in-mob-attack-lathicharge-at-muz-village-101633969030359.html

The decision was taken by the state Cabinet on Monday in view of the assessment of damages to agriculture due to the natural calamity. The Cabinet approved farm compensation worth ₹550 crore to be paid to the affected farmers as agriculture input subsidy. This was among a dozen odd proposals, which were discussed and approved by the Cabinet at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar. Briefing mediapersons after the meeting, additional chief secretary (ACS), Cabinet, Sanjay Kumar said that the agriculture input subsidy would be paid to farmers on the basis of assessment made by the district authorities concerned for crop damages. “Besides, those who could not do farming on their land owing to excessive rains would also get farm subsidy. The Cabinet has approved a sum of ₹100 crore for the purpose,” said the ACS. The Cabinet also gave its nod for payment of ₹50,000 to the nearest kin of those who died due to Covid-19 pandemic. The disaster management department (DMD) has been allocated ₹50 crore to be paid as ex-gratia to around 10,000 such persons. “This will be in addition to the ₹4 lakh to be paid or already paid to the family of each deceased by the state government. The additional amount is being paid as an obligation of the Central government in conformity to its affidavit made in the Supreme Court,” said an official aware of the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cabinet-okays-input-subsidy-for-crop-damage-due-to-floods-rains-101633969028087.html
11-10-2021||Patna||DoT gives radiation clean chit to mobile towers in Bihar||The department of telecommunications (DoT) has given a clean chit from radiation point of view to over 1 lakh mobile towers in Bihar. Of the 34% (34,082) mobile towers the DoT had inspected, all conformed to the government’s radiation norms, said Girijesh Kumar Mishra, senior deputy director general (DDG), department of telecom, Bihar Licensed Service Area (LSA), on Monday. The DoT prescribed maximum limit of power density is 1 Watt per meter square. Sharing these figures, Mishra said there were certain misconceptions related to the radiation of mobile towers among the public, who were reluctant to allow installation. “Some people believe that tower radiation harms health. However, this radiation is non-ionizing. Based on scientific facts, it has been found that it does not have any adverse effect on human health,” said Mishra. Non-ionizing radiations are those having low to medium frequency (3 kiloHertz to 300 Gega Hz), like sunlight, radio and microwave signals. On the contrary, ionizing radiations are those like X-ray, gamma rays, having high electromagnetic spectrum frequency in the range of 300 Pico Hz to 30 Exa Hz, said BM Patel, director (compliance), DoT, Bihar LSA. Mishra said the government of India had endorsed tower radiation level ten times more stringent as compared to the international standards prescribed by the WHO and the International Commission for Non-ionizing Radiation & Protection (ICNIRP). The senior DDG regretted that that the myth about radiation from mobile towers posing health hazards had affected the execution timeline of many projects in the state. “The success of many ambitious projects, such as Digital India, Smart Cities, National Broadband Mission and others, depend on the availability of mobile towers. The country is going to expand 5G technology in a big way soon. It is anticipated that the 5G rollout will require a qualitative increase in the number of telecom towers. In such circumstances, it has become extremely imperative to dispel the myths and misconceptions related to towers and their radiation,” added Mishra. Of the over 1 lakh base transceiver station (BTS), which connects tmhe obile device to the network, in Bihar, Reliance Jio accounts for around 49,000, Airtel 32,300, Vodafone and Idea 15,320 and BSNL 4,300, said Patel. Of these, as many as 10,556 BTS are in Patna district alone, while the rest are distributed among the 37 remaining districts of Bihar. The inequitable distribution of mobile towers is not a happy situation in the state, felt telecom officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/dot-gives-radiation-clean-chit-to-mobile-towers-in-bihar-101633968967321.html

The e-rickshaw driver died during treatment in a hospital on Monday morning. “Sub-inspector (S-I) Rameshwar Dayal Sharma and constable Ravinder Kumar of Chhatari police station have been suspended after the villagers accused both of beating e-rickshaw driver, Gaurishankar,40, a resident of Chaundhera village,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bulandshahr, SK Singh. Circle officer of Dibai area, Vandna, however, defended the cops and claimed that both only scolded him while he was trying to enter into a no vehicle zone in Chhatari area where a fair was in progress on the occasion of Navratri. “Cops didn’t beat him and what I came to know that he was a heart patient and might have come into shock after being scolded by cops on duty,” said the circle officer, adding that only postmortem report would reveal the actual cause of the death. However, villagers claimed that Gaurishankar was beaten by the policemen for entering into the no vehicle zone. His condition deteriorated and his family members admitted him to a hospital from where he was referred to another hospital in Aligarh on Sunday night. He died during the treatment on Monday morning. Angry over the death, villagers and family members blocked the road outside the village on Monday morning. Police and administrative officials along with public representatives reached the spot and persuaded the angry mob to open the road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-cops-accused-of-beating-up-e-rickshaw-driver-to-death-in-bulandshahr-suspended-101633968547598.html
11-10-2021||Patna||Cong leader seeks SC-monitored inquiry in Amazon’s kickback allegations||Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahai on Monday sought an inquiry by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court into an alleged payoff worth ₹8,500 crore to the officials and representatives of the Central government by e-retail giant Amazon for relaxing the norms of e-businesses. Subodh alleged that local traders were running out of business owing to the enormous freedom given to the multinational companies. Talking to media persons at the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) office, Sahai claimed that Amazon had made a statement in its latest annual financial report that it has spent the amount ( ₹8,500 crore) in the legal process in India during the years 2017-20. “The e-retail giants like Amazon and Walmart’s owned Flipkart managed to have a seamless business in India despite legal restraints,” alleged the Congress leader. Justifying his demand for an inquiry by a sitting Judge of the apex court, Sahai said that he was asking for it in the light of the Chief Justice of India’s observations in the case of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. “The CJI was sceptical of a fair inquiry by the CBI into the case. Moreover, repeated pleas of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) to Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal for the CBI inquiry into the alleged kickback failed to elicit any action,” said the Congress leader. The former Union minister claimed that nearly 14 crore people engaged with micro, medium and enterprises, traders and agricultural marketing were left to fend for themselves owing to the unrestrained business regime offered to the multinational e-commerce companies. To a query regarding the present state of the Congress in Bihar and Jharkhand, Sahai said that the 135-year old party would be able to revive its glorious past after the end of the transitional phase, dominated by the politics of polarisation and rhetoric. “Congress always fought for the issues of mass interest and the national pride. People will ultimately realise that they are being taken for a ride by sentimental issues tinged with communal agenda and lofty dreams of Great Bharat,” added the Congress leader. Sahai has reached Patna to participate in the party’s campaign for by-elections at Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies going to the polls on October 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cong-leader-seeks-sc-monitored-inquiry-in-amazon-s-kickback-allegations-101633968306788.html

11-10-2021||Patna||Power issue is there but Bihar ready to meet crisis: Nitish||Amidst the ongoing power crisis, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has assured the people that the effect of the crisis arising in the country will not be seen on Bihar as it has taken ample steps to deal with the situation.“It’s true there is a problem. As per our requirement, either we get power from NTPC or private companies. But the supply is affected now. There are some reasons due to which such a situation has arisen. It’s not only in Bihar, it’s everywhere,” said Kumar on coal shortage after the Janata Darbar on Monday.Accepting that the state was unable to get the amount of electricity required, the chief minister said that for the reduction in power generation, the state government has decided to buy power from other states at expensive prices. “We will not allow power crisis in Bihar under any circumstances. In the last five days, the government has purchased 570 lakh units of electricity by spending about ₹90 crores. Department officials are engaged,” he said. “This will ensure availability of peak hour demand of 5500-5600 MW in the state,” he said.According to Bihar State Electricity Board sources, the Coal stocks have reached a critical level, barely enough to last four days. “There is up to 1000-1500 MW shortage of power. The shortage has led to 4-8 hours of a power outage, especially in rural areas of Bihar,” said a BSEB official.The state, however, is buying power at ₹14- ₹16 per unit (against an average cost of ₹3-5 per unit earlier). “The situation is returning to normal. We will soon be able to ensure availability of power commensurate to its demand,” said Bihar’s energy secretary Sanjeev Hans through a tweet on the handle of the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited.Kumar said that the state had started the Kanti and Barauni powerhouses. “Later on, they were handed over to NTPC. We have also built many new powerhouses. The Barauni Power Unit would be commissioned next month. Electricity rates have become very expensive, but the government is committed to supplying,” he said. CASTE CENSUSCM Kumar said that a decision would be made regarding the caste census after the assembly by-election. “It is very important to conduct caste census. A decision will be taken on this by forming an opinion unanimously with all the parties,” he said.“We are constantly thinking about how the caste census will be done. A final decision has not been taken yet. Right now, because of the by-election, everyone is busy with their respective work. An all-party meeting will be called after the by-election. Every detail will be taken care of in a meticulous manner. Caste, sub-caste, all these things are there, but they have to be studied deeply. The final decision will be taken after the by-polls,” the CM added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/power-issue-is-there-but-bihar-ready-to-meet-crisis-nitish-101633968066937.html
11-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur violence: Priyanka leads silent protest demanding removal of minister||LUCKNOW Congress leaders led by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday observed ‘maun vrat’ (silent protest) at the Gandhi statue near Lucknow’s Grand Post Office (GPO) and other places across UP, demanding dismissal of Ajay Mishra from the post of Union minister of state for home affairs, over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.The protest, as part of the nationwide agitation of the Congress, was held on the day when the police secured three-day custody of the minister’s son Ashish Mishra for interrogation. He was arrested on Saturday by the UP Police in connection with the October 3 violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed. Late on Saturday night, he was produced before a court, which sent him to 14-day judicial custody. On Monday, the police got his three-day custody.Congressmen sat on a ‘maun vrat’ in front of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Lucknow’s Hazratganj area, demanding the dismissal of the Union minister, a party spokesperson said. Party workers and leaders, including state president Ajay Kumar Lallu, CLP leader Aradhana Mishra, leader in the legislative council Dipak Singh among others converged at the GPO Park here and were were later joined by Priyanka Gandhi, the spokesperson said.None of the protestors spoke anything, they just sat there and waved placards with messages – “We will fight, we will win” and “Dismiss MoS.”The Congress and all other opposition parties have been demanding dismissal or resignation of the minister for ensuring a free and fair investigation into the Lakhimpur violence case. On Sunday, addressing a rally in Varanasi, Priyanka Gandhi had said, “Congress workers do not fear anyone, even if you put them in jails or beat them up. We will continue to fight till the Union minister resigns. Our party has fought for the country’s Independence. No one can silence us.” UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh, however, took a jibe at the Congress saying law will take its course and will not be influenced by any kind of pressure. He said: “As far as the maun vrat is concerned, it is the party whose prime minister was on maun vrat for 10 years.” Singh said if Congress leaders want to sit on a maun vrat or hold protests, it is their democratic right.He also said why protests were not held in the Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh where atrocities were allegedly being committed against Dalits and farmers. “We will send them (Cong leaders) Google maps for the routes to Rajasthan and Chhattigarh. Why are they not going to Chhattisgarh where farmers were killed or Rajasthan where a Dalit was mob lynched,” asked Singh.Sidharth Nath Singh also tweeted the Google Maps routes of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh from Lucknow and tagged Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-priyanka-leads-silent-protest-demanding-removal-of-minister-101633968006913.html

11-10-2021||Mumbai||Environmentalists oppose road widening in Aarey||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) earlier this month released a tender to widen the Aarey main road, officially known as Dinkar Rao Desai Marg, to four lanes, with a width of nine metres, up from the existing seven-metre wide, two-lane arrangement. The development, which marks the second time this year that BMC has issued a tender for revamping the Aarey main road, has sparked the ire of environmentalists, who maintain that such infrastructure expansion can be ecologically detrimental to the area.For example, the Aarey main road (which connects the western express highway) to the P/South, K/East and S Wards in suburban Mumbai, falls under the centrally notified eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), which states “vehicular movement of traffic shall be regulated in a habitat friendly manner” within the ESZ. Moreover, the ESZ notification also regulates the widening and strengthening of existing roads, bridges, infrastructure and construction of new roads, with the view that such activities may be taken up when without causing any adverse impacts to the environment, which environmentalists say will be an inevitable outcome of any road widening in Aarey.“It appears that, by widening the existing road, BMC intends to permit more vehicles to use this road which is in contravention of the provisions of the ESZ Notification, which directs that traffic must be regulated (controlled) in such ESZ areas. BMC cannot be permitted to allow the existing road, thru the ESZ & Forested areas of Aarey, to be used as some sort of traffic short-cut,” wrote Zoru Bhatena, an environmentalists and pro-Aarey campaigner, in a letter to authorities on Sunday.Bhatena also pointed out that the road’s alignment cuts through areas of Aarey which have been notified as reserve forest under the Indian Forest Act (1927) by the state government, and that forest department clearance is mandatory before the project can proceed any further. Hindustan Times was unable to locate any proposal on the state forest department portal relating to the BMC’s tender.A nearly identical tender to “improve” the main Aarey road had been floated in August, but was later scrapped by BMC, following a controversy over contractors quoting up to 40% less than estimated cost of ₹1,200 crore for road repairs and maintenance contracts across the city. The bids were reinvited for Aarey on October 4.Sanjiv Valsan, a pro-Aarey campaigner, said, “Widening roads will increase the already heavy vehicular traffic movement in the area, in addition to threatening green cover. If th eBMC’s goal is to sustainably make traffic movement in the area more efficient, they need to impose a toll on heavy private vehicles which enter the forest, which will reduce traffic jams and therefore eliminate the need to widen the road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/environmentalists-oppose-road-widening-in-aarey-101633966573837.html

They argued the police had already questioned Ashish Mishra for 12 hours and no further questioning was required.They also argued that no further recoveries were to be made from the accused.The court allowed the police custody remand application for three days.Ashish Mishra was arrested on Saturday (October 9) after being questioned for over 12 hours in Lakhimpur Kheri.After the arrest, a court had sent Ashish Mishra to 14-day judicial custody.The arrest came five days after he was booked in a murder case lodged at the Tikunia police station.Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four protesting farmers on October 3.While farmer leaders and opposition parties had been demanding Ashish Mishra’s arrest, the minister and his son had denied the allegations.Two BJP workers and their driver were allegedly lynched by angry farmers in the violence. Local journalist Raman Kashyap also died.The Supreme Court had taken cognizance of the incident and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take action against “whoever is involved.” According to the police officials , Ashish Mishra was not able to explain several points about his whereabouts during the incident on October 3.The police had issued their first notice to the minister’s son on October 7 asking him to appear before them on October 8, but he had missed the deadline. After a second notice was issued, Ashish Mishra appeared before the police for questioning on October 9.After his arrest, the police had moved an application before the court for 14 days’ police custody remand.However, the court had postponed the hearing on the application till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-kheri-case-police-get-three-day-custody-of-union-minister-s-son-101633965367477.html

11-10-2021||Mumbai||Village gossip led to quick arrests of accused in Pushpak Express train dacoity and sexual assault case||A village gossip played a significant role in facilitating the arrest of the eight accused in the Pushpak Express dacoity and sexual assault case within 48 hours of the case being registered, investigating officers said on Monday.The accused had allegedly boarded the Lucknow-Mumbai Express train just after it left Igatpuri on the night of October 8, robbed around 15 passengers in one of the sleeper coaches and sexually assaulted a 20-year-old woman in front of her husband. Seven of them managed to flee after the train reached Kasara while one was caught by Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel who responded to the passengers’ cries for help.Officers who were part of the investigation said that the first arrested accused, Arshan Sheikh (20), did not give any significant clues during his preliminary questioning. Further, the police did not have the option of interrogating him at length as the priority was to arrest the rest of the accused before they fled.“We made inquiries with the passengers but they had only heard the accused address each other by their nicknames like ‘Kalya’ and ‘Pakya’, which gave us no clues as to their identities. Our teams obtained Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera footage from the spot where they boarded the train, as well as from Kasara, where they alighted and fled. The footage was scanned till we had decently clear images of their faces,” an officer who is part of the investigation said.Armed with these stills, a joint team from the Kalyan GRP and the GRP’s Local Crime Branch (LCB) went to the Ghoti village in Nashik, where Sheikh hails from. With the help of the Nashik Rural Police, under whose jurisdiction the village falls, the police began going door to door in Sheikh’s locality, showing his picture to all the residents.“Like any village, Ghoti has its own gossip about all of its residents. Sheikh and his friends were allegedly infamous as drug addicts and good-for-nothings. Several of the villagers identified his co-accused for us, telling us their addresses as well as confirming the fact that all of them were often seen together,” the officer said. Using this information, the police fanned out in the village and started picking up the accused, with the Nashik Rural Police providing ground level intelligence. Sources said that one of them was hiding in the forest area near Ghoti, from where he was picked up on Sunday afternoon. “The Nashik Rural Police played a huge role in making the arrests possible,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Manoj Patil, Central Railway, said. The joint team of Kalyan GRP and LCB personnel was working under Patil’s direct supervision.He added that after thorough inquiries, the investigating team has concluded that there were no more accused involved in the case other than the eight already arrested.“We are now working on building a watertight case by recording statements from eye witnesses as well as gathering corroborative evidence,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/village-gossip-led-to-quick-arrests-of-accused-in-pushpak-express-train-dacoity-and-sexual-assault-case-101633965126731.html

People are coming and paying their respects,” said Manoj Bhadra, president of Bondhu Mahal Durga Puja committee.Sushanto Ghosh, secretary, Bondhu Mahal, said, “We will also honour Covid warriors, the neglected Asha bahus, who fought a relentless battle in villages.”Also, they will honour primary teachers, who imparted education to students in villages and dealt with the challenges of online classes. This event will be held on October 13, Ghosh said. Bondhu Mahal Durga Puja committee is organising the Durga Puja for the ninth year.“The pandemic has put a financial strain on the committee, as we can’t collect donations effectively. The businessmen and shopkeepers who were generously donating are unable to contribute as their businesses are not flourishing. We have spent our other deposits to arrange this year’s puja,” Bhadra said.Festival of equality at Kali BadiThe management of the 158-year-old Kali Badi temple at Ghasiyari Mandi in Lucknow feels the financial strain caused by the pandemic is gradually easing. The temple management is following the Covid-19 protocols.“We are adhering to the Covid-19 protocols. This is a festival of equality so everyone is on the same platform worshipping Maa Durga. Naturally, there are limitations posed due to Covid-19 and not many people can converge at one place,” said Abhijit Sarkar, president of Kali Badi Trust.Replica of Delhi’s Ramakrishna MathA massive Durga Puja pandal, which is a replica of New Delhi’s Ramakrishna Math, has been set up at Sector F, Jankipuram. “The entire structure has been created by a team from Medinipur district of West Bengal in a span of 20 days,” said Saurav Bandyopadhyay, chairperson of the puja committee at Jankipuram. However, there will be no bhog distribution for the public as per the government protocols, he said.“The entire structure has been created by a team from Medinipur district of West Bengal in a span of 20 days,” said Saurav Bandyopadhyay, Sahara Estate, Jankipuram. However, there will be no bhog distribution among the masses as per the government protocols, he said.Invoking the divine to defeat corona“We are maintaining Covid protocols at our Durga Puja pandal. We are sanitising consistently,” said Nihar Ranjan Dey of the Cantonment Puja and Sewa Samity which has been organising Durga Puja since 1952. They have come up with a tagline to promote Covid-19 precautions: “Mahishasur mardini bani karona sur mardini” (The Goddess has become the slayer of the coronavirus disease).Sanskritiki Sammilani shifts venueSanskritiki Sammilani, which has conducted Durga Puja rituals, at Shivaji Park, Indira Nagar, Lucknow, for the last 26 years, will do the worship at Kali Mandir, Manas Vihar, this time. “We are taking all necessary precautions and following the norms and regulations as per the government,” said Joy Chatterjee, secretary of the Sanskritiki Sammilani.Private celebrations at RDSOThe Durga Puja Samiti, RDSO, has kept Durga Puja celebrations private this year. They’ll be organising the puja for the 53rd year. “We’ll be arranging a low-budget puja only for members due to Covid-19 pandemic. Hopefully, next year we’ll be organising an event available to all the devotees,” said Tirtho Sengupta of RDSO Puja Samiti,.“The members of our committee are based both in India and foreign nations. They always help us in financing the puja and the administration is also cooperative,” added Sengupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/durga-puja-in-lucknow-honouring-covid-warriors-invoking-divinity-101633964526560.html

11-10-2021||Pune||Country which forgets history cannot create history, says archaeologist GB Deglurkar||Noted archaeologist GB Deglurkar, Phd, insisted on the importance of knowing factually correct history, saying that the country which forgets history cannot create history. Deglurkar was speaking at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (Bori) in Pune on Monday, about an illustrated history book for children which explores the heritage, history, geography and several other aspects of Pune. Deglurkar also shared anecdotes from his research and lesser known archaeological findings, such as finding the remains of a hippopotamus during an excavation at Inamgaon village in Pune district; and ashes from a lava explosion in Sumatra which found on the banks of a river in Pune. “Every expert cannot know everything. In this book we have tried to compile a fact-based history through interesting illustrations. Those who do not know history cannot create it. It should reach people with the correct form and facts. People only know what they have been taught through the system and then they pass it on to the next generation,” said Deglurkar. He is one of the researchers of the book, called “Punyaktha - Pune’s story of a million years”, published by Heritage India. Prof P K Ghanekar, Ajit Vaman Apte, and Manjiri Bhalerao have also contributed to the book, and Kalyani Sardesai has written in the book in the form of a story that will appeal to children. “This book has been written in English on purpose because it should also reach Indians who are living abroad. Those children should also get to know about the correct history of India and of Pune. Children who are studying in Pune, don’t know about the surroundings beyond the curriculum. So a period from ancient to modern has been covered in this book,” said Deglurkar. Through nine chapters and 240 pages full of facts, rarely seen photographs, maps, quizzes, puzzles and activity sheets, the book explains how Pune evolved from primitive man and the Stone Age to a a small basti to a jagir to an important bastion of power on a national and international level. Manjiri Khandekar, CEO, Heritage India said, “In today’s volatile world there is an immense need to connect people to their roots, to impart a sense of stability, belonging, identity and pride. Our book is an endeavour to inculcate this. It is a book of hope, of a city and region that has not only endured, but grown by leaps and bounds and enriched thousands through its long course of existence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/country-which-forgets-history-cannot-create-history-says-archaeologist-gb-deglurkar-101633962306416.html

The 50-year old MP appeared before a Judicial Magistrate Court in Panruti, about 25 kilometres from Cuddalore, and he was remanded to judicial custody till Wednesday. Later, he was lodged in a sub-jail in the district. A police officer told PTI that following the outcome of Covid-19 test, which is expected by tomorrow, he would be lodged in the Cuddalore Central Prison. Ramesh would be produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate court in Panruti on Wednesday, he added. The Lok Sabha MP from Cuddalore has been named in an FIR in the alleged murder of Govindarasu, an employee in his cashew unit off Panruti in Cuddalore district. Already, five men including Ramesh's assistant have been arrested in connection with the worker's alleged murder last month. Police had claimed that they were on the lookout for him while he surrendered today.Ramesh has been booked under various sections of the IPC including murder, wrongful restraint and conspiracy and for causing disappearance of evidence and CB-CID is probing the case. Govindarasu, a PMK office-bearer, had been working in the cashew unit owned by Ramesh in Cuddalore district for the past about seven years. The cashew nut unit management had claimed that "Govindarasu died by suicide" and initially police probed it as a "death under suspicious circumstances". Later, the case was taken up by the CB-CID and the issue also went to the Madras High Court.PMK founder leader Ramadoss had alleged that if not arrested, Ramesh would tamper with evidence and urged the CB-CID to immediately arrest him. Ahead of his surrender, Ramesh said he would legally prove that the accusation levelled against him was baseless. He said he was anguished about a false propaganda against his party by "some political parties due to political vendetta," which was based on an FIR against him. The MP, in a statement, said he was surrendering before the court so as to not give room to those who wanted to hurl accusations at his party-led regime, steered by DMK president and chief minister MK Stalin, who is providing good governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmk-mp-trvs-ramesh-surrenders-before-tamil-nadu-court-in-murder-case-101633958649424.html
11-10-2021||Pune||Mixed response to bandh in Pune; traders rue closure for one day||The Maharashtra bandh called by the three ruling parties in the state – Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP - to protest the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, evoked a mixed response in Pune on Monday.Wholesale vegetable and fruit markets and commercial establishments in central parts of the city remained shut till the afternoon. Commuters, however, had to face some hardship as the public transport service, PMPML, decided not to run most buses during the morning hours to prevent any untoward incident.While all essential services operated smoothly, some shops on Laxmi road, Tulsibaug and Jungli Maharaj road chose not to operate in the morning hours. The three parties, which are part of ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government took out mini rallies and demonstrations at various places, even as no untoward incident was reported in the city, much to the relief of police. At Gultekdi’s Market Yard (wholesale vegetable market), the traders’ association along with labourers and transporters decided to participate in the bandh. Police were on bandobast since the morning at the main gate of Market Yard “Maharashtra bandh appeal and its impact has been good as all of Market Yard and all its stakeholders have supported the bandh,” said Santosh Nangare, secretary, Market Yard Kamgar Sanghatana. Citizens purchased vegetables, fruits and flowers for the ongoing Navratri festival from hawkers on the Market Yard road, who were allowed to operate without any hindrance. “I come every day to Market Yard to purchase vegetables and flowers for Navratri pooja, but as the market was closed we had to purchase it from outside, and that too with a higher price,” said Meghna Bhandari, a resident of the area. A few of the shops on Bajirao road and Laxmi road were open, but the Tulshibaug market remained completed closed. Speaking anonymously, one of the shop owners who was open said, “I pay rent of ₹1.5 lakh per month. Currently our festival season is going on and keeping the shop closed for one day is not affordable. We have already suffered huge loses due to lockdown. Calling for a bandh is easy for political parties, but its impact on common people and traders like is big,” Nitesh Chopada, secretary, Laxmi Road Ganpati Chowk Traders association said, “The shop owners and traders kept their shops closed, mostly because they didn’t want any violence or to have losses. Certainly the financial impact of one day during the main Navratri season is heavy and this is the time when we are able to cover up our losses of the last one year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mixed-response-to-bandh-in-pune-traders-rue-closure-for-one-day-101633961346316.html

The total cost of the plan is estimated at ₹23 crore, i.e. rent for 38 EVs for eight years, including maintenance and a diver for each vehicle. Civic activists have also demanded that EVs be purchased instead of taken on hire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-asks-state-to-allow-increased-spending-for-purchase-of-evs-101633960512440.html
11-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh: Ahead of BMC polls, Shiv Sena shows dominance over Mumbai||The Shiv Sena on Monday displayed its dominance and control over Mumbai by enforcing a near-complete bandh (strike) to protest the killings of the farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. The response to Monday’s bandh showed that the party’s organisation’s strength is still intact and the party can bring Mumbai to a halt. This show of strength is particularly important for the party going into the crucial Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).However, the BJP said that the bandh was forced on shop and establishment owners. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis denied that the people have supported the bandh and alleged that administration, police and government machinery were used to enforce a bandh.The party’s history with ‘bandhs’ dates back several decades when Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray used to bring Mumbai to a grinding halt with a single call. When Bal Thackeray called for a bandh, the city came to a standstill, partly due to fear as well, as the party was prone to violence. The concept of Mumbai bandh was borrowed by Bal Thackeray from his contemporary, the late George Fernandes, but the former used it effectively to show his dominance over Mumbai.For the first time in nearly two decades (18 years), the Sena called or backed a bandh. Sena leaders said the party ceased to call a bandh after 2003 after the party was fined Rs20 lakh by the apex court for calling a bandh against the state government. The Thackerays did not back the bandh called by BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, in Mumbai.In July 2006, when unidentified miscreants allegedly desecrated the statue of Meenatai Thackeray, the late wife of the Sena supremo, irate Shiv Sainiks blocked roads in Mumbai, Nashik and Thane, but officially the party said that there was no bandh. On November 17, 2012, when Thackeray senior passed away, the bandh in Mumbai was “spontaneous as a mark of respect” and the party officially denied calling a bandh on the next day.On Monday, key leaders from the Sena focused on areas such as Dadar, Shivaji Park, Worli, Lal Baug, Parel, Chembur, to stage protests, rasta roko, etc. These areas are largely Marathi dominated localities in central Mumbai, which constitutes a major chunk of the party’s vote bank. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar staged protests at Worli — Sena scion Aaditya Thackeray’s constituency — along with key leaders party’s vibhag pramukh Ashish Chemburkar, former MLA Sunil Shinde, and Sena deputy leader Sachin Ahir. Sena legislator from Dadar-Mahim, Sada Sarvankar held protests in the vicinity of Shiv Sena Bhavan in Dadar — the heart of Mumbai. Party workers took to the streets in the suburbs as well to stop vehicles on arterial roads, shut shops, etc.Sena MP Arvind Sawant, who also heads the Sena’s labour wing, Bharatiya Kamgar Sena, said that the people supported the bandh. “It was a successful bandh as people supported it wholeheartedly. The appeal of the parties [to support farmers] was followed peacefully. We never forced anybody, one or two stray incidents are fine; they are bound to happen, but we never enforced it. The support from the people showed the anguish of the people over the Lakhimpur incident,” he said.Fadnavis, however, dismissed the claim that the bandh had the people’s backing. “The Lakhimpur incident is serious and the state govt (UP) is looking into it. However, today’s bandh is not to show solidarity over the incident, but to get a political benefit. People are not supporting the bandh, but with the help of administration — police, sales tax, GST — people are being forced to do bandh,” Fadnavis said in a press conference.In the last few months, the cadre of the Shiv Sena, which was brought up on the sustained diet of ‘rada’ politics, has been mobilised on the ground due to three instances. Political observers said that this has reignited the strength of the Sainiks on the ground. Sena workers hit the streets in Mumbai in August following union minister Narayan Rane’s ‘slap’ remark against the chief minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Before that BJP and Sena workers clashed outside Sena Bhavan, the party headquarters, including once over BJP legislator Prasad Lad’s comment that ‘if needed they would demolish the Sena Bhavan”.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said that with Bal Thackeray’s demise, the party’s culture had changed to a moderate stance. With the alliance with the NCP and Congress, the connection between the Sena chief and workers had loosened as the leadership was busy helming the state. “Shiv Sena has proven that its organisational mettle and political presence is still intact in Mumbai. In the Rane incident as well Shiv Sainiks had hit the streets. Sainiks, which is the soul of Shiv Sena, are still active and strong. There was a feeling of discomfort in them after the new political alliance (MVA),” Jondhale said.Though Sawant dismissed that the bandh was politically motivated, given the BMC elections next year, he, however, said that it shows the party’s dominance in the city. “We call bandhs to convey the anguish and resentment over issues. We don’t call bandhs to show our strength. The people know the strength of Shiv Sena. Today, there is strong resentment among the people. We never have political motives while doing these things. Balasaheb didn’t care for things like power. During his times, he would call bandhs for causes and justice for people. We have done the same in the past, and we are doing it now... Definitely, it shows our power and dominance because our party workers are strong,” he said. He added that the party was fined in 2003 and subsequently stopped calling for bandh, which he termed as a “Gandhian way to convey our resentment.”Jondhale, former professor of political science at Mumbai University, said that there is a distinction between Bal Thackeray’s bandh which were spontaneous and the one called by the ruling coalition in Maharashtra. “Shiv Sena has positively responded to the initiative taken by NCP [on bandh]. Uddhav Thackeray will gain political benefits from this next year. One must not forget that when BJP got almost as many seats as Shiv Sena in BMC elections in 2017, it was their government and their CM. This time it will be difficult for BJP. Marathi people in Mumbai do not exercise their votes to BJP, the political demarcation is quite clear. For Shiv Sena, its organisation network, presence in the ward has come alive which is important. This will give political dividends soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-ahead-of-bmc-polls-shiv-sena-shows-dominance-over-mumbai-101633960510999.html

In August, Bollywood actor Sonu Sood was announced as the ambassador for the programme. The Delhi government also launched the ‘Deshbhakti curriculum’ in schools on the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh on September 28. “Every deshbhakti period shall start with a five-minute ‘Deshbhakti Dhyaan’, where the teacher and students shall practice mindfulness, reflect on their gratitude for the country, freedom fighters, and any five persons that they consider deshbhakts, and pledge their respect for the country,” the department of education had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-launches-programme-to-provide-career-guidance-to-delhi-govt-school-students-101633959279759.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Will spruce up Amritsar’s walled city if SAD-BSP voted to power in 2022: Sukhbir||AMRITSAR Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said once elected to power in 2022, the SAD-BSP alliance will develop the entire walled city of Amritsar on the lines of Heritage Walk to give a fillip to business and tourism activities. “Promoting tourism in Sri Amritsar Sahib will be our priority. We will not only focus on beautifying the walled city to make it a bigger attraction but will also revive all projects which the Congress government has ignored,” he said while talking to mediapersons here after paying obeisance at the Golden Tenple, Pracheen Shivalya Temple and Gurdwara Atari Sahib (Sultanwind). He also interacted with representatives of medical associations and goldsmiths’ association during his visit to Tahliwala bazaar, besides addressing public gatherings in different areas of Amritsar South and North assembly segments. He was accompanied by senior leaders, including Anil joshi, Gurpartap Tikka and Talbir Gill. Sukhbir said the previous SAD-led government had made Amritsar a tourist hub by developing the Heritage Walk besides creating other tourist spots such as Apna Pind and the Partition Museum. “The holy city had fallen victim to intra-party power games of the Congress, with no major development project taken up in Amritsar in the last nearly five years,” he said. Responding to a media query regarding Navjot Sidhu announcing to sit on a silent protest, the SAD president asked Sidhu to first clear his current status in the party. Terming him a “drama master”, Badal said he would like to appeal to Sidhu to continue this silent protest for four months, if he really wished to do something good for the state. “It shouldn’t be like his previous one at Lakhimpur Kheri where he went on hunger strike post-dinner and broke it before the breakfast,” he said. ‘Coal crisis result of state govt’s failure’ He held the Congress government responsible for the ongoing coal crisis leading to power outages. “Neither the chief minister nor the power minister thought it fit to take up the issue with the central government. Even the private thermal plants were not held to account to keep coal stock at least for 30 days at all times,” Sukhbir said. “Punjabis will also pay a heavy financial price because the state is now purchasing power at ₹11.60 per unit. Those opposing the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) done by the previous SAD government should now explain to the people the reasons behind their own failures. All sectors, including industry, are facing more than six-hour power cut, paralysing the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-spruce-up-amritsar-s-walled-city-if-sad-bsp-voted-to-power-in-2022-sukhbir-101633958706584.html

The cat, Mishti, barely 18 months old, was unable to jump back on the terrace after falling off the gap between window grills on the parapet, officials said. Kulkarni who resides on the fifth floor of Iris Tower near Horizon Prime in Kasarvadavli, called the fire brigade officials after Mishti accidentally climbed the parapet. Fire brigade officials immediately informed the Regional Disaster Management team while two of the officials went to check the situation and whether they would need more manpower. Mishti couldn’t move from the place and started meowing loudly. The family members tried to reach out to her in vain. Disaster Management Cell head, Santosh Kadam said, “ Our team first tried to rescue it with the help of ropes but it didn’t work out. Then we decided to show her some food so that she could at least try to come a little closer. This trick worked out and we were able to rescue her within 20 minutes after reaching the spot. Mishti is safe and has no injury marks on her body.” Kulkarni acts in a Marathi television serial Aai Kuthe Kay Karte and also worked in few Marathi films.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/18monthold-cat-of-tv-actor-rescued-by-authorities-in-thane-101633958646249.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Schooled in the lap of nature, full of sincerity, enthusiasm||“Those who have not done their homework, stand in a line, please.” This was the opening dialogue in our class daily. More than half the class would queue up with hands outstretched. The teacher would survey the length of the line and decide to delegate the job. The job was to whack each hand once with a rod. It was to honour the boys who had not done their homework. The teacher called to the fore the big boy of the class and personally whacked his hands. Then the rod was handed over to the boy to do the needful for rest of the defaulters. I studied in a school in the hinterland of Punjab in the ’70s. We grew up literally in the lap of nature. Students were introduced to nature right from the day of admission. Every student was supposed to plant a tree along the walls or in the partition of vast grounds, whatever variety, and nurture it till the time he left school. For want of classrooms, a majority of classes were held under trees. Thus, planting a tree was more like planting a classroom for future students. Winters were fun. Classes could be held under the sun, wherever the teacher deemed fit. For summer, big shady trees were earmarked for different classes by default. “Go and leave this chair under the Class 6 tree,” our teacher would direct the peon. Students were there in all shapes, sizes and ages. It was a boys’ school. Age was no criteria for any class. In Class 1, we had boys who should have been in Class 10, going by their age. But no one seemed to mind. Students, teachers and parents were cool, as long as the boy was attending school. No classrooms meant no chairs or benches for students. We were supposed to carry our own rugs to sit on. Big boys never carried anything to school. Most of the times, they helped the teacher in controlling the class. If they needed to sit, they would grab the rug from boys like me. Despite carrying the rug from home, I would be sitting on the ground. That is how the meek inherit the earth, I guess. It was more of physical education than a cerebral one. We spent more time on the school grounds rather than in classrooms under the tree. There was no official gardener, it was simply not possible for a single person to look after the vast grounds and plantation. So, every class was allocated a stretch of ground for its maintenance. We were happy doing that, as it was more fun than learning mathematics or science. We would water the plants, mow the grass, and take out weeds. There were no organised tournaments at that time. But it was normal for a hockey or kabaddi team from another school to come visiting. Sometimes, it was a planned event and sometimes unannounced. It would bring a festival like atmosphere to the school. The visiting team would be accompanied by their own supporters and the ambience would be charged with slogans and cat calls. The school taught me discipline in a practical way. It brought me closer to nature. It made a team player out of me. It taught me techniques of survival. We were not supposed to complain to parents about the whacking we got. Parents believed in teachers and left it to them to make men out of us boys. Though schools lacked in infrastructure and teaching aids but there was sincerity in abundance and enthusiasm all around. I’m happy that my schooling laid a solid foundation for me and helped me progress in life. gsbattu@gmail.com The writer is a Patiala-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/schooled-in-the-lap-of-nature-full-of-sincerity-enthusiasm-101633958166126.html
11-10-2021||Lucknow||Moderate exercise helps ease arthritis pain and stiffness: Docs||LUCKNOW Moderate exercise helps ease arthritis pain and stiffness in the joints contrary to the belief that it reduces quality of life, said doctors at a press conference on Monday, a day before World Arthritis Day (WAD). “Regular exercise can prevent arthritis, but also cut down on medicines significantly among people with the disease. Exercise makes muscles stronger and keeps the body joints healthy, reducing impact of any disease,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, secretary, Arthritis Foundation of Lucknow (AFoL) and director, Healthcity Hospital. Sharing details of the issues faced by arthritis patients during lockdown, AFoL president Dr Sandeep Garg said despite telemedicine and consultancy via video calls people with arthritis faced difficulties as the disease affects day-to-day life. “Many patients, who were prescribed medicines for a few weeks and asked to come after completing the course, could not do so for months. This is an incorrect way of dealing with the disease,” he said. “The number of replacement surgeries, the ultimate treatment option for arthritis patients, has gone up during the pandemic. This is because patients have become aware about improving quality of life post-surgery and they do not want to wait for things to go from bad to worse,” said Dr Kapoor. Pain, difficulty in movement and stiffness in joints are common factors among arthritis patients. Often, patients face loss of grip and hence are unable to pick up things and seek help from other family members. “In case of arthritis, it is significant to consult an expert doctor at the earliest to ensure that the disease progression is restricted and correct treatment is started,” he said. After surgery, patients are able to perform their daily activities comfortably. Arthritis is primarily a disease of joints, but with pain and other discomfort it affects the daily life for an individual, said Garg and Kapoor. Events to mark WAD The AFoL will organise various awareness events to mark World Arthritis Day (WAD) on Tuesday. Cyclothon, vintage car rally, zumba and yoga sessions will be conducted by Healthcity Hospital. Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director of the hospital, said participants will gather at the hospital at 6am and the vintage car rally will be flagged off soon after along with the cyclothon. Both will reach Janeshwar Mishra Park. Dr Sandeep Garg said the yoga and zumba sessions will be conducted under the guidance of expert trainers and with Covid protocols. WAD, a global awareness day observed every October 12, aims to raise awareness about the impact of arthritis on people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/moderate-exercise-helps-ease-arthritis-pain-and-stiffness-docs-101633956666414.html

As per the notification, the jurisdiction to deal with debts recovery cases of Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been transferred to Chandigarh Bench.Addressing media persons MK Bhardwaj, president of the J&K high court bar association, called it a calculated move on the part of the government to cause undue inconvenience to the public and advocates in particular in the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.He said that the government has already transferred the registration work to the revenue officers and the revenue offices are located at far off and scattered places. He said earlier, the registration work was with the judicial officers in court premises but due to the shifting of the registration work, the members of the Bar, and the public at large, are facing inconvenience and difficulties.Bhardwaj further said that at present, no consumer commission and forum is working in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir. He said the government of Jammu and Kashmir still has not constituted and notified the same to date.“There is no information about the pending cases and files. For the convenience of the Advocates and the public, the location of the Central Administrative Tribunal, registration work and other tribunals must be shifted to the court premises under one roof,” he said.Bhardwaj further said that the advocates who are working in the far-flung areas would also face difficulties in contesting their debt recovery cases at Chandigarh and this decision will also affect the public.He said the public is facing inconvenience and harassment due to such policies.Bhardwaj urged the government to revoke the notification within a period of 15 days and also redress the above mentioned genuine grievances, otherwise the J&K High Court Bar Association, Jammu has no other option except to fight against the anti-public decisions taken by the Government of U.T. of Jammu & Kashmir for getting their genuine demands fulfilled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jks-debt-recovery-cases-shifted-to-chandigarh-lawyers-boycott-courts-in-jammu-101633955227377.html

MVA leaders claimed a total bandh in Navi Mumbai. The MVA alliance, constituting Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, called for the bandh to protest the killing of four farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city leaders organized a protest rally. The Shiv Sena, however, stayed away from it.Navi Mumbai Shiv Sena leader Vithal More, said, “We jointly planned the bandh but were not aware of the rally. We do not believe it was necessary as the traders and the business community have cooperated and shut shops in support of the bandh call.”Denying cracks in the MVA, Congress city chief Anil Kaushik said, “Shiv Sena is with the MVA and we are all together to ensure the bandh is a success. Not much should be read in the absence of Shiv Sena in the rally.”Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport buses were off the roads as well, though autorickshaws were plying as usual. The impact was visible in Panvel and Uran region as well with Congress leader Mahendra Gharat and NCP leader Prashant Patil leading the bandh call.Even as differences appeared in the MVA, the leaders decided to hold a joint meeting at Shivaji Chowk in Vashi later in the evening to thank the business community for the support.Meanwhile, APMC traders alleged that they had been forced to shut shop as local MVA leaders made rounds of the market and threatened them. A trader who identified himself as Babubhai, said, “These are all politically motivated bandh calls. We cannot really oppose as we have to do business. Business is down and such bandh calls hurt our business even more.”The opposition condemned the bandh call. Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Navi Mumbai chief Ramchandra Gharat, said, “This bandh call is only to divert the raid on Sharad Pawar’s family by the government agencies. We condemn this bandh which is causing problems for the common man.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-brings-navi-mumbai-to-a-halt-sena-skips-cong-ncp-rally-101633952945967.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal byelections: BJP warns rebels, fall in line else face action||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday warned rebels in the fray for the byelections to the Mandi Lok Sabha parliamentary seat and three assembly constituencies of Arki, Jubbal-Kotkhai and Fatehpur to fall in line else face action. October 13 is the last date for the withdrawal of nomination papers for the byelections on October 30. Also read: Eye on elections, Punjab CM renames scheme as Mera Ghar Mere NaamState urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, who is also the minister in-charge of the byelections, said: “The party has taken the principled stand not to allot the ticket to the kith and kin of deceased leaders. Party national president (JP Nadda) has made this clear. The party has also decided to field women leaders who have been in electoral politics for many years.” Bhardwaj said he was hopeful that the BJP unit would work unitedly to ensure the victory of Neelam Seraik, the party’s candidate in Jubbal-Kotkhai. Ever since Chetan Bragta filed his nomination as an independent candidate, local leaders are divided over the party’s decision to allocate the ticket to Seraik. “The party had fielded (Chetan’s father) the late Narendra Bragta ji from Shimla after he lost from Jubbal-Kotkhai. He won the elections from Shimla and was made horticulture minister in the Prem Kumar Dhumal government. When he won again, he was inducted in the cabinet and in 2017, he was made the chief whip of the party with cabinet rank. The party gave him due respect. At times, children and kin of the leader aspire to contest elections,” Bhardwaj said. “This time, the decision has been taken by the BJP’s central leadership,” he said, hoping that Chetan would opt out. It is learnt that state power minister Sukhram Chaudhary and Chopal legislator Balbir Verma are in touch with Chetan, who has so far refused to budge. The party is also hopeful its leaders in Fatehpur will work for the victory of Baldev Thakur. Several office-bearers had quit after the party denied the ticket to former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-byelections-bjp-warns-rebels-fall-in-line-else-face-action-101633951806329.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Eye on elections, Punjab CM renames scheme as Mera Ghar Mere Naam||In a populist step with elections in mind, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday rechristened the state government’s Mission Lal Lakir as Mera Ghar Mere Naam (My house in my name). Channi announced this after approval of the state cabinet. Also read: Indian Army’s JCO, 4 soldiers killed in encounter with terrorists in JammuThe state’s scheme earlier was to give property rights to house dwellers living in the lal dora of 12,700 villages in the state. Lal dora is a village settlement, comprising a cluster of houses where residents live. It is surrounded by a road and outside it is the agriculture land attached with a particular village. Earlier, dwellers inside the lal dora did not have ownership rights, but this scheme is aimed to give them the rights to make properties saleable. This could be used as collateral to raise loans, too. The lal dora has now been extended for house dwellers in municipal limits of cities and towns for generations but people don’t have ownership rights. The scheme is an extension of the Centre’s Swamitav scheme or Survey of villages and mapping with improvised technology in village areas for which a pilot project was started in villages of Gurdaspur district six months ago. According to plans, the scheme will be extended to five more districts. Step to safeguard property of NRIsThe chief minister announced that in order to safeguard properties owned by NRI Punjabis, an entry would be made in revenue records that the owner of the property lives abroad,and it can’t be sold or purchased without his consent. This was also decided in Monday’s meeting. Assures of no power crisis in Punjab Answering a question from the media, Channi said there would be no power crisis in the state as his government has sought supply of coal from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/eye-on-elections-punjab-cm-renames-scheme-as-mera-ghar-mere-naam-101633950125641.html
11-10-2021||Pune||Countdown to PMC polls, part 3: Parvati stuck in 3rd gear, waiting for overdrive||In 2019 when the southern parts of the city were hit by flash floods, unauthorised construction alongside the Ambil odha (stream) was once again centre stage. Two years since, the PMC hasn’t been able to clear the encroachments which threaten a similar flood-like situation in the future. For local residents in Sahakar nagar Parvati, memories of the flood are so stark, every time there’s a heavy spell of rain they fear the worst.This time though, the residents are also upset because of a proposal to develop Taljai tekdi (hill), which many say will take away the “soul” of the ecologically rich hill. The proposal mooted by Congress corporator Aba Bagul, which includes setting up of a stadium, garden and theme parks on the hill that attracts hundreds of citizens every day, has met with strong resistance. This has forced the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to tentatively put the proposal on hold, even as locals say they will fight it till the end. Besides unauthorised constructions, Parvati also has slum areas like Janata Vasahat, Dandekar bridge, Taljai, and Market yard. Despite repeated demands from residents here, no major slum rehabilitation project has been carried out in this area. Slum dwellers have erected two-storey shanties and slums have encroached onto the roads amid apathy from civic authorities. Spread across the Sahakarnagar and Bibwewadi ward offices, Parvati is dominated by the BJP, with four representatives from opposition parties holding positions of note. Among them are Ashwini Kadam and Priya Gadade from the NCP, Aba Bagul, the Congress corporator, and Bala Oswal from the Shiv Sena. Rupesh Shah, 45, working with an accounting firm, said, “Taljai hill is one of the important places, but it’s getting commercialised day by day. There is a need to control vendors as well to keep the hill natural. Footpaths have encroached everywhere.” The region has a mixed population that includes upmarket areas like Salisbury park, Mukund nagar, and Sahakar nagar. Local resident Sachin Kelkar, a 48-year old working at an oil firm said, “Garbage management is very poor, Padmavati, Sahakarnagar, Salisbury park, Bibvewadi all these areas are green and many societies and bungalows having trees. Citizens need to trim the trees, but are facing problems. The garden department does not collect branches lying on the streets. Another problem is pet dogs and strays. Citizens with pets allow the animals to poo near other societies, which is wrong.” Another citizen from Sahakarnagar said, slums in this part have increased over the years, as PMC turned a blind eye. “Many people are staying in slums and own four-wheelers, tempos, auto-rickshaws and two- wheelers. The Padmavati temple area has been completely encroached.” Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Shrinath Bhimale, also former leader of the house in the PMC said, “Many key projects were carried out during five years rule when BJP controlled the PMC. If we speak broadly on big projects, we built the flyover on Nehru road which ends near Market Yard, while also increasing the capacity of the Parvati water treatment plant. For the last several years the work of the underground closed water pipeline from Parvati to the Cantonment water works has been pending. This was completed during our tenure.” The Katraj-Swargate stretch that once boasted India’s first BRTS corridor is now plagued with multiple issues. Geeta Joshi, a 25-year-old resident staying near Treasure Park and working with an IT company said, “I wonder why PMC spent so much on the BRTS corridors when it is not functioning properly. Even the work pertaining to bridges near Aryaneshwar Park are underway for the last many months and roads are closed. PMC should speed up the work.” Besides, BRTS, the Metro corridor between Swargate and Katraj is awaiting the final nod from the state and centre. The PMC recently cleared this stretch at its general body meeting. “The multimodal Metro hub coming up at Swargate will change the face of the area and it will be a landmark. The subway has been built at Swargate to decongest traffic. Recently, all parties unanimously approved the underground metro line between Swargate and Katraj,” said Bhimale. Nitin Kadam, NCP leader and former president of the Parvati assembly constituency said, “During our tenure we changed the face of this area. All the roads in Sahakarngar area are now of cement concrete, We have also started many schools. In the last five years, BJP spent lot of money, but has not been able to kickstart the BRTS on the Katraj to Swargate stretch properly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/countdown-to-pmc-polls-part-3-parvati-stuck-in-3rd-gear-waiting-for-overdrive-101633949646725.html
11-10-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Pune’s airport plans continue to buffer in the wind||Last week, when the Airport Authority of India announced that Pune airport will remain out of operation for civilian flights for 14 days, starting October 16, many were shocked. This was a second shut down within a span of 13 years. The announcement coincided with the inauguration of another airport at Sindhudurg. Operationalisation of the airport at Chipi in Sindhudurg has opened the horizon of additional connectivity of costal Maharashtra with other cities, directly connected with bigger places like Pune. So while the people of Konkan are happy that their region has finally been given air connectivity, flyers in Pune are angry.First, the announcement was made at a very short notice when many had planned to fly as the festive season has begun. The sudden cancellation of trips on a planned day for a reason that should have been announced much earlier was a grumble worth making. Second, for a city not having a dedicated civilian airport is beyond comprehension. The existing airport at Lohegaon is owned by the Indian Air Force (IAF). As stated by IAF, shutting down the airstrip was “inescapable”, as the condition of the runway was rapidly deteriorating and needed re-carpeting. What has disappointed citizens for years is no dedicated civilian airport for the city with a population over five millions and a large presence of industries. The proposed international airport for the city is a saga that may soon be folklore, which one generation can pass on to another. Three years ago, that story looked real when government had finalised not just land in Purandar, but issued a notification for land acquisition. The resistance of farmers led by local MLA Sanjay Jagtap forced the rulers to look for alternate land in the same tehsil. This is now the fourth site the government is exploring for the project, which many now believe, may not be a reality in their lifetime. The joke now is – for the generation which first heard of the proposed international airport in Pune two decades ago, it will always remain ‘proposed’. Initially, it was in the Chakan industrial belt that the government had zeroed-in on land to develop the airport. Opposition of local farmers and entry of politicians, forced the state conduct a feasibility survey at two other sites, including the Khed Special Economic Zone. However, this option also failed to take off, because 74 per cent of this land is under the ownership of the Kalyani Group, which refused to give it up. Fed up of hurdles, the then Devendra Fadnavis government shifted the site to Purandar and obtained clearance from key authorities like Defence, Civil Aviation and Environment. When the project looked to take off, a bunch of farmers protested, putting the proposal in cold storage once again till the current Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) dispensation explored yet another site. Now, doubts are being raised about the future of the project at Purandar as those ruling the state like Ajit Pawar are maintaining that the site has not been confirmed yet, a clear contradiction to his earlier statements made in February 2021, that the newly proposed site for the airport was near the original site and would fall under Purandar tehsil. This isn’t the first or last woe for Pune. There are many more. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-pune-s-airport-plans-continue-to-buffer-in-the-wind-101633949166928.html
11-10-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan may get another tiger reserve in the Kumbhalgarh area of Udaipur division||The four-member committee constituted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has found Kumbhalgarh Sanctuary in Rajasthan as a potential tiger reserve, officials said. After conducting a survey of the area in the last two months, the committee has found sanctuary potential as the fifth tiger reserve but also raised certain concerns. The Committee has prepared the draft report, which will soon be submitted to the NTCA. The report suggests marking a 2053 sq km area for tiger reserve. The reserve will be spread across four districts – Udaipur, Pali, Rajsamand and Sirohi. The committee included retired IFS officers, RN Mehrotra and NK Vasu, and assistant inspector general of forest, NTCA, Hemant Singh. Till 1970, Kumbhalgarh was a natural habitat of big cats with a good prey base and less human interference. In July, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change sanctioned Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary in Bundi as the fourth Tiger Reserve of Rajasthan. Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Sawai Madhopur, Alwar’s Sariska Tiger Reserve, and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota have over 100 big cats. A senior official of the forest department familiar with the development said after the survey the committee has considered Kumbhalgarh sanctuary, a potential area for tiger habitat, provided certain conditions given are fulfilled by the state government. The conditions include adding more area to the sanctuary, increasing prey base, relocation of the villages, and sensitizing people about the big cats. He said the draft report is ready, which will soon be submitted to the NTCA. Another official said Kumbhalgarh sanctuary is a narrow strip with a hilly area, which is not feasible for tigers but for leopards. The committee has recommended increasing the protected areas by adding 1150 sq km of territorial forest and wasteland. The committee suggests developing a breeding centre for the prey base in the reserve. He said the committee suggests developing the habitat in two phases. In phase-I, the 1150 sq km land - Udaipur, Pali, Rajsamand and Sirohi - should be transferred to wildlife, which currently is under the revenue department. In phase-II, the tiger reintroduction plan will be made from 2024-25 by the NTCA, and initially, one or two tigers could be released. The official said around 20 villages need to be relocated and two roads crossing the forest should be shifted to elevated roads. On factors assessed to develop a tiger habitat, Retired IFS officer Sunayan Sharma said a host of things are studied, such as whether the area in past had tiger population, is the area suitable for tiger habitat and has prey base, adequate area, water, protected environment; can the tiger population survive and breed and can the area hold sustainable population. Sharma welcomed the initiative of having another tiger reserve and said, “What is the problem in releasing tigers in another habitat? The important thing is to ensure their safety. The Ranthambore Tiger Reserve is getting overpopulated and needs to be balanced by the relocation of big cats.” He said the territorial disputes are increasing in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve and relocation is a good solution. Member of Parliament from Rajsamand and NTCA member, Diya Kumari said, “I had raised the issue in Lok Sabha, even apprised former and current forest minister over the issue. Kumbhalgarh has huge potential to be a tiger reserve. The area used to be a tiger habitat five decades back, even today it can be developed into one.” Besides, the area can also be a good habitat for leopards. “If things go right then this would be the fifth tiger reserve of the state. I have also written to the CM asking to speed up the proposal for the same to NTCA,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-may-get-another-tiger-reserve-in-the-kumbhalgarh-area-of-udaipur-division-101633948867581.html

11-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan’s bail plea: What lawyers said as court to hear petition on Oct 13||A special court under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on Monday directed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to file its reply on Wednesday, October 13, to a bail plea filed by Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, arrested in connection with the seizure of drugs onboard a cruise ship last week. Special judge VV Patil said he would hear Aryan Khan’s bail plea on Wednesday.Aryan Khan is currently in judicial custody and lodged at the Arthur Road prison in Mumbai after he was arrested on October 3. The 23-year-old approached the special court for bail after his plea was rejected by a magistrate's court which said that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide the matter. Aryan Khan has been charged with offences under Sections 8(c), 20(b), 27, 28, 29 and 35 of the NDPS act related to possession, consumption and purchase of drugs. The NCB has so far arrested 20 people in connection with the case.Also read | Cruise raid: NCB witness whose selfie with Aryan Khan went viral has cheating complaints against him in PalgharThe NCB's advocates AM Chimalkar and Advait Sethna sought a week's time to respond and file their affidavit after Aryan Khan's counsel Amit Desai mentioned the bail plea in the special court. The NCB lawyers said the investigation in the case was still ongoing and the central agency needs to collect material. They also said that it needs to be seen if releasing Aryan Khan on bail would hamper the probe into the case.Also read | Why was Aryan Khan denied bail? Magistrate's court cites this actHowever, Desai objected to the NCB lawyers argument, saying a person's liberty is in question and said that releasing Aryan Khan on bail will not stop the NCB’s investigation. "The NCB can continue their probe. That is their duty. But keeping my client (Aryan Khan) in custody, especially when there has been no recovery (of drugs) from him, is not required," Desai said, according to news agency PTI. "He has not been found in possession of any narcotics and there is no other material against him. Since his arrest, he has been in the custody of the NCB for a week and his statement was recorded twice. Why does he still need to be in jail?" he said.Also read | 'Because it's a Khan?': What politicians say on Aryan Khan's arrestChimalkar said that the NCB needs at least a few days time to file its reply. "What Desai is arguing appears to be rosy, but this is not what the investigation reveals or divulges. Aryan Khan is in judicial custody. Whether his release on bail will affect or hamper our investigation needs to be seen," Chimalkar said, according to PTI.Sethna told the court that there was no extreme urgency for the bail plea to be heard immediately. To which, Desai asked the court to hear and decide Aryan Khan's plea separately, saying the recovery of drugs from each accused in the case was different. However, the NCB lawyers opposed it and said the conspiracy is the same.Arbaaz Merchant, Munmun Dhamecha, Nupur Sateja, and Mohak Jaiswal—the four other accused in the case—have also filed their bail pleas in the special court.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-what-lawyers-said-as-court-to-hear-petition-on-oct-13-101633946276282.html

People have shown their anger against the incident of mowing down the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. If someone is opposing this Maharashtra Bandh then they must ask themselves if they are citizens of this country,” he added.Echoing similar sentiments, Nawab Malik, the leader of another MVA constituent Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said, "All the major political parties, organizations and labour unions have supported the Maharashtra Bandh. Our bandh is successful. We have been making appeals to avoid any sort of violence," he added.Another NCP leader Jayant Patil alleged that the BJP government neglected the farmers' protest at the borders of Delhi, but Lakhimpur incident is a "clear murder". "They (the four farmers) were killed by a BJP minister's son. It appears that BJP wants to crush the farmers' agitation and to condemn the incident we have called this bandh. BJP has unfortunately opposed it. It means they are supporting those who have murdered the farmers by mowing them down," he added.NCP leader Supriya Sule along with party workers participated in a protest during Maharashtra Bandh at Hutatma Chowk in Mumbai. "We have called this bandh against the murder of the farmers. If you watch the video, you will get goosebumps even today. Have you ever seen such a cruelty? It was a cruel incident. Condemning the incident will not be enough and he (Ashish Mishra) should be brought to justice. MoS Ajay Mishra should have resigned from his position by taking moral responsibility of the incident," she added.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil said that the ruling parties in the state are trying to reap political mileage by giving the bandh call for what happened in Uttar Pradeeh. “We condemn it as it has posed a hardship to the general public. Instead of observing a bandh, the state government should first give relief to the farmers affected due to the floodings in Marathwada and Vidarbha recently. The state government has done nothing except tall assurances for them,” he added.The bandh affected the commuters in the morning rush hour in Mumbai and neighbouring areas as bus services were stalled and most of the shops and commercial establishments remained closed. "I have to go to my office and I am waiting for the bus here for the last half an hour," a commuter told news agency ANI.As many as eight people, including four farmers, died in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.

The delay was reported at around 7:30 am, just when the footfall at the metro stations starts to peak. The services resumed back to normal at around 7:53am, according to the updated tweet by the DMRC."Delay in services between Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Shiv Vihar. Normal service on all other lines," it had tweeted.The Pink Line is the seventh metro rail line of the Delhi metro. It stretches from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar and consists of 38 metro stations on the route. The Pink Line was opened in multiple phases starting in 2018.The Delhi metro often informs about the congestion and delays on Twitter. Most of the time these delays occur at the peak time of the commute.Currently, the trains are running at full capacity, however, the provision of standing is still prohibited by the DMRC due to the Covid-19 measures. This also contributes to the regular delays.The services of the Delhi Metro were shut completely in May after the city started reporting a spurt in daily Covid-19 cases. After several extensions, the services were partially opened on June 7. The Delhi Metro trains started operating with 100% seating capacity on July 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-commute-update-brief-delay-in-services-at-pink-line-101633921218007.html

He was asked to join the investigation, and his bail plea was dismissed. He then moved the Delhi high court, where he was asked to join the investigation.

11-10-2021||Delhi||Fire rules red tape keeps open-air dining policy behind closed doors||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) launched its open air dining policy for restaurants under the civic body’s jurisdiction in September last year. However, till date, the corporation has given out only 69 licences -- with only 12 establishments getting the licences in the past four months.Officials of the civic body aware of the matter said the policy failed to take off at the expected pace because of confusion over the fire safety certificate provision.A senior official from the public health department of the civic body explained that a fire safety certificate is a must for all establishments applying for open air dining spaces. Though most of them were able to get the no-objection certificate (NOC) from Delhi Fire Services (DFS) for eateries on the ground floor, space on open terrace remains a sticking point.Restaurant owners said that DFS doesn’t issue NOCs for open terrace, and the fire department has said that the SDMC should get third party safety rules audit for terrace areas since they do not have enough staff to get inspections done.“Fire NOC is a precondition for open-air dining licence and owners are not able to secure it which is leading to very few prospective licensees approaching us. The Delhi Fire Services has asked them to make provisions like water sprinklers, staircases, hosepipes, etc. So far, licenses have been mostly issued to establishments located on ground-floor,” the SDMC official said.The National Restaurant Association of India representatives say that the policy should be amended to resolve the confusion over fire NOC condition for terraces. Sandeep Anand Goyle, managing committee member of National Restaurant Association of India, said that several meetings have been held between DFS, industry representatives and SDMC officials to resolve the issue. “This is a technical flaw in the policy. DFS is telling us that there is no provision of issuing fire NOC for open spaces while SDMC has made it into a precondition. Either the policy should be revised or the civic body may adopt suggestion by fire officials that the existing fire NOCs can be extended to the adjacent open spaces under some conditions like 25% vacant space, two stair cases, etc,” he added.Goyle said it was not clear that who among the two departments would take this responsibility of issuing the clearance.The Delhi Fire Service, in a letter to the municipal health officer of SDMC, suggested that the enforcement of guidelines should be verified by the municipal corporation. “In a joint meeting held in March 2021, the representatives of DFS have stated that they have limited manpower, and they are not able to issue NOC to terraces for which third party inspections may be carried out,” an SDMC official said.In a response to the request from SDMC arguing that DFS should continue to issue fire NOC to terraces, the DFS director had stated in a letter dated March 11, 2021 that the safety guidelines should be verified by SDMC and no further NOC is required from the department.DFS director Atul Garg said the of open-air dining policy was sent for their consideration. “We have told the corporation that our inspection should not be made mandatory. The establishments which have taken NOC for the covered portion can extend the same safety conditions such as equipment and staircase regulations to the open space as well. Why should the fire officials visit them again,” Garg said.The zone wise distribution of open-air dining licenses shows that 29 have been granted in the Najafgarh zone, 27 in the South zone and 10 in the Central zone. The lowest number of such establishments in under the West zone where three such open air eateries are currently operational.SDMC official said that some of area and establishments where outdoor dining licenses have been issued are located in places such as Aerocity, India Habitat Center, Aurobindo Marg, outlets in Kapashera, Dwarka, Rajouri garden, Hauz Khas and Green Park.Goyle said, “The concept of open air dining policy is good and the industry has been pushing for it for the past 15 years.”According to the policy approved in September last year, open-air dining is allowed only in restaurants with a health trade licence, and where there is an open space such as a rooftop which is private property. Recently, the north and east corporation have also adopted a similar policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fire-rules-red-tape-keeps-open-air-dining-policy-behind-closed-doors-101633914355199.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Man shoots mother-in-law, wife, arrested||A 32-year-old man allegedly shot dead his wife and mother-in-law with a pistol in Baba Haridas Nagar of Dwarka on Saturday.Police said the man himself called the police control room and confessed to have murdered the two women.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary, said they received a call at 9.45pm on Saturday regarding the murder of two people. When the cops reached the spot, they found two dead bodies of women with gunshot injuries.Police said the accused, Mahesh, shot them eight times. The gun was seized and Mahesh was arrested from the spot, investigators said. The two victims were identified as Mahesh’s wife Nidhi (21) and his mother-in-law Beero (55).“Nidhi and Mahesh had a love marriage in January 2020 against the wishes of their parents. Later, their parents accepted their marriage and Mahesh, along with his wife, started living with her mother,” said Choudhary.However, soon after, problems started arising between Mahesh and Nidhi, and they fought often over trivia matters, police said.“They had an argument on another argument on Saturday, following which Mahesh shot her and her mother,” said the DCP.Preliminary investigation has shown that Mahesh, who was into buying and selling cars, did not give any money to his wife, which was one of the reasons of discord between the couple.“The accused has a criminal bent of mind and has one case registered against him under 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code at Jaffarpur Kalan police station. Mahesh has been arrested and is in police custody,” said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-shoots-mother-in-law-wife-arrested-101633910998400.html

11-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His October homework||Such a vivid series of cumulous clouds. There’s also a man with a moth perched on his mouth.To a visitor at Aditya Raj’s studio in south Delhi’s CR Park, these acrylics on canvas might bear little resemblance to the real world. The 3 pm sky outside is dull blue and without clouds. The primary view from this fourth floor terrace is in fact of the neighbour’s pani ki tankis.But right now, Mr Raj, 30, is sketching something straightforwardly relatable—the Majnu Ka Tila gateway in the north of the city. It is a part of his October project in which he is drawing one Delhi landmark per day, which he later shares on his instagram handle @adirajart. He first sighted the gateway many years back while driving along the Ring Road—“It stood out with its distinct design, and with the words ‘Tibetan Refugee Camp’… I’d no idea such a place existed in Delhi.” Mr Raj had then newly arrived from hometown Jaipur to join a law college in Delhi. He finished his graduation in 2016 and promptly became a full-time artist. These ongoing October compilations, he points out, mostly consists of places in the capital with which he finds a personal connect. Like the one on Delite Cinema he did last week. “My partner loves films, he’s a great fan of (late) Sridevi and some years back we went to Delite to see the pre-release screening of what turned out to be her last movie (Mom).”It takes two-three hours for Mr Raj to rustle out each October drawing—which comprises sketching and colouring. Some of the other city places he plans to recreate include the Alka hotel in Connaught Place, the German Bakery in Paharganj (it’s now a 24/7 convenience store!), the graffiti lane in Sarojini Nagar, Little Saigon restsurant in Hauz Khas Market, and Sudama tea stall in Delhi University.Meanwhile, a short walk away from his studio, an overgrown creeper on the roadside has clambered up to partially cover a signboard that details a local doctor’s consulting hours. The CR Park-based artist must consider this semi-wild spectacle, too, for his October chore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-october-homework-101633908286693.html
11-10-2021||Indore||Muslim kin alleges mob attack in Madhya Pradesh, police say no communal angle||A Muslim family of blacksmiths in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, alleged that five of its members were thrashed by a mob on Saturday shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans who wanted them to leave their village. Police, however, called it a clash that happened after the family couldn’t deliver an order for a trolley on time and refused to return money paid as advance.Two first information reports were filed on Sunday against both groups for rioting and voluntarily causing hurt. Police are yet to arrest anyone and the injured were admitted to MY Hospital Indore.The Muslim family claimed that some locals in Kampel village had been threatening them for a month and telling them to leave as they didn’t want to see Muslims in the village. “When we didn’t leave, scores of people attacked us on Saturday night with iron rods and canes,” said Shahrukh Lohar.He said they are blacksmiths who keep moving from one place to another. “Two years ago, we came to this village from the Neemar region of MP to work as ironsmiths. We make agricultural equipment and trolleys,” Lohar said.He said when a few villagers told the family to leave, they discussed the matter with the sarpanch and others in the village. “They asked us not to pay attention on their threats. On Saturday, a group of people from a neighbouring village came in large numbers and attacked on us with iron rods and canes. They injured my father, Farukh Lohar,” said Lohar, adding that his sister Fouzia, uncle Firoz and mother Shabnam were also thrashed.Shahrukh’s sister Fouzia said, “They came in large numbers and started shouting slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and abusing us. Before we could react, they started beating my father. My father was already upset about burglars stealing ₹80,000 from our house a month ago and wanted to leave. But Saturday night’s incident shook us badly.”The family also accused the police of not supporting them and said they registered an FIR only after a local advocate named Ehtesham Hashmi intervened. “We had to wait for at least three hours at Kampel outpost to register the case. Instead of taking swift action against the accused, the police personnel were trying to present the matter as a normal group clash,” Hashmi said.The police, however, refuted the allegations and said it was a group clash and nobody received any grievous injuries.Indore (west) superintendent of police MC Jain said, “Farukh Lohar had taken ₹75,000 in advance from a villager Vikas Patel to make a trolley, but didn’t complete the order. Patel was asking Lohar to return the money, and on Saturday night, Patel along with eight others went to Lohar’s home for money. When he refused to pay, Patel attacked Lohar with an iron rod.”Jain added that Patel and others used rods and canes present at Lohar’s house as weapons so it’s clear that it was not a pre-planned attack. “The Lohar family didn’t register any complaint about being threatened and burgled earlier,” the SP said, adding that some people have been trying to give the incident a communal twist and they will be acted against soon.The first FIR was registered against Vikas Patel and eight others under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (using obscene language), 506 (criminal intimidation), 427 (mischief), 147 (rioting), and 148 (rioting with armed deadly weapon) of the Indian Penal Code while another FIR under the same IPC sections was registered against Lohar and five others, including two women.Heavy police force has been deployed in the village to avoid any untoward incident.When contacted, Kampel village sarpanch Prakash Bagwan accused the Muslim family of lying about contacting him or any other villager. “They didn’t inform me about any threat. It was a matter of money,” he said.But Bagwan said Vikas Patel was associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which held a meeting in the village two months ago. “As I didn’t attend the meeting, I am not aware of the agenda,” he added.The incident, however, received some political attention with All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi condemning it. In a tweet, he said, “Sir Shivraj Singh Chouhan and DGP MP will you arrest these radicalized goons, will your government discharge your constitutional duty?”MP Congress spokesperson Aminul Khan Suri accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government of allowing people to spoil the environment of the Malwa region. “The communal clashes and discrimination against minorities have increased manifold. The family was being harassed for a long time, but they didn’t report to the police because they knew that the police won’t support them. That is why even today, they termed the incident as clash not discrimination,” Suri said.However, water resources minister and local BJP MLA Tulsi Silawat said an inquiry has been ordered and nobody will be spared if what the Muslims have said is true. “Communal clashes have increased because people are being misguided for political advantage. We have arrested some and also sent notices to some others for creating unrest among people by circulating fake messages,” Silawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/muslim-kin-alleges-mob-attack-in-madhya-pradesh-police-say-no-communal-angle-101633902553845.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Bandipora killing: 4 militant associates arrested, one at large||The Jammu and Kashmir Police on Sunday busted a Lashkar-e-Taiba - The Resistance Front (LeT-TRF ) module responsible for killing the president of a taxi drivers’ union in Bandipora on October 5. “Four militants were arrested for killing Mohammad Shafi Lone, of Naidkhai,” a police spokesperson said. “The arrested terrorist associates have been identified as Tariq Ahmad Dar alias Tariq Khoucha, Mohammad Shafi Dar, Mudasir Hassan Lone and Bilal Ah Dar alias Sahb Khoucha, “ the spokesman said. However, one of the militant associate involved in the killing, identified as Imtiyaz Ah Dar alias Kotru is absconding and has reportedly joined the terrorist ranks. “The killing was carried out at the behest and instruction of LeT (TRF) handler Lala Umar, a resident of Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that the module that was active in Shahgund, Hajin area, had planned the attack by carrying out reconnaissance of the target and surveiling him. On the day of the attack, one of the terrorist associates called the victim for a meeting at Gundboon, where the victim was assassinated, the spokesman said. Hundreds allegedly questioned over civilian killings Hundreds of people have allegedly been called for questioning, many of whom have been detained across Kashmir over the past few days to investigate the chain of civilian killings in the Valley over the last week.Police officials and local sources, on the condition of anonymity, said the police has been detaining over ground workers (OGWs) and members of the banned organisation, Jamaat-e-Islami to question whether they had any role in the civilian killings. While some reports have put the number of people detained for questioning at around 500, a senior police official said that the number is was not as much.While J&K DGP Dilbag Singh and IG Kashmir Vijay Kumar did not respond to calls, DIG (north Kashmir) Udaybhaskar Billa said that they have been calling people including OGWs to investigate if they had played a role.“It is true that we have called some people and we are verifying the involvement of locals,” he said, adding, “It is not detention per se.” Locals said that police has already detained many people in Hajin after the family members of Mohammad Shafi identified the people who had attacked him.“Right now, it is not appropriate to talk about the case,” the DIG said.Kashmir has been restive since October 3 owing to the targeted killings of seven persons including three belonging to minority communities of the union territory and forth one a non-local.On Thursday suspected militants opened fire on two teachers – Satinder Kour, the principal, and Deepak Chand – of a government school in Srinagar’s old city and killed them.The two were killed two days after Makhan Lal Bindroo, a 68-year-old chemist, street vendor Virender Paswan from Bihar’s Bhagalpur, and Muhammad Shafi Lone, a taxi driver, were shot dead in Srinagar and Bandipora districts on Tuesday.On Saturday evening, gunmen opened fire at Majid Ahmad Gojri, a resident of Chattabal Srinagar, and Mohammad Shafi Dar, a resident of SD Colony Batamaloo, killing them both.To augment the police investigations, the Union government has sent Intelligence Bureau’s head of CT operations Tapan Deka to the Valley to personally supervise the fight against militancy following the killings while CT teams of other national security agencies have also been in Kashmir to act as force multipliers to Jammu and Kashmir police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bandipora-killing-4-militant-associates-arrested-one-at-large-101633900381406.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Mandi bypoll: Development has failed to reach hill state, says Kanhaiya||One of Congress’ star campaigners and recent inductee former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president was in Mandi on Sunday to campaign for Pratibha Singh, who has been fielded from the parliamentary constituency.  Slamming the ruling BJP government, he said the Modi government slogan should be “this time an advertisement government. Tourists reach Himachal from different states for its apples, but development does not reach Himachal,” he said. All India Congress in-charge for Himachal affairs, Rajiv Shukla, said, “One can gauge the level of development in the state from the conditions of the roads. Besides, there has been a hike in fuel prices. Before assuming power, the Prime Minister had promised that the price of petrol will be ₹40 per litre, but the price of diesel is about to reach ₹100.” Shukla asked people should go through the party’s manifestoes and question the leaders over unfulfilled promises. He also criticised the BJP over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. National secretary Sanjay Dutt, state Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, former state president Kaul Singh Thakur, former president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, district president Prakash Chaudhary, MLA Vikramaditya Singh, general secretary Chet Ram Thakur and former minister Rangeela Rama Rao were also present at the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandi-bypoll-development-has-failed-to-reach-hill-state-says-kanhaiya-101633899601296.html

11-10-2021||Pune||Water supply timings to parts of Pune city likely to reduce: PMC||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) water department has decided to control excessive supply of water to parts of the city, which will see a reduction in the span of time supply will be available. The PMC is acting on instructions from the canal committee of the state water resources department and the Maharashtra Water Resource Regulatory Authority (MWRRA). At a recent meeting, the water supply department called in officials and discussed how to control water supply and minimise usage.Aniruddha Pawaskar, chief superintendent engineer, water supply department said, “We are working on the plan on how to control and regulate water supply in the city. At present, some parts of the city are getting more water whereas some parts are not getting enough water. We are trying to minimise the gap and provide at least enough water to every part of the city. It is not that we are going to cut down the water supply.”He further said, “We are under pressure from the water resource department and MSWRRA to reduce water usage. We are working on it. We introduced 24x7 regular and equitable water supply projects. We installed around 53,000 water metres in different parts of the city and laid 550km of pipeline. The project will help us with a water audit and identify leakages and losses in the distribution system.” A senior water distribution official said, “Actually, we are trying to reduce water supply to the Swargate and SNDT zone where there is excessive supply and usage. The timings (hours) of water supply may reduce.”According to PMC officials, there are five major zones in the city - Parvati, Wadgaon, Pune cantonment, Bhama-Askhed, Chikhali - which are divided into different sub-zones. Parvati and Pune cantonment account for 50 per cent of the city in terms of water supply. In August, deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar had attended a canal committee meeting where a review of water availability in the four dams from which Pune gets its water was taken. Pawar had instructed the PMC to make a time-bound plan to restrict water usage.Baramati-based farmer Vithal Jarad filed a case against PMC with the MWRRA for excessive use of water by the PMC as a result of which the water supply to the rural areas is affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/water-supply-timings-to-parts-of-pune-city-likely-to-reduce-pmc-101633898821069.html

11-10-2021||Pune||Fees, daily living worries cloud reopening of colleges for students in Pune||PUNE From Tuesday, October 12, college campuses reopen for in-person classes. Students are eagerly waiting, but along with the excitement, several are also worried. College fees, student accommodation, hostels, and the availability of study material are all the post-Covid issues on the minds of students and parents alike.“We are excited to join start in-person lectures and getting back onto campus after a long break. Many of my friends are returning to Pune, but we are worried about the college fees. Most students, including me, have not yet paid the full college fees. Some have not paid a single penny. The major reason is the Covid pandemic and the financial crisis thereof, especially in rural parts of the state,” said Kuldeep Ambekar, a law student and president of the Students’ Helping Hand organisation. There are more than 10,000 junior and senior colleges, institutions and private universities in Pune district. The approximate number of students studying in all these educational institutions is 1.4 million at least. Payal Mitra, a second year Arts student from the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) said, “I was waiting for this day to start, but my parents and me are worried about the accommodation facilities. Earlier, I used to stay at the university hostel and it is closed now. If I want to rent a flat then I need to stay with other girls, or as a paying guest. This is a bit of a worry looking at the Covid safety and precautions. The university should open up their hostels and students with two vaccination doses should be allowed to stay,”Another student Hitesh Ghule said, “Me and three friends from Beed district are planning to come to Pune next week and start offline lectures. We hope to be able to access accommodation, food mess and other day-to-day needs. Our monthly budget of staying and meals in Pune goes to around ₹7,000 and if this increases then it will affect our studies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fees-daily-living-worries-cloud-reopening-of-colleges-for-students-in-pune-101633898101053.html
11-10-2021||Pune||Child devp services report claims 34.88% of kids under 6 in Maha have stunted growth||PUNE Maharashtra’s Integrated Child Development Services report for June 2020 states that 34.88% or 398,000 children suffer from stunted growth and 168,000 are severely stunted, which accounts for 14.73% of children under the age of six years. Some of the districts with the highest number of stunted children are Palghar and Nandurbar, while districts reporting the least number of stunted children are Pune, Sangli, Jalgaon and Satara. The report states that of the 7,858,646 children in the state aged below six years, 398,545 or 34.88% are stunted and 168,278 are severely stunted. A child is identified as stunted by measuring the height against his/her age and is used to identify if the child is gaining height as per age. As per the central government’s Poshan Abhiyan, stunting is a child short of height and some of the antecedents of stunting are repeated minor illnesses and not eating enough for a long periods of time.The tribal population in the state is the most affected with the highest percentage of stunted children. Of the total of 168,278 severely stunted children in the state, 56,037 are from the tribal community. Of the 398,545 stunted children, 116,885 are from tribal pockets. Nandurbar has the highest percentage of stunted children at 60.79%, while Palghar has 38.27% children with severe stunting. Both districts have a significant number of tribal pockets.The central government guidelines state that children who are stunted have lost the opportunity to regain height, but these children should be cared for, because if they fall sick and start getting thin, then it can be dangerous. For both stunted and underweight children, it is important to ensure complementary feeding, immunisation, deworming and vitamin A supplementation. These children should be monitored regularly and should be referred if found to be losing weight or falling ill. Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad said, “Pune has reported the least number of children who are stunted. Children who are stunted and who are underweight are considered malnourished and although the height gain is not possible once the child is stunted, balanced nutrition to a pregnant woman and also for lactating mothers can provide nutrition to the child at a very early stage and so the related problems that could add troubles for the stunted child could be reduced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/child-devp-services-report-claims-34-88-of-kids-under-6-in-maha-have-stunted-growth-101633897801010.html

Despite all this a massive crowd was seen on Sunday outside the Dagdusheth Ganpati temple and at Tambadi Jogeshwari Devi temple. As it was Sunday, people across the district came to take darshan of at the temples. While there was no proper management of traffic, long queues of vehicles and traffic congestion was seen throughout the day on the Shivaji road. Adding to it were the roadside hawkers creating hurdles for pedestrian movement. “I have come from Baramati to Pune city and one of my main reasons was to take darshan of Tamabdi Jogeshwari Devi as the Navratri festival is going on. After seeing the crowd outside the temple, I was bit afraid,” said Prashant Nikam a citizen. While police bandobast was all around the temple, vehicles coming from Shaniwarwada were not allowed to go towards Tulshibaug market from the Rameshwar chowk on Shivaji road. This led to traffic jams all over the area during the evening peak hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sunday-crowds-jam-traffic-around-dagdusheth-tambadi-jogeshwari-temples-101633897381509.html

While I was in the military , I spent a lot of time in tribal areas and am well versed with the problems faced by those living in remote areas.” He also praised the residents of Lahaul-Spiti for the role they played during the invasion of Kashmir and Ladakh in 1948. “The people of Lahaul were the saviours of Ladakh,” he said. While promising to focus on developing the area, he said the BJP government had done a lot to promote winter tourism and adventure sports in Lahaul-Spiti. The chief minister said the BJP government had ensured that the pace of development had not slowed down over the last four years in Lahaul and Spiti. “The previous government has reduced the budget for tribal areas, which our government has increased to 74 crore. The Atal Tunnel has emerged as a boon for the people and will boost the tourism sector, he said, while also congratulating the residents for achieving 100% vaccination before any other district in the country.Taking a jibe at the Congress, the chief minister said the Congress had no issue against the government. “The Opposition’s candidate, Pratibha Singh, had said she was not interested in contesting the election during a rally at Mandi. If she is not interested, who forced her to fight the polls and why?” He also condemned an Opposition leader for abusing him at a Mandi rally. “Everyone has the right to ask for votes, but votes cannot be sought by abusing,” he said, adding that he was confident that the people would vote in favour of the BJP. Chief electoral officer visits Mandi Ahead of the bypoll, chief electoral officer and Himachal Pradesh election secretary C Paulrasu visited the Mandi parliamentary constituency on Sunday to review poll preparations. He checked the counting centres and strong rooms at Sundernagar.

The zoo authorities are planning to introduce the new ticketing system prior to the reopening, which according to them will take place at the earliest. The zoo authorities met officials from Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) garden and information technology departments last month to discuss options to control crowding at the zoo once it reopens.Dr Rajkumar Jadhav, director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre, said, “We are aware that once the zoo reopens, it will be difficult to manage and control offline visitors hence, we are in discussions with the information technology department of PMC to upgrade the old system of online registration and ticketing for visitors. That way we can control and monitor the number of guests visiting the zoo and also avoid a big rush to the zoo.”Officials of PMC’s information technology department said that they are planning a completely new and separate portal for the zoo along with making ticketing and reservation user-friendly.Rahul Jagtap, head of the information technology department, said, “We are developing a ticketing and reservation application which is an upgrade to the old system that was in use earlier. This new app will help make reservations hassle-free and offer UPI, QR codes and other payment gateway options. It will also help with crowd management by giving us centralised data to compartmentalise visits to attractions inside the zoo.”Jagtap said that the entire idea is the culmination of a meeting on how temples have introduced online booking for devotees and that it will take a month to get the new system up and running. The zoo and the information technology department are also working on procuring information about animals through QR codes to help maintain appropriate distance between visitors and the animals and prevent people from crowding at one place.The zoo is located at Katraj and has been closed since March 2020 when the nationwide lockdown was first announced in the wake of Covid-19. While the PMC has reopened gardens for the public as part of the easing of Covid norms, the zoo at Katraj continues to remain out of bounds for the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rajiv-gandhi-zoo-to-introduce-new-ticketing-system-prior-to-reopening-101633896780926.html

On October 9, when they came, they were shocked to see the laboratory was ransacked and ₹4.36 lakh was stolen from almirah and drawer. He informed the police and lodged an FIR. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 3) Sameer Verma said Deepak hatched a conspiracy to steal the cash along with his accomplice. He said Deepak’s father used to work in the night shift. However, on October 8, he had left at 11 pm as he was unwell. Taking advantage of it, Deepak stole the keys of the laboratory from him and executed the theft. ₹3.50 Lakh has been recovered from Deepak and the rest of the amount is with Vishal who would soon be arrested. A case under Sections 457 and 380 of IPC has been registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-sanitary-worker-arrested-for-theft-at-lab-rs-3-5-lakh-recovered-101633896060843.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Two years after opening of Kartarpur corridor, not much has changed on ground for Dera Baba Nanak||Even as it has been two years since the Kartarpur corridor was thrown open, not much seems to have changed on the ground for the historic border town of Dera Baba Nanak that connects the visa-free passage on the Indian side with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in neighbouring Pakistan. Having faced neglect for 70 years after Independence due to its location along the International Border, the town saw a ray of hope of economic development when the corridor was inaugurated in November 2019 to commemorate the 550th Parkash Gurpurb (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. Two months before the opening of the corridor, the then Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh held a special cabinet meeting at Dera Baba Nanak and sanctioned ₹75.23 crore for widening and strengthening of major roads leading to the town that was a trading hub before Partition.But sadly enough, the work on the key Amritsar-Dera Baba Nanak road is still in its initial stage and is going at a snail’s pace. The road connects the town with Amritsar, the largest city in Punjab’s Majha region, the Sri Guru Ramdas Jee international airport, and the Amritsar railway junction.Another major project announced by the then CM was construction of a heritage street at the cost of ₹3.70 crore to give a fillip to religious tourism, but work on it is yet to start.This street is to be constructed in the town’s main market which is in a state of utter neglect. Full of potholes, the market turned into a pond when it rained recently. Local residents and shopkeepers lament that their life turns miserable during the rainy season due to poor drainage system.Even the Dera Baba Nanak Development Authority was constituted to ensure “holistic development” of the town, but to no avail. The CM had directed the director general of police (DGP) to expedite the process of setting up office of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and police station building in the city.“The projects should have been completed even as the corridor is closed from the Indian side due to the pandemic,” said Kirpal Singh, a local resident. Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Harpreet Singh said, “The work on the heritage street is about to start as tendering process has begun. The work on widening of the Amritsar-Dera Baba Nanak road got delayed due to the rainy season. Now it will be finished in a few months. The open-air amphitheatre and the city wall projects are also underway.”The town is represented in the state assembly by deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-years-after-opening-of-kartarpur-corridor-not-much-has-changed-on-ground-for-dera-baba-nanak-101633895760702.html

The driver Munawwar Sharif managed to save himself. A nullah in the area was overflowing with rainwater around 8.30 pm and Sharif tried to cross it when his car got swept away.The nullah which passes through the area does not have a barricading or a retaining wall. Area residents have been demanded construction of a mini-bridge on both sides of the road. Social activist Rajendra Bhintade said, “The area is extremely dangerous and can lead to loss of lives and a bigger tragedy can happen. We have been demanding construction of a mini retaining wall at the spot, but our plea has fallen on deaf ears.” In Mohammadwadi, a car parked outside Vibgyor school near Dorabjee Heritage was submerged in the deluge on the road on Saturday. The car was later removed on Sunday. Heavy rainfall within a short span caused water to enter housing societies. Between 5pm and 8:30 pm Lohegaon received 75.8mm rainfall while Shivajinagar got 49.2mm and Chinchwad 70mm. PMC deputy commissioner Madhav Jagtap said, “Heavy machinery was deployed to ensure that filth was removed from the nullahs. Also chronic spots will be taken up for repairs and action will be taken.

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Power crisis in Punjab a result of administrative paralysis: Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday said the power crisis in Punjab was a direct consequence of an overall administrative paralysis gripping the state due to lack of planning and preparedness by the Congress government as well as the ruling party’s obsession with power games and vendetta politics. Sukhbir, who was in Amritsar to pay obeisance at various religious shrines and hold a rally, said, “This crisis was waiting to happen. It has nothing to do with the so-called shortage of coal. The Union government has clarified that there is no shortage of coal in the country. This clearly shows that the Punjab government is the real villain as it was not keeping the required reserves of coal to deal with such a situation.” When the Akali Dal came to power in 2007, the state used to have daily power cuts of 14-16 hours, he said, adding that they promised to turn Punjab into a power surplus state and made it happen. The present power crisis, the SAD chief said, was easily foreseeable and manageable if the government had time and will to prepare for it in advance. “Coal shortages are not new and they happened during our times also. We always kept enough coal reserves and never let the state run into such a crisis. I request the chief minister to stop rushing to Delhi every second day and start taking responsibility of the state. It is condemnable that the CM and his power minister never bothered to check the stock of coal,” he said.On a query regarding Navjot Sidhu’s proposed “maun vrat” in Amritsar from Monday, Sukhbir said, “He is a dramebaaz (master of theatrics). Even at Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri, he sat on a hunger strike and observed silence for a night but broke it before breakfast.” Later, Sukhbir held a rally in the Ranjit Avenue area. The rally was organised by party leader and former minister Anil Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-crisis-in-punjab-a-result-of-administrative-paralysis-sukhbir-badal-101633895400983.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Nursing courses: BFUHS to hold another entrance on October 24||With 97% seats in undergraduate nursing courses still vacant after the first round of counselling, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, is going to conduct another entrance test on October 24. In a notice, BFUHS said the candidates can submit online applications for BSc nursing and BSc (post-basic) nursing courses till October 18. “The candidates who failed to clear the first entrance test do not need to re-submit online application. A new roll number will be issued to them,” it read. In the first entrance test conducted in August, the eligibility for admission to the BSc nursing course was 50 marks and for the BSc (post-basic) nursing course 30 marks. However, only 240 of the 2,596 candidates could score more than 50 marks, while 154 of the 380 candidates scored 30 or more, respectively. As many as 7,825 seats are available for both courses in 103 colleges in the state. But during the first round of counselling, only 244 were allotted to eligible candidates. Therefore, BFUHS had sought permission from the department of medical education and research to conduct another entrance test, which was granted. Official sources said in an attempt to fill the nursing seats, BFUHS may put up an easier question paper in the second entrance test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nursing-courses-bfuhs-to-hold-another-entrance-on-october-24-101633895284868.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Congress, SAD-BJP govts ruined Punjab’s public health services: Delhi minister||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday hit out at the successive Congress and SAD-BJP governments for the “deplorable condition of government health services” in Punjab.Accompanied by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab president Bhagwant Mann and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, Jain was in Dhuri to attend a function organised by the family of late party leader Sandeep Singla, in his memory.He said till 1980, Punjab’s government healthcare system was the best in the country. “Over the last four decades, the Congress and the SAD-BJP combine have created a pitiable state of public health services in Punjab, with a deliberate conspiracy to promote private hospitals, the cost of which is being borne by all sections, including the poor people of Punjab,” added Jain.The Delhi health minister said the AAP will implement Delhi’s development model in Punjab if voted to power. “Punjab is a full state. We will not just provide better services in the health sector but also in all other fields,” he added.Describing the Lakhimpur Kheri incident as a blot on the democracy of the nation, Jain said it was unfortunate that the BJP and its leaders had started behaving like dictators, and instead of paying attention to the farmers’ demands, they were treating them cruelly and inhumanely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-sad-bjp-govts-ruined-punjab-s-public-health-services-delhi-minister-101633895283545.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Farmers protest 25-quintal cap on paddy procurement||Up in arms against the limit of 25 quintals yield per acre of paddy and seeking compensation for pink bollworm attack on cotton crop, thousands of farmers held a massive protest against the state government at the grain market in Barnala on Sunday.Gathered under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), the protesters criticised the Congress-led state government for not fulfilling its pre-poll promises of employment and farm debt waiver.BKU (Sidhupur) chief Jagjit Singh Dallewal, and actor and director Amitoj Maan, along with other farmer leaders, opposed the “anti-farmer” policies of successive governments.Dallewal said, “Punjab government has put a cap of 25 quintals yield per acre for paddy procurement. What will farmers do with the rest of the produce? The government has also not given any compensation to cotton farmers who suffered damages due to the pink bollworm attack. Though the kin of farmers, who lost their lives at the Delhi border after November 26, 2020, were given assistance, we also want aid for farmers who died in Punjab earlier.”“The Congress government had promised employment to youth and complete debt waiver to farmers. But these remain unfulfilled even when the government is going to complete its tenure. If farmers can fight the central government, we can struggle against the state government as well. Only a new face of the chief minister will not work. It is the responsibility of the CM to fulfil the party’s pre-poll promises,” he added.Actor Amitoj Maan said had the elected leaders been good, farmers would not have to hold protests. “We will choose the right representatives. If anyone wants to achieve something through the farmer agitation, we will expose them. But we will appreciate those who contribute to it,” he said from the stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabfarmers-protest-25-quintal-cap-on-paddy-procurement-101633895282444.html

Agitating against the three central farm laws and the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, which led to the death of four farmers, farmer bodies have given a call to burn effigies of political leaders belonging to the BJP on Dussehra (October 15). “The Lakhmpur Kheri incident is being quoted as the reason. However, an FIR has been registered, the Uttar Pradesh government has announced compensation and arrest has also been made. So what is the rationale behind disturbing the festival?” asked Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-protest-call-on-dussehra-insensitive-bjp-punjab-general-secretary-101633895280761.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Coal crisis: PSPCL failed to follow central norms on maintaining fuel reserve||The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is itself to blame for the persisting coal crisis in power plants in the state as it failed to adhere to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) norms on maintaining minimum fuel reserves, people familiar with the situation said. As a result, the corporation is not only buying power at a whopping ₹11.80 per unit, but it also missed an opportunity to sell electricity to the national grid in October. A power engineer dealing with coal procurement said, “The corporation management didn’t pay heed to our advice to build coal stock as per the guidelines, saying the demand will dip in the wake of the Covid-19 third wave. But the demand went up against their expectations.”As per figures, the government-run Ropar thermal plant on June 1, 2019 had coal stock for 48 days against 23 days on the corresponding day this year. Similar was the situation at the Lehra Mohabbat plant. Similarly, the private thermal plants didn’t adhere to the guidelines on maintaining coal stocks. According to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission guidelines, the power plants in Punjab have to ensure a minimum stock of 30 days, as all of them are located more than 1,500 km from coal mines. The private sector plants had no stock as they as keep limited reserves to cut their expenditure on an increasing inventory. The PSPCL in the past has maintained sufficient stock and earned profits by selling power to the grid. In a year before the Covid-19 outbreak, the state sold power worth ₹1,183 crore to the grid mostly in September and October when electricity prices remain high. The management was already aware that a 660 megawatt (MW) unit of the Talwandi Sabo plant was operational and it had to meet coal demand of their own plants, but they didn’t maintain stock for at least 40 days, said another power engineer. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad admitted that the corporation is facing an acute coal shortage in all plants across the State. “All the private plants in the state have coal stock for one-and-a-half days while the state-owned plants have about 4 days of reserves. Yesterday, 11 coal rakes were received against the requirement of 22 rakes. Due to depleted coal stock, these plants are operating at less than 50% of their generation capacity. The demand of agriculture sector is still persisting due to delayed transplantation of paddy,” he said. The situation, he claimed, will improve after October 15 as more stock will arrive. “About 1800 MW power was purchased from the grid at ₹11.60 per unit today. Despite that, we are going for load shedding across the state on all categories of consumers to bridge the gap between demand and supply. Power cuts lasting 2-3 hours will be imposed daily till Wednesday,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coal-crisis-pspcl-failed-to-follow-central-norms-on-maintaining-fuel-reserve-101633895221967.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||BSF roping in panchayats in Punjab to tackle drone threat from Pak||The BSF has started roping in panchayats of border villages in Punjab to tackle increasing incidents of drones being used for dropping arms, ammunition and drugs from across the fence, said officials.Company commandants of the Border Security Force (BSF), India’s first line of defence, have been directed to share their contact numbers with sarpanches of villages falling within the 5km radius of the International Border with Pakistan. The panchayats are being requested to inform the concerned BSF officials immediately whenever they spot any unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).Officials said in absence of anti-drone technology along the border, they need public support to check UAVs entering the Indian territory. The move assumes significance as more than a dozen incidents of smuggling of tiffin bombs, hand grenades, pistols, and heroin through drones from Pakistan have been reported in the state in the past two months.“As drones continue to pose a security threat, we have started holding meetings with panchayats of villages which fall within the area of 5km from the International Border. Phone numbers of our company commandants are being shared with the public representatives to pass on immediate information regarding the flying objects,” said BSF’s Gurdaspur sector deputy inspector general (DIG) Prabhakar Joshi.On October 6, three drones, purportedly from Pakistan, were forced to retreat after the BSF troopers opened fire to prevent their entry into the Indian territory in Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts. “Various anti-drone gadgets are under consideration. We hope of getting these soon. Until then, we need the support of villagers,” said a senior BSF official, who didn’t wish to be named.“Drones being used for smuggling of arms and drugs fly at a height of 300 to 400 metres and are not spotted on radars. These flying objects can carry five to seven kilograms of drugs and ammunition and are usually used at night,” said the official. Last month, Tarn Taran police arrested three members of the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) in Bhikhwind sub-division after the recovery of two tiffin bombs, two hand grenades and three pistols. The accused had confessed to the police that the weapons were smuggled through drones from Pakistan and they had retrieved them from a border village to unleash terror activities in Punjab.In August, a tiffin bomb packed with over 2kg of RDX and five hand grenades were found from Daleke village in Amritsar. The police said the ammunition was dropped by a drone from the neighbouring country.Meanwhile, Punjab Police have intensified security near the border keeping in view of the festival season ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-roping-in-panchayats-in-punjab-to-tackle-drone-threat-from-pak-101633895220832.html

Sources at the sugar mills said that the income tax officials were scrutinising documents even as the department concluded its search operation at places owned by Ajit Pawar’s three sisters.On Friday, Ajit Pawar termed the income tax department searches as “guests” and said that he will comment further once the operation is over and the “guests” return from various places. “The ‘guests’ are still at various homes. I will say more once they return,” Ajit Pawar said on Friday in Pune when the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led a show of strength against the income tax department’s raids outside central hall. Income tax officials raided Ajit Pawar’s two sisters’ houses and his son Parth’s office on Thursday. Sugar factories linked to him were also raided the same day.Ajit Pawar’s cousin and NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s daughter, Supriya Sule, termed the action against her cousin sisters as an attack on women. She taunted the Bharatiya Janata Party saying that those who rule in the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj do not follow his principle of respecting women and act like the Mughals instead. Sharad Pawar has already reacted strongly to the income tax searches of premises linked to Ajit Pawar and kin saying that the action reeks of abuse of power and might be the BJP’s reaction to his strong position on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident which he likened to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.Ajit Pawar’s name surfaced in a money laundering case involving the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank in July after which the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached assets worth Rs65.75 crore belonging to the Jarandeshwar sugar mill in Satara district in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/it-searches-continue-at-premises-linked-to-ajit-pawar-s-kin-101633895160611.html

Based on the recent recommendations of a high-level committee headed by Meghalaya deputy chief minister Preston Tynsong, the Meghalaya cabinet approved a proposal to relocate Sikhs living in Thame Liu Malong area (Punjabi Lane). Randhawa said the decision was unjust and was taken allegedly under the pressure of the land mafia. “The civil rights of Sikhs who have been living in Shillong for more than 200 years would not be allowed to be trampled upon at any cost,” he said, urging the Meghalaya government to revoke the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-take-up-with-union-home-minister-unjust-move-to-relocate-shillong-sikhs-randhawa-101633895040687.html

The state capital set to witness huge changes due to the upcoming Defence Corridor project and expansion of city once the outer ring road project is completed,” Gangwar said. “The power consumption in the state capital is increasing at the rate of 12% per annum and going by this rate the power demand will be more than tripled and hence we would need infrastructure that is good enough to tackle the fresh demand for next 25 years,” chief engineer, Cis Gomti, Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA) Madhukar Varma said. The officials said Lucknow would require around 60 more substations to meet the growing load on transformers. The capacity of existing substations will have to be enhanced too. “Land is being searched for new substations. In the first phase 15 new power substations have been planned in Gehru, Latouche road, JaitiKhera, Vibhutikhand, Visheshkhand, HAL, Dewa road, Indira Nagar sector 25, Hussadia, Deendayal Puram , Faizullaganj, Sarvodaya Nagar, Gwari, New GSI colony, Viram Khand, Kamta,” officials said. “With Defence Corridor coming to Lucknow, the power supply infrastructure has to be prepared. Not only that, when the Green Corridor and outer ring road become operational in next few years, new housing colonies will come up and the power demand would increase. LESA is preparing itself for this challenge,” officials said. “To get rid of open wires, aerial bunch conductors are to be put up at many places and introduction of prepaid meters for power consumers will end the problem of power theft,” officials said. “Once the entire power infrastructure is revamped and upgraded, people would benefit as there would be no problem of low voltage and power cuts too would become a thing of the past,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknows-power-infrastructure-set-for-revamp-101633894200594.html
11-10-2021||Other||AU research on capsaicin and its ‘Nobel’ connection||The Nobel Committee has awarded the 2021 Physiology and Medicine Nobel Prize to US scientists Ardem Patapoutian and David Julius for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch. They had used capsaicin to decipher their study on pain receptors. The pungent ingredient in chilli peppers, which gives ‘hot taste’ to chillis is capsaicin. This formed the basis of this award-winning research and one which has an indirect connection with Allahabad University (AU) too. A research group under Prof SI Rizvi in the Biochemistry department here has been engaged in understanding the non-neuronal effects of capsaicin for the last 15 years. This research group has published a large number of research papers on the physiological and biochemical effects of capsaicin. “Capsaicin is a very interesting molecule. It binds to the same nerve endings on the skin which carry sensation of pain and also sensation of temperature. When capsaicin binds to these nerve endings, termed as nociceptors, the nerve is activated, and we experience a sense of ‘hot’ feeling. However, when capsaicin binds to nociceptors or pain receptors for a longer time the nerve becomes insensitive or numb,” prof Rizvi explained. This property of capsaicin to make the nerves, which carry sensation of pain, numb has opened up possibilities to use this pungent compound to mitigate pain. It is also a common observation that food tastes hotter when it is at a higher temperature. This is because capsaicin’s effect is augmented by hot temperature, explained prof Rizvi. Prof Rizvi’s group at the AU has been engaged in research on the effects of capsaicin on the cell membrane. “We have explored a new dimension focused on the question as to why people in hot climatic regions eat more chillies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/au-research-on-capsaicin-and-its-nobel-connection-101633893781240.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Smart City Mission: BJP seeks probe into disbursement of funds by Ludhiana MC||With the authorities making tall claims regarding the development of the Malhar road and the Sarabha Nagar main market under the Smart City Mission, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought an inquiry into alleged ill-planned development and corrupt practices adopted by the Municipal Corporation (MC). Bikram Sidhu, BJP state executive member, has demanded that a proper inquiry needs to be conducted regarding the disbursement of funds and the work done at the ground level. Further, he also urged the civic body to resolve the problems being faced by commuters on the Malhar road due to traffic congestion. He said the authorities claimed to have spent over 38 crores on the project to transform the Malhar road into a smart road and retrofitting the Sarabha Nagar main market, but nothing concrete had been done at the ground level rather than installing interlocking tiles at large. Earlier, the authorities said the market would have multi-storey parking, but that component has also been dropped. Sidhu said despite spending ₹24 crore on the Malhar road, the width of one of the busiest roads of the city had been reduced from 120 ft to around 50 ft due to which traffic snarls were witnessed in the area. Further, the unplanned tabletops (speed breakers) established at certain points are resulting in accidents. Other BJP leaders, including Sidhu, had also submitted a memorandum regarding the alleged discrepancies with secretary, ministry of housing and urban affairs, Durga Shanker Mishra during his visit to the city in September. Pardeep Sabharwal, MC commissioner, said proper monitoring of development projects was being done to keep a check on the quality of work being taken up. The project to transform the Malhar road into a smart road was still underway and would be completed soon. Secretary, MoHUA, Mishra had also appreciated the projects being taken up by MC under the Smart City Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/smart-city-mission-bjp-seeks-probe-into-disbursement-of-funds-by-ludhiana-mc-101633893660903.html

The forecast also states that the city and several other parts of the state are likely to witness heavy rains over the next few days.The IMD in its daily bulletin on Sunday said that several parts of the state will continue to receive heavy rains for at least the next 24 hours.Heavy rainfall is expected over Belagavi, Bagalkote, Vijayapura, Gadag, Koppal, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Kodagu, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Ramanagara and other parts of the state, according to IMD.“Thunderstorms with lightning (are) likely to occur at isolated places over the state,” the IMD said in its forecast for the next 24 hours. The IMD-Bengaluru also said that several districts of the state will receive heavy rainfall (64.5 to 115.5 mm) over the next few days that could further add to the challenges of the state and its population who are yet to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns.“Due to the cyclonic circulation over east-central Arabian Sea and a trough off the Karnataka coast, which is resulting in wind instabilities and also due to east-west wind share, many places over South Peninsular, South Interior Karnataka districts, including Bengaluru, is very likely to receive scattered to widespread rains associated with thunder activity towards evening/night during the next 2-3 days,” according to a forecast by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA).According to Manoj Rajan, commissioner of the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority, Bengaluru urban district recorded rainfall of 468mm as against the normal of 471mm between September 1-30.Nagarbhavi station in the south-western part of Bengaluru received 117mm of rain on October 4 which is the highest so far in the year.Bengaluru has also reported water logging in several parts of the city. The rapid and unplanned expansion of Benglauru has led to encroachment of lakes and storm water drains (SWD) that lead to flooding in these parts, experts have said. Residents have also complained that the constant digging of roads makes it difficult even commute in the city where several persons have lost their lives due to what they call “civic apathy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/heavy-rains-continue-to-lash-bengaluru-other-parts-of-karnataka-101633893541832.html
11-10-2021||Bangalore||Mysore sugar factory must remain with state: Siddaramaiah||Congress Legislative Party leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday participated in a protest held at the Farmers’ Protection Committee in Mandya, demanding that Karnataka retain ownership of the historical Mysore Sugar Company Limited Factory.“The Mysore sugar factory is the only government-owned sugar mill in the state which has a total of 65 sugar factories. Therefore, I demand that the factory be kept in the state’s possession without being privatized,” said Siddaramaiah participating in the Dharani Satyagraha.Founded by Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar in the pre-independence era, the Mysugar Sugar Factory which been in profit for many years and has subsequently suffered losses. Siddaramaiah said that the government and not the farmers is responsible for the loss and the onus lies on the government to revive it.“So many state-owned factories and companies are now at a loss. The government must find out what causes the loss and revive them,” the former chief minister said.JD(S) MLA Annadani had in the state Parliament session asked the government about the Mysugar sugar factory. “I then intervened and urged the Speaker to allow at least half an hour of discussion as this was an important issue. At my insistence, the Chairperson allowed the debate in the session. I also brought to the notice of the government several factors and urged the factory to be retained by the government,” Sidaramaiah said.“At first, the government-appointed managing director had no interest in the factory. How about the factory getting back on track? When I was the chief minister, the factory had 145 crore funds to save factory.“The factory-owned property is located in many places, including Bangalore and Mysore. On the opposite side of Ravindra Kalakshetra, there is land belonging to the factory. The land can be developed and the proceeds from it can be used for the factory,” the JD(U) leader said.Slamming chief minister Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah asked that if private sugar factories in Mysore and Mandya could make profits why could not a government factory make a profit?“Doesn’t this have to be a commitment to the government? Yediyurappa is from Mandya district, I thought he would develop this factory. But in his time he began work on privatization,” Siddaramaiah said.“The Mandya people have an emotional connection with the Mysugar sugar factory. The farmer welfare forum is rallying and protesting in Mysore, and I have demanded that the government not privatize the factory for any reason,” he said.To our protest and demand, the government abandoned its decision to privatize the factory. Now the farmers are protesting to revive the factory and reopen it.“I am talking to Chief Minister Basavaraja Bommayi to provide the necessary grants for the revival of the factory. If they do not do this, we will start the factory again within a month of taking office once we come to power.I have my full support for the Farmers Welfare Forum. I hope that all of you struggle, starting the factory as soon as possible” said Siddaramaiah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/mysore-sugar-factory-must-remain-with-state-siddaramaiah-101633893540637.html
11-10-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka far from its daily vaccination target: Data||The Karnataka government has reiterated its goal to inoculate at least 70% of its over 70 million population with two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and around 90% with the first by the year end.However, data shows that Karnataka has seen sharp fluctuations in its vaccination drives, designed in a way that there are high on selective occasions and then a sharp dip almost as if doses are hoarded to make these events a success.Mansukh Mandaviya, the union minister for health, family welfare, chemicals and fertilizers on Sunday said that Karnataka was the highest among all other states in the country in its vaccination targets on September 17, the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“In the special drive undertaken on September 17, around 2.5 crore doses were administered. Karnataka had given the highest doses of vaccines and created a record,,” according to a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO), attributing the comment to Mandaviya.But data shows that since September 17, Karnataka’s vaccine coverage has seen a sharp dip barring just three days when it administered around one million doses.Karnataka has also seen a sharp fluctuation in its vaccine drives since September 17 when it administered a record 3.17 million doses in a single day as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday.Since then, the state has administered around one million doses just three times and sometimes as low as below 30,000.Data from Cowin portal shows that the state administered 3,177,382 doses on September 17. However, just a day later, it went down to 247,464 and down to 70,298 the following day, data shows.On October 3, the state administered just 29,390 doses, data from Cowin shows.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has maintained that the government would aim to inoculate five lakh doses per day since the beginning of September and that there was enough stock to do the same.“When we asked him (union health minister) for 1 crore doses, he said take 1.5 crore doses and administer five lakh per day. He gave us more supplies and even fixed a higher target for us,” Bommai said at an event on Sunday.But data shows that Karnataka has administered higher than five lakh doses only on four days in the last one month (since September 10).On September 17, the state administered 3,177,382 doses, 10,68,839 on September 221,098,478 on September 29 and 976,040 on October 8, according to data from Cowin portal.But the challenges are many in the state which is expecting the impact of the impending third wave of Covid-19 infections by the year end.The government has also made several concessions to celebrate festivals, opening of schools and other activities to bring back some normalcy in the state even as fears of a third wave looms large.Most of the high vaccination coverages are in large urban centres while people are sent back home without their shots, especially in rural areas where distance and transport have added to existing problems like growing hesitancy in districts like Yadgir, Raichur and Chamarajanagar among other places.To overcome hesitancy, the district administration of Chamarajanagar had also tried to implement a ‘no-vaccine, no-pension/ration’ order that came under heavy criticism and eventually pulled back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-far-from-its-daily-vaccination-targetdata-101633893481806.html
11-10-2021||Bangalore||Will look at finances before deciding on fuel duty cuts: Karnataka CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday said that the state government will soon take a decision on reducing the duty on petrol and diesel as prices of fossil fuels continue to rise across the country.“We will take a look at our financial position, revenues and then make a decision. Let us see,” Bommai said in Bengaluru on Sunday.The statements come at a time when prices of diesel are inching towards breaching the ₹100 mark and join petrol which is already above ₹105 in most parts of the state and country.There has been pressure by the political opposition in Karnataka and other places across the country, demanding that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre reduce the taxes on petrol and diesel to provide some relief to citizens who have been unable to cope with the price rise of essential commodities.There have been similar demands in other states of the country as well.Karnataka is also facing a shortage in coal which Bommai said that the union government is looking into and assured supply.Bommai said that there is a coal shortage globally and in India too.“We have met the mines and geology minister, Pralhad Joshi and placed our demands before him. We are getting 10 racks everyday and we asked if this can be raised to 14 to make things better,” Bommai said.The chief minister said that the state is also asking to fast-track its demand on supplies coming from Western Coal Fields in Maharashtra and Mahanadi Coalfields in Odisha.“They (union) have assured us that there will be no shortage of coal for Karnataka,” Bommai said.They have assured that there will be no shortage of coal for Karnataka.“Distinction between daily coal supplies & coal stock: Daily coal supplies from @CoalIndiaHQ & others are meeting coal requirement for generation of electricity. Coal supplies are recording an all-time high, thus stocks at power plants are set to increase in the coming days,” Joshi said in a post on Twitter.“We take pride that domestic coal supply has risen to substitute imported coal in the country. Furthering the vision of an #AatmanirbharBharat, domestic coal-based power generation has increased by 24% in the 1st half of this fiscal & imported coal supply has reduced by 30%,” he said in another post.“Thermal power plants have rolling stock being replenished with daily supply. Moreover, with the withdrawal of monsoons, coal despatches are set to rise in the coming days thereby increasing coal stocks. Reiterating, there is sufficient coal stock, do not fall for fear mongering,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-look-at-finances-before-deciding-on-fuel-duty-cuts-karnataka-cm-bommai-101633893480693.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Nothing smart about Sarabha Nagar of Ludhiana||At a time when the authorities are making tall claims regarding development projects being taken up under the Smart City Mission in Sarabha Nagar and its surrounding areas, residents in one of the posh areas of the city being developed under the mission are a harried lot due to “unplanned” development projects.With roads dug up for over eight months, erratic water supply in the area for the last two weeks and no proper cleanliness, the residents of Block-B of Sarabha Nagar rued that the mission had caused a plethora of problems rather than facilitating them.The residents said their area was selected under the area-based development (ABD)— one of the components of the Smart City Mission. The authorities made tall claims of development and assured a 24/7 water supply. The roads were dug up for laying supply lines, but the residents are now bearing the brunt of the apathy of the civic body officials and public representatives.Manmohan Singh, a local, said rather than providing a 24/7 water supply, the authorities had even failed to provide supply during regular hours. “Residents have been raising a hue and cry over the disruptions in the supply for months and the problem has turned severe in the last two weeks. We even struggle to get water for drinking and other purposes,” he said.The residents said the authorities had failed to resolve their problems despite repeated complaints to MC officials and councillor Amrit Varsha Rampal.Naini, another resident, said due to the pathetic condition of roads, they do not allow their children to play outside. Further, waterlogging had added to their woes during the rainy season. Due to the lack of cleanliness, there are also chances of mosquito breeding in the area.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson and a resident of the area, Ahbab Grewal said some of the residents were forced to get the areas outside their houses cemented on their own as the authorities failed to reconstruct roads. Though the work at parks in the area is incomplete, the authorities have completed the projects in their records. Similar problems are also being witnessed in other blocks of Sarabha Nagar.It was learnt that there is some problem with the tubewell or pump installed by the MC and the situation is getting worse. The authorities should at least streamline the water supply in the area. Due to the shortage of parking space in the Sarabha Nagar market and Malhar road, residents park their vehicles in residential areas resulting in congestion and nuisance, said Grewal.Councillor Amrit Varsha Rampal could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Pardeep Sabharwal, commissioner, MC, said water supply/sewer lines had to be installed in the ABD area and that had to be done in phases so that residents should not face any trouble. “All roads/streets can’t be dug up simultaneously. The work to install the lines will be completed in the coming time and roads will be repaired. I will direct the staff to temporarily repair the roads wherever required and the problem in the water supply line will also be checked,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nothing-smart-about-sarabha-nagar-of-ludhiana-101633893181517.html

But I believe no witness will be able to speak against them because of Teni’s terror in the area.

On the first day, it will primarily cover street vendors, drivers, shopkeepers and people near religious places, as per the plan of the district administration. Chief medical officer of Lucknow Dr Manoj Agrawal said every day the focus would be upon one segment such as on the first day, street vendors and drivers while the next day religious places. “Focused sampling is a proven method to bring out people who may not be aware that they are actually infected. Such cases can be super spreaders, but if tracked and treated can help in controlling spread of the Covid infection,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors. Every day, the health department targets to take samples of about 10,000 people under the focused sampling drive. On Monday, drivers of e-rickshaws, tempos, three-wheelers will be the target group for sampling.

Even people in the chief minister’s constituency are not happy with this government,” Hooda said, adding that the next programme will be carried out in deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s constituency after the Ellenabad byelection.“This government has failed to conduct any recruitment exam fairly and farmers are on the roads for the past 10 months. We had given two years to this government to fulfil the promises they made during polls but could not deliver,” he added.When asked about solution to end the impasse between the agitating farmers and the central government, Hooda said a guarantee to purchase all produce on the minimum support price (MSP) to farmers could be a first step to end this stalemate.Slamming the government for several conditions imposed on procurement, Hooda said over 8 lakh MT paddy has been procured but the government did not make payments to farmers yet and most paddy is yet to be procured and lifted.“I cannot speak like our chief minister and ask people to pick up sticks. I request people of Haryana to hit the BJP with their votes,” he added.Hooda said following state-wide protests, the BJP and JJP did not have a candidate for the Ellenabad byelection as they had to borrow a candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guaranteed-msp-can-help-to-end-the-impasse-hooda-101633892821313.html

However, there has been no load-shedding till now.“Kerala is already affected. Yesterday (Saturday) we received only 30% of our daily quota from Koondankulam. The issues related to coal from Australia and various environmental issues. We need to find a permanent solution. If the situation continues like this for a long period, then we will have to impose power cuts in the state,” the minister told reporters.He said the state was waiting for the response from the Union ministry and a decision on power cuts would be taken only after further discussions with stakeholders. An energy crisis is looming large over some states, including Delhi and Punjab, due to a combination of factors such as excess rainfall hitting coal movement and imported coal-based power plants generating less than half of their capacity due to record high rates.A senior official of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) said that there would be repercussions in the state but that does not mean that it would resort to load- shedding right away.“Currently, it’s manageable. Due to rains these days, the power consumption during the peak hour has come down. At present, we are experiencing a shortage of around 15%. If it goes beyond 20%, then we will have to think about load-shedding.” The official said that during peak hours, the consumption in the state ranges from 2800-3800 MW. “We are experiencing a shortage of 120 MW to 900 MW on certain days. Today, the estimated shortage is around 200 MW,” the official said.Earlier in the day, Krishnankutty said he was in favour of hydel power projects and that Kerala has a huge potential. He said 3,000 TMC of water is available, of which 1,700 TMC can be used for electricity generation.“But we are not using the same. We need to provide cheap electricity for industries in order to attract investment. Currently, from Idukki, we are generating electricity at a cost of 0.51 paise per unit. However, yesterday during the peak hour we had to purchase for ₹18 per unit,” the minister said.The KSEB has asked the customers to self-regulate the usage of electricity during the peak hours. The average daily power consumption in the state has been hovering around 72 million units (mu) out of which net power imports account for approximately 45 mu. In a year when the country produced record coal, rains hit movement of the fuel from mines to power generation units, impacting power generation in many states such as Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Tamil Nadu.While power producers and distributors have warned of blackouts as generation units are running coal as low as two days, the Coal Ministry said the country has adequate coal stocks and low inventory doesn’t mean generation would stop as stock is being continuously replenished.Power plants that usually rely on imports are now heavily dependent on Indian coal, thus adding further pressure to already stretched domestic supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/loadshedding-if-shortage-of-power-from-central-pool-continues-kerala-minister-101633892700288.html

DAP is the much-preferred fertiliser for mustard and wheat as it contains nitrogen and phosphorus which are the primary nutrients for crops. Farmers are all set to grow mustard from next two to three days but they have apprehensions over the shortage of DAP. The government should ensure that at least mustard growers can get fertiliser,” he added.Satywan Singh, a farmer from Loharu constituency, represented by Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, said he has prepared 20 acre land to grow mustard, which is a profit-oriented crop.“I got just five sacks and need 15 more bags of DAP. Dealers told me that other farmers have already paid in advance for the fertiliser. After a good spell of rainfall this month, most farmers want to go for early sowing,” he added.Bharatiya Kisan Union youth state president Ravi Azad said the government should ensure proper supply of DAP for mustard crop, otherwise they will be forced to launch a stir against the government.“Farmers in the agriculture minister’s constituency are struggling to get DAP. At a time when farmers should have been equipped with adequate stocks of fertilisers, many parts of the state are reporting a severe shortage,” he added.Two fertiliser retailers, pleading anonymity, said they did not get the DAP for the last two days.“We have been getting phone calls from farmers. We are likely to get 800 bags on Monday but that is not enough to fulfil farmers’ requirements,” they added.Bhiwani deputy director (agriculture) Aatma Ram Godara said they have 4,500 MT stock of DAP and have asked the dealer to give only five bags to each farmer in a day for mustard cultivation.“If wheat growers start procuring DAP, then there will be a shortage of fertiliser. Mustard sowing is round the corner so, we have decided to give DAP to mustard farmers only. I have appraised agriculture minister JP Dalal of the situation and he assured that there will be no shortage of DAP. We are cooperating with big land-holding farmers as well,” the DDA added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-struggling-to-get-dap-in-bhiwani-other-parts-of-haryana-101633892583695.html

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) has always worked to understand the problem.“In addition to implementing comprehensive mental health schemes, the LDF government has successfully implemented a number of schemes to ensure the welfare of the common man, including social welfare pensions, food kits, life scheme, distribution of leases, renovation of public schools and expansion of government hospitals,” he said.State health minister Veena George said that mental health literacy was essential as everyone pays attention to physical ailments and seek timely treatment for it, but most people are not able to diagnose mental health problems or seek scientific treatment. Most people do not have an accurate understanding of mental health, she said at a seminar organised by the department of psychiatry of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, Kerala Chapter of Indian Psychiatric Society and Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad on the occasion of the World Mental Health Day.“About 12.8 per cent of the total population in Kerala has mental health problems that require scientific treatment. But only 15 percent of these people seek scientific treatment,” she said in a release.This is not because of a lack of treatment centres or medical facilities, but it is due to the fact that people are not availing the same she said and added that it was imperative that activities to spread awareness about mental health be intensified.Giving details of the state government’s plans to deal with the issue, the minister said that the health department was going to intensify mental health activities from the primary health level onwards.At the same time, the activities of mental health centers and mental health departments in medical colleges will be strengthened and research on the issue would be given priority, she said in the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ldf-govt-implements-schemes-to-tackle-mental-illness-kerala-cm-101633892580421.html

The decision was taken during a first-of-its-kind meeting of various RWA apex bodies, including Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC), Chandigarh Housing Board Resident Welfare Federation (CHBRWF) and Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), organised by CFORWO on Sunday.“We plan to survey around 2,500 people to identify best performing councillors in the city. On the basis of the results, we will form a team of eight best candidates each from BJP, AAP and Congress besides 11 from various RWAs to fight the MC elections,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, CFORWO. There will be 35 seats in the next MC House, which will go to the polls on December.All RWA bodies present at the meeting expressed their dissatisfaction with the present MC House. Voice of Housing Societies convener MN Shukla said their association already plans to field two candidates from the two wards that cover Sectors 48, 49, 50, 51 and 63.FOSWAC chief spokesperson Pankaj Gupta said that all candidates must be educated, honest and accessible to the citizens. CHBRWF president Nirmal Dutt asked all RWAs to play an active role as campaigners rather than petitioners ahead of the elections. CRAWFED patron Major DP Singh urged all RWA bodies to stay politically neutral and united and not to let political parties use them for their benefit.Dyal Krishan, president of Dadumajra Joint Action Committee, also spoke about “parachute councillors”, who represent Dadumajra in the MC House despite living somewhere else. “I will ask the area residents to vote for NOTA if the parties don’t field a Dadumajra resident as a candidate from our ward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-rwa-apex-body-to-field-11-candidates-101633892044924.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Centre cuts UT’s power allocation by 16%||Amid coal shortage that has hit thermal plants across India, the Centre has reduced Chandigarh’s daily power allocation from 300 MW to 250 MW. Even as the UT administration on Sunday maintained that there was no power shortage, officials added that the next two days will be crucial in assessing the demand and supply situation.“We don’t intend to impose any cuts. We have adequate supply arrangements. I will review the power situation on Monday,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.Chandigarh receives power from the central generating stations, state generating stations and independent power producer’s through long-term power purchase agreements and short-term purchases (through exchange, bilateral purchases, etc).The city’s current peak demand is hovering around 250 MW. On Saturday (October 9), the peak demand stood at 247 MW around 7 pm. During off-peak period (around 3 pm), the demand was 173 MW. No shortages were reported. “The peak demand is only reflective of the maximum demand at a point in a day, which subsides within minutes. So, the average demand is much lower than the peak demand. Even after the cut (from 300 MW to 250 MW), we are managing the power supply situation with no requirement of cuts,” said UT chief engineer CB Ojha.Only 12% power from coal-based plantsOjha said the UT electricity department has not imposed any power cut, even as some states have resorted to it due to shortage of fuel to run their coal-based plants.“Most of the power allocated to Chandigarh is hydro-based, and only 12% comes from coal-based electricity producers. So, there are minimal chances of the city getting adversely affected. But increased pressure on the central grid due to rising demand from other states can lead to supply constraints in Chandigarh too,” said a UT official, who didn’t want to be named. The department officials also contended that the Centre’s cut in the city’s power allocation could be related to the change in seasonal demand. “The allocation is increased during the summer, and in other seasons it is reduced. As the winter approaches, the allocation has been cut by the Centre. During the summer, the peak demand consistently crosses 400 MW. However, it has halved now,” said the official. The peak demand had touched 426 MW in July this year. Admn open to buying power beyond allocationThe administration, to avoid any cuts, is also open to buying higher priced electricity beyond its allocation. “It should not be required, but is still an option. These things will be reviewed on Monday,” said the adviser.Ojha said that at present, there is no requirement for purchasing additional power. “We are meeting the demand within the present allocation. The demand, in fact, plummets in the night during this time of the year. It’s only in the middle of the day, particularly working days, when it touches the peak,” he said.Generally, the cost per unit can more than double if there are supply shortages. “If the UT has to buy power beyond its allocation, the department’s spending will increase, which could reflect on the consumer power rates too,” said another official.No scheduled cuts in Mohali, Panchkula tooThere are no scheduled power cuts planned in the neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula districts too. Even as other districts in Punjab are reeling under power cuts, the authorities in Mohali say they have enough power for all industrial, commercial and domestic users. There are around 19 grid substations in the district, which get their power supply from the Rajpura and Ropar thermal plants besides the Ganguwal hydroelectric project. The average power demand in Mohali is 420 MW, while the supply stands at 560 MW. PSPCL superintending engineer Mohit Sood said: “As of now, there are no scheduled power cuts in Mohali, but we are urging the consumers to use power judiciously in the wake of the coal shortage.” Sanjay Kumar, subdivisional officer, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, Panchkula, said: “As of now, there is the least possibility of power cuts in Panchkula. If in case, any possibility arises, it will be publicised in advance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-centre-cuts-ut-s-power-allocation-by-16-101633892043379.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Petrol price breaches ₹100 mark in Chandigarh||The spiralling fuel prices have hit yet another milestone in the tricity with petrol crossing the ₹100 per litre mark in Chandigarh.While petrol was priced at ₹100.24 per litre on Sunday, even diesel rates were at an all-time high of ₹92.55 per litre. The prices have gone up by nearly 25% since the beginning of the year, as petrol was available for ₹81.08 while diesel cost ₹74.14 in the first week of January. According to PTI, petrol is priced above ₹100 across all state capitals except Ranchi.However, across the tricity, fuel still remains cheapest in Chandigarh. Petrol had already crossed the ₹100 mark in Mohali on June 26, while Panchkula reached the milestone on October 5. On Sunday, petrol cost ₹106.28 per litre in Mohali while diesel was available for ₹95.95. In Panchkula, the prices were ₹101.59 and ₹93.34, respectively.Fuel prices have been on the rise since January, though they stabilised between July and September. For the past six days, petrol price had been rising by ₹0.30 per litre daily and diesel price had been seeing a spike of ₹0.35. “This hike is tied to the rise in prices of crude oil in the global market. However, when the price of crude oil falls globally, the price of petrol doesn’t fall proportionately and it’s only symbolic,” said Chandigarh Petroleum Dealers Association president Arjan Singh.Singh said that a decade back the price of crude oil had gone up to $140 per barrel while petrol cost around ₹75 per litre in the city. “The price of crude oil is lower now (around $80), but the retail prices are inflated in comparison,” he said. Various dealers also rued the fact that they need more capital to keep their petrol pumps running and their operational costs have gone up by over 50% after the recent hike.The impact of the hike is likely to be seen on the prices of fruit, vegetable, groceries and other daily essentials in the coming days, according to local transporters.The Congress also protested the spiralling fuel prices on Sunday. Taking a dig at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Chandigarh Congress spokesperson Harmail Kesri said: “Where are all those BJP leaders today, who used to protest on bicycles and horse carts when the price of petrol increased from ₹70 to ₹71 during the Congress regime?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-price-breaches-100-mark-in-chandigarh-101633892040439.html

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Audit report flags irregularities, violation of rules by NIT Kurukshetra||An annual audit report has highlighted irregularities and contraventions of rules by the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Kurukshetra.In the audit conducted by the CAG’s audit party under assistant audit officer Vinod Prakash and supervised by director general of audit (central) Chandigarh Munish Kumar Leekha from July 5 to July 16, irregularities in the establishment of Siemens Centre of Excellence (SCoE) of ₹188.62 crore, contraventions of prescribed rules and indiscretion in the grant of extension to the agencies, procurement of goods and services besides irregularities in the grant of Grade Pay and maintaining service record of 23 officials were detected.NIT Kurukshetra was granted approval by the finance committee to establish the Centre of Excellence (CoE) and placed the project order with Siemens Industries Software India Private Limited for a total project cost of ₹188.85 crore. Of this, the share of NIT was ₹20.71 crore plus 18% GST, while the rest of the project cost, the grant-in-kind, was to be provided by the Siemens as per global academic programme.But during the audit, it was noticed that the MHRD, in a letter on February 6, 2019, conveyed approval for setting up of SCoE at NIT Kurukshetra as per the CoE guidelines approved by the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD).According to the report, the institute placed a purchase order for setting up of SCoE and the institute executed a tripartite agreement with the agencies on March 22, 2019.The check depicted that the agency released payment of ₹21.95 crore up to March, 2021 and the payment was made from the Corpus fund by diverting funds available towards procurement of services instead of seeking regular grants from the ministry concerned, which is irregular, asserted the report, further seeking justification on the proposal of setting up the CoE leading to allotment of purchase SIS India being a single-service provider without providing opportunity to other service providers, in contradiction of Rule 149 of the General Finance Rules (GFR), 2017.The report also revealed irregularities in the ₹13.77 crore grant of extension to three private agencies in violation of Rule 198 of the GFR, 2017. It was noticed that the institute deployed highly skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled manpower through different agencies on account of housekeeping, farmhouse, with the same terms and conditions from the existing agencies and fresh tenders were not called timely in contravention of the Contract Labour Act, 1970, Workman’s Compensation Act, EPF, ESI and MP Acts.It also flagged serious violation of Rule 149 GFR, 2017 in procurement of various components worth ₹33.06 crore for 2020-21. The report mentioned that procurement of only ₹66.42 lakh was made from government e-marketplace and 98% procurement for ₹32.39 crore was made from open market in contravention of Rule 155 of GFR, 2017.Similar violations were reported in procurement of library books amounting to ₹3.39 crore and irregular purchase of sports articles of ₹16.60 lakh by calling e-tendering instead of procuring articles on GeM as prescribed under Rule 149 of the GFR, 2017.It also mentioned non-conducting of physical verification of furniture, equipment, store and stock besides irregularities in maintaining service records of 23 staff members.However, the report mentioned that all minor irregularities and points noticed during the course of audit were discussed and settled on the spot but it also mentioned that on being pointed out the institute did not submit any reply over the irregularities highlighted in the previous reports since 2010-11.The non-conducting of physical verification of furniture, equipment, store and stock and irregularities in grant of grade pay and maintaining of service record of 23 staff members were also highlighted.Reacting to the irregularities in the audit report, NIT Kurukshetra officiating director Prof Akhilesh Swarup said, “These things are routine and it is an official process. The auditors come from different backgrounds and something of technical nature they do not understand properly. Also, they do not interact with the people concerned but do their part of duty and then the people concerned respond to it.”“But the NIT is a public institution and is responsible for putting its audit and annual finance report in the Parliament every year and all things are scrutinised again,” he said.“Even if irregularities happen, the MHRD has a mechanism to check it as it is public money. There are many checks and balances. The NIT is answerable to everything and will definitely submit its report to the authorities when required,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/audit-report-flags-irregularities-violation-of-rules-by-nit-kurukshetra-101633891501957.html

11-10-2021||Delhi||Public works department to begin repairs on GT Road in east Delhi||New Delhi: The Public Works Department (PWD) of the Delhi government will launch a road improvement project on the busy GT Road in east Delhi, officials aware of the development said. The project, which is estimated to cost ₹6.87 crore, will be taken up between the Shahdara flyover and the Seelampur flyover. A senior PWD official said that tenders have been called for the road improvement project.“The tenders have been called for carrying out the re carpeting work on GT Road. The bids will be finalised in next 20-25 days. We are trying to expedite the project in the view of winters when a ban on construction activity may come up due to high air pollution,” the official said asking not to be named.The GT Road stretch in East Delhi connects UP (Apsara Border) and Inter-State Bus Terminus, Kashmere Gate. Recently, the Delhi government inaugurated the one-way Seelampur flyover on the road. A flyover on the other carriageway existed already. The PWD official said since the vehicular density on GT Road is high, the work will be carried out in phases. “We will take up work on only one carriageway at one time. The traffic police are being consulted to finalise a traffic plan,” official said. The project will also include redevelopment of the service lanes, and is expected to take 90 days to complete. The agency has also expedited the other maintenance work before winter sets in that includes Sri Aurbindo Marg between IIT flyover and PTS signal intersection, near Malviya Nagar; on Mathura Road near Jasola Apollo flyover and the Savitri Cinema Road. “There is a depressed damaged portion of road near the Jasola flyover which also witnesses frequent waterlogging. The level of this depressed portion will also be raised during the repair work,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/public-works-department-to-begin-repairs-on-gt-road-in-east-delhi-101633891145873.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ghaggar pollution: Seasonal rivulets still being polluted, admits Chandigarh admn||Failing to act on the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the UT administration is yet to plug all the discharge points that release polluted water into the three seasonal rivulets passing through the city.In a report submitted before the environment standing committee of the administrator’s advisory council, UT stated that all the three seasonal rivulets still had discharge points, which continued to pollute them.“On the N-choe, the administration identified a discharge point in Faidan village. There is a discharge point on Sukhna choe at Dhaka Colony near Raipur Khurd. Similarly, on the Patiala ki Rao, there are multiple discharge points in Sarangpur, Khuda Lahora and Khuda Jassu,” reads the report.The report further states that all other discharge points on the choes have been closed.In a bid to stop pollutants from entering the Ghaggar river, the NGT had directed the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) to stop the sewage being discharged into the seasonal rivulets. Polluted water from Sukhna choe and N-choe merge into the river near Zirakpur, which ultimately pollutes the river too.Notably, the NGT had even warned the administration of imposing financial environmental costs on it if it failed to plug all the discharge points. It had also directed the Central Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) to make a fresh survey of such points. After the survey it was discovered that discharges were still being allowed in the rivulets.UT adviser Dharam Pal, too, in September had also directed the MC and the UT environment department to come up with a definitive plan to stop discharge of sewage in the rivulets.Monitoring stations for real-time assessment of water pollutionMeanwhile, the UT administration has installed real-time water quality monitoring stations at N-choe and Sukhna choe. A UT official said that the development comes on the directions of the National Green Tribunal.The system monitors the pH value, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of water. The administration can live-track the pollution levels in the seasonal rivulet from the monitoring station.Debendra Dalai, director, environment, said, “The MC is preparing a plan to stop the seepage, which is mainly concentrated in unauthorised colonies. We and the MC are keeping an eye on these discharge points. On spotting such points, they are immediately closed. But with no sewerage pipelines in these colonies, these keep cropping up. Now MC is considering, as a short-term solution, to deploy sewage collection trucks in these colonies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ghaggar-pollution-seasonal-rivulets-still-being-polluted-admits-chandigarh-admn-101633891021484.html
11-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Illegal weapons’ suppliers take to social media to hunt for potential buyers||Police claim to have busted an illegal weapons’ smuggling module with the arrest of three persons recently, but their aides continue to hunt for potential buyers through social media.The suppliers had recently posted multiple pictures of illegal weapons on a Facebook group named ‘Ludhiana Wale’ and had invited residents to place orders for weapons. They had even mentioned a mobile number in the post, where residents could reach the sellers. Interestingly, some residents even posted queries regarding the rates of weapons. The sellers were offering a range of weapons starting from the ‘Desi Katta’ to sophisticated pistols priced between ₹2,000 to ₹1 lakh. The accused also offered to provide home delivery of the weapons but sought full payment in advance. According to police officials, the weapons are produced illegally in Madhya Pradesh and then supplied to different cities. The accused used to find potential buyers, including gangsters, through social networking sites. They used to keep tabs on Facebook users who frequently commented on the posts made by gangsters, so as to influence them. A senior police official said, “We tracked some accounts selling weapons on social networking sites but found them to be fake. We also tried to trace the users through their phone numbers, but to no avail as the mobile numbers were procured using fake identity proofs.” On October 4, the CIA Staff-1 had arrested Harinderpal of Lallian Khurd village of Jalandhar, Balwinder Singh of Badhala village of Jalandhar and Arjan Kumar of Rajasthan for supplying illegal weapons. Police had recovered two pistols of .32 bore, four live cartridges, two magazines and three mobiles from their possession. The accused had come to the city to deliver the weapons. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, investigation) Simratpal Singh Dhindsa said more arrests can be expected in the case. Weapons quest September 21: The Marado police arrested two persons with an illegal pistol and bullets following a chase near Duburji cut. Their two accomplices managed to escape. According to the police, the accused had indulged in a scuffle with another group in Bilga village and had bought the weapon from Madhya Pradesh with the intention of harming their rivals. September 3: Police recovered a weapon and six bullets from a man found roaming around the venue where Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president and former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal was holding a rally. The accused had confessed that he had bought the weapon from Madhya Pradesh. July 19: Delhi police arrested Karanbir Singh alias Karan Walia along with his accomplice Sarabjot Singh alias Raja and recovered 13 illegal pistols from their possession.

11-10-2021||Delhi||4th waste to energy plant in Delhi to be ready by August next year||The waste to energy plant at south Delhi’s Tehkhand will become operational by August next year, South Delhi Municipal Corporation officials said, adding that a crucial piece of hardware for the plant is expected to arrive by month-end. Officials aware of the matter said boilers being imported from China were expected to come by March this year, but faced repeated delays. However, the boilers are now reach the port in Kerala by month-end, from where they will take nearly 40 more days to reach Delhi by road, the officials said. This will be SDMC’s second waste to energy plant which will process 2,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day. The facility will be spread over 15 acres near Tehkhand. “With the second plant being operationalised next year, we will be able to process 100% of municipal waste generated in the SDMC areas. Currently, only 53% of waste is being processed while the rest ends up at the Okhla landfill,” an official said asking not to be named. The areas under SDMC generate a total of 3,600 tonnes of municipal waste every day.Currently, Delhi has three waste to energy plants in Ghazipur, Narela and Okhla. The three existing plants have an aggregate capacity to process 5,250 tonnes of waste to generate 52MW power. Delhi generates more than 11,144 tonnes of waste. In 2019, the north corporation proposed to build a second plant with 1,500 TPD (tonnes per day) capacity near Bhalswa and EDMC plans to build its second such facility in Ghonda Gujran. “In a few years, the new engineered landfill sites will receive only the ash and burnt leftover from the waste to energy plant and certain components of waste which cant be incinerated. The Okhla and Tehkhand plant will together generate 400-500 tonnes of such waste which will then be dumped at the new engineered landfill site,” official explained. The general trend in Delhi is now towards using incineration as primary method of waste processing. However, the waste to energy plants have faced stiff resistance by local residents who have flagged pollution generated by such plants. Experts have repeatedly pointed out that Delhi should focus on segregation of household waste instead of setting up waste to energy plants. Defending the move to set up the waste to energy plants, a senior SDMC official said that the waste management models of smaller cities cannot be easily replicated in a city with a population of more than 200 million people. “Existing landfills are saturated. People have been resisting the setting up of new landfill sites in their regions while the household waste segregation levels still remain relatively low. The waste to energy plants generate electricity for the city while also providing a solution for the waste disposal problem,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/4th-waste-to-energy-plant-in-delhi-to-be-ready-by-august-next-year-101633890901794.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to enhance greenery on roads to curb dust pollution||New DelhiThe Delhi government has decided to enhance greenery on its roads and flyovers with the help of shrubs, hedges, creepers and a variety of flowering plants to curb dust pollution, government officials aware of the matter said on Sunday.According to senior officials of the Public Works Department (PWD), central and side verges of roads and flyovers and walls of overbridges will be spruced up with seasonal flowering plants and shrubs on a number of road stretches and flyovers. “There are many flyovers and roads where greenery is less which results in dust. We have identified such stretches to enhance greenery there and beautify these streets. Some of these stretches include the Ring Road, Chirag Delhi flyover, IIT flyover etc. In the mega drive, we will use decorative and seasonal flowering plants, shrubs, hedges for roads and flyovers,” a senior PWD official said.He said tenders have been floated for the procurement of plant saplings, shrubs and hedges. The official said that the main aim of the project is to cut down dust pollution.Dust on roads and from major construction projects in the city is one of the major contributors of suspended particulate matter – one of the primary pollutants in the city air --- in Delhi. The move comes after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last month directed PWD officials to improve greenery to reduce dust pollution in the city. According to PWD officials privy to the development, tenders have been issued for improving greenery and beautification of a number of flyovers. These include IIT flyover, Munirka flyover, Africa Avenue flyover, Chirag Delhi flyover and Panchsheel flyover.Officials said that greenery beneath these flyovers will be improved and road footpaths will also be made free of encroachment. The officials said that at least 42,000 plants saplings, hedges and shrubs will be used to beautify roads and flyovers in PWD’s south sub-division. Bio-decomposer spray from todayDelhi environment minister Gopal Rai will start free spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer from Fatehpur Jat village in northwest Delhi from Monday, the government said.The microbial solution, which can turn stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days, will be sprayed over 4,000 acres of harvested rice fields in Delhi, an official said.A total of 844 farmers in the national capital have applied for free spraying of the solution this year, Rai said. Last year, 310 farmers used it on 1,935 acres of land.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 24 launched the Pusa bio-decomposer formula at Kharkhari Nahar village in southwest Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-enhance-greenery-on-roads-to-curb-dust-pollution-101633890900511.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Man arrested for setting Okhla factory on fire||A 26-year-old man was arrested for allegedly setting fire to a thread factory in south east Delhi’s Okhla area on Sunday. Although no one was injured in the mishap as people rushed out of the factory on time, goods worth ₹5 lakh were gutted in the fire, said police. One of the locals in the area said the fire began around 4am and 31 tenders had to be rushed to the spot, who brought the fire under control by 7am. Police said a team was rushed to the factory as soon as they received information about the fire. A truck and an autorickshaw were also set on fire. Police registered a case under relevant sections at the Okhla police station. During investigation, police scanned the CCTV footage of the cameras installed in the vicinity of the factory, which showed two men roaming around in the premises of the factory. Police apprehended one of the two men, identified as Gulfam, a resident of Okhla Phase-2. During interrogation, it was ascertained that he was present with his associate near the factory and both of them were drunk. Police said while the two suspects were there, a man drove up to them and called up his friend, who reached the factory premises and offered money to the suspects for setting fire to the factory. Gulfam’s friend brokered the deal . He told Gulfam that in one or two days, he will get the money and will give Gulfam his share. Since he was in an inebriated state, Gulfam listened to the man and set the factory on fire using petrol. Gulfam told police that they did not get any payment. Police said further investigation is underway to nab the other accused persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-arrested-for-setting-okhla-factory-on-fire-101633890840238.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Durga Puja organisers told to manage idol immersion||Durga Puja organisers in the city will have to make adequate arrangements to immerse idols at or near the venues, and the government will not make provisions such as artificial ponds unlike previous years, said senior officials in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). The Yamuna river remains out of bounds for idol immersion under guidelines issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). As a result, in 2019 and 2020, the Delhi government put in place artificial ponds across the city for Durga Puja organisers to immerse their idols — around 30 in 2018 and 105 in 2019. The DDMA disallowed Durga Puja celebrations in 2020, over Covid-19 fears.Under the current protocol, all organisers have to seek permission from offices of the sub-divisional officers concerned, following which an assessment of the venue and arrangements is done. “The arrangements have to be somewhere very close, because idol immersion otherwise leads to rallies and processions, which are not allowed this year in the light of the Covid-19 threat,” said a senior DDMA official on Sunday.In usual years, Delhi witnesses around 500-600 Durga Puja pandals. The number, this year, has dropped to around 300, said a senior official in the government’s revenue department.DDMA last week allowed Durga Puja celebrations this year, but with several riders — organisers will have to ensure venues do not have visitors beyond the seating capacity, and there can be no stalls of any kind. Organisers are reeling from immense fund shortfalls borne out of the pandemic, and have struggled to find sponsorships, forcing several to dip into their reserves. However, DDMA’s idol immersion norms are likely to have little impact, several puja committees said, because of the low-key nature of festivities this year.Swapan Ganguly, convener of the Kalibari temple in New Delhi’s Mandir Marg, which organises one of the most prominent Durga Puja celebrations in the city, said: “We have arrangements to immerse the idol inside the temple premises itself. All steps necessary will be taken to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed.”Several prominent organisers in the city have decided to go low-key with no idols at all this year.“In our case, immersion will not be a problem because we will not have a large idol this year. We did not get adequate time to make arrangements. We will follow all rituals with a kalash (earthen urn),” said Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate.The Durga Puja in CR Park’s D Block have will have a decorated pandal and idol. “We have created a pond in the neighbourhood, and will immerse idols there. There will be no rally or procession,” said Sujoy Ghosh, secretary of the block’s Durga Puja committee.“DDMA allowed festivals very late this year. As a result, there was not much time for idol and other arrangements. But organisers who plan to have idols have been clearly told to have arrangements in place for immersion. The protocols are understandable in light of the pandemic,” said Narayan Dey, secretary of the Mela Ground Durga Puja in CR Park.Durga Puja this year will be celebrated between October 11 and 15. DDMA has allowed organisers to set up pandal and celebrate on public spaces, but it has prohibited processions, rallies, and shops, eateries, exhibitions and fairs in and around the venues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-durga-puja-organisers-told-to-manage-idol-immersion-101633890420417.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police constable shoots brother-in-law after argument over dues||A Delhi Police constable posted at Greater Kailash killed his brother-in-law, who was posted as a sub-inspector in the Haryana Police, after they had a heated argument over some monetary issue in south west Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave.Police identified the accused as Vikram Singh. His brother-in-law Virender Nandal (36), a resident of Rohtak in Haryana, was staying with him for almost a week. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma said that they received a PCR call around 8am on Sunday and were informed that a person has incurred gunshot injury in Krishna Nagar area of Safdarjung Enclave. “When the team reached the spot, Virender was found with a bullet injury on his head. He was dead by that time,” said the DCP.Acording to police, Virender was staying at Singh’s house for the last six days due to some work. Police said Singh had borrowed some money from Virender, who was pressurising him to return it. “Singh and Virender had some dispute over the money transaction. Their fight took an ugly turn when Virender abused Singh. Since Singh was already under a lot of mental pressure, he pulled out his service revolver and shot Virender on his head,” said another police official.Soon after Singh killed Virender, he went to his wife, who was in the other room, and told her that he killed her brother. She immediately raised an alarm and made a PCR call informing police about the incident. “We nabbed Singh from the house, and seized the service revolver from him. We have registered a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC and are investigating into the matter,” said another official. The post-mortem of the deceased will be conducted at the Safdarjung hospital, police said.During interrogation, Singh told police that his anger towards Virender started increasing as the latter used to abuse him and his family regularly. Singh said he could tolerate everything that was told to him but not to his family members. Singh said that the same happened on Sunday morning just before the argument flared up and he shot Virender in a fit of rage. According to police , many arguments broke out between Singh and Virender in the last one week. Singh told Virender several times that he would sell off his property and return his money but Virender refused to budge. Police said they are probing all angles—if Virender was shot right after the argument or was he sleeping at the time of the incident. A senior police officer said that in February this year, Vikram alone managed to save four members of a family who were trapped in a house that caught fire in the Greater Kailash area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-constable-shoots-brother-in-law-after-argument-over-dues-101633890060189.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||‘Marks jihad’: Kerala sends letter to Centre deploring DU Prof||Kerala higher education minister R Bindu on Sunday wrote to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan seeking action against Delhi University professor Rakesh Kumar Pandey who kicked up a row last week by coining a communally sensitive and derogatory term -- “marks jihad” -- to contend that students from the southern state were being given higher marks in Class 12 so that they could systematically take over the country’s top higher education institutes.In the letter, Bindu said his words cast unnecessary aspersions on the state, and that they were in bad taste intended to create a communal rift.“The derogatory statement was an intentional move to create division among Keralites. His antipathy and intolerance were quite evident in his venomous words,” the minister said in her letter, and sought strict action against the teacher. Many teachers, student outfits and writers have deplored his post.After Pandey’s comments went viral on social media, the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) on Wednesday alleged that top scorers from the Kerala state board were being denied admission on flimsy grounds by various Delhi University colleges.The Delhi University on Thursday said that the university equally values the academic credentials of all students. “The University of Delhi strongly refutes and condemns the falsity of news which is being circulated regarding favouring candidates from a few boards,” DU Registrar Vikas Gupta said in a statement on Thursday.Pandey is a member of RSS-backed National Democratic Teachers Front (NDTF). In a statement last week, the NDTF distanced itself from Pandey’s comments. “NDTF has nothing to do with views expressed by any individual on any state secondary board. NDTF unambiguously dissociates itself from any objectionable statement,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/marks-jihad-kerala-sends-letter-to-centre-deploring-du-prof-101633889640364.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Cycling infra in Delhi gets upgrade, but experts say some way still go||New Delhi: Cyclists in the Capital can look forward to better infrastructure and more ride-sharing options in the near future as the administration has adopted a slew of measures to promote this green transport, said officials aware of the developments.Two new cycle-sharing projects will be up and running by early next year that will connect residential neighbourhoods with commercial centres and important transit points. The Delhi government is also adding more cycle tracks as part of its project to redesign 540km of city roads, while the Delhi Development Authority is constructing a 16-km dedicated cycling corridor in Dwarka, which will connect sectors 3, 5, 11, 12, 13 and 14.New projectsIn Dwarka, DDA plans to provide 5,000 bicycles and 250 docking stations around markets, metro stations, residential neighbourhoods, etc. The project has been awarded to Yulu, a tech-based shared mobility startup with headquarters in Bangalore and presence in five Indian cities.A senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “We hope to start the project by March. We have planned for the service throughout Dwarka.”Amit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Yulu, said, “We plan to introduce pedal cycles in the first phase of the project and later on introduce other vehicle formats, if we get permission from the authorities.”The South Delhi Municipal Corporation is also doing something similar. It has already floated tenders to set up 82 e-bike stations in several south Delhi areas like AIIMS, IIT-Delhi, Gargi College, Qutub Minar, Hauz Khas, Green Park, etc. But unlike DDA, SDMC will provide the service in seven clusters or areas in a 3-5km radius of residential colonies.Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner (remunerative project cell), SDMC, said, “To provide last-mile connectivity, 82 e-bike stations will be set up in residential colonies, markets, metro stations, etc.”The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) is also planning to scale up its cycle sharing project, which was launched in 2018 with 250 bikes.Satish Upadhyay, vice-chairman, NDMC, said, “During the pandemic we saw so many people cycle to city roads. To encourage people to cycle, we will develop dedicated cycling corridors in Nehru Park (3km) and a 10-km corridor between New Moti Bagh and North Block. We are exploring ways to promote cycling in our area, especially during holidays.”Kunal Kumar, joint secretary and mission director (Smart Cities Mission), ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), said that cities have to make efforts to move people to sustainable modes of transportation. “People want to cycle, but safety and lack of infrastructure are their top concerns. In several cities which started the cycle sharing system before the pandemic, its usage has increased post-Covid.”More cycle sharing options neededDelhi is among the first few Indian cities to introduce a cycle-sharing system. In October 2009, the Delhi government introduced the first cycle feeder and rental system along the BRT (bus rapid transit) corridor with 50 bicycles and five stations. But the project, which was implemented by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System, didn’t get a good response.Experts say that for cycle sharing to be successful, it should be implemented on a large scale.Anuj Malhotra, mobility expert and knowledge partner to the high-powered committee of the ministry of home affairs, said if cycle stations are too far away, then the system is bound to fail.“A minimum of 10-20 sq km of area with stations at every 250m is essential for a cycle-sharing system to be successful. A good density of stations is essential. There should be at least 10-15 stations per sq km. Also, implementing pilot projects in small areas or developing small stretches doesn’t work,” said Malhotra.Various government agencies have developed cycling infrastructure in the past, like during the 2010 Commonwealth Games, it’s not well connected.“There is a need to interconnect the missing links. If we do this, then 50-60% of the area in Delhi will have a good cycling infrastructure in the next few years,” said Malhotra.Cities such as London, Paris, New York, Hangzhou, Amsterdam, etc., have invested heavily in cycling infrastructure. For instance, Paris has 1,400 docking points with 20,000 bicycles. Similarly, London has 750 docking stations with close to 12,000 bikes. All these cities have developed hundreds of dedicated lanes for cycling.Amit Bhatt, executive director at World Resources Institute, India, said, “Just providing a few cycles and docking stations is not enough. It is important to flood the area (where the project is implemented) with cycles so that it is easily accessible to people. Cycling is popular in top global cities as they have invested in developing safe infrastructure for cyclists and also provide a large number of cycles. Cities in China have 50,000 and more cycles.”In India, too, people will start cycling short distances if a well-planned system is in place, said Bhatt.Shreya Gadepalli, managing trustee at Urban Works Institute, said getting the private operators to do everything isn’t working. “For cycle sharing to succeed, the operator should be paid by the government for service quality—like cycle quality and availability—rather than be asked to take the risk of ridership. The government should take the ridership risk. Otherwise, operators focus more on advertising revenue rather than maintaining the system,” Gadepalli said.Lack of safe infra big hurdleA study done by the Central Road Research institute last year using secondary data from different sources projected that the dependence on public buses and private vehicles for short trips (6km or less) can be reduced by nearly 40% if adequate cycling infrastructure is provided in Delhi within the next three years.Gaurav Wadhwa, founder of Delhi Cyclists, a group of cycling enthusiasts, said that if safe infrastructure is provided then people will cycle. “We have reworked our timings ever since traffic began to increase on roads. We now start at 4.30-5am and are back by 8am to avoid peak-hour traffic. If dedicated corridors, safe crossing at intersections, etc., are provided, then a lot of people will again start cycling.”Even the firms that are running cycle sharing projects in the city admit that inadequate infrastructure is a hurdle. DV Manohar, chairman of SmartBike, a shared mobility startup which has implemented the bike sharing project in NDMC area, said e-bikes come with locks that have to be charged every few days. “Of the 50 stations, electricity connection is available only at six. We have to take the cycles to our warehouse for charging the locks. There are logistical issues that need to be addressed,” said Manohar.A senior NDMC official said on condition of anonymity that the process to provide power connections at all the stations is going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cycling-infra-in-delhi-gets-upgrade-but-experts-say-some-way-still-go-101633889580275.html
11-10-2021||Delhi||Unlikely Covid fillip boosts famous scissors market in Meerut||New Delhi: It is a warm October afternoon and Mohammad Anis is giving the finishing touch to a pair of scissors at his small factory in Bazar Peramal in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.There are a large bunch of scissors in front of him on the floor and Anis is moving the blades of all scissors near his right ear. “The sound of the movement of the blades tell me if a pair of scissors is working fine,” he says. “These are busy days for us. This consignment needs to be delivered by evening today. The Meerut scissors are in demand again.” The Covid-19 pandemic has unexpectedly given a new lease of life to Meerut’s 350-year-old scissors industry, which faced a downward spiral in the past two decades due to the growing popularity of Chinese scissors. Many manufacturing units in the city shut down over the years, with thousands losing jobs. But now many scissors manufacturers such as Anis say that demand for their product has gone up by over 50% in the past one and half years. The reasons, they say, include the declining Chinese imports in the wake of the government’s push for AatmaNirbhar Bharat mission, and also the fact that millions of Indians decided to shun barbers and cut their own hair during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. “After the first lockdown last year, the demand for hair-cutting scissors went up five times and the factories here worked day and night for months and still could not meet the demand. This sudden spike did not come from barbers but common people who were not ready to visit their neighbourhood salons because of the fear of catching the infection,” says Tanseer Saifi, who runs Shalimar Scissors Company. “Before the pandemic, I was making 100 scissors a day, now I was making about 200 on an average,” says Abid Hussain, who runs Mission Scissors.But in Meerut, India’s largest scissors manufacturing hub, no one talks about scissors with greater passion than Anis. His forefathers, he says, introduced scissors making in Meerut in the 1750s. His late father, Rais Ahmed, was a local celebrity, whose hand-made scissors were much in demand not just in India but also in west Asia. He pulls out a catalogue -cum-price list from 1896 of General Scissors Factory set up by his great-great grandfather. “Even in those days, we used to be very professional and sent these lists to traders in India and abroad,” says the soft-spoken Anis, showing us several letters from the 1950s and the 1960s from west Asian countries such as Saudi Arabia. “Most well-known tailors in India have also been using our scissors for decades. In fact, some of them have been using the same scissors; when their blades blunt, they courier them to us for sharpening. Chinese scissors are only better in look, they do not cut with the same finesse and are not as durable as ours.” Bobby Grover of Grover Tailors in Khan Market says his tailoring shop has been using Meerut scissors since the 1960s . What makes them special, he says is their cutting edge and their durability. “There are pairs of Meerut scissors that we have been using for 30 years. We just sharpen them from time to time,” says Grover whose shop has tailored suits for former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush when they were visiting India.“The handles of these scissors are so well designed that they hardly leave marks on your hands even after decades of use,” he said. Meerut produces a vast variety of scissors -- tailor scissors, barber scissors, paper, hardening and wire cutting scissors, among others, and they all are made manually with the help of basic cutting, grinding, drilling and polishing machines. Each type has specific blades, weight and length, and is either tapered or blunt-tipped, depending on its use. The size varies, from six inches to 14 inches, and a pair of Meerut scissors are sold at anything between Rs.80 to Rs.2,500 depending on the size. The scissors are made of carbon steel sourced from scrap metal found in cars, buses, trucks and railways, and are plated with nickel or chromium to make them rust-proof. Meerut’s scissors are known for their strength, sharpness, smoothness and durability, says Anis. “It is the meticulous handwork that makes Meerut’s scissors far superior to mass-produced Chinese ones.Not just top tailors , but also barbers across the country use or have used our scissors,” says Anis. “Unlike Chinese scissors, ours can be repaired and reused for decades. All they require is sharpening, ” says Chaman, his brother. The scissors industry in Meerut has about 400 units and employs over 60,000 craftsmen. Manufacturers will tell you that making scissors is an art involving several artisans. “A pair of scissors is made in 14 steps and pass through at least 20 people, each person with expertise in a different processes such as cutting, welding, sharpening, polishing,” says Abdul Aziz, a contract manufactures of scissors. “My orders have doubled compared to pre-pandemic days. A lot of our artisans turned rickshaw pullers and daily-wage labourers because of lack of work. But now with demand for Meerut scissors increasing, many of them are returning to their old vocation. During the pandemic, it has been proved that if we curb the Chinese imports, it can really help boost demand for domestic manufacturing,” adds Aziz. In 2013, Meerut scissors made the cut for Geographical Indication tag (GI), which is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. Abdullah Saeed of M Saeed Scissors Works, says that there is a need for Meerut to modernize its manufacturing processes. “After initial gains during the pandemic and anti-Chinese sentiments, Chinese scissors are again making a comeback slowly. So, ultimately we would have learn to compete with Chinese products and that would not be possible unless we adopt technology and move from manual to machine manufacturing,” says Saeed. In 2009, the government decided to set up a common facility centre (CFC) with the latest machines to help local scissors manufacturers adopt the technology. “Nothing has come out of it so far,” says Saeed. “The rising cost of raw material and high GST will soon undo the gains we have made during the pandemic.

11-10-2021||Chandigarh||UPSC prelims 2021: Parents allege mismanagement at SCD College||High drama was witnessed at the SCD Government College in Ludhiana, which was one of the centres marked for the UPSC civil services preliminary examination, 2021, on Sunday, as parents demanded cancellation of the centre, accusing authorities of delaying the entry of candidates in the morning shift.Of the 6,590 registered candidates, a total of 5,622 students appeared for the exam in 20 centres of Ludhiana. The exam was held in two shifts -- the morning shift from 9:30 to 11:30 am and the afternoon shift from 2:30pm to 4:30 pm.A few anguished parents even got into an argument with sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Jagdeep Sehgal and raised slogans against the administration for the alleged poor management at the centre.As many as 520 candidates appeared for the exam at SCD Government College in the morning shift.Pardeep Kumar, the parent of a candidate from Jalandhar, said, “The authorities were supposed to open the gates at least an hour before the exam. But since the officials were struggling with the final arrangements, they let the candidates in around 9:13am. It takes around 15 minutes for candidates to settle down but the delay on their end caused a lot of mental harassment for our children.”Kumar added that since there were different wings inside the college, many struggled to find their wing according to their roll number, thus leading to more delay. He further alleged that there were no seating plans or roll number sheets displayed at the gates.Ashwani Kumar, another parent from Sirsa, Haryana, said the UPSC should cancel this centre immediately.“It takes around 15 minutes for candidates to fill the OMR sheet before the exam. Since the students were allowed late entry, they took time to settle down and lost out on the extra time to fill the OMR sheet. All other centres allowed entry between 8:30am and 9am,” said Ashwani.SDM Jagdeep said the paper started on time as students were not frisked and were sent directly to exam hall. Meanwhile, parents stopped the official vehicle of Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, who had reached there to inspect the arrangements for the exam. The DC said, “Parents wanted permission to sit on the ground inside the centre. After their demand was turned down, they made an issue out of it. Proper protocol was followed by the officials,” claimed the DC.When asked if the candidates were allowed to take the exam without being frisked, he said that jammers were installed inside to avoid usage of electronic devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/upsc-prelims-2021-high-drama-at-scd-college-of-ludhiana-as-parents-allege-mismanagement-101633888804128.html

11-10-2021||World||UN chief Guterres slams 'broken' Taliban promises made to women and girls||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday slammed the Taliban's "broken" promises to Afghan women and girls, and urged the world to donate more money to Afghanistan to head off its economic collapse.The comments came on the heels of the first face-to-face talks between the United States and the Taliban since the Islamists took control of the country, at which the issue of women's rights was raised, according to the State Department."I am particularly alarmed to see promises made to Afghan women and girls by the Taliban being broken," Guterres told reporters."I strongly appeal to the Taliban to keep their promises to women and girls and fulfill their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law."Guterres said the United Nations "will not give up" on the issue and said the body discusses it daily with the Taliban, who have been in power since mid-August but whose legitimacy as a government is still not internationally recognized."Broken promises lead to broken dreams for the women and girls of Afghanistan," Guterres said, noting that three million girls have enrolled in school since 2001, and the average amount of education for girls has increased from six years to 10."Eighty percent of Afghanistan's economy is informal, with a preponderant role of women. Without them, there is no way the Afghan economy and society will recover," the UN chief warned.Guterres also spoke at length about the challenges faced by Afghanistan's economy. The country's assets held abroad have been frozen, and development aid has been suspended."We need to find ways to make the economy breathe again. This can be done without violating international laws or compromising principles," he said."I urge the world to take action and inject liquidity into the Afghan economy to avoid collapse."According to UN officials, it is possible for international funds or money from blocked Afghan assets to be paid to UN agencies and nongovernmental organizations that then pay salaries to Afghans on the ground.This practice, with bank exemptions authorized by the United States in particular, has already been used in the past for other countries including Yemen.But Guterres warned the international community was moving too slowly to give aid to Afghanistan, where the humanitarian and economic crisis affect at least 18 million people -- about half the population.International humanitarian aid has thus far been delivered to different parts of the country without obstruction from the Taliban, and even with their cooperation and security assistance, he said."The number of incidents during humanitarian operations has been in constant decline," Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-guterres-slams-broken-taliban-promises-made-to-women-and-girls-101633973608323.html
11-10-2021||World||‘Don’t worry, everything's fine': Putin says while repeatedly coughing at a meet||President Vladimir Putin said he has a cold and he isn’t suffering from Covid-19, after he was heard repeatedly coughing at a televised meeting with officials.“Don’t worry, everything’s fine,” Putin told a videoconference Monday with his Security Council, also shown on state television. “They do tests practically on a daily basis not only for Covid-19 but for all other infections and everything is ok.”That unannounced broadcast followed an earlier one Putin held with officials to discuss agriculture, in which he was seen and heard coughing on numerous occasions. Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the upper house of parliament, interrupted Putin at the Security Council after that event to ask about his health. “Everyone got worried,” she said. “I was out in the cool air and moving around actively but nothing terrible is happening,” Putin told the Security Council officials. “I know you’re all vaccinated and don’t forget to get revaccinated,” he said, referring to booster shots against Covid-19.The Russian president, who last week celebrated his 69th birthday, went into self-isolation last month when he disclosed that dozens of his staff had been affected by a Covid-19 outbreak. He showed no public sign of illness himself and emerged after two weeks to hold an in-person meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Sept. 29. Since then, however, he’s continued to hold most of his public meetings by videoconference. Nationally, Russia is suffering another surge in Covid-19 cases, with daily reported deaths hitting record highs, as officials blame low vaccination rates for the rise in infections.Total deaths in Russia linked to Covid-19 since the epidemic began rose above 400,000 in August, according to the latest monthly assessment by the Federal Statistics Service released late Friday. July and August have been the deadliest months to date, with a total of 100,000 deaths recorded.(Updates with Russia deaths data, graphic in last paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-worry-everything-s-fine-putin-says-while-repeatedly-coughing-at-a-meet-101633971979731.html

In a televised address, Prayut said the coronavirus quarantine requirement will end for at least 10 countries including the United Kingdom, Singapore, Germany, China and the United States."When they arrive, they should present a (negative) Covid test... and test once again upon arrival," AFP further quoted the prime minister as saying.After getting a negative test, "they can travel freely like Thais," he said.Currently, vaccinated tourists need to undergo at least seven days of quarantine in a hotel after their arrival in Thailand. Thailand also has a so-called "sandbox" scheme which allows vaccinated tourists to move freely around Phuket for a fortnight and afterwards travel to the mainland without quarantine.There is a curfew in place in Bangkok and other areas from 10pm. to 4am. to check a third wave of the coronavirus that began in April this year.Prayut said visitors outside of Thailand's designated 10 low-risk countries are welcome, “but they have to be in quarantine”, he added. He said more nations would be added to the 'green list' in December.Acknowledging that his decision can lead to a spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, Prayut said people will not be able to stand it if they lose a second chance at this business opportunity.Around 40 million tourists visited Thailand every year before the pandemic, with tourism making up almost 20 percent of its national income. However, Covid-related restrictions left the economy battered. Today's announcement comes as a relief for people in the tourism sector who have suffered losses in their businesses during the ongoing pandemic.Last year, Thailand suffered losses of about $50 billion in tourism revenue as foreign arrivals plunged 83 percent to 6.7 million, from a record 39.9 million two years ago.Currently, the Southeast Asian kingdom has more than 1.7 million cases, and has recorded 17,751 deaths related to Covid-19 infection.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-to-end-quarantine-for-vaccinated-visitors-from-low-risk-nations-november-1-onward-101633962041659.html

Putin takes pains to avoid even mentioning his name.Navalny's movement suffered a new blow in June when a court ruled its activities to be extremist. Many of his allies have had their homes raided or their freedom of movement restricted, and some have fled abroad. Last month Russia opened a new criminal case against Navalny that could keep him in jail for a further decade.RIA news agency said a Moscow court on Monday rejected an action by Navalny against the prosecutor's office over the blocking of his YouTube channel. The channel had advised Russians how to vote in a parliamentary election that went on to be won by the pro-Putin United Russia party.Some of Navalny's supporters have criticised last week's award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov, saying Navalny would have been a more deserving winner. Muratov dedicated the prize to six of his paper's journalists murdered for their work while also saying he would have given it to Navalny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremist-terrorist-navalny-on-how-prison-in-russia-has-changed-his-status-101633965762868.html

The Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) has claimed the suicide bombing at the mosque on October 8. Hundreds of Shia men gathered for Friday prayers when the bomber struck. Dozens of people were injured in the deadly attack. “India strongly condemns the terrorist attack on a Shia mosque in Kunduz, Afghanistan in which more than 100 Afghans were reported to have lost [their] lives and several others injured,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “We extend our condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims during their difficult time,” it said. India said the attack had once again highlighted the need to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The statement said, “India stands committed in the fight against the scourge of terrorism and reiterates the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan. We stand with the people of Afghanistan and hope that perpetrators of this attack would be identified and brought to justice expeditiously.” Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, India has repeatedly insisted that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism. The Indian government has also cautioned the world community against rushing into recognising the Taliban setup, saying the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-condemns-suicide-attack-on-mosque-in-afghanistan-101633965308727.html
11-10-2021||World||What are ‘natural experiments’ which fetched the 2021 Economics Nobel?||Three US-based economists won the 2021 Economics Nobel Prize for pioneering ‘natural experiments’, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Monday. The Prize was split two-way. One half went to Canadian-born David Card of the University of California at Berkeley while the other half was awarded to Israeli-American, Joshua D Angrist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dutch-American Guido W Imbens from Stanford University. Peter Fredriksson, who chairs the Economic Sciences Committee, said in a media statement: “Card’s studies of core questions for society and Angrist and Imbens’ methodological contributions have shown that natural experiments are a rich source of knowledge.” “Their research has substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit for society.” What are natural experiments? Let us look at the definition provided by The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. “Natural experiments or quasi-natural experiments in economics are serendipitous situations in which persons are assigned randomly to a treatment (or multiple treatments) and a control group, and outcomes are analysed for the purposes of putting a hypothesis to a severe test; they are also serendipitous situations where assignment to treatment ‘approximates’ randomized design or a well-controlled experiment.” In a rough-and-ready sense, it stands for real-world situations that are studied for their effects on individuals. “Natural persons” or “events” are randomly divided in an experiment between a controlled group and a treatment group. The key to these observational experiments is that the results are often “serendipitous”, or ones leading to new surprising discoveries. Canada-born economist Card used this approach to assess the impact of minimum wage increases. Those who argue against increasing floor wages, a labour-welfare measure, cite unemployment as an unwanted side-effect (since employers have to pay more in wages, they hire less). Card’s experiment showed that this needn’t be the case always. Natural experimental approaches are based on “exclusively natural events as instruments”, according to a 2000 paper published in the Journal of Economic Literature by Mark R Rosensweig and Kenneth Wolpin. Natural experiments weren’t always a conventional approach in the study of Economics, but have a rich history of at least four decades. For instance, Wolpin did use some of this approach in a study on India entitled, “A New Test of the Permanent Income Hypothesis: The Impact of Weather on Income and Consumption of Farm Households in India,” published in the International Economic Review in 1982. The natural event in this study was of course weather patterns.“Natural experiments are everywhere,” Eva Mörk, a member of the Prize Committee for the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was quoted as telling a news conference by Reuters on Monday. The Economics Prize is officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. Winners are awarded a sum of US $1.14 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-natural-experiments-which-fetched-the-2021-economics-nobel-101633960447508.html

This report suggests so||Russian spies stole the formula for the vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) AstraZeneca developed with Oxford University researchers and used it to create its own Sputnik V jab, The Sun has reported. The British tabloid cited security services as saying that they have proof one of the Russian spies swiped the vital data from the drugs firm—including the blueprint for the Covid-19 vaccine—and used it to create Sputnik V. It also reported that the blueprint and vital information was stolen by a foreign agent in person. Russia’s Sputnik V jab uses similar technology to the Oxford designed vaccine, which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and being used in the vaccination drive by the Centre. The United Kingdom’s security minister Damian Hinds did not confirm the report but said cyber attacks were becoming more sophisticated. Hinds was asked on LBC Radio about the claim in The Sun that British security chiefs believe Russia stole the formula for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. “I can’t comment specifically but it’s fair for your listeners to assume that constantly there are foreign states who would like to get their hands on sensitive information, including sometimes commercial secrets, sometimes scientific, intellectual property, constantly trying to get hold of it and in the cyberspace that is done in a very different way from how things use to happen and we need to be exceptionally vigilant towards it.” "We live in aworld, I am afraid, where there is state activity seeking to engage in industrial espionage and economic espionage, there are cyber attacks that happen and so on.”Also read | Centre permits export of 4 million doses of Sputnik Light vaccine to RussiaThe Sun also said in its report that last year spies pointed the finger at President Vladimir Putin and said they were “more than 95 per cent” sure that Russian state-sponsored hackers targeted the UK, the US and Canadian bodies developing a Covid-19 vaccine. “We are very careful in terms of calling these things out, ensuring we can have that confidence in attribution. We believe we have this here,” the late security minister James Brokenshire said at the time, according to the Sun.However, Sputnik denied the claim late on Monday, saying the report was “another fake news and blatant lie based on anonymous sources.” “They also make absolutely no sense scientifically as Sputnik V and AstraZeneca use different platforms. Sputnik V is based on a well-studied human adenoviral platform whose efficacy and safety have been proven over decades,” it said in a statement.

With only bottle caps to moisten lips and no food, about 500 of the ethnic minorities are transported at a time from freight stations with more than 100 passengers in each carriage, the former law enforcer said."We gather them together, put hoods on their head, two people handcuffed together, to prevent them from escaping," the man, who wanted to be identified as only as Jiang, was quoted as saying in the report."To keep order, we don't let them go to the toilet. They reach their destinations in two days. They reach Xinjiang," he further said.Also read | Warming relations between China, Taliban cause fear among Uyghurs: ReportJiang also spoke about a 2019 drone footage that seemed to reveal blindfolded and shacked Uyghur prisoners being unloaded from a train -- their heads shaved.He said the clipping most likely showed detainees being transferred from various centres to a larger central facility, because of their different uniform.Jiang told Sky News that worked as a detective in a local public security bureau after having served as a soldier.However, the Chinese government has denied the allegations when confronted during a news conference in Beijing.A spokesperson for the Xinjiang government said the revelations of the “so-called local policeman could not happen"."China is a country ruled by law.

So the things said by the man that officials didn't let them go to toilets and that they had no water to drink, and so on, do not exist,” Elijan Anayat, the spokesperson, was quoted as saying in the report.China has so far refuted all reports of human rights abuse and repression of the ethnic minority group in Xinjiang and referred to them as "the lie of the century".Also read | China uses coercive policies in Xinjiang to drive down Uyghur birth rates: ReportHowever, Jiang said the authorities did not see ordinary people as human beings. “They do things that you don't do to human beings," he said. Describing the tactics employed in the camp, Jiang said, "In cases related to politics, jeopardising the regime, cases involving overthrowing the regime - you're allowed to beat people.  It's ok, to make them turn in other people's names.""You use various methods to put pressure -- two people use sticks to weigh down their legs, tie him up and trample their arm; shackle their hands, pour cold water - put a water pipe into their mouth and tie them up," he added."How to say, under this kind of management in the re-education centre, beating somebody to death, for sure, it happens," the defector further said.“If accidents occur, it's normal that some people die. That's just how you get used to saying it. Please do not blame me.”"They have problems with their thoughts," said Jiang and grounds for suspicion and detention included differing opinions on the Communist government, seeking help from higher authorities, or not selling alcohol and cigarettes, all of which could be considered "ideological issues" that justified “re-education”.He said there was, however, a distinction between those sentenced to prison and those sent to re-education centres.“Those who actually contacted other people and planned to rebel, they can be sentenced. But people in the re-education centres are not severe enough to be sentenced.”Jiang left China in 2020, but he was disillusioned with the regime before he was sent to Xinjiang. Having seen much of life, he said his defection and revelations were not about betraying the motherland. "It's a way for me to free myself."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-food-bottlecaps-to-moisten-lips-ex-chinese-cop-reveals-uyghur-travel-woes-101633953282927.html
11-10-2021||World||Iraq says it arrested top Islamic state leader Sami Jasim||Iraq said on Monday it has detained a top leader of the Islamic State group and a longtime al-Qaida operative in a cross-border operation.Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi tweeted the news, identifying the man as Sami Jasim, who oversees the Islamic State group’s financial operations and served as the deputy leader of IS under the late Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Al-Kadhimi described it as “one of the most difficult" cross border intelligence operations ever conducted by Iraqi forces.Jasim has a $5 million bounty on his head from the U.S. State Department’s Rewards for Justice program, which describes him as having been “instrumental in managing finances for IS terrorist operations."“While serving as IS deputy in southern Mosul in 2014, Jasim reportedly served as the equivalent of IS’s finance minister, supervising the group’s revenue-generating operations from illicit sales of oil, gas, antiquities, and minerals,” the website says.Iraqi intelligence officials told The Associated Press that Jasim was detained in an identified foreign country and transported to Iraq few days ago. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak of the operation on the record.Jassem worked with al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006. He assumed various security positions in Iraq, and moved to Syria in 2015, after the Islamic State group, an al-Qaida offshoot, declared its caliphate in 2014 and became the deputy of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the extremist group's leader.Al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S.-led raid in northwestern Syria in 2019, under former U.S. President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-says-it-arrested-top-islamic-state-leader-sami-jasim-101633949637970.html
11-10-2021||World||Chinese women speak out on Weibo against Beijing's ‘three-child-policy’||Chinese women have taken to social media platform Weibo to air their grievances against the Chinese government for “using female bodies” to advance population control measures, alleging that the female body has become a “tool” for the government, reported news agency ANI on Monday. China did away with the repressive ‘one-child-policy’ in 2015 and replaced it with the ‘two-child-policy’, which was then replaced with the controversial ‘three-child-policy’ in 2021, after census data showed China’s population growth slipping to its slowest rate since the 1950s. The ruling Communist Party of China heralded the 2021 relaxation as a major milestone but women were wary it would only exacerbate the existing inequalities.Chinese citizens took to Weibo a day after this policy change was announced on May 31, complaining of rising education expenses, long work hours, lack of access to proper child care services, and sky high real estate prices. The Chinese government promised to help families with child care and education costs but so far little has been done in this regard.“Our government is very good at empty talk,” Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist activist told the New York Times after the three child policy was released, adding that “It’s meaningless to just look at a few things they said.”The Chinese President Xi Jinping has however tried to make good of his party’s promise by dealing a lethal blow to the Chinese online tutoring industry by imposing a ban on for-profit tutoring, in a bid to reduce education cost for parents who spend their last penny into getting their children ready for highly competitive Chinese universities.CCP has also initiated bans on online gaming and restricted the amount of time children can spend playing video games to three hours, and banned online celebrity fan clubs. All these moves, critics opine, belong to the ‘Xi Jinping school of thought’ which aims to impose stricter control on Chinese social life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-women-speak-out-on-weibo-against-three-child-policy-101633949341030.html

South Korea and European countries are among the favorite destinations, he said. “Demand has been overwhelming,” Wong said. “Singaporeans are travel-starved and they are really looking forward to an overseas holiday and some of them may think this is long overdue.”Singapore Airlines said it has seen “very high demand” for flights and may take longer to respond to queries from customers. Fares on some travel lane routes have increased, the carrier’s website shows. The airline’s shares jumped as much as 9.6% Monday, their biggest gain in 11 months. “Our website temporarily experienced technical issues for a few minutes on Oct. 9,” a spokesperson for the airline said. “Customers have since been able to access the Singapore Airlines website and check on our flight schedules and book flights.”The company’s website shows direct flights from Singapore to Los Angeles for S$2,364 ($1,747) in the vaccinated travel lane, compared with S$1,519 for those that involve a leg not under the agreement.  Singapore has moved away from a Covid-Zero approach and is opening its borders to several countries including the U.S. and U.K., backed by its high vaccination rate -- more than 80% of the population is fully inoculated against the virus. The government on Saturday expanded its list of countries to qualify for quarantine-free travel to nine more places. Vaccinated travelers from the U.S., U.K., France, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain and Denmark will be allowed in without having to quarantine from Oct. 19. Those from South Korea will be able to visit via a so-called vaccinated travel lane from Nov. 15. Singapore started similar arrangements with Germany and Brunei last month.Singapore also halved the number of tests that people arriving need to take to two from four, which has made travel more affordable, Wong said. Transport Minister S. Iswaran said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday that more capacity could be added. Travel routes with other countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan are also being considered, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-airlines-s-website-crash-amid-surge-in-flight-demand-101633945454939.html
11-10-2021||World||Don't lose sight of the issue of a two-state solution: Merkel tells Israel||German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday implored Israel not to "lose sight” of the need to establish a Palestinian state, as she wrapped up a two-day farewell visit.Merkel's support for a two-state solution has been one of the key disagreements with Israel's leadership during her 16 years in office, which were characterized by unwavering support for Israel.Speaking at an Israeli think tank, Merkel welcomed the historic diplomatic agreements reached last year between Israel and four Arab countries - led by the United Arab Emirates. But she said the deals, known as the Abraham Accords, did not erase the need for Israel to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians.“We must not lose sight of the right of the Palestinians to have a chance to live,” she said. “Therefore one should under no circumstances, even as it becomes more and more difficult because of the settlements, lose sight of the issue of a two-state solution,” Merkel told a panel at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.Backers of the Abraham Accords, which were brokered by the Trump Administration, have praised them as breaking the long-standing belief that Israel could not forge ties with the Arab world before reaching an agreement with the Palestinians.Israel’s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, a hard-liner who opposes a Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied lands, has ruled out peace talks with the Palestinians. Instead, he has advocated what he says is a more pragmatic approach of improving living conditions for the Palestinians as a way of lowering tensions. His government, a patchwork of dovish, nationalist and Arab parties that took office in June, so far has not announced any major changes in policy.Merkel welcomed Bennett’s intentions but said such an approach would not be enough.“I think that such a long-running issue (the conflict with the Palestinians) will not disappear from the agenda, even if there are improved relations with neighboring Arab states,” she said.Throughout Merkel's visit, she was welcomed as a “true friend” of Israel. Her agenda included meetings with Israeli leaders and a stop at Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem.She repeatedly professed Germany’s commitment to Israel’s security and said she was confident that her country's next government — to be determined in lengthy coalition talks following an inconclusive election last month — would take a similar stance.A key issue on the agenda was Iran's nuclear program. Germany was one of the world powers that negotiated the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.The deal fell apart after then-President Donald Trump, with Israel’s support, withdrew in 2018. The Biden administration has been trying to revive that deal over Israeli objections.Israel considers Iran its greatest enemy, citing the country’s military presence in neighboring Syria and its support for hostile militant groups across the region. It accuses Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons — a charge Iran denies — and believes that international deal did not contain sufficient safeguards.In the meantime, Iran has marched forward with its nuclear activities, such as increased uranium enrichment - a step that can move it closer to building a bomb.Merkel said that disagreements among the world powers that negotiated the original deal have weakened their position and allowed Iran to buy time and expand its military activities across the region.“Iran knows this, and therefore we face a very serious situation,” she said. She acknowledged that she does not have a solution, but called on key players, including Russia and China, to take a stronger public stance against Iran."The more countries make it clear that they don’t accept the ambitions and aggression of Iran, the better for the region,” she said.Israel was formed in the wake of the Holocaust in 1948 and the two countries only established diplomatic ties in 1965. But over the decades, those ties have warmed and Germany is one of Israel's closest and most important international allies and trade partners.Merkel was scheduled to visit in August, but the trip was postponed after the crisis in Afghanistan in which the Taliban seized power. She then delayed the visit until after last month’s German election. She now remains in office in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed, a process that could take weeks or even months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-lose-sight-of-the-issue-of-a-two-state-solution-merkel-tells-israel-101633942373585.html

Travellers have to be vaccinated with a World Health Organization (WHO) approved jab, its guidelines said.The Singapore government’s VTL scheme covers seven European countries - Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Germany - along with United States and Canada. The only Asian country in the list is Brunei. China, India, and Indonesia have not been included so far. In addition to this, vaccinated travellers from South Korea will also be allowed to enter the country from November 15, reported ANI.To avail the VTL scheme travellers have to fly to Singapore in a VTL-designated flight flown by Singapore Airlines or Lufthansa. The government will be adding other carriers to the list over time. Singapore Airlines is expanding VTL flight services to 14 cities, with more points on special designated services to be announced in coming weeks, the carrier said in a statement.Also Read: Singapore set on reopening despite new Covid-19 travel curbsTravellers will also need to carry proof of their vaccination and undergo RT-PCR test not more than 48 hours before their departure and also on their arrival at Singapore’s Changi airport. Previously, travellers had to take four such tests to gain entry.This announcement comes days after Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s push to live with Covid-19 without being paralysed by fear. During a televised address on Saturday, Loong said that the delta variant has shown that Covid-19 is not going away anywhere. However, with vaccinations, social distancing measures and careful monitoring, it will be possible to live with the "new normal". "It will take us at least three months, and perhaps as long as six months, to get there," he cautioned.Loong justified the move to resume connectivity with countries reporting stable numbers of Covid-19 cases insisting that the move would "keep us connected to global supply chains and help to preserve Singapore's hub status".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-allow-quarantine-free-travel-for-11-countries-india-not-included-for-now-101633930585285.html

11-10-2021||World||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un calls for improved living conditions||North Korea said Monday leader Kim Jong Un urged officials to overcome a “grim situation” facing the country and make stronger efforts to improve the food and living conditions of his people.But state media didn’t mention any specific comments toward Washington and Seoul while reporting on Kim’s speech marking the 76th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s founding.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s denuclearization steps.The country has ramped up its missile testing activity in recent weeks while making conditional peace offers to Seoul, reviving a pattern of pressuring South Korea to get what it wants from the United States.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim during his speech on Sunday said his party is determined to achieve the economic goals set during the party’s congress in January, when he acknowledged his previous economic plans weren’t succeeding and issued new development plans for the next five years.The agency said Kim confirmed the determination of the party to efficiently carry out the five-year plan to boost “the national economy and solving the people’s food, clothing and housing problems.”The KCNA said Kim analyzed the “unprecedented difficulties” facing the North and called for the party’s single-minded unity in developing the state economy in face of the “grim situation.”Analysts say Kim is facing perhaps the toughest moment of his near decade in power. He failed to win badly needed sanctions relief in his summitry with then-President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, then the coronavirus pandemic caused North Korea to close its borders and unleashed further economic shock after decades of mismanagement and sanctions over Kim’s nuclear weapons program.The World Health Organization said last week some of its Covid-19 medical supplies had arrived at a North Korea port, an indication the North was easing one of the world’s strictest pandemic border closures to receive outside help.Kim has so far rejected the Biden administration’s offers to restart dialogue without preconditions, saying that Washington must first abandon its “hostile policy,” a term the North mainly uses to refer to sanctions and U.S.-South Korea military exercises.But the North in recent weeks have also restored communication lines with the South and said it could take further steps to improve bilateral relations if Seoul abandons its “double-dealing attitude” and “hostile viewpoint.”Analysts say North Korea is using the South’s desire for inter-Korean engagement to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul and to pressure the South to extract concessions from the Biden administration on its behalf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-calls-for-improved-living-conditions-101633918042313.html

Hill worked as a senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council in the Trump White House."I discovered that I was known as the Russia bitch. This underscored that fact that most women were not paid attention to," Hill told CNN during an interview."And the recent statement by the former President that he doesn't know me at all again underscores the misogyny that if you are a woman, or a certain kind of woman that's not in the immediate entourage, then you are pretty much nothing. You are a non-player in his world," she added.In her recently released memoir "There is nothing for you here", Hill said that for Trump and those around him, it was all about the look, the image, not who you were and what you did.She rose to prominence in November 2019, while testifying at the Trump impeachment hearings. She warned warned Republicans against promoting the "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 US elections.Hill was among the two witnesses who testified before the house intelligence committee, which conducted the first leg of the impeachment inquiry against Trump.Hill, a British-born coal miner's daughter who became a US citizen in 2002, worked for Republican and Democratic administrations. She said she joined the Trump White House because she shared the Republican president's belief that relations with Russia needed to improve. Still, she was adamant that Russia was gearing up to intervene again in the 2020 US election.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led US House of Representatives over charges he abused the power of his office by enlisting a foreign government to investigate a political rival ahead of the 2020 election and obstructed Congress in its investigation.

What changes for Indians, who were already allowed to enter the UK, is that their vaccination status will now be recognised eliminating the requirement to mandatorily quarantine for 10 days. The relaxation has been given to Indian nationals who have received both the doses of locally-produced Covishield, an issue which led to brief tension between the two countries."No quarantine for India travellers to United Kingdom fully vaccinated with Covishield or another UK-approved vaccine from 11 October. Thanks to Indian government for close cooperation over last month," British High Commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeted on Thursday.India had on October 1 imposed mandatory 10-day quarantine for British citizens irrespective of vaccination status in response to the UK quarantine rules for Indians who have received both Covishield doses.In the latest revision of travel rules, UK now has only seven nations in the red list. These countries are: Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Apart from India, vaccinated travellers from Brazil, Hong Kong, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey will be treated the same as returning fully-vaccinated UK residents as long as they have not visited a red-list nation in the last 10 days before arriving in England, the UK advisory said.Check latest guidelines here:1. A traveller has to take the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at least 14 days before arrival in England. The day of one's final dose does not count as one of the 14 days, the government advisory said.2. If a passenger is fully vaccinated, then before travelling to the UK, he/she will have to book and pay for a day 2 Covid-19 test which is to be taken after arrival. The passengers will also have to complete a passenger locator form 48 hours before arriving in England.3. "India will be added to this list of countries and territories with approved proof of vaccination 4am Monday 11 October.

China's sovereignty and territorial integrity has never be partitioned and will never be partitioned," reported CGTN.Tsai, during her National Day address, also stated that Taipei is no longer seen as the orphan of Asia, but as an "Island of Resilience" that can face challenges with courage."But the more we achieve, the greater the pressure we face from China. So I want to remind all my fellow citizens that we do not have the privilege of letting down our guard," she added.Her remarks came amid the rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei as recently 150 Chinese military aircraft breached the airspace of Taiwan over a period of four days.China claims full sovereignty over Taiwan despite the island's self-governance for more than seven decades. Taipei has countered Beijing's aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwanese-president-s-remarks-incite-confrontation-distorts-facts-china-101633912440279.html

But Toebbe responded with caution, asking instead to set up a "dead drop" location and to be paid in cryptocurrency.The couple in following months transferred multiple SD cards of data to the agent. In the first dead drop, "the SD card was wrapped in plastic and placed between two slices of bread on a half a peanut butter sandwich," the agent said in the complaint.Other SD cards were hidden in a chewing gum package and a sealed Band-Aid wrapper, with the Band-Aid still inside.The couple was arrested Saturday after leaving another SD card at a dead drop location.US Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the agencies involved for "thwarting the plot" and "taking this first step in bringing the perpetrators to justice," the statement said.The Department of Defense declined to comment when contacted by AFP.The couple is due to appear in West Virginia federal court on October 12.US nuclear-powered submarines have been the subject of recent attention when Australia and Britain in September unveiled a new defense contract for such subs, negotiated secretly over several months.In order to join the pact, Australia tore up a landmark multimillion-dollar contract with France, sparking an international row that saw Paris recall its ambassador to Canberra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-couple-arrested-for-selling-nuclear-warship-information-justice-department-101633909749551.html
11-10-2021||World||International Day of the Girl Child: History, importance, and how to contribute||The International Day of the Girl Child is observed annually on October 11, a date set by the United Nations to urge the global community to embolden gender equality impacts. This year, the UN urges the world to bridge the gender digital divide that exists in diverse skills and jobs – a challenge that society is increasingly facing due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “The gender digital divide in connectivity, devices, and use, skills and jobs is real,” the UN said in an official statement detailing the significance of the International Day of the Girl Child 2021. “It is an inequity and exclusion gap across geographies and generations that is our challenge to address if the digital revolution is to be for all, with all, by all.”International Day of the Girl Child: HistoryA blueprint for a proper framework of recognising girls' rights first began to take shape in 1995 at the World Conference on Women in China. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which was unanimously adopted by all the countries present, was since regarded as “the most progressive blueprint ever for advancing the rights of not only women but girls.”Later, on December 18, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) declared October 11 as the International Day of the Girl Child, to recognise the unique challenges that girls face around the world, which may share links but also be completely different from the kind of challenges that women face.International Day of the Girl Child: SignificanceAdolescent girls go through an exceptionally important phase where they can be empowered with the right tools to change the world by ensuring a safe, educated, and healthy lifestyle. They have the potential to be both the empowered girl of today as well as tomorrow’s worker, mother, entrepreneur, mentor, household head, or political leader. According to the United Nations, “An investment in realising the power of adolescent girls upholds their rights today and promises a more equitable and prosperous future, one in which half of humanity is an equal partner in solving the problems of climate change, political conflict, economic growth, disease prevention, and global sustainability.”The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by world leaders in 2015 embody a roadmap for progress that is sustainable and leaves no one behind. Each of the 17 goals is integral to achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment.International Day of the Girl Child: How to be involvedAccording to the UN, there are more than a few ways one can get involved with promoting the International Day of the Girl Child. One can share stories, blogs, and videos of inspiring adolescent girls who are tech trailblazers while collectively amplifying the call to action to expand these pathways for every girl, everywhere.Moreover, people can also make themselves more aware of the ways to address the gender digital divide and further amplify the means to achieving meaningful and sustainable change in a digital revolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-the-girl-child-history-importance-and-how-to-contribute-101633852651006.html

They have assured me that there won't be any shortage of coal supply,” the Chhattisgarh chief minister added.The Chhattisgarh government said South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) will ensure the supply of 29,500 metric tonnes of coal per day for thermal power plants in the state. SECL CMD Ambika Prasad Panda gave consent for the supply following a request by Baghel, a government public relations official told news agency PTI.Union minister for home affairs Amit Shah held a meeting with Union power minister RK Singh and Union coal minister Pralhad Joshi earlier in the day to discuss the power crisis, people familiar with the development said.The meeting took place even as RK Singh on Sunday criticised the Gas Authority of India Ltd and Tata Power for sending “baseless SMSs” to customers and creating panic about a power crisis, warning that such acts will be treated as instances of “irresponsible behaviour”.The CEO of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited Ganesh Srinivasan warned on Saturday that the national capital might witness intermittent and rotational load shedding in the coming days as coal-based power stations are left with coal stocks that will last one-two days.The warnings came after the Central Electricity Authority released a report claiming that of the 135 power plants it monitors across the country, 64 non-pithead power plants (plants located 1,500km away from coal mines) are left with coal stocks for less than four days of supply.Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain had warned residents of an acute coal shortage in thermal power plants across the country and cautioned that the national capital had enough coal stocks to last one more day. "There is an acute shortage of coal in coal-fired power plants across the country. There is only one day's stock left in the plants from which Delhi gets electricity, there is no coal at all," Jain told reporters on Saturday.However, Union minister RK Singh refuted these claims insisting that the demand for coal is actually a sign of the economy recovering after the brutal second wave brought things to a standstill.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday over on the "power crisis"and said that he is "personally keeping a close watch over the situation. Meanwhile, a Tata Power spokesperson said that they have stopped generation in Mundra as the high cost of imported coal is “making it impossible to supply under present PPA terms”.ALSO READ | These states may soon face a 'blackout' as coal demands surgeMeanwhile, Karnataka's leader of opposition Siddaramaiah remarked on shortage of coal for power plants in the state earlier on Monday and said, “we have to first understand if the scarcity of coal is artificially created or not. Karnataka had never faced power crisis till now — we had excess production compared to demand.”"As our thermal plants are closed, the requirement of coal is not very high. I condemn if this is an attempt to weaken government owned production plants and privatise them," Siddaramaiah said.Earlier in the day, Kerala government's minister for power and electricity K Krishnankutty said the state government will decide on imposing loadshedding after October 19 while raising alarm that Kerala is facing a shortage of 100MW currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-shortage-of-coal-but-power-plants-are-shutting-baghel-says-centre-lying-101633969818826.html

The Commission, which has completed the collection of records, has been examining witnesses and accordingly, some police officials, families of the accused, government officials, among others, have deposed before the panel so far at the commission's office in the Telangana High Court premises here.The Inquiry Panel's proceedings are currently going on in a hybrid form (physical and virtual appearence).On August 3, 2021, the Supreme Court gave another six months to the commission to file final report on the encounter killing of four accused in the case of gang-rape and murder of the young veterinarian. The Sirpurkar panel was set up on December 12, 2019 to inquire into the circumstances leading to the encounter and was to submit the report in six months. According to the Cyberabad Police here, the accused kidnapped the woman veterinarian on the night of November 27 2019 and killed her after sexually assaulting her, and then took the body in a lorry to Chattanpalli near Hyderabad, where it was burnt under a culvert. The four were arrested on November 29. They were killed in police firing on December 6, 2019 at Chattanpalli when they were taken to the scene of crime near the culvert, under which the charred remains of the 25-year-old veterinarian were found on November 28, to recover her phone, wrist-watch and others pertaining to the case. The Cyberabad police had said its personnel resorted to "retaliatory" firing when two of the accused opened fire at police after snatching their weapons, besides attacking the latter with stones and sticks, resulting in injuries to two policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ips-officer-vc-sajjanar-appears-before-sc-appointed-probe-panel-101633964989712.html
11-10-2021||India||Send digital records of prisoners who filed jail petitions in top court: SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court has directed high court legal services committee and state legal services authority across the country to prepare digital records of cases of prisoners whose jail appeals are pending before the top court due to incomplete records.In an order on Friday, a bench of justices UU Lalit and S Ravindra Bhat directed the two bodies to supply all case records including deposition of witnesses concerned in digital format for smooth hearing of jail petitions. Jail petitions are requests, appeals or applications of any kind, filed by convicts who cannot afford a lawyer. These pleas are forwarded by jail authorities to the state legal services authority concerned. The Supreme Court Legal Services Authority assigns the case to a lawyer on its panel who arranges the necessary documents and gets it ready for hearing. The panel’s lawyer assists the court as amicus curiae to argue the appeal.The bench said such petitions often reached the lawyer from the panel of amicus curiae or those engaged by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC) with incomplete documents and ordered that the state legal services authority or the high court legal services committee should send “complete record of the case in digital form”.Apart from the high court and trial court judgments, the top court said relevant material such as deposition of relevant witnesses and other documents such as custody certificate disclosing the length of custody undergone by the accused should also be shared with the Supreme Court’s registry or SCLSC in digital format.The directions came on a jail petition filed by a life convict lodged in a Rajasthan jail.The Supreme Court received a jail petition on behalf of the convict, Kailash Thakan challenging the Rajasthan high court’s August 6, 2019 verdict confirming his conviction and life sentence. The case was assigned to advocate Karan Bharihoke as amicus curiae on August 17, 2021. The lawyer was given two weeks to prepare the appeal.Bharihoke told the court on October 8 that he could not prepare the appeal since the case record including the depositions of the relevant witnesses was yet to be provided.The bench felt that orders were required to be passed in the matter as similar problems arose while dealing with other jail petitions.The court directed that its order to make digital records available to the lawyer should be sent to all state legal services authorities, high court legal services committees, SCLSC and the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA).Bharihoke described the court’s directions a “welcome step”, adding that it will go a long way in ensuring just and adequate representation to the accused in jail petitions.”On October 6, another bench of the Supreme Court led by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul also took note of 300 cases where convicts in judicial custody have approached the Supreme Court court directly against conviction through jail petitions. In this case, the court directed the Supreme Court registry to ensure records from trial courts and high courts are received by end of next month.The order came pursuant to a report prepared by three lawyers – Gaurav Agrawal, Liz Mathew and Devansh Mohta who examined the 300 jail petitions (including four death convicts) and suggested that in many cases, it was not known whether the convicts had been released or died. In two cases, the team of lawyers found out that the convicts had been released while in one case, the convict died.The court ordered that a mechanism be put in place and directed NALSA to get the documents ready for hearing after receiving the records from the registry. Friday’s order implies that the high court’s legal service authorities concerned will have to supply the records to the registry in digital format.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/send-digital-records-of-prisoners-who-filed-jail-petitions-in-top-court-sc-101633968126975.html

He also said that the price of fuel is not that high when the taxes levied is factored in.Fuel prices aren't high but include the tax levied. You must've taken a free vaccine, where will the money come from? You haven't paid the money, this is how it was collected: Union MoS (Petroleum & Natural Gas) Rameswar Teli in Assam on Oct 9 pic.twitter.com/uZZCpXdUCj“Fuel prices aren't high but include the tax levied. You must've taken a free vaccine, where will the money come from,” Teli was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. “You haven't paid the money, this is how it was collected,” Teli said.Soaring fuel prices across the country have dampened the mood ahead of the festive season. Petrol prices recorded on Monday across the country remained above ₹100. Monday was the seventh straight day of price hike which pushed the fuel prices to a new record high.Delhi saw petrol prices soar to a record high of ₹104.44 a litre while the fuel cost ₹110.41 per litre in Mumbai. Diesel prices soared above ₹100 in Mumbai, Kerala and Karnataka. According to a report by PTI, petrol prices rose by 30 paise a litre and diesel by 35 paise for six days in a row.Diesel rates have gone up by ₹4.35 per litre since September 24 while petrol prices rose by ₹3.25 per litre from September 28 onwards.The opposition parties slammed the government for fuel price hike amid the festive season. Daily commuters also voiced their concerns about the price rise and asked the government to consider the situations pertaining to Covid-19 and decreased incomes.“Prices of fuel should be reasonable. It should not take a toll on people's pockets. This move bothers the general public. Both the central and state government should reduce the taxes imposed on petrol and diesel,” a daily commuter, Yogendra, who hails from Delhi, told news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-must-ve-taken-free-vaccine-union-minister-justifies-fuel-price-hike-101633967121278.html

He also said that the Congress lawmaker is gaining political mileage out of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.“Priyanka Gandhi has started praising Hindu religion. The Gandhi family never thought of Hindu families. Priyanka Gandhi married a Christian, her mother is a Christian and her grandfather is a Muslim,” Subhash was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“She played it all keeping the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in mind. It showed how the Congress party was using farmers' stirs for their political advantage. All of a sudden, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi started becoming Hindu by visiting temples in Uttar Pradesh,” Subhash further added, claiming that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi’s recent visits to Uttar Pradesh were a electoral gimmick.Subhash said that the BJP will return to power with a ‘thumping’ majority. The Telangana BJP leader also said that the recent actions of Priyanka Gandhi comes out of fear as her party lacks alliance partners.Priyanka Gandhi after visiting both temples also addressed a rally in Rohania, an area which is a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency. She earlier said that she will remain in Uttar Pradesh for five days every month ahead of the upcoming elections in order to zero in on her campaigning agenda, according to a report by news agency ANI.Priyanka Gandhi was also detained by the Uttar Pradesh police as she tried to meet the kin of the deceased farmers. She met the family of the deceased later and assured them justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-bjp-leader-likens-priyanka-gandhi-to-chameleon-101633966854499.html
11-10-2021||India||Maneka Gandhi says BJP not naming her in national panel doesn't reduce her stature||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP and former Union minister Maneka Gandhi said on Monday she was satisfied with her two-decade old association with the saffron camp and not being included in the all-important national executive committee did not reduce her stature in any way.Gandhi and her MP son Varun’s names were missing when BJP president JP Nadda released the 80-member national executive committee of the party last week.The non-inclusion seemed to have been a repercussion of Varun’s strong criticism of the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government’s handling of the violent clashes in Lakhimpur Kheri district last week in which at least eight persons, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed. The Pilibhit MP has been vocal about seeking justice for the victims.Also read | Varun Gandhi warns against ‘Hindu vs Sikh’ narrative in Lakhimpur violenceHe had posted a purported video of the incident and said the protesters could be silenced through murder. He also wrote to Adityanath, demanding immediate identification of suspects of the incident and registration of murder case and investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under the supervision of the Supreme Court.Gandhi, who represents the Sultanpur contingency in the Lok Sabha, said her first religion was to serve and it was important that she made a place in the hearts of people."I am satisfied to be in the BJP for 20 years. Not being in the executive does not reduce one's stature. My first religion is to serve. It is more important that I get a place in the hearts of people,” the animal rights activist was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Maneka Gandhi is on a two-day visit to her parliamentary constituency.“There are other senior leaders who also have not got a place in the executive committee. New people should also get an opportunity. I am aware of my duties and serving the people of my constituency is my first duty,” she added.Besides the mother-son duo, the BJP has also left out Birender Singh, another sympathiser of the farmers’ cause, and Subramanian Swamy and replaced them with a new crop of leaders.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maneka-gandhi-bjp-not-naming-me-in-national-panel-doesn-t-reduce-my-stature-101633966258413.html

11-10-2021||India||82% adults in state have Covid-19 antibodies, says latest serosurvey in Kerala||At least 82 per cent of people above 18 years have antibodies against Covid-19 and over 40 per cent of children in the 5-17 age group are exposed to the virus in Kerala, said the latest seroprevalence survey conducted by the state government. The survey report was tabled in the state assembly by health minister Veena Goerge on Monday. Since the Covid-19 vaccine was not given to children below 18 years, the presence of antibodies may be due to recovery from infection, said experts. The survey was conducted in the first week of July and August wherein 13,000 samples were collected from different parts of the state. Since 60 per cent of children are not exposed to the virus, it is likely to affect the government’s decision to open schools on November 1. The health minister, however, said the government had formulated a “back to school” programme anticipating such a situation. “It is not mandatory for all children to attend school. Children can come only with the full consent of parents,” she said, adding that online classes will be available for students who do not want to attend school in person. The pandemic hub of the country, Kerala, for the last four months, has been reporting more than 60-70 per cent of total cases.In the last serosurvey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July, Kerala’s seropositivity was the lowest in the country at 44.4 per cent while the latest is pegged at 82.6%. The immunity has been achieved either through vaccination or natural infection, said experts. Over 95 per cent of the eligible population got at least one vaccine in the state and 60 per cent received both the jabs, statistics show.Meanwhile, the state reported 6,996 new Covid-19 cases on Monday after testing 66,702 samples for the infection with a test positivity rate of 10.49%. It also reported 84 deaths in past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/82-adults-in-state-have-covid-19-antibodies-says-latest-serosurvey-in-kerala-101633964468707.html
11-10-2021||India||Let’s unite against BJP, Goa’s Sardesai reaches out to TMC. Cong may be target||PANAJI: Goa Forward Party’s (GPF) Vijay Sardesai on Monday continued his search for an alliance partner for next year’s assembly elections after the Congress rebuffed his initial offer, declaring that parties opposed to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party cannot sit idle and should get into action.“We Goemkars (Goans) have to awaken the Durga in each of us, draw from the positivity of the orange colour, symbolic of Day four where Goddess Kushmanda is worshipped, and surge forward,” Sardesai said on Monday.The emphasis on Goddess Durga in his appeal for a possible alliance on Monday was seen to be aimed at the West Bengal-headquartered Trinamool Congress led by Mamata Banerjee which renewed efforts to expand its base in Goa and last week inducted former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro.“It’s a shame. But we cannot sit idle forever and waste time because of the inefficiency and indecision of others. To save Goa from complete ruin, we have to act!” he added.“Our fundamental objective must be to defeat the BJP at any cost, and we have to become street fighters on every Goan street to achieve that. Narakasura (the mythical demon king) has to be destroyed and we need all the help we can get,” Sardesai said.The 51-year-old politician, who started out with the Congress but branched out after being denied a ticket in 2012, also took a swipe at the Goa Congress.“For the last 2 years, we have been rooting forcefully for a united Team Goa to challenge and defeat the corrupt anti-Goan BJP before it destroys Goa completely. Unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears with the principal opposition party (Congress) abdicating its duty and responsibility to heed the call or at least come halfway to fulfil this strong desire of the people to throw out the BJP,” Sardesai said.In recent weeks, Congress leaders have rejected his offers more than once, underlining that he should have displayed the same enthusiasm to block the BJP in 2017.Sardesai, who set up the GFP in 2016 ahead of the 2017 state assembly elections, led a sharp campaign against the BJP on the four seats contested by his freshly-minted party. GFP candidates won three of them. But after the results were out, he negotiated a deal with the BJP that enabled Manohar Parrikar to form the government. In exchange, Sardesai became Goa’s deputy chief minister; his two MLAs also got ministerial berths.But the three GFP lawmakers were unceremoniously evicted from the Goa cabinet in July 2019 by chief minister Pramod Sawant after 10 Congress MLAs en masse switched to the BJP.Sardesai withdrew support from the Sawant-led government but stayed put in the NDA till April this year.Prepping for the assembly elections in January-February next year, Sardesai has lately sharpened his attacks on the BJP.A Trinamool Congress leader in Goa insisted that the Mamata Banerjee-led party wasn’t in talks with Sardesai but stressed that the party was looking to unite parties opposed to the BJP.In principle, it was a point that was articulated by the Congress Goa in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao as well. “We are willing to come together with like-minded people and parties who hold secular principles, who have been in Goa for a long time. We are willing to talk and have been talking. In the interest of Goa, we are ready for this,” Rao said last week.Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, the Congress’ election observer for the state, said the party’s priority, for now, is to strengthen itself rather than enter into negotiations over alliances.It is also being pointed out that Vijai Sardesai and leader of the TMC’s Goa unit, Luizinho Faleiro, don’t get along. Faleiro, who led the Congress unit and hoped to become chief minister in 2017, was one of the reasons cited by the Vijay Sardesai camp to explain why its three MLAs backed the BJP rather than the CongressPolitical analyst Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said Sardesai’s overtures to the TMC could be aimed at the Congress. “It appears that this is more of a threat to the Congress that if you do not align with me, I am willing to explore other alliance partners and even with the TMC,” Coutinho, a lawyer, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-unite-against-bjp-goa-s-sardesai-reaches-out-to-tmc-cong-may-be-target-101633963986818.html

Airbus' A320 series of aircraft competes with Boeing's B737 series of planes in the aviation market.Dube said on Monday: “At Akasa Air, we believe having a robust air transportation system is critical for our nation's progress. It is this belief that has motivated us to create a modern, efficient, quality-conscious airline."Akasa Air will serve all Indians regardless of their socio-economic or cultural backgrounds with warmth, inclusiveness and respect, he stated."Because at the end of the day, it is these qualities that connect people and cultures and help Indians realise their dreams,” he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 5 met Jhunjhunwala, noting that he is very bullish about the Indian economy."Delighted to meet the one and only Rakesh Jhunjhunwala... lively, insightful and very bullish on India," Modi had tweeted.When asked on October 8 at the 'India Today Conclave 2021' about his meeting with the PM, Jhunjhunwala, without divulging much, had said they talked about the economy."I told the prime minister that the economy is going to take off," he ​had noted​.When asked about his entry into the aviation sector when some companies have gone bust, Jhunjhunwala​ had​ ​replied​​​ he cannot say much but he is prepared for any outcome."We will see what happens.

11-10-2021||India||'Lakhimpur Kheri violence probe faces obstruction as minister in office': Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday claimed the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident "faces obstruction" as Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra remains in office while his son, Ashish, was sent to police custody for his alleged role in the violence that claimed eight lives.इस मंत्री को बर्खास्त ना करके भाजपा न्याय की प्रक्रिया में बाधा डाल रही है।केंद्र सरकार ना तो किसानों की परवाह करती है, ना ही हत्या के शिकार भाजपा कार्यकर्ताओं की।#KisanKoNyayDoTaking to Twitter, Rahul Gandhi said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government is not concerned with the death of farmers or even its own party workers. “BJP is obstructing the process of justice by not sacking the minister. The central government neither cares about the farmers nor the BJP workers who were killed,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.Eight people were killed when violence erupted at a farmers’ protest in Lakhimpur Kheri after a SUV allegedly carrying the minister Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish, mowed down four protesting farmers. While the four farmers died after they were reportedly run over by the SUV, two BJP party members and the driver of the SUV were lynched to death. A local journalist also died but the reason behind his death remains unclear.The parliamentarian from Wayanad has been critical of the Uttar Pradesh government’s handling of the incident. Rahul Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the kin of the victims despite what they alleged were "repeated attempts" by the Yogi Adityanath-led government to stop them.Rahul Gandhi, who spoke about the deceased Bharatiya Janata Party workers in his tweet, claimed earlier this week that he wanted to visit the kin of the deceased BJP party workers but was told by police officials present that the families were not "keen" on meeting him.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was earlier detained by the Uttar Pradesh police when she attempted to meet the kin of the deceased farmers.Congress’ criticism of the Yogi Adityanath government continues to grow as the state goes into legislative polls next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-probe-faces-obstruction-as-minister-in-office-rahul-101633961942550.html
11-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 12, 1981 — Prakash Padukone claims Han Jian and title||Kuala Lumpur: India’s Prakash Padukone checked the threatened Chinese stranglehold on international badminton here tonight with a superb straight-games 15-0, 18-16 win over Han Jian (China) in the inaugural World Cup championships.Prakash today was at his artistic, stylish best. This was the second successive victory by the 27-year-old Bangalore based Bank officer, over the top ranked Chinese within a fortnight. Prakash had beaten Jian in the semi-final of the Masters Badminton tourney on Sept. 25. But his today’s victory was certainly more impressive than the previous, where Prakash had won 11-15, 15-3, 15-8.Prakash was in his elements today and wrapped up the first game without dropping a point.The aggressive Han was never given a chance to dictate play as Prakash took points with some beautiful cross-court shots and net-play.The graceful Prakash had to fight in a thrilling second game as Han’s smashes began to win points but his greater array of shots proved the telling factor and he took the game 18-16 on fourth match point.Prakash, the 1979 Masters and 1980 All-England champion, had earlier crushed Han’s compatriot Chen Chang Jie, who beat him earlier this year to win the Santa Clara World Games title.China’s Chen Ruizhen claimed the women’s singles title with a shaky 12-10, 2-11, 11-7 victory over her 17-year-old compatriot Li Liangwei.Chen, the firm favorite after her strong showing in the Masters tournament last month was never in her top form, and her agile young opponent let slip a chance to win.Li opened up a 10-3 lead in the first game with the 20-year-old Chen completely out of touch hitting into the sidelines and netting easy returns.China’s Chen Chang Jie, who lost to Prakash in the semi-final yesterday, defeated Hadiyanto (Indonesia) in straight game to take the third place. Chang Jie won 15-12, 15-10. In an earlier match in the women’s section Ivanna Lie (Indonesia) took the third place when she defeated Wendy Carter (Canada) in straight 11-0, 11-8.The Canadian girl finished fourth. But the more experienced Chen rallied and the nervous Li made a series of unforced errors to go down 12-10. Li again opened up a huge lead in, the second game with some superb whiplash overhead smashes and this time keeping her lead won through 11-2.

11-10-2021||India||‘Air India privatisation will boost confidence in govt’s capacity to close transactions’: CII||The sale of state-run Air India will help to “embolden confidence” in the government’s capacity to close transactions and encourage bidding in future sales at a time when the government is lagging in its disinvestment plans as only around 5% of its annual target has been met so far, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said on Monday.The government on Friday announced that Tata Sons is the highest bidder to win back the country’s flagship carrier Air India (AI) for ₹18,000 crore. This marked an end to its five years of struggle to privatise the debt-laden airline. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this year.According to the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), the government has received ₹9,110.56 through disinvestment so far against a target of ₹1.75 lakh crore.“Air India’s successful sell-off, albeit after multiple efforts, will infuse a fresh vigour to the ambitious plan of disinvestment and privatisation of public sector enterprises,” CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said.Friday’s decision of finally selling off the national carrier indeed marked “a watershed event for the policy discourse on disinvestment and privatization” in India, he said in a statement.“The successful privatization of Air India marks a momentous event and sends out a clear message to the markets and global investors that the present government has the political will to bite the reform bullet,” said Banerjee.“The move also amply demonstrates the trust which the government reposes in the private sector by bringing them at centre stage with its bold privatization program,” he added. With taxpayers contributing over ₹1.1 lakh crore to support the loss-making behemoth since 2009-10, Air India’s privatization is expected to release funds to support the government’s spending efforts in sectors that require concerted hand-holding, he said.“Air India’s successful sell-off, albeit after multiple efforts, will infuse a fresh vigour to the ambitious plan of disinvestment and privatisation of public sector enterprises,” he added.After Air India, the government has lined up other PSEs for strategic sale, including Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), CONCOR and Shipping Corporation of India.The recent announcement on asset monetisation will further bolster the government’s resource raising ability, Banerjee said.“In order to capitalize on the optimism and positive buzz created by Air India sale, the government could now look at fast-tracking its efforts of privatization in the banking space, which would set the direction in an area where reforms have been long overdue,” he said. This is much needed for greater efficiency and scale in banking and the time is right for moving ahead with the privatization of two identified public sector banks, he added. One of the critical building blocks which set up the template for a successful privatization policy was the move to delineate public sector enterprises (PSEs) into strategic and non-strategic sectors in the Union Budget 2021-22, he said. Apart from this, another important aspect of the government’s disinvestment policy includes setting up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for monetising land and giving incentives to states for carrying out similar disinvestment of state PSEs, he said. In this regard it may be useful for the government to “monitor and publish the sales that are taking place through SPVs” to ensure “transparency in deals” and “generating greater interest” from bidders, said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-privatisation-will-boost-confidence-in-govt-s-capacity-to-close-transactions-cii-101633961947313.html
11-10-2021||India||Based on survey: Karnataka minister defends statement on ‘modern women’||Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar on Monday defended his statement on modern women desiring to stay single and unwilling to become pregnant even after marriage saying it was based on a survey.While stating that he was a proud father of a daughter and as a trained doctor himself, he understood the sensitivities around women and mental health issues, he said, “My statement about the younger generation shying away from marriage and reproduction is also based on a survey. The findings of YouGov-Mint-CPR Millennial Survey shows that, among millennials, 19 per cent are not interested in either children or marriage.”The only point I was trying to convey was that our youth can find solution&solace to mental health issues in our traditional family&its value system which offers a wonderful support system. I had no intention to single out women nor did my words mean so: Karnataka Health Minister“Another 8 per cent want children, but are not interested in marriage. Among post-millennials (or Gen Z adults), 23 per cent are not interested in either children or marriage. As in the case of millennials, 8 per cent want children but are not interested in marriage,” Sudhkar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | ‘Mindset of educated, working women have broadened too much’: BJP's CT Ravi on Karnataka minister’s remarkHaving received massive backlash over his statements made during an addressing a programme on World Mental Health Day at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS), Sudhakar said that he had no intention of singling out women or his words did not mean so. “The only point I was trying to convey was that our youth can find solution and solace to mental health issues in our traditional family and its value system which offers a wonderful support system,” he added.Sudhkar said it was widely established through research and studies that, in a situation where the mental health resource was a scarcity, families can form a valuable support system, which could be helpful in management of various stressful situations.“The Indian society is collectivistic and promotes social cohesion and interdependence. The traditional Indian joint family, which follows the same principles of collectivism, has proved itself to be an excellent resource for the care of the mentally ill,” he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/based-on-survey-karnataka-minister-defends-statement-on-modern-women-101633961103981.html
11-10-2021||India||Amit Shah meets with power, coal ministers amid coal shortage concerns||Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday held a meeting with his cabinet colleagues RK Singh and Pralhad Joshi amid reports of the ongoing shortage of coal supply to power plants and several states warning of a possible power crisis. According to news agency PTI, Amit Shah, Singh, who holds the power ministry, and Joshi, who is the coal minister, discussed the availability of coal to power plants and the current power demands during the hour-long meeting. Top officials of the power and coal ministries as well as those from NTPC also attended the meeting.Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said many of his counterparts have written to the Centre about the critical situation at power plants due to the coal shortage. "We all are working together to improve the situation," he said. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar also flagged the issue of probable coal shortage. "It is true there is a problem. As per our requirement, either we get it from NTPC or from private companies," Kumar told reporters. “But the supply is affected now. There are some reasons due to which such a situation has arisen. It is not only in Bihar but also everywhere,” he added.Also read | Decision on power cuts after Oct 19, says Kerala ministerThe power consumption of 3,900 MU on October 8 was the highest this month so far—from October 1 to 9—which also became a cause of concern during the ongoing coal shortage, according to data. The peak power demand met or the highest electricity supply in day touched 172.41 GW on October 8, data also showed. The data also showed that peak power demand met slowed to 170.03 GW on Saturday, indicating that the power demand is moderating with the onset of autumn.This was the fallout of coal shortage at power plants in a year when the country produced record coal, but rains hit movement of the fuel from mines to power generation units, impacting electricity production in several states, including Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Power plants, which used imported coal to generate electricity, have either curtailed generation or completely stopped as a spurt in international energy prices has made it difficult for them to meet the commitments to states at a particular rate.Also read | Power minister slams opposition for ‘unnecessary panic’ over coal shortageThe ministry of coal and Coal Indian Limited (CIL) have assured that they are making best efforts to increase dispatch to the power sector to 1.6 MT per day in the next three days and thereafter, try to touch 1.7 MT per day. It is likely to help in a gradual build-up of coal stocks at power plants in the near future. The coal supply as well as the consequent power situation is likely to improve. "It was noted that on 7th October 2021 total dispatch of coal by Coal India Limited (CIL) touched 1.501 MT, thereby reducing the gap between consumption and actual supply,” the ministry of power said in a statement on Saturday.  The latest data of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) showed that coal stocks at power plants on October 7 were not adequate as 16 plants with a cumulative capacity of 16,880MW had the dry fuel for zero days. As many as 30 plants with 37,345MW capacity had coal for just one day and 18 plants with 23,450MW capacity had coal for two days as of October 7. There were 19 plants with 29,160MW capacity which had coal for three days and nine plants with 7,864MW capacity had coal for four days. Six plants with 6,730MW capacity had coal stock for five days and 10 plants with 11,540MW capacity had coal for six days.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-meets-with-power-coal-ministers-amid-coal-shortage-concerns-101633960241044.html

Lists these reasons||A day after coming down heavily on his Uttar Pradesh counterpart over Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s detention in Sitapur, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Monday mounted yet another attack on Yogi Adityanath. Baghel said there is anti-incumbency against Adityanath's government and he will not be able to come back to power for the second time in Uttar Pradesh. “There is anti-incumbency in the state. From farmers, youth, Scheduled community to traders, everyone is upset with the chief minister... The Yogi government will not retain power,” news agency ANI quoted the Chhattisgarh chief minister as saying during his visit to Uttar Pradesh.On Sunday, Bhupesh Baghel called Adityanath a "coward" for not letting Priyanka Gandhi visit Lakhimpur Kheri following the violence last Sunday and keeping her in custody, reported PTI. Priyanka Gandhi was detained in Sitapur last Monday following her attempt to visit the violence-hit district where eight people, including four farmers, were killed. Baghel made the remarks while addressing the party’s "Kisan Nyay Rally" in Varanasi.Also read: BJP sought votes in cows’ name but did not serve them well: BaghelHe also slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claiming that the ruling party in the state divides people in the name of religion, which he said they "learnt from the British". Training guns at Adityanath, Baghel said he had never known seers to fear anyone but Adityanath proved to be an exception who, he said, was a “big coward”.Elections for 403 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh are scheduled to be held early next year. The BJP came back to power in the state in the 2017 assembly polls bagging 309 seats. The Samajwadi Party got 49 seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 18, and Congress managed 7 seats in the last assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityanath-won-t-come-back-to-power-says-bhupesh-baghel-lists-these-reasons-101633955975701.html
11-10-2021||India||Slack, recovery and overheating: Indian economy has it all||What is the state of the Indian economy? That depends on which part of the economy we are looking at. It also depends on the lag in the availability of relevant data. On the basis of the latest statistics, there is no unambiguous answer.There are parts which show that things, and more importantly, sentiment, are still worse than what they were before the Covid-19 pandemic struck. But there are also indicators that are in the green and stakeholders who are extremely bullish. There are sectors showing a sustained recovery, almost in sync with the dropping trajectory of active Covid-19 cases in the country. These diametrically opposite situations and sentiments face a common problem – cost-push inflation and shortages in international value chains, both of which can generate strong headwinds to growth.A wide gap between consumer confidence and investor confidenceResults of the September round of the Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) of the Reserve Bank of India were published on October 8. The Current Situation Index (CSI) was at 57.7. CSI is calculated by adding 100 to the average of net responses (difference between share of respondents who reported an improvement and deterioration) of general economic situation, employment scenario, price level, household income and overall spending.A CSI value below 100 implies the share of respondents who reported an improvement was less than those who reported a worsening. To be sure, the September CSI value is the highest since the July 2020 round of CCS. However, it is still lower than the May 2020 reading of 63.7. CSI has not been above 100 since March 2019, which was a one-off spike after consecutive below 100 readings since June 2017. These numbers highlight the underlying, perhaps entrenched weakness, on the demand front in the Indian, or urban Indian, economy. CCS is only carried out in 13 major cities.Not everyone is bearish about the Indian economy. Take stock markets, for instance. While the Indian economy is not expected to regain pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the current fiscal year, stock markets remain at a record high. The bull run in stock markets is not just about the formal part of the economy – whose shares are listed in such markets – doing better. There is also a large degree of optimism about the future, which is evident when one compares the price to earnings (PE) multiple for major stock markets in the world. The PE multiple captures the price of a share as a multiple of earnings; the higher the value, the greater is the belief that it will generate higher earnings in the future.The divergence in investor confidence in stock markets and consumer confidence is a good indicator of the class divide in the perception of the Indian economy.The divergence in blue-collar and white-collar incomesNot all the optimism in stock markets is exuberance. The formal sector, especially its white-collared component, has made an impressive recovery. This is best seen in the latest direct tax numbers, not just corporation tax (levied on profits) but also income tax (levied on salaries).Data from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), which gives tax numbers until August, shows that direct tax collections have recovered strongly and are significantly above pre-pandemic levels in nominal terms. On the other hand, data on rural wages – the best proxy for wages of unskilled labour in India – until July, the latest available, shows growth compared to pre-pandemic levels has been much lower.This comparison shows that the trajectory of white-collar and blue-collar incomes is very different in the Indian economy. It is important to understand that most high-frequency indicators of the economy are driven by formal sector indicators, whereas the stress in the informal sector takes time to reflect in economic statistics.Double-digit inflation expectations and hardening supply side constraintsIndia’s carmakers are facing a unique problem. While orders are showing an improvement, they are actually having to trim production. According to an ICICI Securities research note dated October 10, “The auto industry witnessed ~32% QoQ improvement in wholesale despatches in Q2FY22” even as “an increasing number of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) declared production cuts (20-40% demand) despite strong demand.” The note mentions shortages of semiconductor chips and elevated logistics costs as major factors holding back supplies.The shortage in production and rising costs comes at a time when inflation expectations are close to their all-time high in India. While headline retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), fell to 5.3% from 6.3% between June and August, median inflation expectations remained elevated. All three measures – current, three months ahead and one year ahead – were in double digits. These are very high levels historically.With prices of crucial commodities such as crude oil continuing to rise – Brent crude was at $84.23 on October 11 – there is unlikely to be any relief on inflation.A note by Nomura Global markets research suggests that the disruption in global value chains and price pressures might compromise potential gains from exports for Asian economies. “Asian exporters are currently dealing with a problem of plenty. Too strong demand and rolling global supply chain bottlenecks have hobbled their orders and sent freight rates soaring. While supply bottlenecks are a short-term hurdle and tech demand still looks strong, we see storm clouds on the horizon, due to spill over effects from a slowing China and a normalization of goods demand in Western economies, especially the US. In our view, the export cycle has peaked, and a slowdown is likely to materialize next year,” the note said.India’s policy choices during the pandemic prioritised ensuring that the formal sector did not run into problems (by ensuring credit guarantees and liquidity infusion) rather than boosting demand directly (by supporting incomes in the informal sector). The bet could have paid off had the disruption in global value chains and commodity price inflation not emerged as a big disruptor for formal sector activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slack-recovery-and-overheating-indian-economy-has-it-all-101633958046170.html
11-10-2021||India||India announces $200 million line of credit for Kyrgyzstan||India on Monday announced a $200-million line of credit for Kyrgyzstan and signed an agreement to carry out small but high impact projects for community development in the Central Asian state.The two initiatives were among several measures announced by external affairs minister S Jaishankar at the end of a two-day visit to Kyrgyzstan. Jaishankar is currently on a three-nation tour that will also take him to Kazakhstan and Armenia.Jaishankar said the Kyrgyz government accepted India’s formal offer of the $200-million line of credit, while the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on high impact community development projects will enable the speedy implementation of ventures in different sectors with full grant funding. The two initiatives will take the “development partnership to the next level”, he said.Kyrgyz foreign minister Ruslan Kazakbaev and Jaishankar discussed recent developments, particularly the situation in Afghanistan and its implications for the peace and security of the region. “We are closely following the developments in Afghanistan. It concerns all of us. Any instability in Afghanistan will have an impact on the region. There are expectations of the international community from the current regime in Afghanistan, which are adequately elaborated in the UN Security Council resolution 2593,” Jaishankar said.The resolution, adopted during India’s presidency of the Security Council in August, includes provisions for preventing the use of Afghan soil for terrorism and negotiations to create an inclusive government in Kabul.Jaishankar said defence and security cooperation has an important place in India-Kyrgyzstan relations because of a common interest in peace and security. “We evaluated our defence exchanges and personnel training very positively. We agreed to continue cooperation in the fields of high-altitude training and biomedical research,” he said. He announced several other initiatives in fields as diverse as telemedicine and culture. Telemedicine centres established by India have helped people in rural areas connect with medical facilities in cities, and the provision of a Bhabhatron or external beam radiation therapy machine has helped in the treatment of cancers, he said.The Bhabhatron, a computer-controlled system used for radiation therapy, is based in Bishkek, and India is committed to providing another Bhabhatron for a hospital in Osh. India will also support the establishment of three more telemedicine centres in Batken, Jalal-Abad and Chui regions of Kyrgyzstan.Jaishankar said the two countries had agreed to explore joint development projects in eco-tourism, jewellery design, pharmaceuticals, medicines, medical education, IT parks and data banks as part of their growing development partnership.He said both countries need to make a concerted push to boost trade and investments. “The signing of the new bilateral investment treaty in 2019 and the mutual agreement on the date of entry into force of the Amended Protocol of the India-Kyrgyz Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement are important steps in that regard,” he added. Kazakbaev and Jaishankar also agreed on steps to preserve and promote cultural links. Noting that the Indian side has organised several events as part of the Year of India-Kyrgyz Cultural Exchanges, Jaishankar said the picturesque lakes and peaks of Kyrgyzstan “offer excellent destinations for Bollywood productions”.India was one of the first countries to recognise the independence of Kyrgyzstan after the break-up of the erstwhile Soviet Union and establish diplomatic relations in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-announces-200-million-line-of-credit-for-kyrgyzstan-101633956906934.html

The group's district vice-president Balkar Singh outlined that except the leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella group of protesting farmers' unions, no other politicians will be allowed to be present on stage.“No political leader will be allowed to share the stage where only Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders will be present,” Balkar Singh said.District president Sandhu said that farmers and their leaders from various states as well as from several districts of Uttar Pradesh will be present during the ‘ardas’ and ‘bhog’ programme in Tikonia. He said no other programme barring ‘antim ardas’ and ‘bhog’ has been communicated till now.Eight people were killed on October 3, including four farmers, a local journalist, two BJP workers and the driver of the SUV, were among the others who died that day.Farmers claim that Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles. Ashish Mishra was sent to three-day custody of the Uttar Pradesh police on Monday. The UP police got Ashish Mishra’s custody between October 12 and October 15. He was arrested on Saturday by the Uttar Pradesh police.The death of the farmers have turned Lakhimpur Kheri into a battleground ahead of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly elections slated to take place next year. Several politicians like Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Akhilesh Yadav and Sushmita Dev have visited the kin of the deceased farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-politician-will-be-on-stage-during-final-prayers-says-farmers-group-101633955823477.html
11-10-2021||India||Decision on power cuts after Oct 19, says Kerala minister||Kerala government's minister for power and electricity K Krishnankutty on Monday said that the government will decide on imposing loadshedding after October 19. Krishnankutty also said that Kerala is facing a shortage of 100MW currently.“The state is trying to meet the demand-supply gap through an automated management system and also by purchasing electricity at higher prices. The government will take a decision on imposing power cuts on October 19,” Krishnankutty was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The state power minister on Sunday said that the government will have to resort to loadshedding in case shortage of power from the Central pool continues. He said that on Sunday Kerala received only 30% of its daily quota from Koondankulam.Coal shortage, which could have been caused due to excess rainfall hitting coal movement and imported coal-based power plants generating less than half of their capacity due to record high rates, sparked fears in few states and Union Territories of blackouts.The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) officials last week said that a shortage of 15% was manageable but once the shortage exceeds beyond 20% then the department will have to think about load-shedding.“We are experiencing a shortage of 120 MW to 900 MW on certain days. Today, the estimated shortage is around 200 MW,” the officials said on Sunday where they assured that the state will not resort to load- shedding right away.“Currently, it's manageable. Due to rains these days, the power consumption during the peak hour has come down,” a KSEB official was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Meanwhile in Delhi, power minister Satyendar Jain said the National Thermal Power Corporation(NTPC) plants halved power supply to the Capital. “NTPC which supplies us 4000 MW power has reduced it to half currently. This has led us to generation of power through gas that costs ₹17.25 per unit,” Jain said.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi vowed not to let power cuts affect his state and said that he has asked Centre to ensure adequate supply of coal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-on-power-cuts-after-oct-19-says-kerala-minister-101633954426555.html

11-10-2021||India||Ashish Mishra remanded in 3-day police custody in Lakhimpur Kheri violence case||The Uttar Pradesh police on Monday got three-day custody of Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra ‘Teni’, for his alleged role in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.The court of chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram allowed Uttar Pradesh the custody of Ashish Mishra between October 12 and October 15.Senior prosecuting officer SP Yadav said that as per Supreme Court guidelines, no coercion or torture would take place and Ashish Mishra may have a lawyer of his choice during interrogation but the lawyer would watch the process from a distance so that no interference is caused.The Uttar Pradesh police arrested Ashish Mishra on Saturday despite his attempts to evade the law enforcement agencies. He was then interrogated for nearly 12 hours following which a local court remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days.However, the Uttar Pradesh police sought Ashish Mishra's police custody and he was produced before the court earlier in the day. Two other accused, Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, known to be close aides of Ashish Mishra, were arrested on Thursday.The arrests followed hours after the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to submit a report within a day on how many arrests have been made so far in connection with the case.Eight people, included four farmers and a local journalist, died during the violence after an SUV belonging to Ashish Mishra and a convoy of cars mowed down a group of protesting farmers from behind at Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella of farmers' unions, alleged that one of the deceased farmers was shot dead by Ashish Mishra while the rest were allegedly run over by the vehicles of his convoy. The Union minister and his son, however, denied the claims.Refuting the allegations levelled by the SKM, the minister said that his son was not present at the spot, and claimed that he had evidence to prove that Ashish was innocent.

Access to clean water is one of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs.Six states and Union territories have come out on top with 100% coverage so far, the data show. These are Andamans and Nicobar Islands, Dadra And Nagar Haveli, Goa, Telangana, Puducherry and Haryana. Haryana is the latest state to achieve the target ahead of schedule.Although the mission’s deadline is over two years away, some large states have been able to cover less than a quarter of total rural households, the data show. Among them is Uttar Pradesh, which has covered 12.74% of its 26.4 million rural households so far. The state has drawn up a largescale engineering project to extend tap water connections in Bundelkhand, one of the driest parts of the country.However, in terms of overall households covered, Uttar Pradesh has been the slowest in implementing the programme. Uttar Pradesh is key to improving India’s overall health parameters, especially among little children, because it is India’s most populous state.The Bundelkhand leg of the Jal Jeevan Mission comprises 467 piped drinking water schemes under 32 projects. Of these, 43 are surface water-based schemes and 424 are ground water-based. “The UP government has completed about 80% work of water treatment plants in various districts of Bundelkhand including Jhansi and Mahoba. The construction work is almost complete in more than 50% of our plants,” said UP principal secretary Anurag Srivastava in a text message.Bihar, a peer state, however, has been speedily able to expand coverage, currently at 88.23% of ts 17.2 million households.Rajasthan, among the laggards, has been able to reach 20.91% of its 10.1 million rural families. It falls among a handful of states and UTs where coverage has been less than 25%, including Assam (22%), Ladakh (16.62%), Jharkhand (15.16%), West Bengal (13.48%) and Chhattisgarh 13.23%).These states also have some of the poorest health outcomes in the country, according to HT’s analysis.For instance, the six states with less than 25% coverage have shown a seven percentage point increase in the incidence of child malnourishment, data from Phase I of the National Family Health Survey 5 released last year shows, in comparison to the previous National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-16). Some regions have achieved rapid progress. For instance, there has been a four-fold increase in the rate at which functional piped water is being provided to households in India’s 117 so-called aspirational districts, home to some of the poorest Indians -- overtaking the pace at which piped water is bring provided nationally under the Jal Jeevan Mission.The data shows nearly a third of households in these districts have assured tap water supply. The coverage in these districts since the launch of the programme saw a 24% jump, a rate higher than the 22.7% increase in tap water connections provided countrywide under the scheme.“The nature of topography and availability of a sustainable water source are key parameters that could be a reason why some states are ahead. I think it is better to go slow and build more sustainable sources than building unsustainable sources in a hurry,” said Aadil Aqueeb, a coordinator for India Coalition for Water Sustainability, a non-governmental outfit.An official requesting anonymity said the Union government monitors progress closely jointly with states. “Frequent meetings are held. Most states are working to deadlines, while six have achieved the target (100% coverage) well ahead of schedule,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-large-states-need-to-ramp-up-jal-jeevan-mission-data-show-101633949886793.html

Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant, model and anchor Munmun Dhamecha, and two others arrested with them - Nupur Satija and Mohak Jaswal - approached the Special NDPS Court on Monday after a Metropolitan Magistrate Court rejected their bail application on Friday.Senior counsel Amit Desai and advocate Satish Maneshinde on Monday mentioned Aryan’s bail plea for urgent hearing.“We have already served the bail applications, electronically and physically to the Narcotics Control Bureau on Friday. We request the court to hear the matter at the earliest,” said Maneshinde.“My client has been in their custody since last Saturday. They have recorded only his statement twice and after which they didn’t question him. They can investigate, the matter bail doesn’t stop their investigation. The magistrate court has already sent them to judicial custody. He was not found in possession of anything or any material and is the only person in the first group arrested by the agency from whom they didn’t recover anything. The magistrate court rejected their bail application only on the grounds that it didn’t have any jurisdiction. Justice needs to be done,” said senior counsel Amit Desai who appeared for Aryan Khan.“Admittedly the maximum punishment is a year’s imprisonment,” said Desai.Avadhut Chimalkar, along with Advait Sethna, appeared for the NCB and sought time to file replies to the bail applications.“We need at least seven days to file replies as there are eight accused. Everybody has a different role and a different affidavit needs to be filed for them. The case is the same, there is a conspiracy and therefore all bail applications need to be heard together. They added that the investigation is still going on and Aryan is been sent to judicial custody. Whether his release will affect the investigation is also a question. There is no urgency in this matter,” said Chimalkar.Desai told the court that family members are also not allowed inside the court building due to Covid-19 guidelines. We need them to take instructions.Additional Sessions Judge VV Patil adjourned the matter to Wednesday asking the NCB to file a reply on the bail applications.The NCB arrested Aryan Khan and others on Sunday afternoon.

Tamenglong borders with Assam’s North Cachar hills district and Nagaland’s Peren district.“We’ve seen the arrival of these birds over our village sky since yesterday (Sunday),” says Ramkhonang Gonmei , chairman of Puching village. “They arrived a bit early compared to last year.But we’re yet to ascertain where they slept last night.”The first batch of Amur falcons have also arrived at Pangti village in Nagaland’s Wokha district a few days back, reports said.Though the residents in Tamenglong,the hill district headquarters, 150km west of Imphal are yet to report sighting the migratory birds in their areas, the divisional forest officer (DFO) Kh Hitler of Tamenglong forest division shared pictures and videos of Amur Falcons hovering in the sky in a WhatsApp group on Monday.The DFO said the conservation related work of village authority on the Amur falcons roosting sites are now recognised by the state government authorities.“We need to continue our work of safeguarding our winged guest, and surely the sacrifice and contribution of the villagers and the local NGO shall get global recognition as well,” he added. “It is our fundamental duties under the Constitution of India to protect forest, wildlife, rivers, lakes etc and to have compassion for living beings.”Two villages of Chiuluan and Puching of Tamenglong district will also be awarded the state government incentive award for wildlife conservation on Monday in a concluding function of 66th wildlife week in Imphal,he said.Also Read: Bihar plans census of Gangetic dolphins in ArariaAmur falcons, locally known as Akhuaipuina, which migrate to their wintering grounds in South Africa, usually arrive in large numbers during October in Nagaland and Manipur besides a few other places in northeast India, undertaking a yearly journey of about 20,000 km.They leave the region in November after having enough food for their non-stop flight to Africa where they spend their winters.Considering the migration period of these pigeon-sized birds in Tamenglong areas as “crucial in the life cycle of Amur falcons,” the then deputy commissioner of Tamenglong had banned hunting,catching,killing and selling of Amur falcons.The radio-tagging programme of Amur falcons was also started in Manipur by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in collaboration with Manipur forest department in 2018 as part of an initiative to conserve wildlife and also to study their migratory route.In 2019, a five-member WII team had radio-tagged five Amur falcons, including two males.The radio tagged birds were named ‘Chiulon’, ‘Puching’ and ‘Phalong’ after villages in Manipur, and ‘Irang’ and ‘Barak’, rivers of Manipur.In May this year, two radio tagged Amur falcons – Chiulon and Irang were traced to have reached their breeding area in North East China after their annual migration flight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amur-falcons-the-longest-flying-migratory-birds-begin-to-arrive-in-manipur-101633945805487.html

11-10-2021||India||NCRB says over 99% crimes registered in 2020 under POCSO Act were against girls||More than 99 per cent of crimes registered under the POCSO Act in 2020 were against girls, according to NCRB data which showed that girl child continues to be part of one of the most vulnerable sections of the society.An analysis of the latest NCRB data by NGO Child Rights and You (CRY) revealed that among 28,327 children who were victims of crimes reported under the POCSO Act, 28,058 were girls.A deeper analysis of the cases reported under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act showed that crimes against adolescent girls within the 16 to 18 age group were the highest at 14,092, followed by 10,949 crimes against girls within the 12 to 16 age group.Though both boys and girls are almost equally prone to abuse, the NRCB data revealed that girls irrespective of all age-groups are more vulnerable to sexual offences than boys.On the occasion of International Day of the Girl Child on Monday, CRY said girls are being celebrated all across the world and much being talked about their rights but they continue to be one of the most vulnerable sections of the society as shown by the NCRB data.According to the latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) last month, more than 99 per cent of crimes committed in 2020 under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act were against girls.Priti Mahara, the director of policy research and advocacy at CRY, said recent trends of girls bearing the brunt of crimes against children should not be seen in isolation."It is vital to understand that along with the protection-related challenges, aspects linked to education, social protection, poverty, etc. also play a significant role in the empowerment of the girl child; and assessing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on these parameters is equally crucial,” she said."During the crises, girls face multiple vulnerabilities – their access to education is further restricted and they become more exposed to the risks of child marriage. They are also more likely to experience violence and sexual exploitation in multiple forms and degrees," said Mahara.Emphasising on the emerging need of a strong child protection mechanism, Mahara said over the past few years, some progress has indeed been made in terms of girls' education and strengthening child protection systems, but the pandemic has derailed the growth.Since the vulnerability has now increased multifold, chances of girls dropping out of the education system and falling from the protection safety-net has correspondingly increased, she added.Mahara said girls, particularly the ones in their adolescence, face many protection risks during and after any humanitarian crisis."Given the immediate and long-term risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of the hour is therefore to reinforce gender responsive protection interventions and ensure that these are implemented to the fullest,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncrb-says-over-99-crimes-registered-in-2020-under-pocso-act-were-against-girls-101633941706256.html

ISpA, Prime Minister Modi observed, will act as a single-window and independent agency on matters related to space technology.Also Read | PM Modi to launch Indian Space Association todayPM Modi laid out what he described as “four pillars” of space technology: freedom for innovation in private sector, a government which plays the role of enabler and not handler, preparing youngsters for future, and treating the space sector as a resource for the progress of the common man. “This the time for exponential, and not linear innovation. This is possible only when the government plays the role of an enabler, and not the handler. Today, the government is sharing its expertise, and providing launch pads for the private sector. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is being opened for the private sector,” he said.He also emphasised how the space sector earlier used to be synonymous with the ruling dispensation, adding that it was his government which changed this mindset. “We introduced innovation to this field. We also gave the mantra of cooperation between between the Centre and start-ups,” Prime Minister Modi said. The Prime Minister also noted that ISpA's launch was taking place on a day when the world celebrates the International Day of the Girl Child. Recalling the celebrations of women scientists involved with India's Mars mission, he said he was hopeful that reforms in space sector would encourage more women participation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-single-window-for-matters-of-space-technology-pm-modi-at-launch-of-ispa-101633931789447.html

Hospital authorities said patients and vaccine seekers may have stayed home fearing disruptions and difficulty in travelling. “Monday is the busiest day of the week in OPDs but the footfall was down by nearly 50% due to the bandh,” said Dr Sarika Chapane from BYL Nair Hospital, where approximately 1000 patients showed up on Monday. Chapane said that routine surgeries were not postponed. Similarly, KEM Hospital and Sion Hospital too saw a drop in the footfall at their OPDs.

11-10-2021||India||'A success': NCP spokesperson says on Maharashtra bandh, demands Union minister be sacked||The Maharashtra bandh, called by the state’s ruling alliance of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress in solidarity with farmers, has been a success, said NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Monday. Nawab Malik claimed that the complete shutdown has been supported by "all major political parties, organisations and labour unions."Shops and other commercial establishments were closed in Maharashtra on Monday as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) observed a complete shutdown to mark their solidarity with the farmers who are agitating against the Centre's three farm laws. It also comes in the backdrop of Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh, in which eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed on October 3.Speaking to the media at Hutatma Chowk in Mumbai, Malik also demanded the resignation of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish Mishra is the main accused in the violence case. Ashish Mishra has been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. “The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi demands that Union minister Ajay Misha be sacked," Malik, a Maharashtra minister, said.Amid the shutdown, Malik and other NCP leaders, including Supriya Sule and Jayant Patil, are at Hutatma Chowk to stage a demonstration against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and to extend their support to violence-hit farmers. "The major reason behind the bandh is that the BJP government neglected the farmers' protest at the borders of Delhi, but the Lakhimpur incident is a clear murder," said Patil, adding, "They were killed by a BJP minister's son."He further alleged that the BJP is attempting to "crush the farmers' agitation, which is ongoing since the enactment of the farm laws last year in September. "To condemn the incident we have called this bandh. I am sure the Lakhimpur Kheri incident will be condemned by each and every family," he also said. “The BJP has unfortunately opposed it. It means they are supporting those who have murdered the farmers by mowing them down," he added.On October 3, an SUV ran over farmers who were returning from a protest. The incident led to widespread condemnation in the country as it involved the Union minister's son. The opposition parties have attacked the BJP government in UP and said that it is trying to protect the culprits. The matter has also reached the Supreme Court and a suo-moto hearing is being held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-success-ncp-spokesperson-says-on-maharashtra-bandh-demands-union-minister-be-sacked-101633932783578.html

11-10-2021||India||20 thermal power stations shut, Centre says no coal scarcity: 10 points||The Centre has assured that there are sufficient coal reserves in the country to produce electricity, but that hasn't stopped state governments to flag concerns about shutting down of thermal power stations due to scarcity of coal. According to Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan, three thermal power plants in Punjab, four in Kerala and 13 in Maharashtra have been shut.The chief ministers of Karnataka and Punjab have urged the Centre to increase coal supply.The Congress has blamed the central government for the coal shortage in the country and expressed fear that power rates may be increased now after the hike in petrol prices.Also Watch | 'Unnecessary panic': Centre assures Delhi of uninterrupted power supply after CM Kejriwal's SOSHere are the key developments in this big story:1. The Union power ministry said in a statement on Sunday that fears of a power crisis in India are overblown. The ministry of coal said "ample coal is available in the country to meet the demand".2. Union power minister RK Singh reviewed the coal stock position at all thermal power plants on Sunday. Reports earlier said that over half of 135 coal-fired utilities, which supply more than half of India's electricity, have fuel inventory to last just under three days.3. The Centre's rebuttal came after concerns were raised by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Delhi could face power outages if the central government did not quickly resolve the coal shortage at power plants. He sought the intervention of the Prime Minister to resolve the crisis.4. After the Union power ministry's statement, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the Centre was not ready to accept there was a coal crisis. Its policy to “turn a blind eye” to every problem could prove to be bad for the country, he added.5. Former Union minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh demanded an investigation into the coal shortage.6. Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh energy minister Pradhuman Singh Tomar on Sunday claimed that the state stood at a better position. The minister also said that the state government has floated tenders to purchase eight metric tonnes of coal for its power stations.7. In Punjab, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal slammed the Congress-led government, alleging that the current crisis was entirely “man-made” and a direct consequence of the ruling dispensation’s “utter neglect and absence of advance planning and preparedness”.8. Power supply situation continued to remain grim in Punjab with the state-owned utility PSPCL on Sunday saying up to three-hour daily power cut will remain in the state till October 13.9. In a year when the country produced record coal, excessive rains in coal producing belt hit movement of the fuel from mines to power generation units, impacting power generation in many states including Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh.10. Another factor that has contributed to the present crisis is power plants that used imported coal to generate electricity, have either curtailed generation or completely stopped as a spurt in international energy prices has made it difficult for them to meet the commitments to states at a particular rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-thermal-power-stations-shut-centre-says-no-coal-scarcity-10-points-101633923917479.html
11-10-2021||India||India-China military dialogue on East Ladakh stalled, PLA refuses to budge||The India-China senior military commanders' marathon dialogue on Sunday did not yield any result with the Chinese Army not willing to address de-escalation in three remaining friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in East Ladakh. The remaining friction points are Hot Springs, Depsang Bulge and Charding Nullah Junction.It appears from the statements issued by two armies that the Chinese PLA was not inclined to go beyond the de-escalation agreed in the 12th round of dialogue. The Chinese statement is sanctimonious and asks India to cherish the past resolutions.“Instead of misjudging the situation, the Indian side should cherish the hard-won situation in China-India border areas,” Senior Colonel Long Shaohua, spokesperson for the Western Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), said in a statement on Monday.The Indian side pointed out during the talks that the situation along the LAC had been caused by unilateral attempts of Chinese side to alter the status quo and in violation of the bilateral agreements. It is, therefore, necessary that the Chinese side take appropriate steps in the remaining areas so as to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the Western Sector, India further said.The Indian statement added that this would also be in accord with the guidance provided by the two foreign ministers in their recent meeting in Dushanbe where they had agreed that the two sides should resolve the remaining issues at the earliest.The Indian side emphasised such resolution of the remaining areas would facilitate progress in the bilateral relations.The 13th round of parley began at 10.30am on Sunday at Moldo on the Chinese side of LAC, according to officials. It came more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement in early August of deployed troops at Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the flashpoints of the border skirmishes.Officials had earlier said that disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at Hot Springs was on the agenda for the latest round of talks.The parley comes at a time of massive military buildup and infrastructure development by the People’s Liberation Army across the LAC, with the Indian Army matching Chinese moves.In February, the two sides pulled back troops and weaponry from Pangong Tso in Ladakh. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-military-dialogue-on-east-ladakh-stalled-pla-adamant-on-progress-101633922540954.html

11-10-2021||India||Centre permits export of 4 million doses of Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine to Russia||The central government has given permission for the export of India-made jabs of Sputnik Light, the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) originally developed by Russia, to that country. According to reports, this decision was taken because Sputnik Light, which is the single-dose formulation of the double-dose Sputnik V, is yet to be given emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).Hyderabad-based Hetero Biopharma, one of several firms in India that the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has partnered with for manufacturing the jab domestically, will produce 4 million doses for export. The development comes after the Russian ambassador, Nikolay Kudashev, wrote to the Centre, urging that till the time Sputnik Light receive EUA in India, its doses be sent to his country, to prevent their wastage.The decision to permit the export was taken last week following “detailed” deliberations, reports said.Sputnik V, which Russia claims is the world's first registered vaccine against Covid-19, received clearance from the DCGI in April at a time when the nation was in the middle of a devastating second wave of the pandemic. However, the drug regulator is yet to approve Sputnik Light, though, in September, it granted permission to Dr Reddy's Laboratories, also based in Hyderabad, to conduct phase 3 bridging trials of Light in the country.The single-dose vaccine demonstrated an efficacy of 79.4 per cent during trials in Russia, from December 5 last year to April 15 this year. (With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-permits-export-of-4-million-doses-of-sputnik-light-covid-19-vaccine-to-russia-101633918245775.html

The stock is replenished every day. I am in touch with (Union minister for Coal and Mines) Pralhad Joshi,” RK Singh said following his meeting with the power distribution companies in Delh and stressed that there was no “crisis” of power supply in Delhi.On Sunday afternoon, Congress Member of Parliament Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “Suddenly we are hearing of a crisis in coal supply to power plants. Is one particular private company making a fortune out of this crisis? But who will investigate?”RK Singh hit out at the Congress saying the party had run out of ideas. “They are running out of votes and therefore are running out of ideas as well,” Singh was reported as saying by news agency ANI.He also dismissed Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s concerns over a potential power crisis in the union territory, which had led the CM to seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention.Also Read | Power crisis in Punjab a result of administrative paralysis: Sukhbir BadalThe power minister met officials from Delhi’s power ministry, Bombay Suburban Electric Supply (BSES) company, and Tata power on Sunday to discuss the issue of coal shortage in power plants.

There were six Covid related deaths in the city on Sunday, taking the number of fatalities in the past 10 days to 48. Experts attribute the slight rise in cases in Mumbai to the reopening of activities including local trains, schools, commercial establishments and also increasing volume of passengers in trains.Since last week, active Covid cases in Mumbai have overtaken Thane, which earlier had the second highest number of active Covid cases in the state after Pune.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said although cases have gone up slightly in Mumbai, deaths are under control.Also Read: Maharashtra bandh today over Lakhimpur Kheri violence“Covid-19 cases have risen slightly in Mumbai, but their intensity has been very less due to vaccination,” said Dr Awate.“We have also been able to bring down the number of Covid deaths significantly,” he added.Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, said this is normal phenomenon in any pandemic. “Any pandemic will have a plateau phase and there will be minor fluctuations in numbers for some weeks before it settles down completely.

11-10-2021||India||What does SAS tell us about India’s animal farms?||Have tractors finally replaced bullock carts and private dairies the milk-animal in the Indian farmer’s house? Vigilante groups (“gau rakshaks”) claiming to be protecting cows have been making news (for the wrong reasons) in the past few years in India. But how many “gau palaks” — those who keep cows at home — are there in India? How big are animal farms and animal farming in the business of farming in India?HT has analysed unit-level data from the latest Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India (SAS) to answer some of these questions. The SAS was conducted in the calendar year 2019 and gives data for the July 2018-June 2019 period on animal farming.A Rajasthan farmer is about thrice as likely to have an animal as his Telangana counterpartThe SAS only looks at households which meet the criterion set for agricultural households. This requires at least one member to be self-employed in agriculture and an output in specified agricultural activities of ₹4,000 (in 2018-19) in the past 365 days.Just as not all farmers are counted as agricultural households, not all agricultural households which have an animal at home – this excludes pets – qualify for the animal farming household (AFH) category in the SAS. Only those agricultural households are considered in AFH category that received some value of output – such as milk, wool, live animals, or even manure -- from animal farming.An estimated 60.2 million out of the total 92.5 million agricultural households or 65% qualify for the AFH category in the entire July 2018-June 2019 period. Data on ownership of animals was, however, only collected when data on agricultural households was being collected with reference to July-December 2018. During this period, 58% households were engaged in animal farming, but 71% owned some kind of livestock (excluding pets).However, there are significant state-wise differences in whether or not an agricultural household qualifies for the AFH category. Among major states, the share of AFHs among agricultural households was 90% in Rajasthan. This number was just 34% in Telangana. Cows and hens, not buffaloes and goatsWhat are the most common animals in India’s animal farms? 45% of India’s agricultural households own cattle, 27% own buffaloes and 14% have poultry birds. Ovine and other mammals (sheep, goat, pig, rabbits, etc) are owned by only 19% of agricultural households. In terms of estimated numbers, cattle and poultry birds outnumber other animals. An average agricultural household owned 1.35 cattle and 1.34 poultry birds compared to 0.90 ovine and other mammals and 0.71 buffaloes.Nearly a third of Other Backward Classes (OBC) agricultural households (32%) own buffaloes, much higher than the 15%, 23% and 32% share for Scheduled Tribe (ST), Scheduled Caste (SC) and agricultural households not belonging to SC, ST or OBC groups. The share of agricultural households owning buffaloes is 2.3 times the share owning cattle in Haryana. Poultry ownership is nil in Haryana compared to 60% in Assam. Size of land-ownership is an important factor in deciding cattle and buffalo ownership though not in case of poultry. Is there a problem of stray cattle in Indian villages?Anecdotal accounts suggest that it is a huge problem. Does the SAS offer any clues on this question? Deductive reasoning suggests that it does. 73% of cattle and 85% of buffaloes owned by agricultural households are female. This means that cattle and buffaloes are largely kept as milk animals and not for working on farms.Such a skewed gender ratio is unlikely to be the result of natural causes. This leaves disposal – either by selling or abandoning -- of male cattle and buffaloes by agricultural households.The SAS shows there is a compelling economic case for doing so. Animal ownership, especially cattle and buffalo ownership, is strongly correlated with land ownership. Intuitively, this makes sense. Animals, like humans, need space to live. Also, cattle feed entails a financial burden. It was 84.4% of a typical AFH’s total expenditure on animal farming in 2018-19. To be sure, not all female cattle and buffalo generates income for the AFH. The SAS found that only 27% of cattle and 37% of buffaloes were giving milk at the time of the survey. Even among female cattle and buffaloes, this figure was 37% and 43%, respectively. This is bound to hurt the net income of such a household. The ownership of in-milk female cattle among OBC and non-SC-ST-OBC households was more than twice that of SC households.Animal farmers are more likely to use poultry than milk for self-consumptionCommercial farming is not the driving force behind India’s animal farmers or AFHs. 49% of the value of total value of output is consumed by the household itself. To be sure, the SAS definition of own consumption includes retention for future sale or for use as animal ‘seed’. Also, share of animal output used for self-consumption varies significantly across products. It is around 45% in the case of cattle and buffalo milk, 60% case of poultry, but just 9.9% for fish and nil for live sheep or goat. The regional divide in India’s dairy economyIn Gujarat, the home of Amul, which pioneered the cooperative revolution in India’s dairy economy, 64% of the milk produced by AFHs is sold to cooperatives. Gujarat is not the only state where cooperatives have a strong presence in the dairy sector. In Kerala and Karnataka too, around 50% milk is sold to cooperatives. Then there are states such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, where private processors buy more than 40% of the total milk produced. At the other extreme are states like Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand, where neither cooperatives nor private businesses have a strong footprint in the milk economy and 3/4th or more of milk production is consumed within the household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-sas-tell-us-about-india-s-animal-farms-101633906804471.html
11-10-2021||India||India chasing new Tuberculosis vaccines after 100 years||Chasing India’s target of eliminating tuberculosis by 2025, scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research have recruited about 12,000 participants for a phase III study of two potential vaccines.The researchers want to see how effective the vaccines are in preventing the disease in adult household members of a person newly diagnosed with TB. The participants from across seven sites in India will be monitored for three years before the potential vaccines are approved for use commercially or under the national TB programme.“Recruitment in the middle of a pandemic was a huge challenge for us because we had to motivate healthy people in a household where TB was detected to come to the DOTS centres for vaccination,” one of the scientists said on condition of anonymity. DOTS, or directly observed treatment, is the name given to the TB control strategy recommended by the World Health Organization.“For Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics, the initial results can start coming in within months,” the researhcer said. “But TB is a long-term illness, and we will have to observe the participants for a longer duration to arrive at any result.”One of the vaccines being tested to prevent tuberculosis of the lungs is Immuvac, which was developed to prevent leprosy. Immuvac, also known as mycobacterium indicus pranii, displays antigens similar to both the leprosy bacterium and the TB bacterium.The other vaccine candidate is VPM1002, a recombinant BCG that is the most widely used vaccine in the world. The new vaccine developed in Germany has the genetic code of the BCG edited in a way that leads to better availability of the TB antigens, thus training the immune system to better fight tuberculosis.Another trial of the same candidate is underway to prevent recurrence of TB in adults. VPM1002 is also being tested to see whether it can offer protection against Covid-19.The BCG vaccine currently in use is a live, weakened form of the bacteria to train the immune system. It is only for use in children. Although it offers protection against the most severe forms of tuberculosis such as TB in the brain, it is not very effective against getting an infection, reactivation of a latent infection, and against the most common form of TB in the lungs. Yet, in the 100 years since the vaccine was developed, there have been no alternatives.Experts say the government’s push towards eliminating tuberculosis and the formation of a research consortium are the reasons for the focus on TB vaccines.“Unlike Covid-19 that affected the rich and the poor countries alike, tuberculosis disproportionately affects those in poorer countries and from poorer neighbourhoods,” said Dr DJ Christopher, professor of pulmonary medicine at Christian Medical College in Vellore, and former chair of RePORT India, a consortium for Indo-US collaborative TB research. “There is not enough interest or funding for research of a TB vaccine.”India’s strategy to eliminate TB hinges on funding 3-4 vaccine candidates for phase I or II trials and have at least one final product co-owned by the government by 2025.“Studying TB is not very popular. The government’s focus on elimination has certainly helped,” said Dr Pradeep D’Costa, intensivist and head of ICU care at KEM hospital in Pune, where he is heads the trial of VPM1002. “Vaccines will be an important contribution to the programme, but there is still ways to go,”Even though research into TB vaccines is a step in the right direction, for now the mainstay of the elimination programme is early detection of new cases, testing for drug resistance and treating the disease completely, experts say.“We don’t yet have effective vaccines. The vaccines currently being developed are also for specific populations, such as those at high risk of TB. And even then they are likely to take years to reach the market,” said Dr Christopher.Vaccines are unlikely to be an important tool in the fight against TB in the foreseeable future, he said. “What we need to focus on instead is point of care testing. Tests such as CBNAAT and TrueNat are more sensitive than microscopy. They can also detect whether the TB is drug resistant,” the professor of pulmonary medicine said. “We need to make these tests the first line of diagnosis across the country.”India is unlikely to achieve its 2025 target, Dr Christopher said. “We would not have made the 2025 target even without the pandemic,” he said. “With the pandemic, the timeline has been pushed further by probably five years.”There was a 25 percent decline in the number of TB cases reported in 2020, government data show. It was mainly due to the lockdown and fear of going to health care facilities due to pandemic, experts said.In addition, there have been challenges such as several centres in India reporting a shortage or stock-outs of CBNAAT cartridges. “There were some issues with the procurement of the CBNAAT cartridges,” an official from one of the biggest TB centres in Delhi said on condition of anonymity. “Because of the shortage of the reagents, many of the centres under the TB programme could not perform the test.”“With Covid-19, TB has definitely taken a back seat, but we are slowly moving in the right direction,” Dr D’Costa said. “Our national programme is fairly widespread and the MDR (multi-drug resistant) detection kits are now available even in rural centres. There is also a need to ramp up counselling of patients and their family members because the stigma is still high.”“Focus group discussions with our own staff showed that there was still significant stigma about TB. Many doctors did not notify their cases to the government,” said Dr Dinesh Kumar, former professor of community medicine at Government Medical College in Jammu. “The stigma is the community is likely to be higher. We need to address this in order to detect cases early on.”“In addition, we have seen when we carried out active case finding, we were able to detect several latent TB cases that otherwise would not have reached a health centre,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-chasing-new-tuberculosis-vaccines-after-100-years-101633905903593.html

11-10-2021||India||Bombs hurled at car of Odisha opposition chief whip, minister condemns attack||Senior BJP leader and opposition chief whip Mohan Majhi on Sunday had a close shave when two bike-borne men allegedly hurled two country-made bombs at his car in Keonjhar district while he was returning from a public meeting.The Keonjhar MLA was returning from a labour union meeting at about 1 pm, when two bike-borne miscreants came and hurled bombs at his vehicle near Mandua under Town Police station area. The front panel of the vehicle was partially damaged in the attack, but Majhi and his driver sustained no injuries.“I had gone to the office of the Utkal Sambad of the Siksha Vikash Samiti near Mandua to attend the executive meeting of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. After attending the meeting, I was on the way to my house at Mandua when two young men intercepted my vehicle. One of them in a black shirt got off the bike and hurled two bombs at my vehicle. He also tried to take out a pistol but was chased away by my PSO. They then fled towards the railway station,” Majhi said.Majhi alleged that local BJD leader Raja Chakra was behind the attack as three weeks ago he had issued a threat to him while addressing a party meeting in the Keonjhar Sadar block. However, Chakra said the allegations of his involvement in the attack on Majhi were false and baseless.Later Majhi lodged a complaint with the Keonjhar Town police. Following the incident, tension ran high in Keonjhar town as hundreds of BJP activists staged a road blockade on National Highway-49 at Gandhi Chhak by burning tyres.“During my 20 years of career in politics, I might have developed political enmity. But I don’t have any enemies at a personal level,” said Majhi.Later Union education minister and senior BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted that the attack on Majhi showed how the law and order in the state was deteriorating. “There will always be a difference of opinion in a democracy, but attacking a public representative is a matter of concern. As the minister for home department, the chief minister should take strong action,” tweeted Pradhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombs-hurled-at-car-of-odisha-opposition-chief-whip-minister-condemns-attack-101633897981131.html
11-10-2021||India||Temple located in no-man’s land between India and Bangladesh preps to celebrate Durga Puja||A 150-year-old Durga Temple located in no-man’s land between India and Bangladesh near Assam’s Karimganj district is all set to host the Durga Puja festival. The temple was a part of Narendra Malakar’s property. He was a landlord during the British period. In a demarcation drive, a border was drawn between the house and the Durga Temple of Narendra Malakar. The area came under fencing in 2008 and a year later BSF jawans discovered the temple. With the help of locals they started Durga Puja celebrations there which attract thousands of devotees during the festival every year.During Pujas, the BSF opens the border gate from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm every day where only devotees are allowed to enter. An on-duty BSF official said, “Not only locals, our jawans celebrate Navratri by offering puja in this temple. We have people from various parts of India in our force and this temple beyond fencing unites everyone. We only allow devotees to go beyond the fencing gate during the festival.”Apu Malakar, a local resident informed that the Durga Temple was established by Narendra Malakar’s forefathers almost 150 years back. They were landlords during the British period and Durga Puja used to be a week-long celebration.“We have heard stories that artists from Kolkata and Dhaka used to attend this Durga Puja during the British period. Narendra Malakar died a few years after Independence and the family reduced the size of the celebration. When the last decedent of the family, Hriday Ranjan Malakar died in 1994, the puja was officially stopped,” he said. About the reopening of the Durga Temple he said, “In 2008, the area came under Border Fencing and BSF camps were made. One day an on-duty BSF official called us and said that he saw something in that area. A year later one official of BSF called the villegers and asked to reopen the temple. The temple was half broken and BSF officials helped us to reconstruct this. Since then we are conducting Durga Puja where BSF officials also take part spontaneously. Last year more than 10 thousand devotees visited the temple, this year the number may climb higher.”Locals made a committee to take care of the temple and BSF officials helped them. The area near the temple has started getting basic facilities like electricity and better mobile network with the help of BSF officials. Champak Malakar, president of the Manikpur Durga Puja committee said, “This puja helps us to get united. The officials from various parts of India join us as fellow devotees. They helped us to improve the common lifestyle here. Maa Durga is blessing us from beyond the fencing.”President of Manikpur Durga Puja committee, Parimal Malakar informed that people from entire Karimganj district extend their support to conduct this Durga Puja. He said, “Initially the puja started with the help of BSF but later a lot of people started visiting the temple. We needed money to arrange prasad. Now a family pays the amount for making the idol. Some other families give groceries for cooking khichdi (which is distributed as prasad during puja). Last year, we didn’t distribute khichdi due to Covid-19 but this year things are better.”Karimganj shares a 92 km-long border with Bangladesh, mostly with Sylhet district of that country. Manikpur Durga Mandir is the only temple located on no-man’s land in the district. Apart from that, there are nine Indian villages located beyond the fencing. But only in one such village, Durga Puja is celebrated. The village named Gobindapur has 44 Indian families, 42 of them are Hindu houses and they used to conduct Durga Puja before the pandemic. Local resident Titu Namasusra said, “Till 2019 we organised Durga Puja but due to Covid-19, we stopped it temporarily. We don’t take support from outsiders; it’s our own Durga Puja. If the situation allows, the puja will be conducted next year.”The other villages beyond fencing in Karimganj are, Lafashail, Jarapata, Latukandi, Kuorbag, Mahisaahan, Tesua, Barmagul and Deo Tuli. The BSF allows residents of those villages to enter into Indian land for various purposes. They conduct monthly Covid-19 tests for each villager. But according to the BSF officials, no person has been found positive till now.Champa Rani Namasusra, a 50-year-old resident of Gobindapur informed that they went through a tough time during lockdown but things have started normalising. “BSF officials closed the gate permanently during lockdown. But they supplied food and also allowed NGOs to send us essentials. Our children are now going to school after crossing the fencing gate. We all have taken the vaccine for Covid-19 and we were allowed to go to government hospitals for that. It’s sad that we cannot conduct Durga Puja this year but it’ll happen once the situation normalises.”Several organisations like Ram Krishna Mission Seva Samiti, Lions Club have distributed new clothes amongst residents of these villages before Durga Puja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temple-located-in-no-man-s-land-between-india-and-bangladesh-preps-to-celebrate-durga-puja-101633896541015.html
11-10-2021||India||Monsoon withdraws from NW India, says IMD||Monsoon has withdrawn from most parts of northwest India and conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal from some more parts of Gujarat, Chhattisgarh; most parts of Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar; Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal during next 2 days said the India Meteorological Department on Sunday.Monsoon commenced withdrawal on October 6 compared to the normal date of September 17 but in the past four days it has almost withdrawn from half of the country, including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and parts of Gujarat, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.“Even in years when monsoon onset is slow, monsoon withdrawal can be quick. It’s because no low pressure system has formed that can bring further rain. So after cyclone Gulab and associated low pressure system crossed there was no other system bringing rain. However, we are expecting a low pressure area to form north Andaman Sea which is likely to cross the Odisha coast. This system may slightly delay complete withdrawal of monsoon and bring rains up to Maharashtra,” said DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD, Pune.“Withdrawal of monsoon is very fast this time. We expect monsoon to withdraw from most parts of the country during the next 3 to 4 days but there is a slight chance that the low pressure area over Andaman Sea could intensify in to a cyclone or a depression which can bring a lot of rain,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather. There is no cyclogenesis warning from IMD yet.According to the IMD bulletin, a cyclonic circulation is lying over north Andaman Sea and neighbourhood. Under its influence, a low pressure area is likely to form over the same region during next 36 hours. It is likely to become more marked and move westnorthwestwards towards south Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh coasts during subsequent 4-5 days. Under its influence, light to moderate rainfall is likely at most places with isolated thunderstorm (wind speed 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph) and heavy to very heavy rain likely over Andaman & Nicobar Islands during next 5 days, .A cyclonic circulation is also lying over east-central Arabian Sea and is likely to persist during next 3-4 days and an east-west trough (area of low pressure) is at lower levels running from the cyclonic circulation over north Andaman Sea to cyclonic circulation over eastcentral Arabian Sea, said the IMD in its bulletin. Widespread and moderate rain with isolated heavy rain is very likely over southern peninsular India during next 5 days and over Maharashtra during next 2 days. Very heavy rain is very likely over Kerala and Mahe till October 14, said the IMD.The country received “normal” rainfall during the four-month Southwest Monsoon season from June to September. All India monsoon rainfall from June 1 to September 30 has been 87 cm against the Long Period Average of 88 cm of 1961-2010 (99 percent of its LPA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-withdraws-from-nw-india-says-imd-101633892483980.html

Coronavirus is certainly under control but it has not gone away,” Mandaviya said at the launch of Covid-19 field hospital here.He appreciated the Karnataka government for its preparedness to deal with any health emergency caused by Covid-19 in future.“Dealing with an outbreak of disease depends on the thinking of the government. The Karnataka government has decided to set up dedicated field hospitals in remote areas, which shows how prepared it is to deal with the outbreak in future,” Mandaviya said.He also hailed the state government for taking vaccines to the household level and achieved its vaccination target in a remarkable way. “I congratulate the Chief Minister that 83 per cent of eligible population got the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine administered in the state,” the Union Minister said.According to him, the Indian Council for Medical Research panel has said that those who took first dose of the vaccine become 97 per cent safe, Mandaviya said. He also lauded Karnataka for the maximum Covid-19 vaccinations on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday. “The way the vaccination drive took place in Karnataka and the vaccine was taken to every village are remarkable. A large state like Karnataka has carried out its fight against Covid-19 in an exemplary way,” Mandaviya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-let-guard-down-against-covid-warns-mansukh-mandaviya-101633893720667.html
11-10-2021||India||Four held in two cases of moral policing in Karnataka: Cops||Four people have been arrested in two separate cases of moral policing in Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada Shivamogga districts, police said on Sunday.Two people have been arrested in Dakshina Kannada after they stopped a car on Saturday and questioned travellers as to why they got into a vehicle driven by a person of another faith, police said.According to Moodbidri police officials, a Muslim couple travelling in a car saw two friends and offered them a lift since they were heading towards the same area.After the four travelled a short distance, two people on a motorcycle intercepted them and questioned the women as to why they need to sit in the car of a Muslim person. Though police arrived at the scene, the two people, Samithraj and Sandeep Poojary, continued to abuse the two women and the Muslim couple.“The two persons have been booked in a case of rioting and public nuisance based on a woman’s complaint,” a police official said, requesting not to be named. “Both were produced before the court and are currently in judicial custody.”In Shivamogga, two people were held on Saturday on charges of moral policing after they allegedly assaulted a Hindu man for dropping off a Muslim woman on his two-wheeler on Saturday, police said.Karnataka has reported many cases of moral policing and hate crime recently. In a case of hate crime, a 24-year-old Muslim, who was in a relationship with a Hindu woman, was found decapitated on railway tracks in Khanapur in Belagavi district, about 505 kms from Bengaluru, on September 28.While police had initially registered a case of unnatural death, they later filed a murder case after a post-mortem report revealed injuries on the head. The woman’s parents had hired contract killers. Police arrested 10 people, including the parents of the woman, on Friday.In June this year, a 19-year-old interfaith couple was found with their heads smashed in Vijayapura district. The woman’s parents did not approve of her relationship with the man from a minority community. On September 18, Bengaluru police arrested two people in a case of moral policing, where a biker was assaulted for riding with a woman of a different faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-held-in-two-cases-of-moral-policing-in-karnataka-cops-101633893422464.html

The party has made it clear that the list will be lean, not a jumbo one, and many leaders are anxious about their positions and group equations. There were enough fireworks when the District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents were announced in August. There was a spate of resignations and disciplinary action taken. Sulking former state president VM Sudheeran had resigned from all party posts including the membership of the All India Congress Committee. And senior leaders like Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala aired their displeasure in public. “The new list will be lean and mean. It will be a mix of both, young and experienced. After the new DCC presidents’ elevation, changes are visible on the ground. We will transform the party as a well-oiled machine and make it battle- ready,” said state party chief K Sudhakaran denying chances of another revolt in the party. He said he had extensive talks with senior leaders before finalizing the list. Now the party has 100-odd secretaries, many vice-presidents and other office-bearers. But the new PCC committee will have only 50 members and their work will be monitored closely, said Sudhakaran. He said he’s planning to transform the party a semi-cadre outfit and hard work and organising capacity will be main criteria for leaders. Recently the party had conducted a workshop for the new DCC presidents in the state capital. Earlier factions were supreme in the party and leaders filled maximum posts with their cronies to maintain group equations and often the party took a backseat. Leaders who were not part of these powerful blocs were either ignored or side-lined. But the party was forced to carry out major changes after the humiliating defeat in the April assembly elections. It decided to clip the wings of powerful groups by installing a new crop of leaders. It appointed K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from the Communist heartland Kannur as the PCC president and another grassroot leader V D Satheesan as the opposition leader side-lining two powerful blocs led by former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala who ruled the party for more than one and a half decade. Many see it as a major generational shift but group leaders refuse to buy it saying it is difficult for the party to surge ahead by side-lining senior leaders like Chandy and Chennithala. But the party has rallied behind the new leadership and supported its moves to impose discipline in the party. Two days back, the party had issued show-cause notices to 97 leaders for their alleged lapses during the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/factionridden-congress-sees-uneasy-calm-in-kerala-as-pcc-list-is-prepared-101633893301972.html

11-10-2021||India||Congress dares RJD to form government in Bihar without its support||The rift between the grand alliance partners Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress widened on Sunday after All India Congress Committee in-charge for Bihar Bhakta Charan Das dared the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for form government without the Congress’s supportin the state and said that the impact of split in the coalition would be visible in the upcoming by-elections. Talking to media persons at the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) office on the sidelines of a crucial meeting of party seniors for by-elections in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, Das said, “RJD would need the support of 19 Congress legislators if it wants to form the government...We are still in the alliance. But the breakup of the Grand Alliance (GA) would have its perceptible bearing on the by-elections’ result.”The bypolls to the two assembly seats are scheduled to be held on October 30 and the two parties have fielded their own candidates for the two seats..The Congress has fielded Atirek Kumar, the son of the party’s stalwart Ashok Kumar from Kusheshwarsthan (reserved for the scheduled caste) in Darbhanga and Rajesh Kumar Mishra from Tarapur seat in Munger. They are pitted against the JDU’s Aman Bhushan Hazari and Rajiv Singh and RJD’s Ganesh Bharti and Arun Kumar Sah. A senior AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha said that the RJD’s strength in the Lok Sabha dipped to 4 against 22 in 2009, when it parted ways with the Congress and teamed up with Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP in the parliamentary polls. “Likewise, RJD’s tally in the assembly dipped to 22 in 2010 against 54 in 2005, when it rejected the Congress’s tie-up proposal and continued its alliance with the LJP,” said Jha. Chairman of the election campaign committee of the BPCC Akhilesh Prasad Singh claimed that the party was sure to wrest both the seats, as both the NDA and the RJD was grappling with internal crises. “We are working with renewed vigour in the wake of break up in the coalition,” said Singh. RJD spokesman Shakti Singh Yadav said that they (RJD) had to go alone, as its repeated pleas to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to strengthen the alternative at regional levels failed to yield any result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-dares-rjd-to-form-government-in-bihar-without-its-support-101633892280502.html

This resulted in an argument, after which Aman drove his Ford Endeavour SUV over six people, killing two of them — 42-year-old Raj Rani and 55-year-old Subhash Chand. The other four have been hospitalized, officials said.Raju, a nephew of the deceased Subhash, said the accused would often drive at high speed in their locality in Karnal’s Nilokheri area. He said they had raised the issue with Aman’s father but no action was taken. “Aman was angry after we asked him to drive responsibly as he used to drive very fast in the neighborhood. We had earlier raised the issue of rash driving with his father but he did not take it seriously,” Chand’s nephew Raju (who goes by one name) said. Butana police station in-charge Kanwar Singh said a case has been registered against Aman and his father Balvinder Singh under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 302 (punishment for murder) “Police teams have been formed to arrest the accused,” Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asked-not-to-drive-rashly-haryana-man-runs-over-6-of-family-2-dead-cops-101633891440308.html
11-10-2021||India||At least 500 detained and questioned in J&K over killing of civilians||Police in Kashmir have detained and questioned at least five hundred people and many in the past few days to investigate the series of civilian killings in valley since October 3.Suspected members of banned terrorist groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami have been interrogated to trace their roles in the murders. “It is true that we have called some people and we are verifying the involvement of locals,” said Udaybhaskar Billa, deputy inspector general of police, north Kashmir. Local residents said police have detained many people in Hajin, a town in Kashmir, after family members of deceased Mohammad Shafi Lone, president of a local taxi union, identified some people who had attacked him. “Right now it is not appropriate to talk about the case,” Billa said. Dilbag Singh, director general of police, Jammu and Kashmir, and Vijay Kumar, inspector general of police, Kashmir, did not take calls from Hindustan Times. Kashmir has been restive since October 3 after the murder of seven persons, including three belonging to minority communities in the Union Territory.Suspected terrorists on Thursday killed two teachers – Satinder Kour and Deepak Chand – of a government school in Srinagar’s old city. They were killed two days after Makhan Lal Bindroo, a 68-year-old chemist, street vendor Virender Paswan from Bihar’s Bhagalpur, and Lone were shot dead in Srinagar and Bandipora districts on Tuesday. On Saturday evening, gunmen opened fire at Majid Ahmad Gojri, a resident of Chattabal Srinagar, and Mohammad Shafi Dar, a resident of SD Colony Batamaloo, killing them both. The central government has sent the Intelligence Bureau’s counter-terror chief Tapan Deka to the valley to oversee the fight against terrorism after the recent killings. Counter-terror teams of other national security agencies have also been sent to Kashmir.As many as 28 civilians have been killed by terrorists this year, Kumar said on Thursday. “Out of the 28, five persons belong to local Hindu and Sikh communities and two non-local Hindu labourers,” he said, without mentioning that the remaining 21 slain people were Muslims.“These acts are committed by newly recruited terrorists, or those who are about to join the terrorists’ ranks. In some cases, OGWs (over the ground workers of terrorist organisations) have been found directly involved,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-500-detained-and-questioned-in-j-k-over-killing-of-civilians-101633891201497.html

I believe that Kashmiris will expose the elements who are trying to divide Kashmiri society on communal lines,” he said while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Baramulla. “I also have full confidence that people will stand together irrespective of their religion to pull out the anti-national elements,” he said. The officer reiterated that the Line of Control (LoC) is absolutely secure and there is no need to worry about it.In the recent past, several targeted killings have taken place in Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists over the last five days. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) backed new Kashmiri terror group ‘The Resistance Front (TRF)’ is suspected as the prime terror outfit behind targeted killings in Jammu and Kashmir in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recent-killings-an-attempt-to-divide-kashmiri-society-says-goc-of-chinar-corps-101633891140336.html
11-10-2021||India||EC plans to do away with in-person verification for voter registration||Voters will find it easier to register themselves as the Election Commission of India is planning to make changes in the process, eliminating the need for in-person verifications, said people familiar with the development.Electors will be allowed to file documents online, which will be then verified by the electoral watchdog. “Five or six core documents will be declared, and if voters agree to share those online, then there will be no need for booth-level worker verification,” one of the people said.The Commission is also planning changes to several forms that are used to register voters, including form six, seven and eight. “There is a form 8A, which may be discarded completely,” the person said, requesting anonymity. Form 8A is used for electors who want to transfer their voter ID card from one location to another. The Commission is planing a separate process to shift voter ID card to a different state.The Commission is also working on a remote voting system, where people will be allowed to vote from a different state in case they can’t make it in time for the polls. A prototype of the system has already been seen by the Commission, but a final call on its viability will be taken only after consultation with political parties.The move to remove booth-level verification would be revolutionary, according to former chief election commissioner VS Sampath. “It will be a good move, as it will streamline the process more,” he said. “There are many times when one person is at home and the other isn’t. That makes it difficult for people to verify their identity in-person.”The Commission will continue its usual voter registration process, but an alternative will be provided for people to hasten the process. “It’s voluntary for people who want to get their voter ID cards sooner,” the person said.Addressing concerns regarding the storing of data, a second person said that the Commission has been handling personal data for sometime now. “The data will be secure,” the person said, declining to be named.Elections in Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are due next year.The changes are a part of a slew of electoral reforms. The Commission met law minister Kiren Rijiju in August to discuss the reforms, which include linking Aadhaar unique identity numbers to voter ID cards, and providing multiple registration dates for voters.“The law minister was briefed on several of the reforms that are pending with the ministry,” a person said on the condition of anonymity. “Once the amendments are drafted, they will hopefully be introduced in the winter session of Parliament,” HT reported in August.The Commission, comprising of chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, has been pushing for the reforms. Chandra wrote to the law ministry in May to “expedite them”.The Election Commission of India is pushing for at least five key electoral reforms, including making paid news an electoral offence, linking Aadhaar numbers to the electoral roll , and increasing the punishment for filing a false affidavit to two years of imprisonment, and has written to the government in this regard, HT reported on June 8.There are nearly 40 proposals pending with the law ministry.The Commission has been considering a wide range of electoral reforms to usher in digitisation, removing duplication of voters, and enabling remote voting for non-resident Indians (NRIs) and even migrant workers within the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-plans-to-do-away-with-in-person-verification-for-voter-registration-101633891022147.html
11-10-2021||India||5 years on, IIT-Goa awaits allotment of land for permanent campus||New Delhi Five years since it was opened through a bill amendment, the Indian Institute of Technology in Goa (IIT-Goa), which functions from Farmagudi, is awaiting land allotment for the construction of a permanent campus, officials familiar with the developments said.Between 2015-2016, six new IITs were established in Tirupati, Palakkad, Dharwad, Bhilai, Goa and Jammu through the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2016, to provide more opportunities to students who aspire to join the country’s premier engineering institutes. While the other five IITs have either already shifted to their permanent campuses or are in the process, IIT-Goa continues to share the campus with a state-run engineering college in Farmagudi.The delay has not only affected the day-to-day functioning of the institution but also created uncertainty among faculty members and students, the officials cited above said.“It has become a long wait for the institute now. The delay has created a sense of uncertainty among faculty members. In the last two years, we have seen that students with lower all-India ranking are opting for IIT-Goa. It was not the case initially,” director BK Mishra said.Initially, officials said, the land was identified in Lolium part of south Goa in 2016 but the plan failed to materialise after residents protested against it.Later in 2019, a land in Sanguem was identified but not finalised “in view of various difficulties encountered in procuring/acquiring and transferring the land to IIT-Goa”.In 2020, a third site was identified in Shel-Melalui and Guleli villages. The state government, however, in January this year scrapped the project at the location following continuous protests, which turned violent on one occasion after villagers hurled stones and police responded with lathi-charge. The villagers claimed that their cultivation would be affected by the project.Several faculty members told HT that the absence of a permanent campus was depriving the Goa unit of several opportunities.“There are a number of research and funding schemes of the central government but for that, you need space to apply for it. Because we have no permanent campus, we are not getting any such project,” associate professor Sharad Sinha said.“Besides, we are not able to get sponsored-research projects because to get such projects, one should have the necessary resources in terms of lab infrastructure to carry out the consultancy work. Some of these have visited us but when they visited our temporary campus, they did not offer anything,” Sinha added.The faculty also said that due to limited space, the institute has not been able to introduce additional courses.“We were thinking of starting programmes in civil engineering and materials engineering but they need large laboratories. We have set up just the most-needed labs in our curriculum in the space we borrowed from the college we are sharing the campus with.We are not being able to recruit people despite having enough faculty-sanctioned strength,” a faculty member said, preferring anonymity.Currently, the institute offers four courses at the undergraduate level, three courses at the postgraduate level and PhD programmes in several disciplines.“Due to limited space, the institute is not able to buy and install elaborate technical equipment. We are mostly working with tabletop equipment with limited capability just to hold demonstrations for our students,” the faculty member added.Students at the institute also complained along similar lines. While IIT-Goa has built accommodation on the shared campus for undergraduate and postgraduate students, there is no residential space for PhD scholars.“The PhD scholars in other IITs are given quarters to live with their family. But here I am, living with my 4-year-old daughter at a distance of 7-8 km. It’s not only affecting my research work but also becomes difficult to continue at the personal level since I had to pursue my family a lot to use this opportunity. Other IIT campuses have creches for kids but here, we don’t have that due to the paucity of space,” Prachi Kashikar, 31, a research scholar at the institute, said.The faculty said it has sent multiple requests to the education ministry over the years and in July, a representative also visited the Prime Minister Office, in this regard. The institute hopes to get a land ahead of the new academic session scheduled to begin in November.When contacted, a senior official at the ministry who did not wish to be named said, “We had been regularly sending reminders to the state government to expedite the process of allotting the land.”Goa revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar, a member of a committee that was constituted by the state to allocate land for the project, said, “We are searching for suitable land for the project. We expect something to come up in the next few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-years-on-iit-goa-awaits-allotment-of-land-for-permanent-campus-101633890961400.html
11-10-2021||India||Will keep fighting till MoS Mishra resigns over Lakhimpur violence: Priyanka||VARANASI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday said her party workers were not afraid of anyone and asserted, “we will keep fighting until the (Union) minister of state for home resigns”, in a reference to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed on October 3.The Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday arrested Ashish Mishra, son of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, on charges of murder in connection with the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, where a vehicle, reportedly owned by Ajay Kumar Mishra, mowed down protesters while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village. Farmers allege that Ashish Mishra was in the lead car that ran over people. The junior home minister and his son deny the allegation. Addressing her party’s Kisan Nyay Rally in Varanasi, she also lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he visited Lucknow for the Azadi Ki Amrit Mahotsav event marking 75 years of Independence but could not go to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the families of the farmers who were allegedly mowed down by the minister’s son.“PM Modi visited Lucknow but could not go to the farmers’ homes to wipe the tears of aggrieved families and share their miseries. You are celebrating freedom, but who gave freedom? Freedom has been given by the sons of farmers. What is the meaning of this festival?” she asked.The Congress general secretary also said that she will not stop until she throws “this government” out of power in order to bring a positive change and development in Uttar Pradesh. The state assembly election is due early next year.Priyanka said, “The whole country has seen what happened in Lakhimpur Kheri. The son of the minister of state for home brutally trampled farmers under his vehicle. When I met the aggrieved families of the farmers, they told me that they don’t want money, they want justice.” Priyanka alleged that instead of taking action against the accused, the entire state government was engaged in protecting the son of the minister.The entire administration was busy stopping the opposition, she said, alleging that the families of the victims were also placed under house arrest and a huge police force was deployed outside their houses.“But not even a single person took a step to ensure the arrest of the minister of state’s son. Have you seen in any country or in this country that invitation was sent to the person, who trampled farmers, for interrogation? Such a thing never happened in the history of this country,” she said in reference to the police sending summons to Ashish Mishra twice before he finally appeared for questioning and was arrested. She alleged that the state chief minister was defending the minister’s son. “This country is a faith. This country is hope. The country got independence in the hope of justice. When Mahatma Gandhi went to fight for freedom, it was in his heart that the poor, downtrodden and all should get justice. Our Constitution is based on justice. But in this country, everyone has lost hope of justice,” she said and alleged that the government was not taking action against criminals.She also mentioned the past incidents of Sonbhadra, Hathras and Unnao in Uttar Pradesh.In all three incidents, people associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party were involved, she alleged, adding that instead of taking action, the BJP government in the state tried to protect the accused. Priyanka also said farmers were agitating for 300 days against the Centre’s three new agri laws and once these laws were implemented, the “billionaire friends” of the government will capture their agricultural lands. “Our Prime Minister may go to every corner of the world. He may go to America. But he could not go to meet the farmers at Delhi border, just 10km from his residence in Delhi,” she said. Stating that while two planes were bought for the PM for ₹16,000 crore last year, the Congress general secretary alleged that the government sold the national carrier Air India to “billionaire friends” for just ₹18,000 crore.“Our Prime Minister, who calls himself Gangaputra, has insulted the Gangaputras. Farmers are deeply troubled. Stray animals are destroying their crops. Is he aware of this problem? But I have seen it,” she said. Priyanka tried to connect with the people by raising issues like rising electricity bills and said farmers are not getting the price of paddy and wheat.“GST (goods and services tax) has been imposed on farming equipment. Petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices are skyrocketing. Coal is running out. Unemployment is at its peak,” she said.She also said only BJP leaders and their billionaire friends were safe in the country.“This country is your country. Who will save this country? If you do not become aware, you will not become wise. If you remain entangled in their politics, you will not be able to save this country and yourself. You are a farmer. Your hard work has made this country. Those who call you agitators, those who call you terrorists, force them to give justice, ” she said.“We, the workers of the Congress are not afraid of anyone. Whether you beat us, whether you put us behind bars, we will keep fighting until the minister of state for home resigns,” she asserted. Before addressing the rally, Priyanka offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath, Annapurna and Durga temples in Varanasi.She started her speech with a prayer to the goddess Durga.“It is the fourth day of Navratri today. I am fasting today. So I want to start with the stuti (prayer) of Maa,” she said and chanted a prayer.She also said “Jai Mata Di” thrice and the crowd followed.Hitting back at Priyanka Gandhi, Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Anila Singh on Sunday said she should first gather knowledge and give advice to her brother Rahul Gandhi. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra does online politics. Just like work from home, she does politics from home... Priyanka ji should first fix all the issues of her party... And, instead of giving advice to the Prime Minister, she should first gather knowledge. She should give advice to her brother. She should go and see what is happening with Dalits and farmers in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-keep-fighting-till-ajay-kumar-mishra-resigns-over-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-in-varanasi-101633890783666.html
11-10-2021||India||Varun Gandhi warns against ‘Hindu vs Sikh’ narrative in Lakhimpur violence||New Delhi BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Sunday warned against attempts to turn the Lakhimapur Kheri incident into a “Hindu vs Sikh battle”, saying it is dangerous to create these fault lines and reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. The Pilibhit MP, who was recently dropped from the BJP national executive, said the struggle for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri is about the “cruel massacre of poor farmers in the face of an arrogant local power elite”, and the issue has no religious connotations. “To use the word ‘Khalistani’ liberally to describe the protesting farmers is not only an insult to the generations of these proud sons of the Tarai who have fought and shed blood on our borders, it is also extremely dangerous for our national unity if this provokes the wrong kind of reaction,” he said. In a tweet, he said, “An attempt to turn Lakhimpur Kheri into a Hindu vs Sikh battle is being made. Not only is this an immoral & false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault-lines & reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity.” Police had arrested Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, in connection with the October 3 Lakhimpur violence. Farmer organisations have blamed the father-son duo for the incident and are alleging that the minister had made a provocative speech while his son was inside a vehicle that hit farmers. Both have denied the allegations. Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit last Sunday. Two BJP workers and their driver were allegedly lynched by angry farmers in retaliation. Local journalist Raman Kashyap also died in the violence, which has triggered a political storm and put the BJP government on the back foot in poll-bound UP. Gandhi has been sympathetic to the farmers’ cause over their protests against three agricultural laws and often tweeted in their support, a stand which is said to have not gone down well with the BJP leadership.

11-10-2021||India||SC should strike down sedition law, portions of UAPA: Justice Nariman||The Supreme Court should strike down the colonial-era sedition law so that citizens of India can breathe more freely, said former Supreme Court judge Rohinton F Nariman on Sunday. The retired judge, who in 2015 quashed Section 66A of the Information Technology Act in 2015 for having the “chilling effect” on the right to freedom of speech, also called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act a “draconian legislation” that requires to be scrutinised by the apex court.“I would exhort the Supreme Court to not send sedition law cases pending before it back to the Centre. Governments will come and go (but) it is important for the court to use its power and strike down Section 124A and offensive portion of UAPA. Then citizens here would breathe more freely,” said the retired judge, speaking at a function organised by Viswanath Pasayat Memorial Committee. Justice Nariman was emphatic that the top court should not refer the clutch of petitions pending before it on the sedition law to the central government and that it should assert its power of judicial review to strike down the contentious Section 124A (sedition) in the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The penal provision is punishable with a jail term ranging between three years and life term, with or without a fine.Justice Nariman also explained how UAPA came into the statute book after India’s wars with Pakistan and China. “We had China and Pakistan wars. Thereafter, we introduced the draconian legislation, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. UAPA is a draconian Act as it has no anticipatory bail and has minimum 5 years imprisonment. This Act is not under scanner yet. This too has to be looked into along with the sedition law,” he said.During his address, the former judge, who retired in August after seven-year tenure in the top court, narrated the history of the sedition law, pointing out that sedition was not there in the original draft of the IPC. “Sedition provision was there in draft but not in final book. But it was later discovered and redrafted. It was said that this section was left out by oversight. The wordings were also vague. Sentence under 124A was enormous as it was transportation for life and imprisonment for three years,” he said.Justice Nariman then recounted how the British used the law against Indians including prominent freedom fighters. “There was the Bangobasi case. In that, an editor of newspaper Bangobasi was charged for publishing an article that spoke against the age of consent act in relation to child marriages. The author (of the article) said that child marriage was inherent to Indian culture. British judge was not charmed and therefore, held that editor was liable under Section 124A,” he added.The judge also mentioned how freedom fighters such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were convicted for sedition for speaking against the colonial government.“Gandhiji said affection (towards government) cannot be measured by law. He said disaffection should be given full hand unless it leads to violence. He said he considered it a privilege to be charged under Section 124A,” said justice Nariman, adding that Gandhi was sentenced to six years and he served two years behind bars while Jawaharlal Nehru too served jail terms in 1932 and 1934.He also spoke at length about how Tilak was tried for sedition on more than one occasion, with Mohammad Ali Jinnah acting as Tilak’s defence counsel on one occasion.The former judge also described how sedition was initially part of the exception to free speech under draft Article 19 of the Constitution. It was debated extensively before being dropped from the Constitution. But it, however, continued to remain in the Indian Penal Code.“Then Supreme Court in Kedarnath Case (1962) ultimately said if we can read a particular provision in a particular way so long as disaffection was coupled with call for violence, only then it would be sedition,” said the former judge. Justice Nariman also pointed out that RSS-backed Organiser magazine had to undergo pre-censorship in 1950 by the Nehru administration for speaking against the government. Sedition law and UAPA have a chilling effect on journalists, said justice Nariman.On July 15, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana rued the “enormous power of misuse” of the sedition law in India and asked the Union government why it should not scrap a colonial law that was once used by the British government to oppress the freedom movements and leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The court observed that indiscriminate use of Section 124A (sedition) in the Indian Penal Code is like a saw in the hands of a carpenter who cuts the entire forest instead of a tree.The government’s top law officer, attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, on his part, submitted that the entire section need not be struck down, and the court could lay down strict guidelines so that the provision meets its legal purpose. The court then sought a response from the central government on the bunch of petitions that pressed for striking down Section 124A. The case is yet to be heard next.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-should-strike-down-sedition-law-portions-of-uapa-justice-nariman-101633890720494.html
11-10-2021||India||PM Modi most democratic leader of India: Union home minister Amit Shah||New Delhi: Narendra Modi is the most democratic leader India has ever seen, as he is a good listener and takes every decision only after consulting everyone, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday, refuting assertions that the Prime Minister takes unilateral decisions on important matters. This incorrect perception of Modi taking unilateral decisions and not listening to anyone has been deliberately created by some people from rival ideologies to damage his image, Shah said. “Yes, he takes some risks and insists on discipline, but he never imposes his will while taking important decisions related to governance and policy,” Shah said in an interview to state-run Sansad TV on the occasion of Modi completing 20 years in public service on October 7. “Modi believes, and he has said this multiple times, that we have not come to just run a government, but to build India.” Those who have worked with Modi, including his critics, will agree that the cabinet of ministers has never been run in such a democratic manner, Shah said. “I have never seen a good listener as Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He listens to everyone, gives importance to the quality of the suggestion(s) rather than the person who has suggested it, and then takes a decision,” the home minister said. “The final decision rests with him, but of course, he is the Prime Minister.” Several opposition leaders have over the years called the functioning of Modi as ‘dictatorial’ over decisions like demonetization, announcement of nationwide lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic in March last year, abrogation of Article 370 that conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir, on farmer protests or alleged attacks on free speech. Demonetization, annulling Article 370 and the law banning triple talaq were some of the bold decisions of Modi, Shah said in the interview. He said that the surgical strikes on Pakistan in response to terror attacks “was out of the question” before Modi came to power. Modi has changed the dimensions of politics in the country, said the closest aide of the Prime Minister, and that is why there are personal attacks on him. Modi gets his confidence “from the fact that citizens of India know he has no personal interests and that he only works for the country”, the home minister said. “Modi gets stronger every time he is attacked.” Shah took a swipe at the Congress party, saying some parties considered it their right to rule the country and cannot digest the fact that Modi is successfully running the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-most-democratic-leader-of-india-union-home-minister-amit-shah-101633890661957.html

The party deleted the post shortly after.Ashish Mishra, son of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, was arrested by Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday after he was accused of being part of the convoy that ran over the farmers when they were returning after a demonstration. He is in judicial custody and a local court will decide on Monday whether he should be sent to police custody.“The shocking incident of broad daylight massacre of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri has shaken the conscience of the entire nation. A delegation of the Congress party headed by Shri Rahul Gandhi seeks an appointment with the honourable President, on priority, to present to him a detailed memorandum of facts,” the Congress party had posted on its Twitter handle, sharing an image of its letter addressed to the Rashtrapati Bhavan.The delegation will include leaders such as KC Venugopal, AK Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, as well as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, according to the letter dated 9 October.The social media team of the party did not immediately respond to a query on the deletion. A Congress leader on the condition of anonymity said there are still discussions over meeting the President.The Congress has attacked the government for not acting on the killings that took place on October 3 when farmers returning from a demonstration against Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya were run over, killing four of them. Two workers of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a driver of minister Mishra and a local journalist were killed in the resulting melee, taking to toll to eight.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Congress Rajya Sabha parliamentarian Deepender Hooda tried to reach the spot, but were detained in Sitapur before they could reach the violence-hit district. They were arrested shortly after.A day later, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, met the families of the slain farmers. The chief ministers announced financial compensations for the families, and the kin of the journalist, Raman Kashyap.The Supreme Court has expressed dissatisfaction at the way in which investigations into the violence were being conducted. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana asked the Uttar Pradesh government to direct its state police chief to ensure evidence in the case is protected till the time another investigative agency takes over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-tweets-seeking-appointment-with-president-ram-nath-kovind-over-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-later-deletes-101633890601499.html

But the police will produce him before the court again on Monday and seek his police remand.A police officer privy to the investigation said the nine-member team headed by deputy inspector general (DIG) Upendra Agarwal tried to establish the sequence of events based on the CCTV feed.He said the probe team also visited Banbirpur, the village of the minister, and recorded the statements of several people there.Additional director general (law and order) of police Prashant Kumar said on Sunday that Lakhimpur police have applied for the custody remand of Mishra to interrogate him further about the incident and that he was arrested after he could not give satisfactory answers during interrogation.Another police officer said on condition of anonymity that Mishra submitted multiple videos about his presence in the village but could not produce an alibi for 64 minutes—2.36pm to 3.40pm on October 3. He said Mishra’s cellphone was seized and a video recording of the entire process was done by the probe team.Meanwhile, Lakhimpur Kheri district jail superintendent P P Singh said Mishra was kept in quarantine barrack number 21 designated for new jail inmates. He was being provided with all facilities permissible to every prisoner.Earlier on Thursday, ADG Kumar had said the police identified six people as accused—three of them died in the violence, two others named Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey who was arrested on Thursday, and Ashish Mishra. Another accused remains to be identified.But people familiar with the case said the names of two more people have surfaced — former Union minister Akhilesh Das’ nephew Ankit Das and one Sumit Jaiswal. They were alleged with Mishra in his SUV at the time of the incident. Police are looking for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-ajay-mishra-s-son-ashish-mishra-in-judicial-custody-cops-scan-cctv-in-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-probe-101633890540833.html
11-10-2021||India||Power situation fine, no scarcity: Minister||Fears of a power crisis in India are overblown as there are sufficient coal reserves to produce electricity, the central government assured on Sunday, a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, voicing concern that there could be outages in the national capital.“Any fear of disruption in power supply is entirely misplaced,” the power ministry said in a statement. “The coal stock at power plant is sufficient for more than 4 days’ requirement and as the coal supply is being ramped up by CIL (Coal India Ltd), the coal stock at power plants would gradually improve.”Reports earlier said that over half of 135 coal-fired utilities, which supply more than half of India’s electricity, have fuel inventory to last just under three days.“This panic was unnecessarily created without any reason,” power minister RK Singh told ANI news agency.On Saturday, Kejriwal said Delhi could face power outages if the central government did not quickly resolve the coal shortage at power plants. He sought the intervention of the Prime Minister to resolve the crisis.Power minister Singh has directed that distribution companies in Delhi will get as much power as they require, his ministry said on Sunday.“The ministry of coal reassures that ample coal is available in the country to meet the demand of power plants,” the coal ministry said in a statement. “The coal stock at power plants end is about 72 lakh tonne, sufficient for 4 days’ requirement, and that the Coal India Limited end is more than 400 lakh tonnes, which is being supplied to the power plants.”The Centre was not ready to accept there was a coal crisis, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said. Its policy to “turn a blind eye” to every problem could prove to be bad for the country, he said.“Union power minister RK Singh said there isn’t any coal crisis and that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should not have written a letter to the prime minister on the issue. It is sad that a Union cabinet minister has adopted such irresponsible approach,” Sisodia said at a news briefing.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said that it clearly showed that the central government was making excuses to “run away” from the crisis and compared the present situation with the shortage of oxygen during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May this year.Singh reviewed the coal stock position at all thermal power plants, including those utilities that supply electricity to distribution companies in Delhi.In a year when India produced record amounts of coal, excessive rain in the coal-producing areas hit movement of the fuel from mines to utilities, impacting generation in many states, including Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh. Another factor that contributed to the present situation was power plants that used imported coal to generate electricity either curtailed generation or stopped production as a spurt in international coal prices made it difficult for them to meet commitments to states at a particular rate.Despite heavy rainfall in September, steep hike in power demand due to the economic recovery and increase in the prices of imported coal, domestic coal supply has sustained operations of power plants and efforts are being made to ensure full power supply to the distribution companies, the power ministry said.“It may be noted that the comfortable coal position in the country is reflected by the fact that the CIL has been supplying more than 2.5 lakh tonnes (approx) daily to meet the demand of non-power industries like Aluminium, Cement, Steel etc. along with supply of coal to thermal plants of the country,” the coal ministry said.There are a number of reasons for the current situation. International prices of coal have surged, increasing the demand for local coal. Power demand, and therefore the derived demand for coal, has increased sharply in the past couple of months, perhaps a reflection of pent-up demand on account of the disruption from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May, HT reported earlier.Heavy rainfall, especially in the coal-producing regions of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, have added to the problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-situation-fine-no-scarcity-minister-101633889759567.html

The National Health Authority is creating the priority channel for empanelled hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) to attract more of these health care facilities to get empanelled under the government’s flagship health insurance scheme. There are some 24,000 hospitals currently empaneled under PM-JAY.“For more hospitals to get attracted to the Ayushman Bharat scheme, we are doing things such as reducing the turnaround time for reimbursement. For that to happen, we are creating something called a green channel, which will be applicable to those hospitals that have not forwarded any fraudulent claims so far and who have a clear record,” said RS Sharma, chief executive of the National Health Authority that implements PM-JAY. “The moment they submit their claim, we will release 50% of the amount instantly to them.” It now takes at least two weeks to reimburse the treatment cost to a hospital under the scheme.“Fifteen days is our norm, but at some places it was going beyond that, so we are making changes as early as possible. More hospitals are going to be empanelled so that people have access to nearby hospitals,” Sharma said. “Apart from releasing the claim amount, we are also rationalizing the rates of the packages.” The authority on Tuesday revised beneficiary packages of around 400 procedures under the public health scheme, and included surgical treatment for mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that is being reported from across India as a common post-Covid-19 complication during the second wave of the pandemic. By the end of June, close to 30,000 cases of mucormycosis were reported nation wide, government data show. In the revised benefits package, rates of some treatments have been increased by 20 to 400 percent. The revised rates will be rolled out from November.The revisions have been done in the fields of radiation oncology; medical management procedures such as procedures for dengue, acute febrile illness, etc.; and other procedures such as right and left heart catheterization, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus) closure, arthrodesis, cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, etc.Currently, PM-JAY covers 1,669 procedures, out of which 1,080 are surgical, 588 medical and one unspecified package.The public health insurance scheme was launched in 2018 with 1,393 packages. It provides free and cashless health care services up to ₹500,000 per family a year to at least 107.4 million poor and vulnerable families. Total beneficiaries number over 530 million, according to the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011 database. More initiatives are planned, Sharma said. “First of all, everybody who is a beneficiary should be aware of Ayushman Bharat,” he said. “We are distributing about 4 crore (40 million) cards this year, and the process is being accelerated so that people can just walk in with a card and can claim benefit under the scheme.”The move to create a green channel will help drawing in more partners to offer treatment under the government scheme. “These are two important aspects that any hospital willing to be a part of any public health insurance schemes will look at — reasonably priced treatment packages and quick reimbursement of claims. Most of the time, reimbursement claims are stuck with the government for months. We have seen this with CGHS (central government health scheme) claims,” a senior administrator at a prominent hospital in New Delhi said, requesting anonymity. “If this issue is taken care of, then many hospitals would come forward to offer treatment under Ayushman Bharat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-instant-claim-reimbursement-on-anvil-for-pm-jay-listed-hospitals-with-clean-records-101633889703748.html
11-10-2021||India||India, China conclude 13th round of LAC talks||Corps commanders of Indian and Chinese armies held talks on Sunday to resolve problems at friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, where the countries have been locked in a border standoff for over 17 months, officials familiar with the development said.The 13th round of parley began at 10.30am at Moldo on the Chinese side of LAC, the officials said, requesting anonymity. It came more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement in early August of deployed troops at Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the flashpoints of the border skirmishes.The focus of the talks was to cool tensions at Hot Springs and Depsang, Hindustan Times reported on Sunday. Officials earlier said disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at Hot Springs was on the agenda for the 13th round of talks.The parley comes at a time of massive military buildup and infrastructure development by the People’s Liberation Army across the LAC, with the Indian Army matching Chinese moves.In February, the two sides pulled back troops and weaponry from Pangong Tso in Ladakh. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry in eastern Ladakh.If the Chinese army is to stay in Ladakh, so is the Indian army, General Manoj Mukund Naravane, chief of the army staff, said on Saturday, flagging concerns about the continuing Chinese buildup in the area.The latest round of military dialogue follows a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the border last week in Tawang in northeast India’s Arunachal Pradesh and another incursion by Chinese soldiers on August 30 in Uttarakhand in northern India.Top Indian and Chinese commanders had agreed to a speedy resolution of outstanding issues on LAC at the 12th round of talks. The dialogue had focussed on disengagement of troops from the remaining flashpoints on the contested border.A joint statement issued after the 12th round described the talks as “a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.”Talking about the LAC situation, Naravane on Saturday said in Delhi: “It is a matter of concern that the large-scale buildup that occurred last year (when the border row erupted) continues to be in place.”“To sustain that kind of buildup, there has been an equal amount of infrastructure development on the Chinese side. It means that they (PLA) are there to stay. We are keeping a close watch on the developments. But if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too,” he said.“If they continue to stay there for the second winter, it will definitely mean we will be in Line of Control (LoC) kind of situation (referring to the Indian and Pakistani deployments on the LoC), though not an active LoC as is there on the western front. We will have to keep a close eye on PLA troop buildup and deployments to ensure they don’t get into any misadventure once again,” Naravane said.On PLA’s intentions, he said: “I wish I knew. The most difficult thing is to get into your adversary’s mind…But whatever those reasons may have been, I don’t think they have been able to achieve their aims because of the rapid response by the Indian armed forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-conclude-13th-round-of-lac-talks-101633889699537.html
11-10-2021||India||‘Mission 100 Days’ launched to curb Covid during festivals||The central government has started a campaign dubbed Mission 100 Days to control the spread of Covid-19 infections during the festive season, said people familiar with the matter.There were 230,971 active Covid-19 cases as on Sunday, according to government data, with 34 districts in nine states and Union territories still reporting a weekly positivity rate of at least 10 percent. A weekly rate of five percent or less indicates the spread of infections is somewhat under control, according to the World Health Organization. There are fears that the three-month festive season that started in October could see a resurgence of Covid-19.Also Read| Durga Puja celebration a low-key affair in Noida amid Covid pandemic“This year should be about Covid-safe festivities, which in effect means people celebrate festivals largely online to avoid spreading Covid-19,” a central government official said on condition of anonymity. “We are asking states to be extra vigilant during the next 100 days, and ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is observed. Only then we will be able to save the country from an expected surge in cases.”A “prevention fatigue has set in among the masses, which is why it is more important to make extra efforts to make people understand the importance of not giving up right now”, the official said. “It is important to keep on doing what we are doing to prevent the disease spread with greater intensity, and look for ways to improve on existing measures for better effect.”The Centre has been regularly issuing guidelines to states, asking them to intensify containment measures in areas or districts that continue to report high caseloads, such as aggressive testing and strictly marking containment zones. States have also been asked to generate awareness among people so that it becomes a collective effort, especially during the festive season, as new cases have always seen a surge after festivals.The Centre has asked states to not allow mass gatherings in containment zones and districts reporting at least 5 percent case positivity. Even when gatherings are allowed in such districts, they should need permissions and there has to be caps on the number of attendees. Physical visits or meetings are to be discouraged in favour of online darshans and virtual celebrations. All rituals such as effigy burning, pandal hopping during the Durga Puja, Dandiya and Garba, and Chhath Puja should be symbolic, the guidelines said.“Crowded spaces are fertile ground for disease transmission. Therefore, it is important to not allow crowding, especially in closed spaces, as it has been well-established that the disease is airborne,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. “This is not the time to drop your guard as an infectious disease can always flare up if there is laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour.”Also Read| India's daily Covid-19 tally drops nearly 8% to 18,166Twenty-eight districts across 12 states and Union territories are reporting a weekly positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent. Five states — Mizoram, Kerala, Sikkim, Manipur and Meghalaya — are reporting a weekly positivity rate of at least 5 percent.“It has to be a collective effort if we want to stop experiencing more waves. Since it is people’s behaviour that will eventually determine whether we see any more waves or not and if we do then how intense those are going to be, it is pertinent for the people to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour and for the governments to ensure it is strictly implemented,” said another official, also requesting anonymity.Health ministry officials on Thursday urged people to be careful during the festive season as the pandemic is far from over.“We cannot afford to take the current stable situation for granted. We have to be mindful of the fact that the pandemic is still going on and can take an untoward turn if we are not careful. People need to avoid crowded places and unnecessary travel; stay home as far as possible and celebrate festivals virtually with shopping online,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, ministry of health and family welfare.Intensifying measures during the festival season does not mean we can relax at other times, said the first official cited earlier. “We have to be careful throughout because we are dealing with a highly infectious disease.

He listens to everyone, gives importance to the quality of the suggestion(s) rather than the person who has suggested it, and then takes a decision,” the home minister said.“The final decision rests with him, but of course, he is the Prime Minister.”Several opposition leaders have over the years called the functioning of Modi as ‘dictatorial’ over decisions like demonetization, announcement of nationwide lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic in March last year, abrogation of Article 370 that conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir, on farmer protests or alleged attacks on free speech.Demonetization, annulling Article 370 and the law banning triple talaq were some of the bold decisions of Modi, Shah said in the interview. He said that the surgical strikes on Pakistan in response to terror attacks “was out of the question” before Modi came to power.Modi has changed the dimensions of politics in the country, said the closest aide of the Prime Minister, and that is why there are personal attacks on him.Modi gets his confidence “from the fact that citizens of India know he has no personal interests and that he only works for the country”, the home minister said.“Modi gets stronger every time he is attacked.”Shah took a swipe at the Congress party, saying some parties considered it their right to rule the country and cannot digest the fact that Modi is successfully running the country.(This report has been updated to accurately reflect Union home minister Amit Shah's remarks on PM Modi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-no-dictator-but-most-democratic-leader-india-has-seen-amit-shah-101633857717130.html
11-10-2021||India||Chief secretary who helped Meghalaya tide over Covid crisis, retires||When MS Rao took charge as the chief secretary of Meghalaya on the first day of 2020, the state government had been in power for less than two years, the economy was growing and there was a general sense of optimism in the air, except over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which had engendered protests in capital Shillong.However, within months the Covid-19 pandemic plunged Meghalaya into its greatest ever crisis. Rao had to draw on decades of experience to help the state tide over it by making quick and exceedingly complex decisions. Rao says his mantra has been to understand a challenge first before one starts tackling it.“The uniqueness of the IAS [Indian Administrative Service] is that one gets to do a wide variety of assignments. Every new assignment brings its own set of challenges, but it is important that in the initial days of every assignment an extra effort is made to grasp the subject as quickly and as thoroughly as possible,” Rao said.Echoing his senior, principal secretary of health Sampath Kumar said the former CS stewarded state officials brilliantly in implementing the three-prong approach towards handling the pandemic.“Though right from the very start, we collaborated together as a team and since the pandemic was such a dynamic situation where people wanted quick solutions and answers, certain tough decisions keeping the overall interests of the people had to be taken and he (Rao) was there always egging us on,” Kumar said, and added, “He was an integral interface between the chief minister, Group of Ministers and the department at all times and was always available.”Rao left the post of chief secretary when he reached superannuation at the end of September but by then the pandemic had been contained to a degree of satisfaction in the state. He is now the first chief commissioner of the Public Service Delivery Commission, tasked with the delivery of notified public services to the state’s citizens within a stipulated time frame as per the Meghalaya Right to Public Services Act 2020, which also provides for liabilities for government servants in case of default.“It is a very progressive law which demands direct accountability of the administration to the citizens,” Rao said as he took charge. “My role would be to facilitate and enforce this law which will benefit the citizens immensely. Since I am the first incumbent, I will have to set up the office and get things moving fast. I intend to bring the whole framework under e-governance to make it prompt and efficient.”Rao has served as a civil servant for 34 years and first came to work in Meghalaya in 2000 when he was made the secretary in the state’s agriculture department.Also Read: HNLC cadre arrested for planting IED outside NPP office in MeghalayaUnder his watch, the government launched some “high-impact initiatives” other than the Right to Public Services Act, such as the Meghalaya Enterprise Architecture, Health Policy, Youth Policy, Public-Private Partnership Policy, direct flights to New Delhi and postgraduate diploma courses to address the shortage of specialist doctors in the state.“On the overall state performance during my tenure, I would like to specifically mention three sectors - immunisation, NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and Jal Jeevan Mission - in which we were among the best performing states in the country,” he said.A keen bridge player and an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur and Indian Institute of Management (IIM)Kolkata alumnus, Rao spent two decades in Meghalaya. He said that while coalition governments have a tendency to be unstable, he enjoyed good working relationships with all the chief ministers he served. Outside the government, Rao feels the quality of local labour must be improved to bridge the gap in skill set compared to migrant labourers.Talking about Mehgalaya’s culture, he said It was very important to understand and respect the local culture and customs while making decisions that impact the community. “Community bonding beyond family systems is unique to the society here, which impressed me immensely. People are warm, friendly and cheerful, which made it easy for me to forge many good friendships.”Rao also offered some parting advice for those to follow him through the ranks.“The key thing is to maintain high levels of motivation and be conscious of their accountability to the citizens. It is also important to keep oneself abreast of the latest developments in the relevant sectors and cultivate the habit of continuous learning,” he said. “I strongly believe that technology is a great enabler, and we must make full use of it to improve the quality of governance and, in turn, the quality of life of the citizens,” he said, before signing off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chief-secretary-who-helped-meghalaya-tide-over-covid-crisis-retires-101633855676799.html
