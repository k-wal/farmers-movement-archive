13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Special corner for senior citizens at Sector-17 Plaza||The Chandigarh branch of the Indian Red Cross Society has created a specialised corner for senior citizens called Plaza Baithak at the Sector-17 Plaza city centre, which was inaugurated by UT adviser Dharam Pal here on Wednesday.“A dedicated space was required in the city where the elderly from diverse backgrounds could meet and interact comfortably. The main idea behind setting up this special corner at the Plaza city centre is to make the elders feel important and give them a special place to relax,” said a UT spokesperson.The Plaza Baithak is a makeshift arrangement to seat around 20-25 people. Along with provision of daily newspapers, few magazines and some indoor games like chess and carrom, some physiotherapy modalities, too, are available to the seniors.The timings to use the space will be between 11am and 7pm, which has been decided to align with timings of the Sector-17 market.“This is a space where the seniors can spend some quality time with their peer group and socialize in an eco-friendly environment. They can sit, read and enjoy the vibrant and pleasant atmosphere of the popular Sector-17 market and at the same time interact with each other. This project will create an awareness among the youth of City Beautiful about their responsibilities towards our elders, who may come up with better ideas to reverse the segregation of seniors from the younger population,” said the spokesperson.Deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said, “The facility was to be started last year, but because of the pandemic we had to postpone it. If we get a good response to this initiative, more such facilities will be created across the city. We could have a ‘Lake Baithak’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/special-corner-for-senior-citizens-at-sector-17-plaza-101634149421536.html

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Ramlila associations upset over cracker ban this Dussehra||The UT administration’s decision to ban crackers this Dussehra and Diwali has invited resentment from the Ramlila organising committees, who believe that burning effigies without crackers will make an already low-key festival even more drab.Decision to ban crackers on Diwali was taken on October 12 in continuation with last year’s practice. The order, issued by UT adviser Dharam Pal, came into force with immediate effect and will remain in force until further orders. Any violation can invite up to two-year imprisonment. Burning of effigies on Dussehra, however, will be allowed.Senior vice-president of the Sector-20 Ramlila, Ashok Choudhary, said, “Cracker ban has come just two days before the festival when all arrangements have been made. Our association has placed orders for effigies worth over ₹3 lakh and crackers have already been fitted in them. The administration should have at least given permission to Ramlila associations to use crackers as the ban will only result in huge financial losses for the organisers.”Choudhary further added that people specially visited the Dussehra ground to watch the pomp and show and without crackers, the audience will not like it.The organisers of the Sector-20 Ramlila also met UT home secretary Nitin Yadav on Wednesday and requested him to give some relaxations in the orders.Director of the Ordnance Cable Factory (OCF) Sanskritik Manch, Jyoti Swaroop Bhardwaj, which stages Ramlila in Sector 29, said, “Ramlila associations will definitely abide by the administration’s rules, but we will suffer financial problems due to the cracker ban. Instead of putting a complete ban on the sale and purchase of crackers, the administration must give some relaxations in the orders like limiting the quantity.”“We can use green-crackers to limit the pollution. This way, people will enjoy the festivals and organisers will be able to cope up with the losses, which they are facing since the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.An effigy artiste, Hader Ali of Kalka, said, “Since the pandemic, this is the first time that Dussehra is being celebrated. Last year, too, we had made small effigies and we will have to bear financial losses yet again this year because effigies with crackers have already been made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-ramlila-associations-upset-over-cracker-ban-this-dussehra-101634148823511.html

13-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: In a first, buyers to deliver housing project as builder fails||The homebuyers of Sampada Livia, a stuck housing project in Greater Noida, on Wednesday started work on the project and said that four towers will be delivered in the next two years. The development comes more than one year after the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) handed over the project in Sector Chi-5 to the homebuyers’ association to finish construction and deliver the flats.Officials of the UP-Rera said that it is for the first time in the state that homebuyers will finish a project after the real estate developer failed to deliver it. On September 30, 2019, the regulator put the developer -- PSA Impex Private Limited -- into defaulters’ category and cancelled the registration of the project. On June 6, 2020, it allowed the homebuyers’ association to take over the project. The UP-Rera will assist and monitor the work of this project, the officials said, adding that the move gives hope to other buyers who have failed to get their flats in stuck housing projects. Office bearers of Sampada Livia buyers welfare association said that PSA Impex had challenged the UP-Rera’s order in the Allahabad high court that rejected its petition in March this year. “We are so happy that finally we have got the opportunity to deliver the flats to all aggrieved homebuyers. We have hired a contractor for the job, and will deliver four towers in the next two years,” said Dr Akanksha Aggarwal, president of the association.PSA Impex had launched the project on 5 acres of land in 2011 with assurances that the flats would be delivered in 2014-15. It had planned for 10 towers with 24 floors each and a total of 726 units. When the developer failed to deliver, completing only 10% of the project, homebuyers under the banner of Sampada Livia buyers’ welfare association filed a plea in the UP-Rera in June 2018. The same year, real estate firm’s chief executive officer Diwakar Sharma, who was booked in several cases for cheating and fraud, among others, was jailed.According to an audit by the Greater Noida authority, the developer had sold 355 of the 726 units. It estimated that the unsold flats would go for ₹233.50 crore and unsold commercial space could rake in ₹6.4 crore, said an authority official.KN Mishra from buyers’ legal team said, “We are likely to rope in a marketing agency that will be engaged in selling off remaining units and commercial space to raise funds for the construction.”The UP-Rera officials said that this project will inspire other buyers to take that route in stuck projects, where realtors have deserted them.“The homebuyers successfully took over the project after a long legal battle. Now, they have restarted the project. It will inspire other buyers to come forward and use this legal route to finish the stuck projects. There are at least 13 such cases, where buyers can take up the project after going through the legal route,” said Balvinder Kumar, member of UP-Rera. Representatives of PSA Impex were unavailable for comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-in-a-first-buyers-to-deliver-housing-project-as-builder-fails-101634148581896.html

The suspects were identified as Rajesh Kumar, 28, the driver, his brother Amit Kumar, 32, and Rakam Singh, 35, all residents of Astauli village in Dankaur, Greater Noida. Rajesh Kumar worked as a driver for businessman Vishnu Gupta, 45, in Sector Pi 4 in Greater Noida. Gupta said that he was in the process of buying commercial space for a warehouse. “I talked to a property dealer in Defence Colony in New Delhi and fixed a deal. On Tuesday 4.30pm, I sent Rajesh in a Mahindra XUV with ₹55 lakh to pay the property dealer in Delhi,” he said. Gupta said soon he received a call from the property dealer informing that he was not available on Tuesday. Gupta asked Rajesh to return to Greater Noida with the cash. “At 6pm, I again called Rajesh and he said he was stuck i a n traffic jam. I waited for him until 7.30pm, but he did not return. I kept calling him repeatedly but he did not pick up. I was worried because he was carrying a huge amount of cash,” Gupta said. Rajesh had been working for Gupta for the last four months, while his brother Amit had been supplying milk to his house for the last seven years. Gupta called Amit and asked him to check on his brother’s whereabouts. “At 9pm, Amit informed me that some persons in a Ford EcoSport car overtook Rajesh and snatched the cash near Sector 143 Metro station in Noida,” Gupta said. Gupta informed the police and also reached the spot. “I found Rajesh lying on the front seat with his hands tied behind his back. He started crying and saying some criminals robbed him when he was on his back,” he said. Soon, a police team reached the spot and launched an investigation. A case was registered against unknown suspects under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in robbery) of the Indian Penal Code at Surajpur police station,” he said.Ankur Agarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida Central, said the police questioned Rajesh and found his statements were not consistent. “He was not able to state how his brother found out about the robbery as they did not exchange any phone call during that time. We scanned Rajesh’s call details and found he was also in touch with a local, Rakam Singh. The three persons were questioned thoroughly and they admitted to have faked the robbery,” he said. The police found the stolen cash at Rakam Singh’s place. “We have arrested the three suspects. They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said the ADCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-fakes-robbery-to-embezzle-55-lakh-from-employer-3-arrested-101634148461589.html

13-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government backs reservation in promotions for VJ, NT, and Special Backward Classes||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to take back the reservation in promotion for Vimukti Jati (VJ) and Nomadic Tribes (B, C & D) and Special Backward Classes (SBC) categories in the state and file an additional affidavit in the Supreme Court (SC) with regards to the ongoing petitions challenging the reservation in promotion. The government, according to ministers, will use powers under the Constitution to provide the reservation, citing “inadequate” representation of the VJ, NT and SBC in the government jobs at higher posts. The decision came after the state filed an affidavit in the Apex court stating that the only Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe’s reservations in the promotion are as per the Constitution. The affidavit meant that the state had said that the reservation provided to VJ, NT and SBC categories in the state in 2004, as per the Maharashtra Reservation Act 2001, was unconstitutional. The affidavit filed by the state government drew ire from communities and held protests against it recently. On Wednesday, the issue of reservation in promotion was discussed in the state cabinet by senior Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) ministers raising objections on the state’s stand in Supreme Court on the issue. The ministers questioned how the administration filed an affidavit without the consent of the social justice minister. “The SC, ST are already provided reservations. We have decided today to appoint a special counsel [in the matter] and file an additional affidavit citing inadequate representation of VJ, NT and SBC categories,” said Vijay Wadettiwar, a cabinet minister.A statement from the state secretariat said that a report of the committee headed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte showed that like the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the VJ, NT and SBC classes have inadequate representation in promotions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-backs-reservation-in-promotions-for-vj-nt-and-special-backward-classes-101634148342830.html

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Third Covid wave: 2 Chandigarh private hospitals to install oxygen plants||Two private hospitals of Chandigarh are ready to install pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants in preparation for a possible third Covid wave.Meanwhile three other private facilities are also expected to follow suit, the UT administration said on Wednesday.PSA is a process to generate enriched oxygen gas from ambient air.The central government had requested those private hospitals or clinical establishments with a capacity of more than 50 beds to install an oxygen plant. The move came after several states and UTs had complained of oxygen shortage in government and private hospitals during the peak of the second Covid wave.In regard to this, UT health secretary Yashpal Garg on Wednesday convened a meeting with private hospitals to review their response.“Eden Hospital has already placed an order for installation of a PSA oxygen plant, which is expected to be made functional by the end of October this year. Also, Shri Dhanwantry Hospital is in the advanced stages of finalising purchase of 250 LPM plant,” Garg said, adding that Land Mark Hospital, Healing Hospital and Mukat Hospital are in advanced stages of negotiation with the manufacturer or supplier of the plant and the authorities will submit the final plan by October 31.Meanwhile, Chaitanya Hospital and Santokh Hospital are installing liquid oxygen tankers and have procured some oxygen concentrators, to be used in the case of emergency. Chandigarh’s Cloud Nine Hospital and Chandigarh City Hospital, too, have procured oxygen concentrators.So far, four oxygen generation plants are installed at Chandigarh’s four government health institutes with a cumulative capacity to generate 3,600 litres of medical oxygen per minute (LPM). Besides, four more oxygen plants are being set up at various government hospitals in UT, with the help of donations from non-governmental organisations. Once operational, 2,000 LPM oxygen will be added to the UT’s in-house generation capacity.During the second wave, the demand for oxygen had suddenly peaked with the increase in patient load, and the UT administration had to request the Centre to raise its oxygen quota from 20MT to 35MT. The UT health department had wisely distributed the 20MT oxygen among government and private hospitals during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/third-covid-wave-2-chandigarh-private-hospitals-to-install-oxygen-plants-101634148041493.html

The developer, M3M, however, declined to comment on the matter.H-Rera, Gurugram, also observed that a “malicious trend” of advertising real estate projects without prior registration is being observed among real estate promoters. “It is found that promoters are getting advertised their unregistered projects either directly or through their channel partner/real estate agents. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 makes it mandatory to register all commercial or residential projects before its launch, to promote transparency in real estate sector. It is noticed that promoters are not getting their projects registered but getting them advertised in the market luring the investors to invest,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hrera-imposes-3-cr-fine-for-advertising-housing-projects-without-registry-101634147742655.html
13-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG crackdown on illegal street vendors to start with survey||In a crackdown on illegal street vendors, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to undertake a survey of all 148 vending zones from the next week and initiate action against those operating without licences or on licences issued to other vendors.A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of MCG’s Town Vending Committee (TVC) held at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Wednesday.The MCG’s street vending zones have been under scrutiny since November last year, when it was discovered that they were operating at only 53% capacity. The MCG had issued a work order for incorporating 3,452 street vendors into its street vending zones, but managed to bring in only 1,620 vendors.In April, deputy municipal commissioner (DMC) Vijaypal Yadav, who oversees the project, submitted a report to senior MCG officials, disclosing that of the 1,620 street vendors, around 300 were found to be illegal as their original owners had either leased the carts to others or transferred the ownership to them.“Many unauthorised vendors are reported to be working in these (148) vending zones. There is a need for separate enforcement/monitoring team to check such type of illegal vendors so that only approved vendors may be rehabilitated in the approved vending zones and action taken against illegal vendors,” stated the MCG’s agenda in the meeting.After deliberation, officials approved the formation of an enforcement team to check illegal vendors.“An enforcement team of 10-15 officials will be formed to check for illegal vendors in all the vending zones. Besides taking action against them, they will also have the responsibility to check if the licences of the approved vendors are up to date, otherwise, direct them to get them renewed,” Yadav said.Officials also disclosed that a Delhi-based consultant was hired to assess if all vending zones are adhering to the norms of the Haryana Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2020. According to the scheme, the right of way (ROW) of the road near the vending zone should be less than 10 metres, the vending zones must not be located on footpaths and they should not be located near schools.According to Yadav, the consultant has assessed 58 vending zones but has been directed to resurvey the zones to identify vacant spaces.“The TVC realised that the consultant can also check for vacant areas which can be used as parking spaces for vehicles near all the vending zones. This will ensure there is no traffic congestion near any of the vending zones,” Yadav said.Yadav said that the consultant has been directed to check if 45% of the total space of a vending zone has been reserved for vendors, while the remaining 55% is left for parking, drinking water facility, mobile toilets, benches, bins and streetlights, among other amenities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-crackdown-on-illegal-street-vendors-to-start-with-survey-101634147683827.html
13-10-2021||Gurugram||Heliport for Gurugram in the works: CM Manohar Lal Khattar||The Haryana government will submit a proposal for building a heliport in Gurugram to the civil aviation ministry soon, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Wednesday, after meeting with the union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in Delhi.Khattar said that the heliport will boost intercity and intracity transport by helicopters and might also reduce the pressure on IGI Airport. “Land will be identified soon and proposal submitted to civil aviation ministry for setting up a helicopter hub in Gurugram,” Khattar said during an interaction with media persons.A helicopter hub or heliport is a small airport meant for helicopters and other vertical aircraft. It has one or more touchdown and lift-off areas, with facilities for refuelling and hangars for parking.Khattar met Scindia to discuss civil aviation projects coming up in different parts of the state. The CM said that it was also decided to reduce the value-added tax (VAT) rates on air turbine fuel from 20% to 1% in the state.Setting up a civil aviation university, a school for drones, a satellite centre in the state, an integrated aviation hub at Hisar, airstrips at Karnal and Ambala, and pilot training schools in Bhiwani and Narnaul, besides adding air services routes in the state, were also discussed, government officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/heliport-for-gurugram-in-the-works-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-101634147682631.html
13-10-2021||Gurugram||Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway: NHAI asked to redesign median at Sirhaul border||To reduce congestion at the Sirhaul toll, especially on the Gurugram-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, traffic police asked the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to realign the median near Ambience Mall the underpass and update signage.According to the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) of the Gurugram traffic police, Ravinder Singh Tomar, the median located between the Ambience Mall underpass and Rajokri flyover has a heavy bend, which extends the road width on the Delhi-Gurugram carriageway and narrows it on the opposite direction.The directions were issued following a joint visit by the Gurugram traffic police, Delhi traffic police and NHAI officials at the Sirhaul toll on Tuesday afternoon, to survey ways through which congestion at the border could be reduced. Tomar said that NHAI has been asked to realign the median and ensure both carriageways have similar road widths.“Due to the bend, the road width on the carriageway carrying traffic from Delhi to Gurugram is so much that vehicles tend to not access three of the rightmost lanes. Instead, we have asked NHAI to straighten the bend and align it in such a manner that at least two more lanes are added on the opposite carriageway. We anticipate that the changes will reduce travelling time by at least 10 minutes during peak traffic hours,” Tomar said.According to a mobility plan of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), around 300,000 vehicles cross the Sirhaul toll every day. The toll is, by far, the most congested stretch in the city, and, at times, takes take around 25-40 minutes to cross it during peak traffic hours.Tomar said that NHAI was also directed to update signage on the Gurugram-Delhi carriageway, depicting the direction and distance for terminals one and three of the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.“We observed that a large number of vehicles were driving on the leftmost lane of the Gurugram-Delhi carriageway just after crossing the toll. Upon inquiring, we realised that most vehicles were heading towards the airport and were unaware of the distance to each of the terminals, and their respective exits. We have asked the NHAI to update signage along the stretch accordingly,” Tomar said.Tomar said that the updated signage will also reduce “zigzag” driving, which was leading to congestion and ensure lane driving is maintained. He said that the NHAI was also asked to put up signage at all foot overbridges falling between Kherki Daula toll and Sirhaul toll, stating that heavy vehicles must drive on the leftmost lane.“We have asked the Gurugram traffic police to submit all recommendations in writing so that we can take up all matters with our concessionaire formally. Each of the recommendations will be individually examined and its technical feasibility assessed before proceeding further,” Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said.Last month, Gurugram traffic police launched a dedicated drive to check the movement of heavy vehicles on the leftmost carriageway of National Highway 48 and penalised over 3,000 drivers for violations between September 3 and 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/delhigurgaon-expressway-nhai-asked-to-redesign-median-at-sirhaul-border-101634147681282.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Railways to convert local trains on Mumbai suburban network to AC trains||The railways have planned to convert all local trains on Mumbai’s suburban train network to air-conditioned (AC) trains.The decision was taken by the Railway Board; the apex body of all zonal railways, after consulting Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation(MRVC), Central and Western Railway officials on Tuesday. The fares of the local trains are also likely to be reduced and will be based on the fare structure of metros. The railway ministry has also put the plans to run semi-AC local trains (in which a few AC coaches were to be attached to local trains in addition to current first and second class coaches) on hold, according to information.“We will be procuring all fully AC local trains for the Mumbai suburban railway network under the Mumbai Urban Transport Projects (MUTP),” said Ravi Agarwal, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), MRVC.The MRVC will be buying 283 new AC local trains in the coming days. The Railways ministry has given its approval for the procurement of AC local trains but the time-frame for the same is not decided yet, said Railway officials.Currently, Mumbai has nine AC trains running on a suburban network. However, the response from the commuters is lukewarm due to fare which is higher even than first-class coaches and poor frequency of trains. Railway authorities had planned semi-AC trains comprising first, second and AC coaches to tide over the problem of poor frequency. However, the Railway Board is now planning to covert the entire fleet of trains into AC trains. “The time-frame for the same has not been decided but it has been decided that every new local train that is bought now for Mumbai suburban train network would be an AC train,” said a senior railway official.In the case of the fare of these trains, the Railway Board is looking at the fare structure of metros run in Delhi and Mumbai.“The fare structure of the suburban AC local trains will be based on metro fare structure by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority(MMRDA) or the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The MRVC had suggested the fare structure of AC local trains on par with metro fares in Mumbai and Delhi,” said the official.The semi AC local train plan of the railways has also reportedly been put on hold. “The implementation of the semi AC local trains involves a lot of technicalities and there are chances that it cannot be feasible. There was a discussion with the railway ministry and the project was put on hold.” said a senior official who was a part of the meeting.The Central and Western Railway has recently undertaken a passenger survey on the AC local trains and had submitted the response from commuters to the railway ministry. Passengers had asked for a reduction in the fares of the AC local train.The first suburban AC local train was operated on the Western Railway on December 25, 2017. The train service is operational between Churchgate and Virar railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-to-convert-local-trains-on-mumbai-suburban-network-to-ac-trains-101634147621475.html

These employees have welcomed the decision. They are serving as guides, electricians, muezzin, “sipahis”, “jamadars” and “darogas” among others.The move came after a city-based social activist raised the issue and approached chief minister and pursued the matter with the district magistrate.“We have decided to increase the salary of class three and four employees of HAT and from now onwards, the salary would be paid on the basis of minimum wage scale,” said Lucknow district magistrate Abhishek Prakash. The DM said the salary hike would increase the expenses of the Trust by ₹7 lakh monthly.In 2019, a city-based social activist S Mohammed Haider first raised the issue and gave a representation to the CM, with copy with other officials, including the DM, demanding salary hike for the guides and other employees of the Trust.“I am thankful to the district administration for considering my plea and for showing generosity towards the class three and four lowly paid employees of the HAT,” said Haider, a heritage activist and corporate lawyer.“Pandemic was tough for all and our profession was no exception.

13-10-2021||Pune||SPPU to start internship programme for commerce students||The students studying in the last year of Bachelor of Commerce (B Com) will now get hands-on training in the last semester. The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) from this academic year has started a 60 hours compulsory internship programme for students studying in the last semester and has tied up with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) for the same.At least 20,000 students will benefit from the internship and will get a monthly stipend of ₹2,500.“This would be a 60-hour internship programme in which every student in his/her last semester will work at the chartered accountant firm for 15 days up to three months. Through this outcome-based education system, students will get practical work knowledge apart from theoretical studies. The work office should be around 2 to 4 km away from the house of the student and accordingly, we have tied up with the CA firms in three districts - Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar,” said Parag Kalkar, SPPU dean - faculty of commerce and management studies.Earlier this year SPPU had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ICAI in this regard.“Later from next year, we are planning to make the internship compulsory for around six months, not only with the CA firms but also with the Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICWA) and Company Secretary (CS) firms. Already we are in talks with the organisational bodies,” he said.“Currently, there are around 57,000 commerce students in SPPU affiliated colleges out of which 20,000 students are in last year. Through this practical internship work they would study tally, excel sheet, Goods and Services Tax (GST) payments and income tax-related works actually at the firm office,” added Kalkar.Chandrasekhar Chitale, ICAI Central Council member CA, said, “The commerce branch has a great response from the students. However, they lack practical knowledge.

13-10-2021||Noida||Stubble burning increases in Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, officials promise action||Even as Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts prepare action plans to combat the spike in air pollution during the approaching winter season, instances of crop residue burning are now increasing.HT, during a spot visit, found crop residue burning in a field at Nahal in Dasna near the Delhi Meerut Expressway on Wednesday.Both district authorities have put together a slew of measures in their respective winter action plans to keep sources of air pollution in check, including instances of crop residue burning.According to official statistics from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Gautam Budh Nagar reported five instances of crop residue burning from September 15 to October 12 this year, while Ghaziabad reported two instances during the same period.During the same period in 2020, both districts reported only one instance each.“The instances will continue to rise as disposing of the crop residue is a costly affair for poor and marginal farmers. So, they resort to burning it. More awareness should be spread, and farmers should be incentivised with affordable equipment for the safe disposal of crop residue,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and lawyer.“If the instances are being reported, it indicates that there is lack of monitoring,” he added.According to CREAMS reports, a total of 2,954, 1,506, and 1,559 instances were reported from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh from October 1 to October 12 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.“We are properly monitoring crop residue burning in Dasna and our teams cover the urban areas of the town. Rural belts in Dasna are monitored by teams of the revenue department. Once we get the information, we act on it and also take legal action. Last year too, we lodged several FIRs in connection with the crop residue burning incidents,” said Manoj Kumar, executive officer of Dasna Nagar Palika in Ghaziabad.Suhas LY, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that he has taken different measures to keep in check the instance of crop residue burning.“Recently, four incidents of crop residue burning were reported in one day, and we took punitive action against the erring persons and fined them. We also issued show-cause notices against the local staff and against the agricultural department staff. Also, the staff of agriculture and revenue departments has been sensitising locals against any burning activity,” the DM added.“In all, five incidents have been reported in the district so far,” he added.On Wednesday, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration also said that they will impose a fine of ₹2,500 per instance in case the land is smaller than two acres; ₹5,000 in case the land is two acres to five acres, and ₹15,000 in case the land is over five acres.Officials said that the farmers can avail the waste decomposer facility, which is available free of cost with the agriculture department, and this can help in convert the waste crop residue to manure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/stubble-burning-increases-in-ghaziabad-gautam-budh-nagar-officials-promise-action-101634147262928.html
13-10-2021||Noida||Two workers die while cleaning tank in Greater Noida chemical factory||Two workers died after inhaling poisonous gases in a tank they were trying to clean in a chemical factory in Site V industrial area, Greater Noida, around 9.30pm on Tuesday. The victims’ kin alleged negligence on the part of the contractor and the factory owner. The deceased were identified as Rambhes, 26, and Pankaj, 22, (known by their first names only) from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. They lived in a slum in Site V area. Ravindra, Pankaj’s cousin, said that on Tuesday night, a contractor Hemant visited him and said that he needed some workers to clean a large tank in a chemical factory. “Hemant offered us ₹6,000 for the work. Four of us, including Rambhes, Pankaj and another man Ramesh, agreed to clean the tank. We reached the factory at night and found a large underground chemical tank. We entered the tank and realised the strong smell of chemicals was making it difficult to breathe,” Ravindra said. He said that the workers informed the contractor that it was unsafe to work without any safety gear. “The contractor said that he had got this work done several times in the past and there was no need to worry,” he said in the complaint. Ravindra said that soon Rambhes and Pankaj fainted in the tank. “We somehow pulled them out of the tank and rushed them to a private hospital in Greater Noida where doctors declared them dead on arrival. They died after inhaling poisonous gases just because the contractor forced us to work without a safety mask and gear,” he said. Sudhir Kumar, station house officer, Kasna police station, said a case had been registered against contractor Hemant and the factory owner under sections 304-A (death due to negligence) and 284 (negligent conduct with respect to poisonous substance) of the Indian Penal Code. “We have detained the contractor in this case. The factory owner has given ₹8.77 lakh compensation to the kin of each deceased victim. It is not clear if the factory owner was directly involved in engaging workers to clean the tank. We are investigating the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-workers-die-while-cleaning-tank-in-greater-noida-chemical-factory-101634147261549.html
13-10-2021||Noida||Expert panel clears use of Covaxin for ages 2-18, 900k to benefit from jab||A day after an expert group looking at Covid-19 vaccine approvals recommended the use of Covaxin for children aged 2-18 years, officials of the Ghaziabad district health department said that the move will benefit an estimated 900,000 children. According to official estimates, the district has a population of about 3,900,000. Nearly 878,250 beneficiaries are over the age of 45, while about 1,880,276 are in the 18-44 age group. “Of the remaining approximately 1,140,000, nearly 200,000 are estimated to be in the age group 0-2 years. So, this leaves us with roughly 900,000 children who could benefit from the vaccination coverage. However, the government estimates and guidelines regarding the vaccination of children will provide us with the accurate population estimate,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination. On Tuesday, the Subject Expert Committee, an expert group looking at vaccine approvals, recommended the use of Covaxin for the age group 2-18 years. The move raised the possibility that children could soon begin to receive Covid-19 vaccine doses across the country. The Subject Expert Committee’s recommendation will need to be accepted by the Drugs Controller of India – which is expected within days – and has to be followed by a formal inclusion in the Centre’s Covid-19 immunisation campaign. “Once we receive the guidelines to administer Covid-19 vaccine to children, we will seek their numbers from the rolls of schools and educational institutions,” Dr Mathuria added. Parents’ association members said that the move will make parents consider sending their children to schools. “Children have been attending online classes for over one-and-a-half years. Once the required guidelines come in, vaccination for children should start so that they can attend schools from the next academic session,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of Ghaziabad parents’ association. “Till then, online mode should continue. No Covid-19 vaccine for children was a major reason for parents not sending their children to schools,” he added. According to statistics from the district health department, about 853 children in the age group 0-10 were infected during the first wave, from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. These include two deaths as well. About 1,865 children were infected in the age group 11-20 years during the same period, but there was no casualty within this age group. During the second wave, from April 1, 2021 to June 18, 2021, about 764 children in the age group 0-10 were infected. About 1,991 in the age group 11-20 years were infected during the same period. There was no casualty reported in either age group during the second wave. According to academicians, once the vaccination process starts, there might be some initial hesitancy. “When the vaccine arrived for adults, there was initial hesitancy. Not many countries have data regarding the effect of vaccination on children, and it is always an issue of concern for parents. Younger children will not be able to detect the effects on their bodies. So, it would be advisable to start with higher age groups like 16-18, 14-16 etc, and then progress to vaccinating younger children,” said Jyoti Gupta, director of Delhi Public School, Sahibabad. “Children should be vaccinated in a phased manner so that we have enough data and evidence on how it is affecting them. Initially, I do not foresee much euphoria, but acceptability will increase once encouraging results start coming out. Once this trend is observed, schools will also start with advocacy campaigns,” she added. Health experts said that after the required approvals, vaccination for children will start. “There were apprehensions that children will be most-affected during a possible third wave. Since they form a major part of our population and are not protected so far, they must get the vaccine at the earliest to get maximum protection against Covid-19,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/expert-panel-clears-use-of-covaxin-for-ages-2-18-900k-to-benefit-from-jab-101634147201552.html

13-10-2021||Lucknow||Shivpal: Alliance with Samajwadi Party first priority||Agra Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party president Shivpal Yadav on Wednesday said that his first priority was to form an alliance with the Samajwadi Party in the upcoming UP assembly polls but he did not rule out the possibility of a tie-up with other “secular” parties. Shivpal Yadav, whose ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ had a halt in city on Tuesday night, interacted with journalists on Wednesday morning before moving on to Firozabad. “Our ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ has begun from Mathura, the birthplace of Lord Krishna and would end in Ayodha, the birthplace of Lord Rama. The yatra will move across all 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh before ending at Ayodhya,” said Shivpal Yadav. “We are open to alliance with like-minded political parties with secular values. At present our top priority is to have an alliance with Samajwadi Party (SP). It would be good if this alliance between SP and PSP happens,” said Shivpal who had earlier parted ways with the Samajwadi Party and formed his own party in 2018 after a feud with his nephew and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav. When asked about separate inaugurations of ‘yatra’ by SP and PSP from different cities, Shivpal Yadav said that even if the alliance occurred, then also two parties got together with their own existence continuing. Replying to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) performance in the state and at the centre, Shivpal said that both the governments failed to fulfill the promises they made to the masses. “The BJP promised to end corruption in 100 days, bring back black money, double the income of farmers, provide 15 lakh to every citizen and get released land occupied by China but failed to fulfill any of these promises. The slogan ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’ has fallen flat,” alleged Shivpal.. “We will now reach the masses through ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ and highlight failures of the BJP in keeping its promises. We will seek support of the masses so that PSP forms government and lodges war against ‘bhookh’ (hunger), ‘bhaya’ (fear) and ‘bhrashtachar’ (corruption),” said the PSP president. “Farmers, youth and poor are facing difficulties during the present BJP rule and change is needed for which ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ will pave the way,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shivpal-alliance-with-samajwadi-party-first-priority-101634147022491.html

13-10-2021||Lucknow||Increased screen time causing multiple eye problems: Experts||Increased screen time in the past one-and-half-year due to the pandemic has given rise to multiple eye problems primarily dry eyes, say doctors.Sharing details of the issues faced by students using computer for online classes, Dr Arum Sharma, ophthalmology department, King George’s Medical University (KGMU) said, “Students who wear specs have greater chance of facing eye problem such as dry eyes while those not using specs or not having any eye problem too suffer with the problem. So, the risk is there with both the groups.”“Students regular on online classes should make sure they look away and blink eyes for a few seconds after at least every half-an-hour,” he advised.Moreover, doctors say the habit of watching movies or shows on cell phones during night has gone up particularly after switching off the lights and during such sessions the body posture remains relaxed but incorrect. “The screen should be at chest level and not at the level of the eyes,” said Dr Sharma, head of the community eye bank at KGMU.“Not just children or young but even elderly people have started using smartphones to kill lockdown boredom and excessive use of screen has resulted in eye problem. Many older people got the number for their specs revised as their vision got disturbed due to cell phones,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.Dr Shobhit Chawla, medical director and chief vitreoretinal consultant at Prakash Netra Kendra, Lucknow, said, “China and India together account for 49% of the world’s total burden of blindness and vision impairment with vision loss. In my clinical observation, we see about 30-35% retinal disease patients, 15% glaucoma patients and 50% cataract patients in a month. The key across all three conditions is timely diagnosis and treatment. Without timely treatment, the condition is allowed to progress and can result in irreversible vision loss.”“In the out-patient department (OPD), number of patients coming with problems like dry eyes has gone up,” said Dr Siddharth of the department of ophthalmology at KGMU.World Sight Day-2021, to be celebrated on Thursday (October 14), marks an opportunity to raise awareness about retinal diseases. Early detection is vital to prevent vision loss. There are various treatment options available that can limit disease progression and consulting an ophthalmologist is a key step to understanding options that can be beneficial.Tips for keeping eyes safe*Give the eyes break at every half-an-hour when watching screen continuously*Keep laptop or mobile preferably at the chest level*Get eyes checked every year if wearing specs*Even if no problem, one should get eyes checked once if using screen for long||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/increased-screen-time-causing-multiple-eye-problems-experts-101634146841416.html

The CWC meeting has been called on October 16 to discuss the current political situation, forthcoming assembly and organizational polls. A cabinet rejig and appointments had taken a backseat after the announcement of dates for assembly bypolls to be held on October 30. Leaders familiar with the development said after meetings between AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, Sachin Pilot and the party leadership that a rejig may happen soon. Their expectations, however, were reinforced with the appointment of health minister Raghu Sharma as in-charge for Gujarat on October 7, but thereafter nothing much happened. Now Gehlot’s likely visit to Delhi to attend the CWC meeting has sparked fresh speculation. This will be Gehlot’s second visit to the national capital this year after February. A senior leader familiar with developments said Gehlot is not part of the CWC but in most meetings held so far, the chief ministers of Congress ruled states had been attendees. “It is believed that Gehlot will meet AICC chief Sonia Gandhi, discuss a possible cabinet rejig and appointments and get her approval,” he said. He continued that a cabinet reshuffle and appointments are long awaited and it is now believed that it will happen with the Rajasthan CM’s visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/ashok-gehlot-s-upcoming-delhi-visit-sparks-speculation-of-cabinet-rejig-in-rajasthan-101634146721377.html
13-10-2021||Pune||Katraj-Dehu road bypass: PWD commits to making “safety arrangements”||PUNE: With service road works underway on both sides of the Katraj to Dehu road bypass highway and demarcation between the highway and service road unclear at several spots, especially along the Katraj to Navale bridge chowk stretch, thousands of commuters who use this route daily are facing a risk to their lives.A senior official from the state public works department (PWD) said, “The service road work has been awarded to a private contractor and it is that contractor’s duty to put up barricades and maintain the safety of vehicles and commuters. Still we will once again review the risky spots and make necessary safety arrangements.”The seriousness of the issue once again came to the fore on October 4 when a youth, 37, died on-the-spot on this fatal stretch where the bypass highway suddenly becomes narrow even as a slope goes down to the service road on the side.Also along the stretch near Potdar International school, there are no barricades where the service road work is underway. The highway suddenly becomes narrow so one cannot differentiate between the highway and the service road which has been dug up with JCB machines operating on site. It is especially difficult at night to distinguish between the highway and the open service road as there are no reflectors, signage boards or barricades at the spot.Ramesh Khutwad who lives nearby said, “I travel daily along the bypass highway and it is getting riskier due to the ongoing service road work. Stones and mud are strewn over the highway and there are no proper barricades to separate the construction site from the highway. Many a time, we get confused as vehicles are speeding and the road suddenly becomes narrow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/katrajdehu-road-bypass-pwd-commits-to-making-safety-arrangements-101634146661720.html

13-10-2021||Lucknow||Ahead of 2022 UP polls, BJP unveils its ‘Jatav’ face against BSP||LUCKNOW: Nearly 34 days after she quit as Uttarakhand governor in September, two years ahead of the scheduled closure of her five-year gubernatorial stint, Baby Rani Maurya, the dalit woman leader from Agra arrived in Lucknow with hoardings prominently showcasing her dalit subcaste: Jatav. “Yes, I am a ‘dalit ki beti’ (daughter of a dalit),” she said soon after her arrival, while admitting that in the run up to the 2022 Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections, she would seek to rally the Jatavs – considered to be the mainstay of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and staunch backers of party chief Mayawati who too is a Jatav. Maurya, whose father was a Congress councillor in Agra and who edged closer to the BJP after her marriage, arrived in Lucknow on Tuesday for a felicitation function organised by the party’s Scheduled Caste wing. “With ‘Jatav’ prominently written in the backdrop, Maurya was presented with a memento of ‘Ram Darbar’ to symbolically represent RSS’s desire to unite Hindus,” a party leader who was present at the felicitation function at Lucknow’s Vishweshwaraiya Hall, explained. During the function, Maurya invoked Bhimrao Ambedkar reminding the predominantly dalit audience of Ambedkar’s three main things. “He wanted the community to be educated, to stay united and to fight against evil practices and BJP is the only party treading the path shown by Ambedkar,” she said to applause. The BJP had decided to get Maurya to hold rallies all over the state, with special focus on districts with sizeable dalit population, party leaders admitted. So far, despite cutting into BSP’s dalit vote, the BJP had largely preferred to woo non-Jatav dalits but having found a woman dalit leader in Baby Rani, the party was now seeking to aggressively woo the Jatavs too, party leaders confirmed. Of the nearly 21 per cent dalit vote bank in UP, Jatavs form a sizeable chunk, about 11 per cent and Maurya said she would try to win over the community. Hoardings put up across the state projected her as a Jatav leader and Maurya, who is now BJP’s national vice president, said she didn’t find anything wrong with it. “I was born into this caste. My family was and still is into leather and footwear work. For nearly three decades I have been with the BJP as a Jatav,” she said when asked if the focus on ‘Jatav’ was deliberate. Asked if she was confident of delivering the Jatav vote to the BJP, Maurya said, while the extent of breach in Maya’s vote bank remained to be seen, the community’s poor would ultimately side with a party that assured them education, growth and prosperity. “Can’t say much about the (shift of) cadre base vote (of BSP) but it is a fact that we would want them to (Jatavs) align with the BJP and for a good reason. After all, those who want good education for their children or employment will definitely go somewhere and we would surely want them over to our side on the basis of the good work that our governments have been doing,” she said. “So far the party lacked a Jatav woman leader and obviously now, the party leadership feels that Baby Rani having loyally served the party through its ups and downs in the state, appears to be a perfect choice to take on Mayawati and her party,” a party leader said. On her part, Baby refrained from making any direct attack on Mayawati even as the BJP’s SC cell chose to put up a hoarding prominently showcasing Baby’s face and her ‘Jatav’ caste close to Mayawati’s Mall Avenue residence. There has been no reaction from the BSP camp so far over the BJP projecting its own Jatav dalit woman face in the run up to 2022 UP polls. Mayawati, however, had recently revealed the intent to play up ‘soft Hindutva’ ahead of the UP polls, stating that if elected to power, her government would continue with development projects started by the BJP in Hindu holy cities of Ayodhya, Mathura and Varanasi. “This means that while the BJP is eyeing Maya’s base vote, the feisty BSP leader is looking to get even by playing up soft Hindutva,” said Irshad Ilmi, veteran political leader. Maurya said in BJP, there was no discrimination on caste lines and her rise was proof. “The BJP has acknowledged my work over the years, from being Agra’s first woman mayor, to member of women’s commission, governor and now national vice president. This is enough to show that in BJP, there is no discrimination and merit is promoted,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ahead-of-2022-up-polls-bjp-unveils-its-jatav-face-against-bsp-101634146601467.html

A proposal has been drafted for the same and disaster management funds are being used to buy the kits. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Pune zilla parishad, said, “Back in April when the second wave was at its peak, we had to face shortage of rapid antigen kits. Although the number of new Covid-19 cases is falling, the zilla parishad will buy over 50,000 rapid antigen kits to avoid any shortage in future. In April, Covid care centres (CCCs) faced rising demand for rapid antigen kits from the district’s Covid-19 hotspots. To bridge the gap, the district hospital had to supply kits from their own stock.”Justifying the purchase, Prasad said this is a long-term plan so as to not repeat the April 2021 situation at the peak of the second wave. “We need to keep testing more people. We do not want to bring down the testing numbers just because the number of new cases has gone down. This is part of our advanced planning and if we do not buy now, there is likely to be a shortage in the near future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-pune-zp-to-buy-50-000-rapid-antigen-kits-to-avoid-shortage-101634146361300.html

Somaiya in a press conference on Wednesday alleged that Ajit Pawar owns 57 firms directly or indirectly (benami) and also has involvement in deals through a shell company called Yash V Jewels Limited. He also alleged that three leaders or ministers in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government have dealt through Yash V Jewels, which was announced a shell company by SEBI in April 2009. NCP chief Sharad Pawar in his press conference on Wednesday said, “The raids on my three nieces are on for the sixth day in a row. The I-T teams have not found anything in the raids and the officers want to wind up the operation, but their ‘bosses’ from Delhi have instructed them to continue the raids. Three of my nieces are apolitical personalities and have nothing to do with the sugar mills or other businesses facing action.” “After the I-T raids on three sisters of Ajit Pawar last week, the deputy chief minister drew emotive card and said that his sisters had nothing to do with the companies. I am producing the documents today to show that Vijaya Patil and her husband and Nita Patil are the owners or shareholders in Jarandeshwar Sugar factory. The family including Ajit Pawar, his wife Sunetra and sisters hold ownership to the tune of 90.5% through their company Sparkling Soil Private Limited. The sugar factory was leased out to the family for 45 years, although there were 22 other bidders who backed out after showing interest. The Pawars created 27 layers to hide the fact related to the ownership,” Somaiya alleged. “The I-T raids are one of the biggest raids in the country so far. The I-T authorities have found many important documents hid in servants’ quarters, parking areas, inside the walls during these raids.” Ajit Pawar was not available for comment, while his office said that he will speak at an appropriate time. “The allegations are baseless,” said minority welfare minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-owns-57-companies-investment-in-deals-through-shell-company-somaiya-101634146062840.html

13-10-2021||Pune||Chorus grows louder to allow 100% occupancy at theatres, auditoriums||Theatres and auditoriums are set to reopen in Pune city and state from October 22 at 50% seating capacity. But members from the entertainment industry have appealed to the state government to reconsider the decision and allow 100% occupancy.Amol Kolhe, Member of Parliament from Pune district and an actor, has written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and requested him to reconsider the decision.“Considering the revenue model of the entertainment industry the 50% seating capacity norm must be reconsidered,” he said.“Movies and plays are watched with family and loved ones. Many would rethink before going to watch a drama with family members. Also, fully vaccinated citizens have been allowed in public transport, crowded places, and malls. The condition of 50% capacity at theatres would cause an immense financial loss to the entertainment industry which is already struggling with huge losses,” he said.“While allowing the theatres to operate at 100% capacity there is a need to exclude fully vaccinated individuals from the seating arrangements as per the current SOPs. They should be allowed to sit together,” he said.Strategists and planners from the film industry pointed out that several films are ready and haven’t yet been released because of norms and with 50% restrictions producers would refrain from releasing the films.“There are many films in line to be released. But with 50% norm no good film would be released as it is not viable for parties involved,” said Vinod Satav, founder of Lead Media, strategists and marketing firm for Marathi films.“Earlier when we had met CM, we specifically had requested him to reopen the theatres with full capacity. The decision should be taken immediately,” said Sunil Mahajan, president, Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad, Kothrud Branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chorus-grows-louder-to-allow-100-occupancy-at-theatres-auditoriums-101634145821379.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt announces ₹10,000 crore compensation for flood-affected farmers||Under fire from the opposition and the farmers’ organisations, the state government announced the package of ₹10,000 crore for the compensation to the farmers for the damages to the crops on 55 lakh hectares of land this monsoon since June. The package, however, includes the amount already announced for the agricultural losses due to the downpour in Konkan, western Maharashtra and other parts of the state in July. Eight districts of central Maharashtra, many districts in Vidarbha and north Maharashtra suffered heavy losses of lives, livestock and the crops in last week of September. More than 1.2 million (mn) hectares under cultivation were damaged, more than 20 people had died in eight districts of central Maharashtra in September while the total damage suffered since June 1 was more than 2.5mn hectares. Opposition and farmers organisations had demanded to announce wet drought so that the farmers were adequately compensated. The agricultural crop losses in central Maharashtra alone is estimated to be ₹1,796 crore since June this year. The state cabinet on Wednesday gave a nod to the package of ₹10,000 crore towards the compensation to the farmers whose crops were damaged this monsoon. The compensation has been announced at additional rates keeping the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) norms aside. “The cabinet has decided to extend the compensation of ₹10,000 a hectare for the crop losses on non-irrigated land; ₹15,000 per hectare for the losses of crops on irrigated land and ₹25,000 a hectare for the losses of perineal crops. The NDRF norms with the compensation rate ranging between ₹6,800 and ₹18000 have been increased and the state government will bear the burden,” said agriculture minister Dada Bhuse. The compensation, however, includes the package of ₹11,500 crore announced towards the losses suffered in the downpour in Konkan, Western Maharashtra and other parts in the last week of July. “Around ₹1,500 crore of it was towards the compensation to the damages of agricultural damages, and ₹365 crore of it has already been disbursed. Around ₹554 crore towards the compensation for the non-agricultural losses has been disbursed so far. The package announced today is for the crop losses suffered across the state since the outset of the monsoon on June 1,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department. The state government has submitted a memorandum of ₹1,659 crore to the Central government for the relief package as per the NDRF norms for the losses in the July downpour. The officer said that the spot assessment of the losses in September flooding is yet to be completed and the funds will be released as and when the reports are finalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-announces-10-000-crore-compensation-for-flood-affected-farmers-101634145642724.html

The river channel itsel will now be the flood line. Speaking anonymously, PMC officials, on Wednesday, confirmed that Pune’s river will developed along the lines of the Sabaramati riverfront in Ahmedabad – where there are no red and blue flood lines.The PMC’s standing committee, on Tuesday, cleared the riverfront project, with the Sangam bridge to Yerwada section of the river to be developed in the first phase.While all parties have approved the project, the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) MP Vandana Chavan raised concerns about the rivers. Chavan said, “A river cannot be considered in phases and it is one unit. The Irrigation department as well as the Central Water and Power Research Institute (CWPRS), also raised concerns about this project. Though the municipal administration claims that the CWPRS had given the nod, it’s not 100 per cent true.”Chavan added, “Irrigation department clearly said that the crosssection of the river shoukd not be altered. In spite of this, the municipal corporation decided to go ahead, without addressing these concerns. Citizens must think about it and before executing this mega project.”With the municipal elections due early next year, many elected members have raised eyebrows about the project getting cleared. The state government had asked for a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to be formed to execute this project. Pune’s Mayor Murlidhar Mohol who is the president of the SPV said, “After lot of follow ups, this project is moving ahead. It is a mega project and we will ensure that rest of the phases start very soon.”Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “The same consultant that prepared the DPR for Ahmedabad will do so for PMC.” Total cost of the project is Rs2,619 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-mula-mutha-riverfront-development-project-no-more-red-blue-flood-lines-101634145641226.html

While two minors were detained late on Tuesday, the main suspect, 22-year-old Hrishikesh, alias Shubham Bhagwat, was apprehended from the Bibwewadi area where he was trying to hide, a police official said on Wednesday. Bhagwat, who was stalking the victim, and two of his accomplices, allegedly hacked the Class 8 student to death with a sickle at a playground where she was practicisng kabaddi on Tuesday. “We have arrested four persons which include three juveniles in conflict with the law who were detained last night,” said Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has asked the police to ensure the suspects are given the harshest punishment for the crime, which according to him was an, “indication of the overall deterioration of social values”. “The incident is extremely serious. I have asked the police to take all possible efforts and ensure that the suspects are awarded the harshest punishment,” said Pawar. Police officers said that Bhagwat, a relative of the victim, was allegedly stalking her for months, and reached the playground along with two other friends on Tuesday evening. He then took the girl aside. An argument ensued and Bhagwat pulled out a sickle from his bag and hacked her to death. “The girl was at a playground where local groups hold kabaddi practices and fitness classes for children. Three people, including a 22-year-old man, came on a bike and attacked the girl with a sharp weapon. The attack was so brutal that the girl died on the spot,” DCP Patil had said after the incident. The other two, according to police, were also carrying sharp weapons and assaulted the girl. Police said the attack unfolded in front of the victim’s friends and others who came for an evening walk.Police also recovered a toy pistol from the spot, which was allegedly used to scare off the victim’s friends. Police said Shubham was staying at the victim’s house with her family in the Bibwewadi area, when he began stalking her. “Shubham was stalking her for some time though after knowing about this, the girl’s parents had warned him to leave their house and he went to stay in another area at Chinchwad,” said Sunil Zaware, senior police inspector, Bibwewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/murder-of-14-year-old-girl-in-pune-main-suspect-arrested-4-in-custody-101634145281549.html
13-10-2021||Lucknow||Ravana cut down to size in Lucknow, courtesy inflation, Covid-19||Gone are the days when Lucknowites used to see giant Ravana effigies — some as tall as 121ft — being burnt on Dussehra at Aishbagh along with huge effigies of Kumbhkarn and Meghnad.Rising inflation and the pandemic has taken a toll on Ravan effigies, while the effigies of Kumbhkarna and Meghnad have altogether disappeared.Now, even the oldest Ramleela of the city in Aishbagh has only an 80-feet-tall Ravan effigy, while the effigy in Mausambagh Ramleela is just 40 feet tall. In Rajajipuram, the effigy of Ravan is about 35 feet tall.Aditya Dwivedi, secretary, Aishbagh Ramleela committee, said, “Though the Covid-19 restrictions have eased, we are still not fully out of the pandemic. Protocols are still in place to avoid the third wave of the pandemic. The market is still dull so the contribution from people is not that great. The budget for the Ramleela has been increasing every year because everything is becoming costly. Inflation is on the rise so the height of the Ravan effigy had to be reduced while we decided to do away with the effigies of Kumbhkarna and Meghnad.”Ghanshyam Agarwal of Mausamganj Ramleela Committee said everything has become twice as expensive compared to last year. “With our limited budget and scare of Coronavirus we can only manage a 40-feet-tall effigy of Ravan,” he said.Artisan Ashok Kumar, who has been making effigies of Ravana for the last 20 years said, “The cost of Ravan has almost doubled compared to last year. While the price of paper and bamboo have risen, we have to also use eco-friendly crackers which don’t create pollution. All this only adds to the cost. However, to reduce the cost many Ramleela committees have reduced the size of their effigies.”He said, “In the past, many private housing societies used to order Ravan effigies of 20 feet. They are now ordering just 5 to 10-feet-tall Ravan effigy. Effigies of Kumbhkarn and Meghnad have not been ordered this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ravana-cut-down-to-size-in-lucknow-courtesy-inflation-covid19-101634144921275.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Mishra must resign over Lakhimpur Kheri: Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday trained his guns on the Narendra Modi-led Union government over what he termed as “misuse of central agencies” and the killing of eight persons, including four farmers, in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on October 3. Pawar also commented on the October 7 Income Tax department searches on the premises of three of his nieces, saying, “Guests should not overstay their welcome.” The 80-year-old politician was addressing a press conference at party’s office in Mumbai, where he demanded the resignation of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra, whose son Ashish was allegedly driving one of the three cars that ran over a group of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. Ashish was denied bail by a local court on Wednesday. Pawar said Mishra’s resignation was necessary to maintain people’s faith in the system. “Despite the gruesome killing, the ruling party in the Uttar Pradesh and Central government tried to shrug off the responsibility,” he said. “Ashish Mishra was arrested only after the Supreme Court pulled up the government. To ensure faith of the people in the system, the minister needs to resign from the post.”Pawar alleged that central agencies such as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Income Tax (I-T) Department, Enforcement Directorate (ED), and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are being misused by the Centre, adding that the IT raids against his nieces in Pune were the result of his statement that the Lakhimpur Kheri incident was similar to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 1919. He said some Central ministers told him that this comparison “was taken very seriously by the ‘central leadership’.” “The raids on my three nieces are on for a sixth day in a row. The I-T teams have not found anything in the raids and the officers want to wind up the operation, but their ‘bosses’ from Delhi have instructed them to continue. Three of my nieces are apolitical personalities and have nothing to do with the sugar mills or other businesses facing action. Large, 18-member teams are raiding my nieces who live small houses. We are not against the action, but it should not cross limits.”Pawar also questioned NCB’s action during the raids on a cruise party in Mumbai and agency’s association with people that face criminal charges. Aryan, the 23-year-old son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, was among those arrested for possession and consumption of narcotics. “I have heard many stories about NCB’s zonal chief during his tenure at Mumbai airport, but I will not speak about it as I have no specific information. However, there are questions over the agency’s association with the people such as Kiran Gosavi who himself faces criminal cases and is shown as absconding in police records. He is NCB’s independent witness in the case. It raises the question over the integrity of the central agency. The agency appears to take action only for the sake of publicity and to show to their bosses in Delhi and to oblige them. The seizures by Maharashtra’s anti-narcotics cell is much more than what NCB could achieve in last few years,” he said. Pawar questioned why Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders stood in NCB’s support after the allegations levelled by NCP leader Nawab Malik. Pawar criticised former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who had taunted the Congress-NCP government over the Maval firing on farmers 10 years ago. Pawar said that the Maval firing was done to disperse a mob that had gone out of control. He also alleged that the farmers in Maval were instigated by the local BJP leaders. BJP’s Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis hit back at Pawar, saying, “Pawar saheb said the Maval firing was not done by the state government, but it was the act of the police. He should also remember that the Jallianwala Bagh firing, too, was not done by the governor general but it was ordered by him and done by the police. Pawar saheb should be worried about the sensational information which is coming out to the fore from raids conducted by the central agencies. He should ask his government to curb the rampant corruption.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mishra-must-resign-over-lakhimpur-kheri-sharad-pawar-101634144861276.html

Villagers came to know about the incident when the couple’s six-year-old granddaughter came out of the house on Wednesday morning and informed villagers that her grandparents and aunt were lying motionless, they said. Senior police officials reached the spot with dog squad and forensic team for investigation after getting information about the incident from the villagers. The injured aged man was immediately admitted to the hospital while the bodies of the two women were sent for a postmortem examination, they added. According to reports, Bajrang Bahadur aka Nachkau, 60, his wife Prema Devi, 56, daughter Tanu, 18 and granddaughter Anshika, 6, were asleep at their house at Miya-ka-Pura village on Tuesday night. Late in the night, some unidentified miscreants barged into their house and attacked them with sharp-edged weapons. However, they did not harm Anshika. On Wednesday morning, Anshika came out crying from her home and called villagers. Locals were shocked when they saw the family members lying in pool of blood and immediately called police. Bajrang Bahadur was rushed to the hospital after he was found alive. Investigations revealed that bodies of Prema Devi and Tanu had multiple injuries on their bodies including on the neck. Miscreants had also broken locks of an almirah and trunks. However, details of missing valuables would be available only after arrival of Prema Devi’s elder daughter, police said. During investigations by field unit and dog squad, a pair of shoes and a blood-stained wooden club, were found at the back of the house. The enraged locals staged a protest against the incident and were pacified by senior police officials. SP (trans-Yamuna) Saurabh Dixit said locals were being questioned and all angles were under investigation. “The aged man injured in the assault may give vital clues about the miscreants and he will be questioned once his condition is better. A hunt has been launched for suspects in the surrounding areas,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-daughter-killed-by-armed-men-in-prayagraj-husband-injured-101634144741168.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Cycle track around Powai Lake flouts DCR’||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) clarification on the Powai Lake cycle track dispute issued earlier this week has come under fire from environmentalists who have pointed out that the project contravenes the BMC’s own development control regulations (DCR). The BMC had said: “Statutorily, Powai Lake reservoir is demarcated as a Natural Area (NA) in the Development Plan for Greater Mumbai (2034). The repairs, remodeling and extension works around Powai Lake are in line with part VII of Regulation 3.7 of the DPR”. It states that board walks, trekking facilities, public sanitary conveniences for visitors and sewage pumping stations are permissible within eco-sensitive areas with requisite permissions, which the MCGM has obtained from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) which is the Apex Statutory State Body of Government of Maharashtra, and MHCC has accorded its approval. Environmentalists have pointed to a provision in the BMC’s development plan which bars any construction work in close proximity of the lake. “The BMC has said a lot in their own press release, but they haven’t said anything about the fact that BMC’s own DCR does not allow ‘any construction whatsover’ in the 100m zone of the periphery of Powai Lake. Only the south part of the lake has a promenade sanctioned in the DP Plan. The rest of the periphery does not have any such development sanctioned,” said environmentalist Zoru Bhatena. Others campaigning to have the project revoked have expressed concern that work to construct the cycle track has been going on in full swing, despite the MCGM’s assurance that an expert committee will first evaluate the project and suggest mitigation measures to protect the area’s ecology and wildlife, which includes several Indian marsh crocodiles, a species protected under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972). The BMC earlier this week instated “a committee, comprising environmental experts... to discuss the site development and carry out any mitigation measures required to not just alleviate, but also enhance the Lake and its surroundings.” The committee is working on a detailed project analysis to handhold MCGM for sustainable construction during and after the project. The committee includes leading professionals in the field of environmental science, aquatic ecologies, herpetology, and a hydraulics expert with the MCGM. “There is no sign yet of the committee’s report, and there has been no news of any site visits by the committee to ascertain the ground situation,” said Amrita Bhattacharjee, another environmentalist who has been following the issue. The BMC, however, said that the committee has “deliberated in detail the environmental issues of Powai Lake, assessed various technologies and upon weighing their respective pros and cons, considers the gabion wall technology as the most adaptable method of construction, one which will be least intrusive to the natural environment of the lake.” HT reached out to committee members Dr Rakesh Kumar of NEERI and Dr Deepak Apte, formerly of the Bombay Natural History Society, for a comment on their deliberations but did not receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cycle-track-around-powai-lake-flouts-dcr-101634144381576.html

Besides, the administration has directed Nigrani Samitis and village heads to keep a track on the workers and ensure they are vaccinated. “We are expecting homecoming of the migrant workers, in large number, who may further act as Covid-19 spreaders. Hence, it is mandatory for us to ensure that all migrant labourers returning from Covid-19 hit states get vaccinated, if they have not been jabbed yet,” stated a recent order of district magistrate (DM) Abhishek Prakash. The DM also ordered Nigrani Samitis and village heads to ensure that migrant workers get vaccinated if they were still not inoculated. “Nigrani Samitis and village heads have a major role to play this festive season. They have to maintain a record of the migrant workers visiting their villages and to ensure whether they are vaccinated or not. If not, they should inform the administration and get them vaccinated,” he said. In addition, the administration has launched two mobile vaccination vans in the rural pockets and made it mandatory for them to vaccinate at least 1000 people in a day. Also, the administration has directed the medical teams to carry out random sampling and testing in the rural areas as well. The DM has appealed to the people in the city areas that they ensure that their near and dear ones are fully vaccinated.

13-10-2021||Mumbai||Over 1,000 govt offices sent phishing email; prompt action by cyber police restricts impact||Maharashtra cyber police, which is probing the Mumbai cyber police station email account compromise matter, has found that the suspicious email was sent to over 1,000 government offices and private persons. A preliminary probe indicated that the unidentified attackers intended to steal confidential information. However, prompt suo-motto action by the state cyber police restricted the impact of the attack. The officers contacted the email recipients and asked them to change their passwords. “We detected the attack during our regular surveillance and by contacting as many as recipients through calls, emails and other media we managed to reduce the impact of the attack to the minimum by advising them to change the passwords of their email accounts,” said Sanjay Shintre, Superintendent of police, state cyber. “Attackers may have done this by temporarily hacking the cyber cell email account,” an officer said. The email was sent from the email ID belonging to the east region cyber police station, and it is in the name of senior inspector Rajesh Shivajirao Nagawade. Nagawade didn’t respond to phone calls. “It would not be completely correct to say that the cyber police station’s account has been hacked, as they didn’t lose access to it, but email was sent by using their e-mail ID, said a state cyber police officer. Targeted recipients received suspicious emails under the subject “Terrorists behind JK attacks gunned down in Mumbai.” The email had an attached PDF document named “Report Intelligence.” On clicking the document, the users were directed to a website and their email account got compromised, said a police officer. Thousands of police offices, government officers and private individuals from Maharashtra, Delhi and other parts of the country had received the phishing email. “Preliminary inquiry has revealed that the email was sent from Rawalpindi, Punjab province of Pakistan. But we are not sure if the email, in reality, was sent from Pakistan, or the cybercriminals used other methods to show it that it is sent from the servers in Pakistan. It is learnt that an individual from UP was behind creating the PDF document, but nothing much can be shared at this stage.

13-10-2021||Mumbai||Covid killed more senior citizens in Mumbai than any other age group: Study||On October 4, a 63-year-old retired businessman from Borivli, who spent eight days at the Seven Hills Hospital in Marol battling Covid-19, went into cardiac arrest. The businessman had hypertension and heart disease for which he was soon to undergo an angioplasty. He had taken the first shot of the vaccine in July and the second one was due this month when Covid-19 struck. He is one among the 10,387 senior citizens who have succumbed to Sars-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic, and according to data provided to Hindustan Times by the civic body, also part of the age group that has seen the highest mortality.In Mumbai, over half the Covid-19 deaths have been reported in senior citizens. According to data provided by the civic body, 51% of all deaths recorded from the start of the pandemic till October 10, 2021, have been in the age group of 61 to 80 years. While 13.3% of the deaths were seen among those above the age of 80, nearly 37% of deaths were recorded among people between 20-60 years, which is largely the working age group. An analysis carried out by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on mortality figures shows that senior citizens have remained the most vulnerable group throughout both waves of the pandemic. Of the 16,149 deaths recorded in the city till October 10, the most number of deaths were seen in the 61 to 70 years age group (27.4%). The 71-80 age group recorded 23.6% of all deaths. Together, these two groups contributed to 51% of the city’s deaths. “The advanced age and comorbid conditions are the main reasons why senior citizens have remained susceptible,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, intensive care specialist at Fortis Hospital and member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. The civic data showed that a majority of the deceased across all age groups had diabetes and hypertension which led to severe symptoms of Covid-19 and made recovery difficult. Underlying diseases have also been linked to prolonged hospitalisation and oxygen requirement and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions according to doctors who have been treating Covid patients throughout the pandemic. The civic body did not record the vaccination status of those who have died due to Covid-19, as the national vaccination programme began only at the start of this year, and was opened out to cover senior citizens starting March 1. Since then, Mumbai has achieved nearly 75% full vaccination coverage in senior citizens – the city has an estimated 1.10 million people who are above 60 years. “But we must remember that Covid-19 has not gone. The infection is still lurking. While vaccination will provide a certain degree of protection, Covid appropriate behaviour is a must,” said Pandit. “Those who are vaccinated must not let their guards down.” While the second wave has been receding and the daily number of infections in the city has been steady, medical experts have expressed concern about breakthrough infections and re-infections. Breakthrough infections are those that occur among people two weeks after completing the mandated full vaccination schedule. While many hospitals are individually collecting data, there is still limited data available on the overall incidence of breakthroughs and re-infections seen in Mumbai. “Senior citizens and people with comorbidities may not have the same degree of protection from the vaccine compared to others,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Tanu Singhal from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. “If one has symptoms, it’s best to immediately seek medical help and get tested even if they are fully vaccinated. New treatment options like the monoclonal antibodies can prevent severe disease if patients seek timely help,” she said. Effect on childrenMortality figures among children have remained the lowest through the pandemic: 0.1% among those below 10 years, and 0.3% among 11- to 20-year-olds. Experts said that these figures indicated that the decision to open schools was accurate. “Parents should not be reluctant to send their children to schools,” said Singhal. “Adults are stepping out. Children are stepping out to play and going out with the adults. Thus, going to school will not present any additional risk. People must ensure that adults at home, mainly grandparents are vaccinated. Only children who have severe comorbid conditions should continue to stay at home [to stay safe],” she said. Experts said the stay-at-home orders during the pandemic have resulted in mental health issues among children, and many are even reluctant to get back to a schedule. “They have to be gradually brought back into the schedule,” said Singhal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-killed-more-senior-citizens-in-mumbai-than-any-other-age-group-study-101634142280902.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan chatted about drugs in bulk quantity with a foreigner: NCB||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), while opposing the bail application of Aryan Khan, model Munmun Dhamecha and actor Arbaaz Merchant, told the court that they have written to the Ministry of External Affairs, seeking help to arrest a foreign national who has allegedly chatted with the accused and is a suspected peddler. The agency told the court that Khan has chatted with peddlers about drugs in bulk quantity, and used to procure drugs through Merchant.Additional solicitor general, Anil Singh, who appeared for the NCB and opposed the bail applications of the three, told the court that bail applications are heard day in and out, but it is not like they have to be decided on the same day. NCB is a credible agency dealing with drug trafficking. Consumption of drugs by youngsters is affecting the whole nation, not only economically but also otherwise. The agency is concerned about the gangs involved and efforts are made to trace them.“They have been arguing Aryan Khan was invited to the cruise ship however who invited and when invited nothing is shown on record. It’s not a simple case that you were invited and you have only consumed drugs. After the third remand application we have applied section 29 of the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substance Act (NDPS) Act that is for abetment and criminal conspiracy. There are twenty accused, out of which four are drug peddlers. We have evidence in the form of WhatsApp chats that Khan and Merchant were in touch with them.”ASG further told the court, “There are chats which mention about commercial quantities or bulk quantities. There are chats with foreign nationals in reference to hard drugs. Somebody won’t order bulk quantities for consumption. There is something more. We have spoken to the Ministry of External Affairs and are trying to locate the foreign national.”“It’s a chain and all are connected. If they are given bail it will hamper our further investigations. The contraband was with Arbaaz for consumption of both, both were aware about it. Whatever may be the quantity, if section 29 of NDPS is applied, the punishment will be the same for all due to conspiracy. The person who is charged with the offence will be punished with the same offence as the conspirator.”The counsels for Khan have also argued that he has retracted his statement. They did the same on October 3, however, we have also recorded his statement on October 4, which is not retracted.“You have the right to retract, but when are you saying that you have retracted. You have not retracted your second statement, which talks about your consumption.”Earlier senior counsel Amit Desai, who argued for Khan’s bail application, told the court.“They are not drug peddlers or drug traffickers, but young kids. They have learnt their lessons, let us not penalise them.”The NDPS act itself was reformed and punishment for consumption was brought down. Reformation is the way. Even Cannabis was removed from the dangerous drugs schedule. Something has to be done, but this is not the way to do it. In many countries, this substance is legal. They have suffered enough.“Nothing was found on Aryan Khan. Whatever was found was from Merchant, that too 6g of Charas, the agency has been relying on his statement and claiming that both of them used to consume it. This has a one-year punishment, the involvement in consumption, no substance for sale, and there is no money, so no purchase.”Desai told the court that Aryan had no money so there was no question of purchase.The agency has said in its remand application the accused are “inextricably connected with each other” and “it is not possible to dissect the role, involvement of one accused from that of the other.”“Don’t they say this in every case, they said they wanted to inquire about international drug trafficking on October 4, we are now on October 13. They are saying that they have connection and nexus, whom are they talking of. Khan and Merchant know each other, that’s a fact.”The allegations levelled against Khan by the agency of illicit drug trafficking are frightening, very serious allegations they have dumped upon him. There is no material found on him, they are talking about cultivation, sale, purchase of drugs there is nothing against him and is this a responsible agency?Khan has not been arrested for conspiracy; other persons arrested are in separate punchnama; how can they all be linked.Senior counsel Taraq Sayyad, who argued for Merchant, told the court, “It’s a clear case of consumption. The court should immediately grant bail; there is even no need for prosecution. Both were together and they have already accepted the fact; they don’t know anybody else. They have already spent time in jail so should be granted bail.”Ali Kashif Khan, who argued for Dhamecha, told the court, “I am a fashion model who had gone to do a ramp walk on the cruise. They recovered drugs from my room but there were two more people in the same room. I had just reached the cruise when the raid happened.”Additional sessions judge, VV Patil, after hearing both the sides, adjourned the matter to Thursday as ASG Anil Singh wanted to further argue in the matter.A metropolitan magistrate has rejected the bail applications of Khan, Dhamecha and Merchant, saying that they were not maintainable before it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-khan-chatted-about-drugs-in-bulk-quantity-with-a-foreigner-ncb-101634141741262.html

Later, he made ID cards on other addresses and on the basis of those documents, he got his passport made in 2014. He has a permanent address of Bihar and has different addresses on other IDs,” said another officer of Delhi Police. Sources in Bihar government said he managed to get a residential certificate with the help of sarpanch but refused to divulge the name of the district.Additional director general of Bihar Police (headquarters), Jitendra Singh Gangwar, said the state’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) was in touch with its Delhi counterparts. “If Delhi Police team comes to Bihar, we will extend all cooperation. So far, there is no official contact in this regard,” he said.Notorious pastTerror links being traced to Bihar is not new, be it Dubai-based terrorist Aftab Ansari alias Farhan Mallik, whose passport was made at a Nalanda address or LTTE chief Prabhakaran, whose driving licence was traced to Dhanbad in early 1990s when the coal town was part of undivided Bihar.In the past, several terror suspects have been picked up from Madhubani, Darbhanga, Samastipur and Purnea districts. Intelligence agencies had claimed to have stumbled upon incriminating evidence in Darbhanga in the aftermath of blasts at the 2014 rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Patna.In 2014, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) nabbed Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and his aide Asadullah from the Indo-Nepal border. Bhatkal used to work in Bihar in the guise of an Ayurvedic physician, identifying himself as “Dr Imran”. In 2009, a Nepal-based Lashkar operative, Mohammad Omar Madni, who hailed from Madhubani, was arrested by a Delhi Police team. In 2006, Kamaluddin and Khalid Sheikh were arrested from Madhubani’s Basobpatti area in connection with Mumbai train blasts.Bihar’s revenue and land reforms minister Ram Surat Kumar, who is from BJP, had earlier alleged that infiltration in Seemanchal districts has been happening with cooperation from the locals, who help them buy land, build houses and start their businesses on the basis of fake documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/delhi-arrest-turns-lens-on-bihar-terror-links-again-101634141383402.html
13-10-2021||Other||Tiger found dead in VTR||Forest officials in Bihar’s West Champaran district found a tiger’s carcass in Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) on Wednesday.This is the fourth death of a big cat in VTR since a report released in August 2018 put their number at 32, excluding nine cubs. With the latest death, the number of tigers in the VTR is down to 28. “Prima facie, it appears that the death occurred due to the injuries sustained in a fight with other wild animal,” said HK Rai, the wildlife conservator and field director, VTR. “Viscera will be sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) at Bareilly and Wildlife Institute of India (WWI) at Dehradun for forensic tests,” Rai said, ruling out the possibility of poaching as the cause of the death. Incidents of poaching are not unheard of in VTR. In January 2019, forest officials had rescued a wild bear from the trap and later released it in the forest.In August 2019, a man was arrested with over five kilograms of flesh of deer from a village in VTR. In 2018, a bear was found dead. In 2014-15, two bears were poached in Haranatand forest areas of the tiger reserve.Spread over 900 square kilometres, VTR is broadly divided into two divisions and has 150-km-long perimeter with 120 villages, It is home to a number of wild animals, including tigers, leopards, bears and rhinoceros.Past deathsOn February 19, 2021, a tigress captured from VTR after it killed three villagers in West Champaran died at a zoo in Patna. On January 30, 2021, a tiger’s carcass was recovered in VTR. On January 1, 2020, a tigress was found dead in the Raghiya forest range of VTR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tiger-found-dead-in-vtr-101634141382208.html

Wankhede along with the senior IPS officer of NCB met the Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey on Monday and submitted a written complaint claiming that some persons had been following him for the past few days.Wankhede has been investigating the cruise drug case and arrested a total of 20 people including actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and other high profile people, drug suppliers and foreign nationals involved in the case in the past 10 days.After the cruise drug bust, the senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik, in a press conference on October 6, claimed that the arrest was a conspiracy involving the NCB and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defame Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray-led coalition government and the film industry. Malik claimed that two private persons were involved in the raid, one of them is Manish Bhanushali who claims to be a BJP office-bearer and the other is KP Gosawi, who claims to be a private detective. In a press conference, Malik played two widely-circulated video clips of Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant. In the first, Gosawi can be seen bringing Aryan to the NCB office and in the second, Bhanushali is seen bringing Merchant to the NCB office. However, the charge is promptly denied by the NCB and BJP. NCB claimed that both Bhanushali and Gosavi were independent witnesses in the case. Wankhede had earlier also arrested Malik’s son-in-law in a drug case from Bandra this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cruise-drug-case-top-cop-orders-inquiry-into-sameer-wankhede-s-allegations-101634138080685.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Crime branch seeks Sachin Vaze’s custody in Goregaon extortion case||The Mumbai crime branch on Wednesday approached the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court for the custody of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, arrested in the Antilia explosive scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case. The crime branch wants to question Vaze in an extortion case registered with the Goregaon police station, in which former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has been also named as an accused. In August, the Goregaon police had registered a case against Singh, Vaze and civilians — Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vijay Singh and Riyaz Bhati for extortion. The complainant hotelier Bimal Agarwal has alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakhs from him and had threatened of registering cases against Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar, owned by him. The special NIA court judge AT Wankhede allowed the crime branch to question another former police officer Sunil Mane who is lodged in jail, also arrested in the twin cases. The court has posted the agency’s plea for Vaze’s custody for hearing on October 22, after calling for a reply from the prison’s department on his health condition. When Vaze’s counsel Raunak Naik tried to oppose the plea, the court told him that a metropolitan magistrate had already issued a warrant for his production and that he should have objected before the magistrate court. According to crime branch officials, Vaze is the main accused in the case. The police have already arrested Sumeet Singh, who had allegedly collected extortion money for Vaze. Meanwhile, former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma has filed a default bail application, which is also posted for hearing on October 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crime-branch-seeks-sachin-vaze-s-custody-in-goregaon-extortion-case-101634137960765.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Row erupts as Centre widens BSF jurisdiction from 15km to 50km in Punjab||With the Centre increasing the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in Punjab for seizure, search and arrest up to 50km from the international border with Pakistan, a row has erupted in the border districts. Farmers, politicians and the Punjab Police officials have criticised the Centre’s move, many terming it a ‘direct attack’ on the federal structure of the country. Six border districts in Punjab—Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Ferozepur and Fazilka—will be affected by the BSF’s wider jurisdiction for raids and arrests under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the Indian Passports Act. “Instead of increasing the BSF’s jurisdiction inside the Indian territory, the Centre should focus on making the border foolproof against flow of drugs, arms and ammunition from Pakistan. Even drones from across the border hover around without problem as the BSF lacks technology and manpower,” said Kabal Singh Muhawa, an active member of Punjab Border Area Kisan Welfare Society (PBAKWS) in Amritsar. The society’s vice-president Surjit Singh Bhura said, “Farmers whose land is situated across the barbed fence face difficulties as the BSF lacks adequate manpower. Instead of increasing the BSF’s jurisdiction, the Centre should first provide adequate manpower to the force.”A senior police official, who is posted in a border district, requesting anonymity, said, “Punjab Police are capable of dealing with any kind of situation. The decision is unfortunate. Punjab Police have already been seizing arms, ammunition and drugs even from across the barbed fence.”He further said the decision will also have many complications during the trials in cases where the BSF will be involved. “Most BSF personnel get transferred within two or three years. It will be a task to produce the BSF personnel concerned in local courts in cases of seizures and arrests,” he said.Another police official posted in the border area said, “Punjab Police are even capable of guarding the border. The decision should be revoked immediately.”Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) spokesperson and Tarn Taran district president Virsa Singh Valtoha said, “It is an attack on our federal structure. The Centre is working in collusion with the state government.”The decision of the Centre comes a day after BSF’s director general (DG) Pankaj Kumar visited various border outposts (BoPs) in Punjab and reviewed the ‘domination and operational preparedness’ on the ground.On October 5, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi had met Union home minister Amit Shah and sought his ‘personal intervention’ to seal the border for breaking the supply chain of drugs and arms from across the border. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Rajya Sabha member from Amritsar Shwait Malki, however, hailed the decision. “The BSF is more capable than the Punjab Police. The decision is for the security and safety of the country and its citizens. Even, former CM Captain Amarinder Singh had repeatedly requested the Centre to protect the border area from the nefarious designs of Pakistan. There should be no politics on the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-erupts-as-centre-widens-bsf-jurisdiction-from-15km-to-50km-in-punjab-101634137900829.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC plans to generate electricity by putting up solar panels along Mumbai coastal road||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned to generate electricity from the 10-km-long stretch of the Mumbai coastal road project by setting up solar panels.State environment minister and Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray has asked the BMC to identify space for installing solar panels on the coastal road between Nariman Point and Worli, which has been under construction since October 2018. According to the plan, the civic body will have to identify space on the cycle track or median (divider) that will be constructed as part of the ongoing coastal road project. The plan was revealed by Thackeray last week at the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) relating to climate change along with BMC officials.Thackeray said, “The coastal road will have more than 90 hectares of green space. We want to have carbon sequestration using multiple measures. The first and foremost is we would be having a global call for design for landscape and trees to have dense urban forest, enough for carbon capture. There is already a cycle track and walking pathway, along with a huge promenade towards the sea, and I have asked the BMC to explore the idea to have solar panels either over the cycle track, or the median to see if we can generate solar energy.”Thackeray added, “However, none of the open space would be encroached on by the solar panels. For Mumbai- Nagpur, I have pitched for solar farms along the highway alignment, because of which, we would have the potential of 250 MW generated. This is different; we may give the electricity to the grid as well.”Similarly, the Maharashtra State Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is constructing the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, has proposed to install solar panels on the expressway which is expected to be thrown open fully next year. The plan to install solar panels was mooted by the MSRDC in July 2016. Mumbai Coastal Road might be the first intra-city road to have solar panels generating electricity for public consumption. A month ago, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) also signed the MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) to conduct feasibility studies of the establishment of solar power projects on the available vacant land parcels with NHAI and rooftops of NHAI buildings/ structures at a toll plaza and other NHAI owned buildings/ structures.In Mumbai, the coastal road will be the first intra-city road to get solar panels and later other arterial roads also might be considered. However, currently, the BMC’s focus, when it comes to the 2,000-km-long road network it handles in the city, is to concretise around 80% of the total road network in the next six to seven years to bring down the menace of potholes. Mumbai-based architect Rahul Kadri of IMK Architects, who is working with the BMC on the Malabar Hill walkway project said, “It is a good idea to have solar panels on the cycle track, medians, on top of the tunnels or the entrance of the tunnel. This will also go with the design. However, the solar panels should not be installed on green space considering that space will not be usable later.”The construction work of the ₹12,700 crore coastal road was started in October 2018, and since then the project has been in the news for environmental issues. In July 2019, the Bombay high court (HC) put a stay on the project citing that it needed to have environmental clearances. The coastal road project measuring around 10km between Princess Street flyover and Worli-end of Bandra-Worli sea link was earlier expected to be ready by July 2023. However, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, which initially delayed the delivery of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) from China. Also, the BMC had to tweak its plan to not use Chinese experts for the assembling of the TBM in the backdrop of border tensions between India and China.Currently, the BMC has completed over 40% of the civil works for the coastal road project and over 1-km tunnel works out of the total 1.9-km tunnelling is completed. The BMC recently also appointed the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) for carrying out a comprehensive scientific survey to scrutinise the loss of lives of the fishing communities due to the ongoing coastal road project.Meanwhile, the coastal road project was originally planned between Nariman Point and Kandivli, claiming it will ease traffic for those travelling between north and south Mumbai. However, now there is a question of whether there should be a coastal road or a sea link beyond Versova to connect to the suburbs. The state is yet to take a call on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-to-generate-electricity-by-putting-up-solar-panels-along-mumbai-coastal-road-101634137840736.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Questioning suspect is our right, says ED; HC reserves order on Anil Deshmukh’s plea||The Enforcement Directorate (ED), while opposing the petition of former home minister Anil Deshmukh which sought quashing of proceedings arising out of the summons being issued to him by ED, argued that the high court (HC) petition was not maintainable as the agency was only exercising its right to investigate and had summoned Deshmukh only to question him with regards to the material seized from him. The ED argued that the fact that though it had only issued summons for questioning, Deshmukh’s reluctance to come in person indicated that he was aware that he could be arrested. The ED also submitted that it had a right to question the suspect at the place and time it deemed fit and not the other way round, hence no reliefs should be granted as the investigation was just at the initial stage and the court’s interference would indict the entire process. The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the petition of Deshmukh was informed by senior counsel Aman Lekhi for the ED that the entire premise of the petition was misconceived. Lekhi submitted that the agency had only issued summons to Deshmukh in the exercise of section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which requires a suspect to attend the ED office in person. However, Deshmukh was jumping to the conclusion that he would be arrested under section 19 of the same Act when he went in person, which indicated that he had some guilt and something to hide, he added. “This is the initial stage of the investigation and interrogation of a suspect is the right of the agency. However, the petitioner has been avoiding the summons and approached the court which indicates that he wants to stifle and interdict the investigation,” submitted Lekhi. He further referred to past judgements of the Supreme Court and also the order passed in the petition filed by Deshmukh before approaching the HC and said that none of them provided any protection to the suspect as the court realised that without interrogation, details of the crime being investigated would not come to the fore, hence the current bench should also not interfere. Lekhi further argued that that the submission that documents were being sought from the petitioner without giving him the ECIR also was not valid as the summons were intended to question the suspect regarding the recoveries made during his house search. Lekhi submitted that the HC had no reason to interfere and should not grant the reliefs sought by the petitioner. Thereafter, the bench said it had concluded hearing the arguments of both sides and reserved its order, which is expected to be passed in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/questioning-suspect-is-our-right-says-ed-hc-reserves-order-on-anil-deshmukh-s-plea-101634137720776.html

Earlier on October 5, the prices of CNG and domestic PNG were hiked and were priced at ₹54.57/kg, while PNG was available at ₹32.67/SCM in slab 1 and ₹36.00 /SCM in slab 2. “Being a customer-focused company, MGL has always tried to maintain price stability for its CNG and domestic PNG customers. However, since there has been an increase in gas prices, MGL has decided to progressively recover from such an increase in gas cost. Accordingly, MGL is constrained to further increase the basic price of CNG by ₹2.30/kg and PNG by ₹1.11/ SCM in and around Mumbai,” said a statement from MGL. The prices of CNG and domestic PNG were last hiked in the city in July. CNG was available at ₹51.98/kg, while PNG was available at ₹30.40/ SCM in slab 1 and ₹36.00 /SCM in slab 2 respectively.

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura, Behbal Kalan police firing: Six years on, investigations look inconclusive amid legal setbacks||Even six years after police firing incidents at Faridkot district’s Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan, the investigations done by different special investigation teams (SIT) appear to be inconclusive. Setbacks on the legal front — quashing of charge sheets in Kotkapura case by high court and stay on investigation against former Punjab director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini — have left the probe teams at the crossroads. On October 14, 2015, police had opened fire at people protesting at the above-mentioned locations against the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in Faridkot’s Bargari village. Two Sikh protesters — Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village in Faridkot district— were killed in the firing at Behbal Kalan. In April this year, the high court had quashed all the reports related to Kotkapura firing filed by the previous SIT headed by the inspector general of police (now retired) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Acting on the HC orders, the state government constituted a new three-member SIT headed by ADGP LK Yadav, who is being assisted by IG Rakesh Agrawal and DIG Surjit Singh. The new SIT was directed to complete the investigation within six months. SIT consulting legal experts on KotkapuraMore than five months after starting the probe into Kotkapura firing case, the SIT led by ADGP LK Yadav is yet to file a fresh charge sheet against the accused in the court. The probe team is in a fix over filing the charge sheet in the light of high court’s staying till February 2022 investigations in cases pending against former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini. An officer privy to the investigation said the SIT was consulting legal experts whether they should file the first charge sheet against the accused, excluding Saini, or wait until February. “Another option before the state government is to challenge the high court order. Saini has a very significant role in this case, so without him, a key link will be missing,” the official added. Even the newly appointed special public prosecutor senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains has also suggested that the state government should immediately challenge the high court order staying probe against Saini to ensure speedy justice in the cases. Yadav-led SIT is also waiting for a date from Gandhinagar-based forensic science laboratory (FSL) for conducting a lie-detection test on suspended inspector general (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal even as the permission for the test was granted three months ago. When contacted DIG Surjit Singh, who is a member of the SIT, refused to comment stating that the high court has barred them from talking to the media about the case.Charges yet to be framed in Behbal Kalan case A trial court in Faridkot is yet to start the hearing on arguments for framing of charges against the accused in Behbal Kalan firing case after which the trial will start. Further, the court has exempted Saini from personal appearance following the HC order. So, this may delay the proceedings of the trial court further. “SIT investigation says that Saini’s role was the centre point in the case. All the key links need to be there,” said a lawyer. The Kunwar Vijay Pratap-led SIT had filed charge sheet against seven accused, including five cops, in the Behbal Kalan firing case. The SIT claimed that the cops opened fire at peaceful protesters at the direction of Umranangal, who got instructions from Saini, and later conspired to fabricate the evidence to cover up the incidents. The first charge sheet was filed against former Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma in April 2019. Later, the SIT filed charge sheet against four accused, including SP Bikramjit Singh in October 2020. The charge sheets against Umranangal and Saini were filed in January. After Kunwar Vijay took voluntary retirement, the government formed a three-member SIT headed by IG Naunihal Singh to probe the Behbal Kalan firing case in May. However, the SIT head is yet to visit the Faridkot district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-behbal-kalan-police-firing-six-years-on-investigations-look-inconclusive-amid-legal-setbacks-101634137420729.html

The accused told the supervisor that the site was just 10km from Thane Creek Flamingo National Sanctuary Boundary and a notice was issued to them stating that permission for the work had not been sought from the National Wildlife Board at Thane and the Forest Department.Following the notice, the trio had demanded a bribe of ₹5 lakh from the complainant for not taking action on him. Of the ₹5 lakh demanded, ₹3.5 lakh was being received by Pawar when the ACB laid a trap and nabbed them, said superintendent of police, Panjabrao Ugale, ACB, Thane range.The complainant had also alleged that apart from the said amount, he was also asked to pay ₹25,000 per month for the next six months. The trap was laid at Sector 17, Vashi, wherein Pawar and Verma, came in a car and accepted a bribe of ₹3.5 lakh from the complainant. “The trio has been remanded to police custody till October 16,” Ugale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-forest-officials-from-thane-arrested-for-bribery-after-trap-set-in-vashi-101634137240450.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Colleges in Maharashtra to reopen from October 20||Amid the sustained decline in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the state, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday announced that colleges in the state will reopen from October 20. Physical classes will, however, reopen only for students who have received both doses of the vaccine against Covid-19, the government order stated.Earlier this month, the state government reopened schools in urban and rural areas. In rural areas, classes 5 to 12 started from October 4, while in urban areas, classes 8 to 12 were reopened. “For the past week, I was saying that the time has come for colleges to reopen. Today, we discussed the issue with the chief minister, deputy chief minister and the senior officials and decided to reopen colleges from October 20... The colleges that come under the Higher and Technical Education [department], including UGC, PG, engineering colleges, etc. will reopen from October 20,” said Uday Samant, Maharashtra’s higher and technical education minister.The government resolution (GR) issued by the government on Wednesday stated that colleges and universities must set up vaccination camps for students. “The students must be fully vaccinated and those should be asked to attend classes in priority. If the students are not vaccinated then universities and colleges must take the initiative to set up a vaccination camp for students on the campus, after discussion with the local administration. Such instructions have been given to all universities and college managements,” Samant said.The minister said that the department will send a proposal to the chief secretary to allow college students in Mumbai to travel by local trains. Currently, only fully vaccinated citizens are allowed to use Mumbai suburban local train services.Samant added that the teaching and non-teaching staff in the universities and colleges must be fully vaccinated. While starting physical classes in the universities and colleges, the management must engage with the local district administration on whether to start it with 50% capacity or more, he added. He further appealed to guardians, parents and students, including those who are fully vaccinated, to ensure all precautions while attending college.Some districts in Maharashtra continue to have more Covid-19 cases than other parts. For such districts, the universities and college management can decide on reopening, depending on the situation in conjunction with the local district administration.“Nobody knows that if and when the third wave of Covid infections will come. If it happens, universities and colleges must coordinate with the local administration to prepare a dedicated guideline for the district. Some districts currently have a high number of cases... for example Sindhudurg, Satara, Ahmednagar still have a high number of cases. Such districts can discuss with the local administration and take a decision [on reopening colleges],” the minister said.The universities or colleges are also mandated to set up online classes for those students who cannot attend the lectures. Some students may be staying back in their villages since hostels are still not operational, they have can attend classes online, the minister said. He said, “We are planning to reopen hostels in a graded manner. The department will survey the hostels and they will be reopened gradually.”Meanwhile, principals and school staff are concerned about preparations that need to be in place, while students are excited to be able to attend classes after almost two years of online sessions.“This has come as a relief as we were wondering if we would have to continue with online sessions this year as well. We were looking forwards for the fun of meeting classmates and attending physical sessions, which helps us understand concepts better,” said Anvita Joshi, 19, student of Ruia CollegePrincipals are busy chalking out plans to set up a hybrid model of teaching. Most colleges have exams around the same time, making it difficult to shift to offline sessions immediately. “We have our exams beginning from October 20 so we will have to delay reopening, however, in the meantime we are preparing a hybrid model of teaching. Our priority at reopening would be students that have practical sessions to attend. Classes for final year students of graduation and post graduation will begin first,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College. Moreover, the concern for most is commuting as many are not due for the second dose yet. Reaching college for staff and students without access to local trains would be difficult. “The government should permit those with identification cards access to local trains even if they have only taken one dose of vaccination. This should include non teaching staff as well. Most travel from various locations within Mumbai,” said TA Shiware, chairman of Mumbai Association of non-government colleges.“I have to travel from Thane till Ville Parle on a regular basis if college reopens. I am keen on attending offline sessions, but my second dose of vaccine is due only next month. Without access to local trains I will not be able to attend,” said Viraj Desai, 20, student of Mithibai College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colleges-in-maharashtra-to-reopen-from-october-20-101634135982467.html

13-10-2021||Dehradun||‘Not without an apology’: Harish Rawat raises the bar for ex-Congress leaders to return||Dehradun: Former Congress leaders who crossed over to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2016 and want to return will have to give a public apology before being allowed back to the party, former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat said on Wednesday.The senior Congress leader’s assertion comes against the backdrop of speculation that labour minister Harak Singh Rawat could be looking at the possibility of exiting the ruling BJP ahead of Uttarakhand state elections in early 2022. To be sure, Harak Singh Rawat has rebutted suggestions that he was reviewing his options and insisted that he intended to stay in the BJP.“Those who were involved in the horse-trading episode to bring down my government (in 2016), committed a felony. They won’t be allowed to return unless they offer an apology for their actions in public. That apology should be made to our leaders, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the Uttarakhand public and even to their gods,” said Harish Rawat, a reference to the nine Congress legislators who crossed over to the BJP in 2016. Labour minister Harak Singh Rawat, a six-time legislator, was among the nine.Much of the buzz around minister Harak Singh Rawat’s next move started with his unscheduled meeting with Uttarakhand BJP president Madan Kaushik on Tuesday, just a day after the BJP’s Yashpal Arya announced his resignation from Pushkar Singh Dhami-led government and the party. He rejoined the Congress on Monday along with his son Sanjiv, also a legislator.A video where he is heard vowing not to fight the assembly election fuelled the speculation.Harak Singh Rawat told reporters in Dehradun that he was not keen on contesting the 2022 assembly elections but stressed that the video, which was being circulated, was from 2012. He didn’t keep his 2012 pledge and did contest the election. “There was some situation during that time that I had to contest. But for the 2022 elections, I am not very much interested in contesting,” he said.On his meeting with state BJP chief on Tuesday, Harak Singh said he was on his way to Dehradun from Kotdwar when he got a call from Madan Kaushik. The meeting lasted an hour, he said, adding that it was focused on preparations for the upcoming elections. “That’s it,” he said. Kaushik made the same point and rejected suggestions that it was aimed at mollifying Harak Singh. “There was nothing extraordinary discussed in the meeting. We both have meetings at regular intervals as Rawat is one of our senior leaders in the state. It’s election time and there are many issues to discuss related to it,” he said.Political observers indicated that they do not take these statements at their face value.“Definitely all eyes are now on (Harak Singh) Rawat considering the developments in the last few weeks pertaining to him. On many occasions, he has made statements which suggest that despite being a cabinet minister in the BJP government, he is not happy there,” said political commentator Jai Singh Rawat. Congress general secretary Harish Rawat, who insisted on a public apology by legislators who had rebelled against his leadership, said Yashpal Arya didn’t have to give such an apology because his case was “different”.“Arya didn’t leave the party with the intention of taking down my government like the others. His reasons were different which were personal with me. His return to the Congress would help to make it stronger,” Harish Rawat explained.Senior political analyst SMA Kazmi said Harish Rawat will not want Harak Singh to return “as he was one of the main leaders whose defection brought down his government” but his statement has led to a dilemma for the Congress.“The party leadership will want to welcome him (Harak Singh Rawat) considering that he is a stalwart and his return will definitely boost the organisation...But Harish won’t allow it,” said Kazmi.He added that both parties are likely to try to get lawmakers and leaders from the other side to defect.Leader of opposition in the assembly Pritam Singh, who is being credited with engineering Arya’s return to the Congress, said, the “party’s door is open to anyone willing to come.”“We won’t refuse anyone willing to come to the party. However, we will first analyse their utility in the party. Only then we will welcome them. Of course, it will be done with the approval of the national leadership like in Arya’s case,” Pritam Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/not-without-an-apology-harish-rawat-raises-the-bar-for-ex-congress-leaders-to-return-101634135380802.html

Together, the DTC and cluster scheme comprise the public transport bus fleet in the national capital.The new buses will also be equipped with latest features like GPS, panic buttons, CCTV cameras and are expected to roll out on the city roads by mid-2022, if the bids are successfully carried out, officials of the department said.According to estimates, Delhi requires at least 11,000 buses to fulfill public transport needs of the people. Delhi government has been making efforts to add more buses.The DTC too had floated tenders for 300 electric buses recently that are expected to roll out from November this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-to-induct-140-electric-ac-buses-to-check-air-pollution-101634131990887.html

I congratulate him. After being the chief minister for five years, Fadnavis still feels he is holding the post. I lacked this trait. I have served as chief minister (of Maharashtra) four times. But I don't even remember," Pawar said at a press conference on Wednesday.Speaking to reporters in Navi Mumbai on Tuesday, Fadnavis said the love and affection of people for him had not yet receded even after two years of his moving on from the CM’s role. "I still feel that I am chief minister as I have been roaming in the state over the last two years. The love and affection of people have not receded,” he said on Tuesday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader had served as the chief minister from 2014-2019. He had to give up the post after the 2019 assembly election when the BJP’s decades-old ally, the Shiv Sena, parted ways over leadership issues.While he did retain his office for three days by forming a coalition with a breakaway group of NCP led by Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar, his government fell after Pawar rescinded his support, paving way for the MVA government to take over with Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray as the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-has-this-to-say-on-devendra-fadnavis-still-feel-like-maha-cm-comment-101634128995089.html

The 115-foot-long wooden bridge has been built after dismantling a 20 years old bamboo bridge which had broken earlier this year. The birders had been demanding for a new bridge for the past several months.“Visitors had been facing issues due to the broken bridge. The new bridge is stronger and aesthetically beautiful. It has an iron base with wooden framework. The wooden bridge is three foot wide, while the older bridge was two feet wide. It has been constructed at a cost of around ₹7 lakh and has a life of at least 20 years,” said PK Srivastav, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. The officials also said that they have proposed a new development project for the Surajpur wetland and reserve forest.“We have proposed it to the higher officials. We aim to enhance facilities in the Surajpur wetland to attract more visitors and birders. We want to construct some eco-huts, infrastructure for public convenience and also a phytoremediation pond to clean the drain that comes in,” Srivastava said.The officials said that the drain that passes through several villages falls into the wetland, thereby polluting it.“We want to treat the drain naturally. For this, a small pond will be dug where we will have treatment and advance oxidation plants. The drain water will fall in the Surajpur lake only by passing through the treatment pond,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-okhla-bird-sanctuary-gets-new-wooden-bridge-101634128539382.html

A case was registered against around 20 people.According to a police official, after the morning prayer at the school, students sing the national anthem and end it with the chant "Bharat Mata Ki Jai". However, there was an argument between two groups of students over raising the slogan in the school. Later, after leaving the school premises, some of them allegedly thrashed the boys on the other side.Students from various communities, including Hindu and Muslim, study in the school, Agar Malwa's Superintendent of Police Rakesh Sagar told PTI over phone. However, when a few Muslim children were not chanting "Bharat Mata Ki Jai", Class 12 student Bharat Singh Rajput (19) objected to it, the police said.Rajput later complained to police that he and a teacher were intercepted by the boys when they were returning home after school on Tuesday, and allegedly assaulted. He stated that the accused abused him and others, saying who were they to make them raise the slogan and hit them with sticks. When the teacher started recording the incident on his mobile phone, the accused hit him too and broke his phone, the complainant alleged.Meanwhile, SP Rakesh Sagar said, “It is more an issue of proper counselling and guidance than a legal offence as all those involved are students. The school teachers and principal should impart moral lessons to students."“A case under Indian Penal Code sections for assault and rioting, and provisions of the SC-ST Act has been registered following a complaint over the dispute," he said.Initially, the police booked nine people and eight to ten other unidentified persons, another official said. Some people were detained for questioning and further legal steps will be taken following an investigation into the case, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/student-teacher-allegedly-beaten-up-for-raising-bharat-mata-ki-jai-slogans-in-madhya-pradesh-101634123270962.html

Hindustan Times has not independently verified the authenticity of the leaked video clip. Correction | Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee serves show-cause notice to party leader VS Ugrappa. Party leader MA Saleem Ahmad* suspended for 6 yrs.In a video, the 2 leaders were reportedly heard saying to each other that party's DK Shivakumar & his people are taking moneyThe duo’s conversation, which came to light earlier in the day, seemed to be referring to Shivakumar’s tenure as the water resources minister in the previous HD Kumaraswamy cabinet.The two men were heard speaking about the differences in the style of speaking between Shivakumar’s and senior Congress leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah. According to reports, Saleem could be heard doing most of the talking, while Ugrappa responded with monosyllabic answers.Soon after the surfacing of the clipping, Ugappa addressed a press conference stating that a private conversation was being taken out of context and the party did not encourage corruption. “Why is a conversation taken out of context being taken seriously? Congress has never encouraged commission or corruption in awarding tenders,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, the BJP said the grand old party acted in a biased manner while punishing its workers on the basis of religion. “At the KPCC office, Ugrappa and Saleem expressed their opinion of the corrupt and failed leadership of their president. Saleem, a minority, has been suspended,” the party tweeted on Wednesday.The Congress, however, said Saleem was suspended because he spoke “baselessly”, while urging the BJP to take similar action against its legislators. “We have suspended Saleem who spoke baselessly. Yatnal, who has been accused of repeatedly accusing his government.Vishwanath on him @BJP4Karnataka. Do you dare to take action or are you willing to admit their accusations?” the party wrote in a tweet.The BJP also took a dig at the ongoing rumblings in the state unit of the Congress. Calling Shivakumar a ‘corrupt president’, the saffron party wrote, “Filming of multi-lingual multilingual political film has begun. Production, Direction - Siddaramaiah. Starring - Ugrappa, Saleem.

13-10-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: Peshwa’s Ramna Dakshina births a legacy of scholarship in Pune||Last week, on October 6, 2021, the Deccan College and Postgraduate research Institute concluded its celebrations of it bicentennial year with great fanfare. This third oldest college in India was established on October 6, 1821 as Hindoo College, part of an initiative undertaken by the Bombay Presidency Governor, Mt Stuart Elphistone. But, did you know that this establishment has a connection to a much older tradition of “Shravan Dakshina”, known from the Peshwa period?It is difficult to determine the exact date when the tradition of granting “Dakshina” during Shravan month to learned Brahmins folks began. Some scholars attribute it to Shivaji Maharaj, but safer attribution would be to Sambhaji Maharaj or the Rajaram Chhatrapati period. Shravan month is considered to be most auspicious amongst the four-month “chaturmas” period observed by Hindus during the monsoons. Shahu Chhatrapati-I would commission abhishekh rituals at Shiva temple at Kashi-Banaras and distributed gifts worth ₹2lakh to ₹4lakh every year. Back then, Shravan was also the period when soldiers and battalions retreated to home lands during the rainy season. The residential camp of various military commanders including the Peshwas, would be in Pune. It was a season of meeting families and relatives and also meant the celebration of various rituals and festivities. The month of Shravan, thus, proved to be the perfect time to carry out personal religious charity deeds. The learned and noble Brahmins, Shastri, Pandits and Veda scholars would earn their livelihoods by knowledge dissemination, teaching and priesthood. This was apparently not enough for their sustenance. Thus, Dakshina during Shravan month served as yearly scholarships for the knowledge fraternity. As per records, it was sardar Khanderao Dabhade who started the tradition of donating religious gifts to Brahmins during Shravan in Pune in 1718, inspired by the Bhosale kings. It continued till the death of Trimbakrao Dabhade in the battle of Dabhoi in 1730. After his death, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj requested the Peshwas to continue the tradition of Dakshina and accordingly, Bajirao I commenced it at Shaniwarwada from 1732 onwards. In the initial years, 3,000-odd Brahmins benefitted from the Dakshina. The ceremony of Dakshina donation used to take place either at Kabutarkhana near Omkareshwar temple or at Hujurpaga, the horse stables near the present day Laxmi road. Re1 to Rs12 was distributed on an average, amounting to a total of anything between Rs16,000 and Rs50,000.Behind Shaniwarwada in Shaniwar peth, a leisure garden was created for personal entertainment. The ceremony of Dakshina donation, in the initial years, conducted at the spot of the Ramna garden gave it the name “Raman” baug. Even today, the school constructed at the same spot in later years, is known as New English School, Ramanbaug. Ramna is an enclosed open space or a leisure garden for entertainment, a place for distributing religious gifts. As Nanasaheb Peshwa’s tenure started in 1940, the revenue generation and personal property of the Peshwas grew manifold which brought eminent prosperity. Various developmental works undertaken by diplomatic strategist Nanasaheb also bore fruit, thus, increasing the urban cosmopolitan population of the medieval city. The total donation amount during his reign increased from a mere Rs30,000 to Rs18 lakh. Every year, the crowds of Brahmins congregating in Pune would increase. This led to the formation of a systematic organisation which would filter and segregate the Brahmins according to their genuine needs and the merit scholarship. In order to accommodate growing numbers, Nanasaheb Peshwa chose an open space on the foothills of Parvati hill to build a fortified walled open space called the new “Ramna” in 1751-52. The dimensions of this huge pavilion were 200 feet by 200 feet and it had four gateways in four directions. It was equipped with a full-fledged kitchen, water tanks, storage spaces and ritual spaces for sacrificial yajna, sandhya, and pooja. It could accommodate 50,000 to 60,000 Brahmins on a particular occasion. The Ganesha at the base of Parvati came to be known as Ramna Ganpati.The Brahmins were placed in the walled pavilion and on their way out were personally granted religious gifts by Peshwas and other eminent officers. Due to the massive numbers, sometimes it would take two whole days for a Brahmin to get out of the Ramna walls. Meanwhile, every donation seeker would be provided with food provisions and an allowance to cook their own food. Rains during month of Shravan necessitated residential arrangements for visiting Brahmins. Thus, residential arrangements were made for 40,000 Brahmins by building dharamshala or sarai. Temporary arrangements in the form of tents were made for additional crowds. Kabutarkhana or the old Ramna near Ramanbaug was utilised to distribute Dakshina to the non-Brahmins, particularly, beggars and mendicants. In some years, the records show numbers reaching 80,000 people! As a popular bard (shahir) describes the Dakshina ceremony, there is no count of the number of Brahmins who received charitable gifts in Pune during Shravan. Brahmins from far flung places such as Bundelkhand, Malwa, Kashi, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat and Konkan would participate in the Dakshina ceremony. He also quips, how Brahmins from south Konkan demand more money and in spite of getting generous grants complain and bicker about amounts received from the Peshwas.The Hyderabad Nizam’s attack on Pune region in 1763 caused substantial damage to various establishments including the Ramna which was totally destroyed by troops. The Dakshina was then briefly discontinued, but later was reinstated in Madhavrao Peshwa’s period. The loss of revenue in the Panipat battle was swiftly recovered by pious Madhavrao and within few years, the Ramna ceremony was performed as per its former glory. Yet another Sanskrit verse describes only two places that are known to turn muddy due to excess discharge of water in the absence of the monsoon; one is at chief justice Ramshashtri Prabhune’s front yard, where people failing the examination for Dakshina eligibility would cry desolately; and the other when Madhavrao pours udak or water during the charity gifting at Ramna.The Ramna further continued during Sawai Madhavrao’s and Bajirao II’s period. It was required for every Brahmin to pass an examination to be eligible for the Dakshina. Bajirao II‘s period records show that learned women, too, received Dakshina. Dakshina for deserving old and helpless Brahmins was sent to their homes during the month of Shravan. A force of 1,500 soldiers was kept on guard to manage the Brahmin crowds. The descriptions of “satvik” feast distributed during his time include various sweetmeats, dry fruits, sukeli (dried bananas), fanaspoli (dried jackfruit), yogurt, buttermilk and poha. This pious act conducted for 100 years by subsequent Peshwas was instrumental in spreading tales of generosity and religious character of the Maratha state under the Peshwas. After the end of Maratha rule in 1818, the British government started the Poona Sanskrit School at Vishrambaug wada, as per the orders of Mr Chaplin. 1836 onwards, it was supervised by Major Candy who brought in modern education reforms and named it Hindoo College, currently known as Deccan College and postgraduate research institute. Today, the Ramna pavilion and Ramanbaug are erased from Pune’s map, but Deccan College continues to herald the Peshwa legacy of Shravan Dakshina - a medieval underpinning of the education capital that is Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-peshwa-s-ramna-dakshina-births-a-legacy-of-scholarship-in-pune-101634121700018.html

A report in PTI said a decision on reopening primary schools in the state would also be taken at the meeting.The CM’s announcement came in the wake of a gradual decline in coronavirus cases being reported across the state over the past few days. At present, Karnataka is reporting a little over 300 daily new cases on an average with 332 people testing positive for the disease on Tuesday.With this, the total number of confirmed infections rose to 29,81,732, according to a bulletin from the state department. Also, 11 more fatalities in the past 24 hours pushed the death toll to 37,906, the data showed.Meanwhile, the active caseload fell below the 10,000-mark and was recorded at 9,712 as of Tuesday. Bengaluru Urban with 6,595 active cases contributed the most to the state’s tally.Earlier in the month, Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar had also spoken about reopening schools for primary classes (classes 1 to 5). On September 6, physical schooling resumed for students of classes 6 to 8 in taluks where the Covid-19 positivity rate was less than 2 per cent.Sudhakar said the state government did not take any decision on reopening of educational institutes in a hurry. It was done in a phased manner after due consultations with parents and experts, he added.The state has also offered some relaxations to existing norms with a gradual improvement in the pandemic scenario and allowed cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes and pubs to be reopened However, night curfews between 10pm and 5am would continue to keep the virus under control.As of 7am on Wednesday, 59,913,592 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the state, according to the Union health ministry’s data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/decision-on-further-easing-of-norms-resuming-primary-classes-after-dasara-karnataka-cm-101634118023925.html

People in the Congress state unit claimed that a meeting with the senior Congress leaders and office bearers has been called on Wednesday evening. Both will reach Raipur from Delhi at around 8 pm. The development comes a day after Singh Deo was on a one-day visit to Delhi and reportedly met a senior Congress leader on Tuesday. Singh Deo returned to Raipur on Tuesday evening. “It was just a courtesy call nothing more than that... no political development,” Singh Deo told HT. On August 28, emerging after a long meeting with the Congress high command on suggestions that he should move aside because of a reported two and a half year power-sharing agreement with colleague TS Singh Deo, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel seemed to have bought some time. He said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would visit the state the next week, especially Bastar, to review the work that was being done. The next day, when Singh Deo returned, he said that he had spoken to the leadership too and they had kept a “decision safe”. Congress leadership in Delhi believes that the visit of Punia and Yadav on Wednesday should not be seen as a ‘political development’. “I believe that the decision over power-sharing is reserved with the high command but there is confusion and desperation among the Congress leaders, bureaucrats and media in Chhattisgarh. Punia and Yadav are going for the first time after the turmoil started about two months ago. The aim is to ease out the confusion prevailing in Chhattisgarh,” said a senior Congress leader based in Delhi. Meanwhile, functionaries close to Baghel asserted that the visit is routine which will be followed by meetings. “The visit of Punia and Yadav is routine... Actually, their visit was due for a couple of months. There are some meetings lined up with office-bearers and leaders,” said a leader close to the CM. In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem too. Four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the chief minister’s post. As Mahant settled for the speaker’s post, friction between Baghel and Singh Deo meant that Sahu first emerged as the frontrunner, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-congress-in-charge-pl-punia-co-incharge-chandan-yadav-in-raipur-today-101634114739783.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Shimla much more than the Ridge and the Mall||Shimla is one of the best-known hill stations that tourists throng to. Once the summer capital of British India, Shimla is now the state capital of Himachal Pradesh. Tourists normally mill around popular hotspots, namely The Ridge and The Mall, considered the epicentre of tourist activities in town. I was fortunate to be posted in Shimla as a banker. The two-year stay offered me opportunities to explore Shimla in ways that tourists who come for a couple of days don’t get. Aided by official heft, I discovered the academic side of Shimla. There are four such landmarks that embellish the Queen of the Hills uniquely. The first institution is the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies (IIAS). Set up as a research institute by the then ministry of education, Government of India, in 1964, IIAS started functioning from October 20, 1965. By virtue of the goodwill earned through the installation of an ATM at the gate of the IIAS during my tenure in the bank’s Shimla branch, I gained the opportunity of not only meeting its top brass but also the privilege of being shown around even those quarters that are not open to the public. The building that houses IIAS was completed in 1888 as the Viceregal Lodge. After Independence, it was renamed Rashtrapati Niwas. The second place of eminence is the National Academy of Audit and Accounts (NAAA). It is the apex training institute of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. Trainee officers of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IAAS), an allied service of the IAS, are imparted training at NAAA during their probation period. I will always cherish the privilege of taking a session on the topic of banking for IAAS probationers in the plush precincts of the academy. Next comes the Labour Bureau. It is a central government office under the ministry of labour and employment. It compiles the consumer price index for industrial workers (CPI-IW), used for calculating the dearness allowance (DA). It is housed in The Cleremont Building, a British Raj heritage building. Prior to my visit to the Labour Bureau where this interesting fact was revealed, I hadn’t known that the CPI-IW was compiled in Shimla. Officials at the bureau fully satiated my curiosity about the methodology of compiling the consumer price index. Last but not the least is the Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI), run under the aegis of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research. CPRI was established to carry out research, education and extension on the potato. An interesting trivia about potato is that though potato is a household name today in India it came to this ancient land from Europe in the beginning of the 17th century. It remained an insignificant crop till independence. As our bank had an extension counter there, I was duty-bound to visit the CPRI periodically. Undoubtedly, Shimla is much more than the Ridge and the Mall. It is dotted with heritage buildings that house institutions of academic significance. chander59@icloud.com The writer is a Panchkula-based retired banker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-much-more-than-the-ridge-and-the-mall-101634113958653.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||DU student turns British High Commissioner for a day!||It’s not everyday you that you get to be numero uno at British High Commission in the Capital. But for 20-year-old Aditi Maheshwari, a student of Bachelors in Physical Science from Miranda House, University of Delhi, it was a dream come true.From attending meetings with senior-level diplomats to learning about professional responsibilities, she caught a glimpse of diplomat life as the British High Commissioner for the day. Maheshwari who hails from Chittorgarh, Rajasthan won this year’s High Commissioner for a Day contest, which is held annually by the High Commission, in celebration of International Day of the Girl Child (October 11) for young girls aged 18-23 to head the diplomatic mission for a day.What helped Maheshwari’s selection from over 100 entries was her befitting answer to ‘How can young people best support tackling the global challenge of climate change?’ She says, “I think every problem has an opportunity and the problem can be solved by us. So we are the solution.” She also reveals that it was her father who motivated her to participate in the competition.Maheshwari, who aspires to become an Indian Administrative Officer started her day as the commissioner at 8am with meetings followed by interactions with next gen women leaders from Delhi University and then a meeting with beneficiaries and staff, to understand the relations between India and the UK. She says, “I learnt a lot during the day about international relations and diplomacy. I got to know about the qualities that a leader needs to have.”In between the packed day, she also taught new words in Hindi to Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India, who often posts videos of himself speaking in the language. He says, “That was a good ice breaker. She taught me words like umar (age), vidyarthi (student) and uttari (north).” Talking about switching the roles for a day, he says,“She has been fantastic. She is very thoughtful, and showed great confidence. She’s also good at addressing groups. The world belongs to her and her generation. And it’s a great privilege for me to see it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-student-turns-british-high-commissioner-for-a-day-101634113179306.html
13-10-2021||Pune||Police arrest third suspect in killing of 14-year-old girl in Pune||Hours after a 14-year-old girl was hacked to death in Pune on Tuesday, the police arrested three persons, including the main suspect and two juveniles, officials said. While the police detained two minors late on Tuesday, the main suspect, 22-year-old Hrishikesh alias Shubham Bhagwat, was apprehended from Bibwewadi area where he was trying to hide, an official said on Wednesday. Bhagwat, who was stalking the victim, and two of his accomplices allegedly hacked an 8th standard student with a sickle at a playground in Pune during Kabaddi practice on Tuesday. So brutal was the attack that the victim’s head was nearly decapitated. “We have arrested the third suspect as well while the two juveniles in conflict with law were detained last night,” said Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police (Zone V). According to another official, they are also investigating the involvement of a fourth suspect in the case though he refused to divulge any more information. Taking cognizance of the brutal killing, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar asked the police to make a tight case against the suspects to ensure the harshest punishment for a crime which he described as an “indication of the overall deterioration of social values.” “The incident is extremely serious. I have asked the police to take all possible efforts and ensure that suspects are awarded the harshest punishment,” said Pawar. Police officers said Bhagwat, who was a relative of the victim and was allegedly stalking her for months, reached the playground along with two other friends in the evening. He then called the girl who was about to begin her Kabaddi practice with friends and took her aside. An argument ensued and Bhagwat pulled out a sickle from his bag and hacked her to death. “The girl was at a playground where local groups hold Kabaddi practice and fitness classes for children. Three people, including a 22-year-old man, came on a bike and attacked the girl with a sharp weapon. The attack was so brutal that the girl died on the spot,” Patil said after the incident. The other two, according to police, were also carrying sharp weapons and assaulted the girl. Police said the attack unfolded in front of the victim’s friends and others who came for an evening stroll, all were shocked and left the place immediately. Police detained the two alleged accomplices, both minors, but the main accused was on the run. Police also recovered from the spot a toy pistol, which was allegedly used to scare off the victim’s friends. Police said Shubham was staying at the victim’s house with her family in the Bibwewadi area when he began stalking her. “Shubham was stalking her for some time. After the victim’s parents learnt about it, they warned him to leave after which he went to stay at another area at Chinchwad,” said Sunil Zaware, senior police inspector, Bibwewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-arrest-third-suspect-in-killing-of-14-year-old-girl-in-pune-101634103638053.html

Check details||The National Capital Region is likely to shrink to 100-km radius, according to a draft plan approved by the NCR Planning Board on Tuesday. The focus of 'Draft Regional Plan 2041' is the development of NCR's urban areas, according to news agency PTI, which quoted officials.The National Capital Region currently spans around 150-175 kilometres, covering entire districts and their rural areas. But with the approval of Regional Plan 2041, areas beyond 100 km are not likely to be main part of the NCR, said the officials.The draft plan talks about establishing linear corridors beyond the 100 km radius, paving the way for development in areas falling within one kilometre from expressways, national highways and regional rapid transit system.The decision to include or omit Tehsils lying partly within this 100 km delineation will be left to the respective state governments, according to the details of the regional plan carried by PTI.A detailed draft plan will soon be made public for suggestions and objections and thereafter, it will be notified by the NCR Planning Board.The Regional Plan 2021, which is available on NCRPB's website, had identified seven metro centres - Faridabad-Ballabgarh, Gurgaon-Manesar, Ghaziabad-Loni, Noida, Sonepat-Kundli, Greater Noida and Meerut.It had also identified 11 regional centres - Bahadurgah, Panipat, Rohtak, Palwal, Rewari-Dharuhera-Bawal, Hapur-Pilkhua, Bulandshahr-Khurja, Baghpat-Baraut, Alwar, Greater Bhiwadi and Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror.The plan for the year 2041 also envisions an NCR with air ambulance facility and high-speed connectivity through helitaxis, road, rail and inland waterways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ncr-may-shrink-draft-regional-plan-2041-approved-check-details-101634099891333.html

The Adani Group-owned Mumbai airport operator had said in a statement on October 8 that it was supposed to start operations from T1 from October 20 but due to heavy passenger rush amid the festive season, was forced to prepone resumption of flight services from the domestic terminal.On morning of October 8, many people took to social media to mention about the chaos and also shared pictures and videos of the scenes at the airport, while airlines advised passengers to report early to allow sufficient times for security check. A CSMIA spokesperson blamed the rush on the upcoming festive season and announced several measures "to ensure a smooth experience while keeping security protocol intact".The airport operator said these measures include resuming T1 operations from Wednesday with flights operated by GoFirst, followed by AirAsia India on October 16.The Mumbai airport had on October 4 announced the reopening of its domestic passenger terminal T1 from the midnight of October 20, saying GoFirst, AirAsia India, Star Air and TruJet will resume all their domestic operations from there. However, IndiGo's select flights will resume from October 31 with most of its flights operating from T2 and base flights will operate out of Terminal 1, it had stated.The Mumbai airport authorities had suspended flight services from T1 in mid-April after the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic hit the nation and moved all operations to T2, which is largely used for international connectivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-s-terminal-1-to-open-from-today-101634083520718.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM: Pollution rising, need your help to bring it down||People should turn off their vehicles when waiting at a traffic signal, use public transport or carpool once a week, and flag violations of environmental rules, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to citizens on Tuesday, after hitting out at neighbouring states for failing to stop farm fires which, he said, will impact the Capital’s air soon.Kejriwal’s appeal comes days after the city launched a 10-point action plan to mitigate a spike in air pollution levels.“Air pollution has been slowly increasing for the last three-four days. One of the main reasons is that stubble burning has started in neighbouring states where governments have failed in helping farmers in this regard. We can get a clear picture of that through Nasa images… Last week, we presented a 10-point action plan. Today, I seek your help in reducing air pollution in personal capacity,” said Kejriwal in a video briefing on Tuesday.He said the government, like last year, will launch an awareness campaign on the benefits of switching off engines at traffic lights. “Even though we will launch a formal campaign this year again from October 18, I request you to start it in personal capacity from today. Studies have shown that by doing this we can collectively save around ₹250 crore a year and reduce pollution by up to 15%.”Last year, it launched the “Red light on, gaadi off (vehicle off)” campaign to help reduce vehicular emissions and fuel consumption. While environmentalists and activists appreciated the campaign, many pointed out the limited period for which it lasted. Experts said a campaign aimed to bring about a behavioural change needs to be sustained to show visible results.“Secondly, I request you to use public transport or carpool at least once a week, instead of using a personal vehicle. Doing it more than once a week would be even better. Third, I request you to download the Green Delhi app... for actively registering complaints regarding pollution... We have resolved more than 23,000 complaints through the app so far,” said Kejriwal.On October 4, Kejriwal released a winter action plan. It includes free distribution of a bio-decomposer to help dissolve paddy stubble – the farm residue is a major source of pollution. Farmers set this alight as a quick and cheap way to prepare their fields for the next crop that need to be sowed before the onset of winter.The plan also includes dust suppression drives, a ban on burning of garbage, installation of smog towers, a tight vigil on the ban on firecrackers, constant monitoring of pollution hot spots, and investing on efforts to reduce vehicular pollution in the capitalKejriwal, over the last month, has been tweeting the city’s daily AQI recordings to show what he says is pollution under regular circumstances. On Tuesday, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was at 179, which is regarded as moderately polluted.At least 11 of the 35 air monitoring stations in the city recorded air quality that was in the poor category (with a value of over 200), up from 7 a day before. On Monday, Delhi’s average AQI was 166.To be sure, farm fires are not the only reason for the drop in air quality. Meteorological conditions are a strong factor, and they trap the local dust and emissions from vehicles and factories in the air close to the ground. There are also significant local sources of pollution, such as road dust and construction debris, that the authorities have struggled to control over the years. The situation is made worse by the use of firecrackers -- banned in Delhi since 2017 by the Supreme Court, except for relatively less polluting “green crackers” -- during Diwali, which lead to a sudden spurt by adding emissions that are more toxic than usual.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav in an interview last week said that all stakeholders are working together to control farm fires this time and special directions have been issued by the newly formed Committee on Air Quality Management (CAQM) to states to provide all assistance to farmers so that they refrain from setting their fields on fire.Farmer unions this year warned that there could be significant instances of farm fires, since the monsoon withdrew late, reducing the time cultivators had to harvest the crop. “Harvesting has started but will pick up properly around October 10.

13-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A cold-weather friend||A man is lying on a bench, wide awake. Some steps away, a chhole-bhature eatery staffer is hurriedly finishing his homemade dal-roti. While a cotton candy hawker, armed with plastic-wrapped pink candies, is playing ludo on the mobile. Then there’s a goat, and a lazy dog too. Overlooking it all is the area’s Jama Masjid.After plunging into semi-hibernation during the summer and monsoon months, Gurugram’s Masjid Udayan has awakened to the October nip. It’s not yet cold, and the winter’s dreaded haze is weeks away. Be warned, though: the park is just a muddy brown ground with some grass and some cactuses. If you are patient, only then does it reveal its elusive beauty. Most citizens ignore this place, tucked at one end of the town’s Sadar Bazaar; but those who are drawn to it fall into a committed relationship. That’s why the unusual city oasis is peopled with always the same faces. For instance, at a certain hour in any given afternoon, you’ll find the same three “putai wale” house painters sitting with legs crossed, their work-clothes splattered with colours. The same rat poison hawkers sit under the park’s peepal for lunch.Occasionally unfamiliar folks are spotted. They tend to come up with some sad story or the other. One afternoon in the ongoing pandemic era, a young man in ironed pants and shirt was lying flat under this tree. With his black laptop bag doubling up as pillow, he confessed he hadn’t told his “bhaiya-bhabhi” that he was recently relieved of his “office job.” Another afternoon (this was last year’s winter), two panic-stricken labourers were furiously calling up contacts on their mobile to help them with emergency cash for train tickets to home in Bihar.In the late morning hours, a corner of the park smells of fragrant pulao—a street-food seller daily cooks the dish in an adjacent yard.When here, also look out for a man in safari suit. Biscuit trader Naseer Ahmad Khan’s “biskut ke thele” are permanently parked by the park. A cheerily optimistic man, he is full of stories about the locality and its people. He speaks in flowery Urdu, like a Ghalibian poet of yesteryear. If you say hello to him, he might treat you to chai and his biscuits, which he “imports” from the pilgrimage town of Ujjain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-cold-weather-friend-101634079154118.html

However, police have found evidence of their involvement in two snatching cases so far.Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav said Malik and Alam used to target people in the morning, and snatched cell phones of people, many of whom may not have reported the crime. DCP Yadav said that on Sunday, when the two men were arrested from Sector 4, Bawana, they had already snatched eight cell phones within three hours. Police have seized the phones, and are contacting the victims.The officer said that the two suspects started working together one and a half months ago. He said there was another person who joined them, identified as one Raja, and they formed a gang.“They got in touch with one Raja, who became the gang leader eventually. They paid Raja ₹5000 at least 20 days a month, to rent high-end bikes. Raja also helped them with money, whenever required, weapons and places to hide,” a senior official said.Initial investigation has shown that Raja too was involved in at least 25 snatching casesacross the city. Police said Raja’s brother, named Manish Poddar is also the gang leader of a different gang.

Thereafter, the contact was again lost with the terrorists but a massive search operation has been launched to eliminate them,” said a defence official. Five soldiers, including a JCO, lost their lives when a group of heavily armed terrorists opened fire on an army search party in Chamrer forest close to Dera Ki Gali (DKG) in Surankote early on Monday. After the initial encounter, terrorists fled to nearby Pangai forest which falls in the jurisdiction of Rajouri’s Thanamandi. The gunfight between the two sides stopped on Monday evening after the terrorists took advantage of the dense forest and fled, the officials said, adding that the entire forest belt was cordoned off and a search operation was underway to neutralise the hiding terrorists. The officials said senior police and army officers also rushed to the area to supervise the operation. Earlier, a defence spokesman said on the intervening night of October 10 and 11, a counterterrorist operation was launched by the Indian Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police in the area of Shahdara, near the boundary of Poonch-Rajouri districts. The districts of Rajouri and Poonch, south of Pir Panjal, have witnessed a rise in infiltration attempts since June this year, resulting in the killing of nine terrorists in separate encounters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-search-op-on-in-rajouri-poonch-to-flush-out-ultras-101634077761876.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: Jai Ram flays Pratibha over Kargil War remarks||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday slammed Congress nominee Pratibha Singh over her remarks on Kargil War. Pratibha during an election rally had described the Kargil conflict as a “small war”. She was trolled for her remarks as a video of her statement was put out on social networking platforms. “There is a strange situation in the Congress right now. Its leaders do not listen to each other inside the assembly. Everyone is in a race to become a leader,” Jai Ram said while making a veiled attack on leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri. “Whatever Congress leaders said about me is not an insult to me, but to the entire state,” the CM said during an election meeting in Churag. “I am not a king. I am from a poor family, but it doesn’t mean that you keep on insulting a common man,” Jai Ram said, calling the Congress a “directionless party without a leader”. He said the records of Congress leaders were known to everyone. “Everybody knows Brigadier Khushal Thakur. He fought valiantly. It’s saddening that Pratibha described the battle with Pakistan as a minor one,” the Himachal CM said, while lambasting Vikramaditya. “He made it to the Vidhan Sabha for the first time and he is talking about avenging the Congress’ defeat . It’s unfortunate that Virbhadra Singh is not among us today and if anyone is seeking votes, they should do that on the basis of work rather than anyone’s name,” he added. Pratibha targets CM over unemployment in Himachal Meanwhile, Pratibha Singh flayed Jai Ram Thakur-led state government over growing unemployment. “It’s disheartening that people from outside the state are getting jobs in Himachal, but not the Himachalis,” she said. She addressed a series of rallies in different assembly segments of Mandi on Tuesday. “Virbhadra Singh always gave prominence to the people of the state while his government made job appointments. It’s for the first time that I am in fray without him (Virbhadra). Virbhadra ji is remembered for his works, it’s the reason that he got love and affection from people of the state,” she added. She blamed the “defective policies” of the central government for rising unemployment and inflation. HP Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, while addressing the media in Shimla, also claimed that the government has failed on all fronts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-jai-ram-flays-pratibha-over-kargil-war-remarks-101634077221615.html

The DEO held a meeting with over 400 government school heads to discuss the strategies for the preparation of NAS in the schools. The BNOs have been asked to discuss the results of students in September bi-monthly exams and sensitise them towards the survey exams in order to achieve the top spot in the country. The stress on cent percent participation of students was laid during the meeting. The schools have been asked to give special attention to the attendance of students.

A few strategies include special subject-wise PPT, especially for Classes VIII and X, on the least scored five questions during the bi-monthly tests held last month. Moreover, schools have been asked to conduct weekly tests of students from videos and PPTs shared by the education department with schools for the NAS preparations. School heads and principals have been told to hold meetings with subject teachers whose results were not satisfactory during the bi-monthly tests. Most of the students secured marks between 40% to 80% in bi-monthly tests but in order to bag the first spot in the country, all students will have to get over 80% marks in the NAS exam. Sharing the strategies, DEO, secondary, Lakhbir Singh said, “Questions related to weekly learning outcomes will be included in each weekly assignment and in word wall activity.

Meanwhile, Davinder Singh Chhina, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Shahapur, said the preparations for the NAS were in the full swing and in the final phase. “We are stressing more on the revision.

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana man protests outside LIT office over delay in registration of plot||Forced to make rounds of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) office for the last six years to get a registry of his house done, a resident of BRS Nagar block-J, Jatinder Pal Singh staged a protest outside the trust office in Feroze Gandhi market on Tuesday.Holding a placard in his hand accusing LIT officials of corruption, he claimed that even after transferring the ownership of the plot on his name, LIT was not getting the registry done citing vigilance inquiry and a pending case in the high court. He claimed that even the facts of the case were clear and the ownership had already been transferred to his name.Accusing the LIT officials of asking for a bribe of ₹2 lakh for getting the registry done, Jatinder Pal stated that he had applied with LIT in 2015. At that time, LIT officials wrongly showed a default in the payment for the plot and asked for a bribe of ₹50,000 for resolving the issue, he alleged.“I denied and started pursuing the case at the state level. A complaint was also filed with the CM office, following which a vigilance inquiry was marked in the case, which is still pending. A petition was also filed in the high court and the court directed the LIT to take the final decision on whether the department wants to get the registry done or not based on the facts of the case. In 2018, the department admitted that there is no default on payment and transferred the ownership of the property on my name. But for the last two years, the department is not allowing the registry of the property done on my name,” said Jatinder Pal.“I have been forced to make rounds of the office and the department officials demand ₹2 lakh bribe for clearing the case. Even LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam has failed to provide any relief,” he said.Meanwhile, Balasubramaniam said a vigilance inquiry was marked against few cases in the past, including the case of Jatinder Pal, and a case regarding the matter is also sub judice in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “To support Jatinder Pal, a resolution approved by LIT was also sent to the government for approval, but the government has not taken any final decision on the same. There is no delay on the part of LIT and the allegations being levelled by Jatinder Pal are baseless,” said the chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-man-protests-outside-lit-office-over-delay-in-registration-of-plot-101634071946441.html

Gas detectors are also being purchased for the safety of sewer men.MC executive engineer Ranbir Singh said around 100 safety kits were already available with the department and over 1,600 are being purchased. “All of these will not be provided to the staff at once and only a few will be provided at each sub-zone as per the needs, while the other will be kept in the stores for future use.Earlier in September, chairman of the Punjab State Safai Karamchari Commission Geja Ram Valmiki had moved the high court seeking action against MC officials concerned over the alleged incident of manual scavenging in the Jugiana area.The chairman claimed that he had caught MC sewer men involved in manual scavenging in Jugiana on July 16. The MC officials, however, alleged that manual scavenging was banned, and the chairman forced the sewer men to enter the manhole for implicating MC staffers. The video of the incident was also available, claimed the MC officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manual-scavenging-quality-council-of-india-to-hold-inspection-in-ludhiana-101634071945321.html

After the family sought intervention of commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, a probe was marked to additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 4) Rupinder Kaur Sra on Tuesday. The victim, Sajjan Singh of Guru Nanak Colony, was a pickup truck driver. His wife, Gurmeet Kaur, said that Sajjan had left the house with his friend Raju on May 14, saying he will be back in jiffy, but never returned. His body was found at a field in Darshan Singh Wala village the next day, which was May 15. Dalbir Singh, a relative, said the police did not take Raju’s statement and were pressuring them to drop the matter. “Raju has said the two of them were attacked by a former sarpanch and his aides, who suspected that they were thieves. He had managed to escape, but they had lynched Sajjan to death and set his body on fire. The police said that he had been electrocuted to death while stealing oil from transformers.However, the body was found at some distance from the transformer,” Dalbir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/probe-ordered-into-ludhiana-man-s-death-after-family-alleges-lynching-101634071944129.html

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||After councillor’s appeal, Ludhiana MC acts against illegal hoardings||A day after Congress councillor Mamta Ashu, wife of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, appealed to the residents to stop using pictures of ministers on illegal hoardings and urged the civic body to take action against such hoardings across the city, the municipal corporation (MC) initiated a drive to remove illegal posters/hoarding from city roads on Tuesday.However, a large number of hoardings can still be seen installed in different parts of the city, including Ferozepur road, SBS Nagar, Model Town Extension, Barewal road, Chandigarh road, old GT road among other areas. Most of these are political or religious hoardings and at many points the directions boards have also been covered with illegal hoardings, giving a tough time to commuters.On Monday, the Congress councillor took to social media urging supporters and social, religious, industrial and political organisations in Ludhiana west constituency to stop defacing the city by installing illegal hoardings.In her post on social media, she said, “In a progressive society like ours, our endeavour should be to make our city smarter and aesthetically more beautiful. Dotting the city with illegal hoardings is definitely not acceptable to anyone.”Further, she urged mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal to take action against such hoardings.The mayor said action was always taken against illegal hoardings in the city. Directions had again been issued to the MC staff and an extensive drive had been initiated in the city to remove illegal hoardings. “The staff has been directed to remove illegal hoardings even if there is a picture of a minister or mine too. Supporters add pictures of leaders in the hoardings without their consent,” said Sandhu.MC fails to impose penaltiesEven after the municipal corporation (MC) house had approved a resolution to impose a penalty of up to ₹50,000 on printers for installing hoardings last year, the MC has failed to tighten the noose around printers and residents who install hoardings.In the resolution approved by the MC general house in November last year, the MC had also decided to impose a penalty of ₹5,000 per day on superintendents who fail to remove illegal hoardings. The house also deliberated on lodging an FIR against violators.One of the MC officials requesting anonymity said there was a large-scale interference in the working of the MC due to which the civic body failed to take action against illegal hoardings. With assembly elections scheduled for next year and festival season around the corner, supporters have installed a large number of hoardings in the city and politicians also support them.Residents have also been complaining against defacement, but MC officials were helpless, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-councillor-s-appeal-ludhiana-mc-acts-against-illegal-hoardings-101634071940929.html

Delay in re-tendering process will cause huge financial losses to the civic body. Willful delay in the re-tendering process may amount to giving undue favour to any person or firm by causing loss to the MC,” he said.Devshali added, “Apart from this, the accountability of the responsible officers should be fixed and appropriate action should be taken in the interest of the corporation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-fails-to-re-tender-sanitation-work-in-southern-sectors-101634071640935.html

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||High moisture content in paddy worries Punjab farmers, commission agents||High moisture content in paddy produce arriving at procurement centres across Punjab has become a matter of concern for farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents) this kharif marketing season. The moisture content in the grain is being recorded from 18-20% against the permissible limit of 17%, officials said. In Amloh sub-division of Fatehgarh Sahib district, the state food and civil supplies department barred 13 commission agents from the procurement process after they allowed purchase of paddy with a moisture content over permissible limit. The agriculture department said harvesting of an unripe crop was the main reason behind high moisture in the grain.But the farmers blamed inclement weather conditions and late sowing of paddy for the problem. Punjab Arhtiya Association general secretary Harjeet Singh said the procurement agencies were harassing both farmers and commission agents on the pretext of high moisture content.“The farmers who brought paddy with high moisture are not being allowed to dry their produce in the grain markets. Moreover, the department and procurement agencies resort to stringent action if commission agents are found unloading such produce in the market,” said Singh.This is for the first time that moisture level has become such a big trouble for every stakeholder, he claimed. Manjit Singh of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) said it is really difficult for farmers to bring down moisture level in the grain due to suddenly drop in temperatures in morning and evening hours. “The bulk of produce is yet to reach the grain markets as the harvesting has started picking pace. In the coming days, the problem of moisture level will multiply. The central government and procurement agencies should increase the permissible limit of moisture content,” he said. In such a situation, farmers have no choice but to resort to distress selling and they end up getting rates far below the minimum support price (MSP), he said. Patiala chief agriculture officer Jaswinder Pal Singh Grewal said, “We are asking farmers not to harvest the crop till it matures adequately.” New specifications irk farmers, millersAlso, the new quality specifications issued by the central government for procurement of paddy have irked rice millers and farmers in Punjab.According to the new specifications, stricter quality control measures have been put in place for the millers as broken grain percentage has been reduced to 20% from the earlier 25%. Moreover, the moisture content in rice to be accepted from millers has also been reduced from 15% to 14%. The damaged grain percentage has been brought down from 3% to 2%, while red grains, which earlier had 3% limit, will not be accepted.In case of paddy unloaded at grain markets, the permissible limit of foreign matter (organic and inorganic) has been lowered from 2% to 1%. The percentage of discoloured, sprouted and damaged grain has been reduced from 5% to 3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-moisture-content-in-paddy-worries-punjab-farmers-commission-agents-101634070624721.html

One such 20-member team from Agra, headed by 46-year-old Saira Banu, has been entrusted with preparing a 100-ft tall Ravana effigy to be burnt at the Daresi Dussehra ground on Friday. Of her 20-member team, 16 are Muslim workmen, and the rest are Hindus. Promote communal harmonySaira says she prepares the effigies to promote communal harmony and for the love of the art. Each year she gets orders for hundreds of effigies ahead of Dussehra, which she prepares with the help of workmen and her family, all of whom take leave of absence from their regular jobs to give her a hand. “Most people, barring a few, appreciate us for promoting communal harmony. My family has been in the business for over three decades, and we have been preparing effigies for the Daresi Dussehra ground for 22 years,”says the mother of four.Her eldest son, Imran Farooqui, a post graduate, is working with a private company in Noida as a software engineer, while her younger son, Sohail Khan is pursuing engineering at a college in Agra. Her elder daughter Asma is a government school teacher and lives in Lucknow, while her youngest daughter, Noreen Farooqui, is pursuing MBBS at Kota.A family affair Her husband, Azgar Ali, a diploma holder in civil engineering, left his government job to pursue his love for the art, which his forefathers had also excelled at. Her children, despite earning handsome salaries, have learnt the art of their fathers, which has been passed down from generation to generation. “We cannot part ourselves from this job, despite our stable financial condition, as it transcends communal differences and divisive political vendetta.” Azgar Ali, who is preparing effigies with another team at Chandigarh and Panchkula says.”We have never asked our kids to help us, but they do it voluntarily.” “I was a kid when I saw my father and the grandfather preparing effigies. Now, it is my passion and love. The last two years were disappointing as we only made one effigy for the Daresi ground due to the pandemic,” said Ali. Hindu rituals followedHer brother, Akeel, says Hindu traditions as well as Muslim traditions are followed before starting the work. “Along with Muslim prayers, we also follow Hindu rituals before making the effigies and even 10 minutes before the effigies are burned. The people love us, which is the most sacred thing for the team,” said Akeel.Other than Ravana, the team has prepared 50-feet effigies of Khardushan, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath for the Daresi Ground this year. These artists also lend their services for other Ramlilas in the district, including those at Shiv Purin and Bharat Nagar Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dussehra-festivities-ravana-effigy-brings-hindu-muslim-artisans-together-in-ludhiana-101634070500539.html

Reviewing the functioning of the bus tracking system monitoring and control room in Chandigarh, Warring said that as the performance of private buses was not satisfactory in terms of safety, the installation of VTS would be ensured in them as well. The system had been implemented in 1,450 buses of Punbus and Punjab Roadways till now, he said. “VTS is for checking speeding of buses, harsh braking and acceleration, overnight stay of buses, stoppage at any other place rather than designated stops, stay of buses at dhabas for more than 25 minutes, route diversion, bypassing cities, missing stops, real-time monitoring of arrival and departure from counters and actual travel distance covered,” he added. The management information system was also generating reports on behaviour of drivers and conductors, usage of buses, utilisation of available staff, delays and advancement in the time of buses, kilometers covered by buses, etc, the minister said. “On the basis of reports generated by the system and feedback of department officials, three best performing general managers of depots and 10 drivers and conductors each will be honoured every fortnight,” he said, warning non-performers of action.

Handing over the appointment letter to Harpreet Kaur at the civic body’s Zone D office, mayor Balkar Sandhu said the firefighter, Manpreet Singh, had been hired on a contractual basis and the local bodies’ department had to go through a complicated process to provide his sister with a regular job. On November 2017, a plastic factory had collapsed near Suffiyan Chowk after a fire broke out on the premises. Sixteen people, including nine firefighters, perished in the tragedy. In the aftermath of the building collapse, the state government had announced compensation and a government job to the victims’ kin. However, Manpreet, and Vishal, another firefighter, were contractual workers, so special permission was required for providing their kin with a regular job.Manpreet’s father, Malkit Singh said, “We had to go to the municipal corporation offices several times, but at least they provided my daughter with a job, which is appreciable.” The mayor said, “The process was delayed as the MC had to take special permissions. Manpreet’s sister has been appointed as a clerk and will be deputed to the Zone B office, which is closer to her house in the Mundiyan area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/plastic-factory-tragedy-four-years-on-ludhiana-mc-finally-hires-deceased-firefighter-s-sister-101634069840283.html

Taking inspiration from a movie, they hatched a conspiracy to execute an inconspicuous robbery at the pharmacist’s house, under the garb of income tax sleuths,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 1) Pragya Jain. Huge rush of customers caught their eyeThe ADCP said around a week ago, the trio visited the Old City Market for shopping. “At Trunka Wala Bazaar, they noticed a heavy rush of customers at a pharmacy store and assumed its owner, Damanpreet Singh, must have deep pockets. Thus started their search for Damanpreet’s house and a scheme to rob him,” she added.After conducting a recce of the pharmacist’s house to understand his movement, they struck on Monday when he and his father were away, and his mother, wife and two children were home.“The accused presented a fake income tax notice before the family and started to search the house.

The high court said that a committee shall examine the procedure adopted in the case in hand for extending time-limit and shall report as to whether the same was in accordance with rules and settled procedure. The committee will also examine as to why there was no “export permit” in favour of the accused when he was granted permit for removal. The department has been given a time of four weeks and the report is to be submitted to chief conservator of forests, who will further take action as warranted, the high court said. The directions were issued on the bail pleas of two accused, Bhupal Sharma and Kapil Sharma, who were booked on the complaint of the forest department, registered at the police station in Majri block, Mohali, for illegal removal of trees in Mirzapur village. The forest department had claimed that the high court had stayed the cutting and lifting of khair wood in 16,400 bighas 18 biswas in Mirzapur, but they had removed 375 logs loaded in seven trolleys and one pick-up truck on April 4 night without seeking approval from the forest department. On the other hand, the accused had pleaded that forest department officials were demanding illegal gratification and that they had valid permits. The court found that the initial permit was issued on January 18, valid up to January 26, for removal of 933 trees and an export permit was also issued. Another permit was issued on January 30 to cut 964 trees and to stack the same at the depot by March 15, the period later extended upto March 31. However, no export permit was ever issued in this case, as per the department. The court found that even as the initial permit was only for removal of trees upto March 15, the department processed his application for “export permit” and allowed time limit of the same up to March 31. The court further observed that it appeared that his application had been processed in a “cavalier manner”. While an extension of time-limit of the so-called “export permit” was accorded, nobody seemed to have verified as to whether any such permit had ever been issued, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-removal-of-trees-by-contractor-in-majri-block-look-into-anomalies-in-export-permit-directs-hc-101634069360162.html

They haven’t been able to convince as how these laws are black and why they are anti-farmer,” said Chahar addressing a press conference after chairing a meeting of Punjab BJP’s kisan morcha cell in Chandigarh. Chahar said the deadlock between the Centre and the farmer unions can be broken only if the latter are ready to discuss as how these laws can be improved by making certain changes. “But if somebody thinks that Modi government will buckle under pressure to withdraw the laws, they are mistaken. We are sure that finally whatever misconceptions have been created in the minds of farmers would end,” he said. The Lok Sabha MP said the farmer unions have been misguided by the Congress and the communist think-tanks and the shoulder of the peasants are being used to fire at the Modi government. “Those who are left with no political ground in the country have misguided the farmers that if these laws are implemented their land will snatched away. Moreover, these laws have already been stayed by the Supreme Court and the Centre has also agreed not to implement them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/talks-only-if-farm-unions-come-up-with-constructive-suggestions-bjp-kisan-morcha-chief-101634069301659.html

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Coal crisis: Private plant forces Punjab power utility to pay 60% more than PPA price||The Tata Mundra-run private thermal power project, which since last year stopped supplying electricity to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) citing non-viability, has now asked the utility to pay more if it wants to draw power in view of high demand amid the ongoing coal crisis. The plant, located at Mundra in Gujarat, has asked the corporation to shell out money which is 60% more than the price agreed in the power purchase agreement (PPA). The power supply arrangement will be for a week, it is learnt. The PSPCL has a share of 475 megawatt (MW) in the project’s total production capacity of 4,000 MW. According to the agreement, which was entered in 2007 and is valid for 25 years, the Mundra project will sell power to the state at around ₹3 per unit. But last month, the project stopped power supply to the PSPCL citing losses and its inability to supply the required volume of electricity. But later, the project management communicated to the power utility that it was ready to sell power if it agreed to pay ₹5 per unit. “Since the PSPCL is already purchasing power from the grid at ₹13 per unit, it decided to go ahead with ₹5 per unit from the Mundra project even as it is much higher than the rate agreed in the PPA,” said a senior corporation official. The decision, he added, was taken in the interest of consumers as prices of power available with the grid have touched rates as high as ₹20 per unit during the peak hours due to the countrywide coal crisis.PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said they will take decision in the interests of consumers. “We are trying our best to meet the demand, but the coal supply from the mines is really slow,” he added. Some senior power engineers have opposed the corporation’s decision. “Why two set of rules for private and government sector? If private projects can ask for higher rates than PPA on the plea that exchange rates are high, then why can’t the PSPCL refuse to pay as per the agreement when the exchange rates are lower? asked an engineer. Coal stock situation remains criticalThe coal stock situation in all thermal power plants in Punjab remains critical. The private based have coal reserves for about 2 days while the state-owned plants are left with less than 3 days of stock. On Monday, 13 coal rakes were received against the total requirement of 22 rakes. The PSPCL met maximum demand of 8,809 MW a day earlier. On Tuesday, nearly 1,600 MW electricity was procured at Rs.14.56 per unit from the national exchange. Power availability has improved as an additional unit of the Ropar plant and a unit of the GVK have started generating power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coal-crisis-private-plant-forces-punjab-power-utility-to-pay-60-more-than-ppa-price-101634068820150.html

During his visit to Urmar constituency, he inaugurated a house made for slum dwellers here by an NGO, and assured that the SAD-BSP government would construct five-lakh houses for the homeless. On the occasion, former minister Balbir Singh Miani rejoined the party. Miani said he will work for the victory of BSP candidate from Urmar, Lakhwinder Singh Lakhi. Sukhbir said the Kandi area had been neglected by the Congress government and no effort was made to augment drinking water and irrigation facilities. “A separate ministry will ensure focused development of the entire sub-mountainous area,” he said. Talking to mediapersons, Sukhbir said it was surprising to see AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s double standards on the issue of electricity crisis. “Kejriwal had announced that Delhi had become the only state which was not using coal for generating power. He also wrote to the Prime Minister, demanding diversion of coal meant for other thermal plants to the ones supplying power to Delhi,” he said. Sukhbir said the AAP leader’s stand on Satluj-Yamuna Link Canal and stubble burning issue was also not clear. On chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the SAD president said he was part of the cabinet that had denied SC scholarships to deserving students and scrapping of lakhs of blue cards. On the power crisis in the state, he said it was the direct result of mismanagement by the Congress government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-promises-separate-ministry-for-kandi-area-s-development-if-sad-bsp-voted-to-power-101634068762214.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh records hottest October day in 13 years||With maximum temperature touching 36.5°C, nearly four notches above normal, Tuesday was the hottest October day in at least 13 years in Chandigarh, according to data available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The all-time high for the month was recorded at 37.2°C nearly three decades back, on October 4, 1992.“An anticyclonic movement has developed over Rajasthan and Gujarat, which is sending dry and warm southwesterly winds towards this region, leading to a rise in mercury,” said Manmohan Singh, director, IMD, Chandigarh, adding that the temperature is likely to stay on the higher side in the coming days as well.“This situation will continue for the next two to three days, and the mercury could rise up to 38°C. However, the anticyclonic movement is shifting eastward. Northwesterly winds, which are colder, will again become dominant in the region and lead to a drop in mercury,” he said.Meanwhile, minimum temperature continued to fall, dropping to 20.6°C on Tuesday. Though three notches above normal, it was the lowest recorded since May 30 and is likely to remain around 20-21°C in the next three days too.Air quality turns poorThe air quality, too, took a turn for the worse on Tuesday. The air quality index (AQI) went up to 272 around 1pm at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station in Sector 22, which has been made operational recently. The AQI remained 200 till 2pm before gradually falling to 156 around 6pm. Meanwhile, the air was much cleaner at the monitoring station in Sector 25, where the AQI was recorded at 94 around the same time. AQI in the range of 201-300 is considered poor, and denotes that the polluted air can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Usually, it stays below 150 during this time of the year, and rises due to the burning of paddy stubble in the region. Debendra Dalai, member secretary of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee, said the AQI is expected to go higher in the coming days. “After the monsoon system, an anticyclonic movement forms over the area, which keeps pollutants from getting dispersed from the air,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-records-hottest-october-day-in-13-years-101634068587170.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh imposes blanket ban on crackers this Diwali||The Chandigarh administration on Tuesday decided to continue with the cracker ban this Diwali, which was also imposed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The order, issued by UT adviser Dharam Pal, came into force with immediate effect and will remain in force until further orders. Any violation can invite up to two-year imprisonment. However, burning of effigies will be allowed on Dussehra.According to the administration, the decision was taken after extensive consultation with health and environment experts, keeping in view the ongoing Covid-19 situation and the National Green Tribunal’s order.“These directions are issued as a containment measure to prevent spread of Covid-19 due to polluted atmosphere created by bursting of crackers,” the adviser stated in his order.Meanwhile, a spokesperson said:“Keeping in mind the National Green Tribunal orders, the Chandigarh administration has decided to impose a complete ban on sale or use of crackers of any kind, throughout the UT,”The city is one of the non-attachment cities included in the list notified by the Central Pollution Control Board as per the NGT orders, which advocate stringent measures for air pollution control.The spokesperson said the toxic air rising out of crackers is likely to affect residents’ health, and they should avoid bursting crackers this festive season.Any violation of the order will invite penal action under Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and other provisions as applicable. The punishment under the stated sections ranges from six months to two years, though the convicts can also be made to pay just a fine.Decision draws flakThe administration’s decision has drawn flak from the business community. Terming it arbitrary, the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) appealed the administration to follow a policy on the pattern of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.“This most important Indian festival of Diwali is celebrated worldwide by all communities to mark ushering of New Year. Without fire crackers, this festival seems incomplete. CBM demands protection of trade concerning sale and purchase of crackers and fireworks, though with necessary reasonable restrictions that may be imposed in its usage and timings,” said CBM patron Diwakar Sahoonja.Chirag Aggarwal, general secretary, Cracker Dealers Association, said they were going through the worst phase for the past two years. “In Mohali and Panchkula, people can sell and burst crackers, but not in Chandigarh. We will approach the courts against the order. Thousands of crackers manufacturers and traders are set to lose their livelihood.” Last year, the administration had banned the sale and bursting of crackers as the Covid-19 cases were on the rise. Even in 2019, the administration had allowed the use of crackers only for restricted hours to curb pollution. Stating that the Covid-19 situation is starkly different this year in comparison to last year, BJP state president Arun Sood said: “A blanket ban is not warranted. We will take up the issue with the administration.”AAP convener Prem Garg said: “The administration should allow limited sale of green crackers because children look forward to Diwali for bursting crackers.”Paveela Bali, a city-based environmentalist, said, “A blanket ban is not a rational response to environment protection. It goes against the traditions and hits at the livelihood of thousands of people. Better regulation of cracker quality can be done.”Limited licences in MohaliIn Mohali, which houses one of the biggest cracker markets in Kurali, the district administration has no plans to ban the sale of crackers. However, only a limited number of licences will be issued and the sale of crackers will also be allowed for only about three days.Deputy commissioner Isha Kalia said: “As per the directives, only temporary licences will be issued; that too would be only 20% of the licences issued in 2016.” Last year, the administration had issued 44 licences in the entire district.In Panchkula, the district administration is awaiting the state government’s directions.Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said: “Panchkula will go by whatever directions the state government issues. So far, we have not issued any licences. We will implement the decision as and when it comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-imposes-blanket-ban-on-crackers-this-diwali-101634068586007.html

She will have to undergo an additional six-month jail term is she fails to pay the fine. According to the prosecution, a team of the crime branch on patrol duty near Sector 39 had apprehended Kaur on the afternoon of July 10, 2019. As many as 50 vials of buprenorphine and pheniramine maleate were recovered from her. Both drugs are addictive in nature and taking them without prescription can be dangerous. The batch numbers on the vials were smeared with black ink and hence were not legible. A case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at the police station in Sector 39. “The nature of offence and heavy recovery, which is commercial in nature, do not leave any reason with the court to treat convict with leniency, lest it may give wrong signal to the society, thereby encouraging propagation of delivery and possession of such psychotropic substances, which are hazardous, damaging and are potential reason for spoiling of youth,” ruled the court of additional district and sessions judge Rajeev K Beri. False implication plea fails to hold waterKaur, who claimed to be a Class-11 student, had claimed false implication in the case. She told court that her mother was annoyed with her and had requested police to take some steps to make her mend her ways.She alleged that police had picked her up from a house in Sector 40 and the drugs had been planted. The court dismissed her submissions, stating: “The suggestion remained lame and unsubstantiated one. No ground is made out to believe such unproved suggestion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-court-awards-12-year-jail-to-woman-caught-with-drugs-101634068585053.html

The potash reserves will boost the state exchequer and reduce import bills of the country, they said. With this, Punjab has become the second state in the country after Rajasthan to have underground potash reserves and this will open a new chapter in the mining sector of the state, said an official. An official of the state mining department said India imports millions of tonnes of the mineral every year. The GSI officials shared the news with the state mining department recently in a meeting of the State Geological Programming Board. The GSI study has confirmed the presence of potash at a depth of 400-500 metres. The exploration was going on for the past one year. Sources in the mining department said the GSI team will take a few more months to complete the exploration and then hand over the sites to the Punjab government. A top official of the GSI, pleading anonymity, said, “A team of GSI has found potash in Fazilka and Muktsar districts. The quantity is yet to be calculated as the work of exploration is still on. But its commercial value is expected to be over ₹1,000 crore.” In written communication, a GSI official said, “Two deep boreholes have been completed and a few more have been planned to delineate the extent and mineral potential.” Additional secretary of mines and geology, Rahul Bhandari, said, “In the recent meeting of State Geological Programming Board, GSI officials said that they have found potash in Punjab and further studies are on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gsi-detects-potash-reserves-in-punjab-s-fazilka-muktsar-districts-101634068044481.html

The details of voters along with their woes related to electricity supply and billings are registered through a mobile app and the guarantee card is handed over to the voters with a registration number.“The voters may complain and even move court with the guarantee card if the promises made by AAP are not fulfilled after the party comes to power in the state. At present, the first guarantee card of Arvind Kejriwal promises 300 units of free electricity, waiver of old unpaid bills, regular power supply besides free electricity to farmers in the state,” Altaf said.Altaf, who is the party candidate from city South constituency, said that within a few days of campaigning, the guarantee card of Arvind Kejriwal has been handed over to around 3,000 households in different constituencies. Citizens reeling under the present government are now themselves expressing faith and confidence in the Aam Aadmi Party’s public interest policies. The budget for electricity in UP is far more than Delhi and it is possible to provide 300 units of free electricity to people across the state. People are being overbilled and if they receive 300 units free electricity then they may spend the saved money on welfare of their families and their entertainment.AAP city general secretary Sarvesh Yadav said that party leaders will soon go to the people with a second guarantee card of Arvind Kejriwal which will promise employment and raise issues related to women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-prayagraj-aap-wooing-voters-with-kejriwal-s-free-electricity-guarantee-card-101634067859898.html

Both were nabbed while planning to surrender in a court, police said. The arrests were made just two days after JN Singh, former SHO Ramgarh Tal police station and Akshay Mishra, chowki in charge of Phal Mandi post were held from Gorakhpur. These four cops were among the six policemen who were booked under section 302 of the IPC. “Acting on a tip-off, police have arrested the two cops identified as Rahul Dubey and Prashant Kumar in connection with Manish Gupta murder case,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vipin Tada. All the six accused cops were carrying a cash reward of ₹1 lakh declared by Kanpur SIT which had also circulated the photos of the accused policemen with public appeal for information leading to their arrest. Raids were on to nab the remaining accused persons, the police officer said. On the intervening night of September 27 and 28, six policemen led by JN Singh and Akshay Mishra visited Hotel Krishna palace around 12.30 and checked room no 512, where Manish was staying with his two friends Hardeep Singh Chauhan and Pradeep Singh Chauhan, brothers from Gurgaon, and asked them to show their ID proofs as part of an ongoing checking drive against criminals and suspects. While the Chauhan brothers were quick to show their IDs, Manish objected to the midnight checking, leading to arguments which eventually made Singh and Mishra angry who then allegedly started beating him brutally. Chauhan brothers had told media that Manish was beaten up in the closed room after they were pushed out by cops. When the door opened, they saw the cops dragging Manish in an unconscious state. They said the policemen took Manish to a nearby private hospital from where he was referred to the BRD Medical College, where he was declared brought dead due to excessive bleeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kanpur-realtor-murder-case-two-more-accused-cops-held-in-gorakhpur-101634067680711.html

It is our duty to make efforts to improve the future of the students.”He said, “I have especially come here to meet and listen to students. The aim of the government is to make efforts to make students self-reliant by providing world-class opportunities.” He said that soon he will go to different technical institutions of the state and listen to the problems of teachers and students and solve them. “Work will be further accelerated to make student-centric policies,” he said.Prasada said that the prime minister is to announce the Gati Shakti Yojana on Wednesday.

For this, the monastic order has decided to organise ‘Kalindi Utsav’ under which wide spread riverbank cleaning exercises and conservation awareness events would be started between Karela Bagh and Bade Hanuman temple in Prayagraj on November 14 and it would be gradually scaled up into a state-level mission, said Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad and chief patron of Juna Akhada. “Yamuna is also a sacred river in Hinduism. The river is worshipped as a Hindu goddess called Yamuna, also known as Yami in early texts and in later religious literature, she is called Kalindi. In Hindu scriptures, she is daughter of Surya, the sun god, and Sanjna, the cloud goddess,” the senior saint said. Aimed at attracting the attention of the people as well as the governments towards need of undertaking Yamuna-specific initiatives to conserve the river, demand of constructing public toilets on the river banks would also be raised, said Mahant Hari Giri. “We want basic amenities to be developed first to conserve Yamuna, followed by the people residing on its bank being sensitised about the need to conserve the river and its importance among millions of Hindus. The next step possibly could be strict measures like levying fines etc on people polluting the river and its banks by dumping waste, garbage and releasing untreated sewage into it,” he said. The Juna Akhada, the largest of all 13 monastic orders in terms of count of seers as well as having maximum number of Naga ascetics, would also undertake massive tree plantation drives along the banks of Yamuna as part of this mission. “We will involve locals residing on the riverbank as well as volunteers for looking after the planted trees. Our saints and seers across the state will use their sermons and discourses to spread the message,” he explained. Deepdaan events on Yamuna banks during the sacred Kartik month as per the Hindu calendar, set to start on October 21, and continue till November 19, would also be organised during cleaning of the ghats and the banks as part of this mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-juna-akhada-to-launch-mega-mission-across-uttar-pradesh-for-yamuna-conservation-101634067204406.html

The field reports should have been filed by now. The respective district authorities should now file these within the next 72 hours. Accountability will be fixed if anyone is found involved in the sale of spurious seeds and pesticides or overlooking their availability,” said Nabha.The minister said the reports from cotton-growing belts were also required to determine the exact crop loss for compensation.“As per existing rules, loss between 76% and 100% can be compensated with ₹12,000 per acre. But it is the domain of the finance minister to finalise the amount of compensation,” he added.Nabha said experts of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, and other institutes had been taken on board to chalk out a long-term plan to mitigate infestation of pink bollworm.Prima facie, the onus of transportation of this pest from other states lied on the cotton-ginning and oil-extraction firms, he added.“We do not intend to take any punitive action. But factory owners must ensure that safety protocols are followed strictly to check the population growth of pests. Also, a mass awareness drive has been planned to sentitise farmers by February to adopt best farm practices,” he added.Nabha said a draft farmers’ policy, framed by the Punjab Farmers and Farm Workers Commission, will be reviewed for implementation.“Ajay Vir Jakhar, who recently resigned as commission chairperson, had spent considerable time to prepare the report. It deserves to be discussed in the government and we should adopt the best recommendations,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-attack-in-punjab-agriculture-minister-sets-72-hour-deadline-for-reports-101634066962315.html

The FIR alleges that her uncles and cousins later also raped the girl. She has also accused her father of trying to force her into prostitution.Lalitpur district president of the Samajwadi Party Tilak Yadav, who has been named in the FIR, said it was a conspiracy against him. “ I will commit suicide if implicated; this is the case of martial dispute.

13-10-2021||Lucknow||Shivpal Yadav begins ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ from Mathura||Agra National president of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (PSP), Shivpal Yadav chose death anniversary of socialist leader Dr Ram Manohar Lohia on Tuesday to begin his ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ from the religious town of Vrindavan in Mathura district. The yatra which halted in Agra on Tuesday night will head for Firozabad on Wednesday morning. Shivpal Yadav offered prayers at Bankey Behari Temple in Vrindavan on Tuesday to seek blessings as he began his election campaign for forthcoming assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. From Firozabad the yatra will go to Etawah, Auraiya and Jalaun on way to Rae Bareli and is expected to end on November 27 after travelling through different districts. “It is jungle raj all over UP and mafia are dominant everywhere. Farmers are being targeted for no fault of theirs, so this ‘rath yatra’ is for ‘parivartan’ (change) of power in the state. We have begun our effort to achieve this aim after seeking blessings of Bankey Behari in Vrindavan,” said Yadav before beginning his ‘yatra’ in a specially prepared bus. Incidentally, Shivpal Yadav began his ‘samajik parivartan yatra’ on the same day in Mathura when his nephew Akhilesh Yadav initiated his ‘vijay yatra’ from Kanpur. In a surprising development, Congress leader and spiritual head Acharya Pramod Krishnan was with Shivpal Yadav and boarded the bus too in Mathura. “The present government in Uttar Pradesh has chosen the path of ‘adharm’ (against ethics) and PSP leader Shivpal Yadav has chosen to initiate ‘yatra’ to uproot this government. So I came to convey my good wishes to Shivpal Yadav with whom I have personal relations, being associated with the same ashram in Mathura’ said Pramod Krishnan while evading questions related to alliance between Congress and PSP. But he said that parties with same ideologies should unite to uproot the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. On Monday Aditya Yadav, son of Shivpal Yadav, said in Mathura, that his father was blessed by good wishes from Mulayam Singh Yadav and masses in Uttar Pradesh both of which would pave the way for success in the forthcoming elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shivpal-yadav-begins-samajik-parivartan-yatra-from-mathura-101634066419916.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up authorities for not closing 1,000 juvenile-related cases||The Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up the authorities for not taking steps to close around 1000 cases related to petty crimes allegedly committed by children or juveniles in which enquiries have been pending for more than a year. Petty crimes under Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act are defined as those which entail a maximum imprisonment up to three years. These include offences such as assault, causing simple hurt, theft, forgery etc.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani noted that the state has also not complied with its direction to inform it about the number of cases where inquiries are pending in each Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) for six months to one year, along with the date of institution of the inquiry and of the first production in each case.When the court was informed that the government was waiting as some amendment was going on in the Rules and 10 days time was sought to produce juveniles before the JJBs, the bench observed, “Children can’t wait. Juveniles can’t wait. You take as much time as you want but children cannot be put on hold.”During the hearing, the Delhi government showed a chart to the court where there was a difference of 409 minors in the number of juveniles produced before the JJB and those released thereafter.“Where are these 409 juveniles? They have fallen through the cracks. These 409 (minors) will be lost in the system. We shudder to think what awaits us. What is happening? What happened to these 409 and where are they?” it asked.The bench further said the government’s conduct was not satisfactory and the court’s September 29 judgment, which said the child must be produced before the JJB within 24 hours of becoming a subject of processes under the JJ Act, was clear and had no ambiguity.“You should follow “Alice in the Wonderland” which says that if everybody minded their own business, the world would go around a great deal faster than it does,” it said.The court granted Delhi government a week’s time to file an affidavit elaborating the steps taken by them to comply with its previous order.When the court asked when will all the juveniles, allegedly involved in petty offences and against whom inquires are pending, be produced before the JJB, the government counsel said it will be done in 10 days.“You should have done it by now. We are surprised with what JJBs are doing. Are they not aware of our order? They must comply with our order. By now, the JJB should have directed the police to produce all juveniles before the board,” the bench said.“We can understand the executive is finding it difficult to comply with our order but we cannot understand why JJB is finding it difficult to comply with our order. We cannot turn a blind eye to it,” it added.When the government counsel said the court’s September 29 order has been a boon, the bench shot back saying the order has not yet been complied with and how can it be a boon to anyone.The court said the authorities cannot take the ground of COVID-19 pandemic for not producing the juveniles before the JJB within 24 hours and said when policing did not stop in the pandemic, it must also do all the documentation work.Senior advocate H S Phoolka, amicus curiae in the matter, said the bench may direct the registrar of the court to send the order to the JJBs for ensuring compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-pulls-up-authorities-for-not-closing-1-000-juvenile-related-cases-101634066240841.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||Rohini shooting: Bar associations suggest smart ID cards for lawyers||The Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) and the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) on Tuesday suggested to the Delhi high court that advocates must be allowed to enter district court premises only on the basis of a “smart ID card”, having a digital chip for verification of the individual’s identity.Listing out their suggestions for improving security measures at district courts, the lawyer bodies told the bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that such smart cards will be similar to the “proximity cards” issued to lawyers for securing entry to the Supreme Court premises.“Advocates may be permitted with ID cards, like proximity cards in Supreme Court... There will be a mechanical scanning of these digitised cards,” said DHCBA president and senior lawyer Mohit Mathur.Lawyer Devendra Singh, appearing for BCD, said a new card containing a “chip” will be issued to advocates to regulate their entry into court premises.He said all advocates must abide by security checks and any refusal to follow the same shall amount to misconduct.The suggestions were made during the hearing of a plea that the bench had taken up suo motu, following the shooting at Rohini courts on September 24 in which jailed gangster Jitender Gogi was shot dead by two men posing as lawyers, who were later shot dead by the police in retaliatory firing. The bench had earlier asked all stakeholders, including the Centre, the Delhi government, and various bar associations, to also give their suggestions on the improving security at district courts so that these could be incorporated in the final order.During the hearing, the DHCBA further suggested that all visitors, including advocates, be frisked using advanced metal detectors, and all vehicles checked using hi-tech devices. The association further said the entry of hawkers must be banned; only licensed shopkeepers must be allowed access and identity cards must be issued to their staff as well. The BCD called for a three-tier security system, including posting police personnel in civvies inside courtrooms, setting up a “24-hour control room” and installing more CCTV cameras to monitor the court premises.It was also suggested that an “active interactions and meetings” of stakeholders must be ensured to deal with the issues and a separate uniform be prescribed for law interns.Both lawyer bodies said the production of under-trials should be done in the virtual mode and the number of security personnel increased.Lawyer Robin Raju, appearing for a petitioner lawyer, who has filed a separate plea on the issue, said an advisory should be issued to all members of the Bar to cooperate with the security checks.Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, appearing for Delhi Police, said his suggestions were “more or less the same”.Earlier, Delhi Police had suggested that the use of technology must be maximised to reduce the physical appearances of parties at all seven district courts and also suggested the immediate upgrade of security gadgets to obviate security concerns.It said the security of the seven district courts has been taken over by the Security Unit, a specialised unit of the Delhi Police, and necessary security arrangements and staff are being deployed accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rohini-shooting-bar-associations-suggest-smart-id-cards-for-lawyers-101634065999863.html

The reward will go up to ₹1 lakh if the case ends in conviction,” Bhaskar said in a release.Information against errant scan centres could be provided on helpline number 104 or pcpndt.ap.gov.in website. Details of the informants would be kept confidential, the Commissioner said.The child sex ratio in AP currently stood at 0:5, “which is not good”.“We will have a bad sex ratio again in a few year, though the adult sex ratio now looks okay,” a top official pointed out.He said sex determination appeared to be high though nobody was giving evidence.“Hence this reward and ₹1 lakh is decent,” he added.The health department carried out 474 decoy operations in various districts in recent times to keep a tab on scanning centres. More than 17,000 inspections were also carried out to ensure that the PCPNDT Act was not violated.In 21 cases, the centres were sealed and cases filed in courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-declares-reward-to-curb-tests-for-sex-determination-101634065642316.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||32 Tihar officials booked for violation of jail rules in Delhi||The Delhi Police crime branch on Tuesday filed a case against 32 officers of Tihar jail for allegedly helping jailed Unitech ex-promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra violate prison rules and run a “secret underground office in south Delhi” from the jail, officers aware of the matter said. The officers said that all 32 prison officials who have been booked were posted in Tihar’s jail number 7, where the two real estate developers were lodged, until the morning of August 28 when they were shifted to Arthur Road and Taloja jail in Maharashtra on the orders of the Supreme Court.“The FIR is against one jail superintendent and other junior officers such as deputy superintendent, assistant superintendent and warders. The FIR also names the two Chandra brothers and their father, Ramesh Chandra. There was prima facie evidence of the jail officers taking money for helping the prisoners, so we have registered case under the Prevention of Corruption Act,” said a mid-level police officer, who asked not to be named. On Tuesday evening, a Delhi Police spokesperson said that they have sent letters to the Delhi government and the Union ministry of home affairs for departmental action(suspension) against 32 officers. As part of the probe, Delhi police commissioner Asthana recorded statements of all officers; inspected jail premises where the Chandra brothers were lodged, and also visited the jails in Maharashtra where they are currently incarcerated.A senior prison officer, who asked not to be named, said the prison department is yet to receive the letter. “All 32 will be suspended until the investigation is completed. We are yet to receive the report,” the officer said.On October 6, the Supreme Court, acting on the inquiry report submitted by the police commissioner, ordered the government to suspend the officers named in the report. On August 26, the apex court directed the Delhi Police chief to personally look into the role of prison officials after the Enforcement Directorate(ED) informed the court that Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra violated prison rules and ran a “secret underground office” in south Delhi from inside Tihar jail allegedly with the help of jail officers.HT reported on October 7 that the crime branch will register an FIR in the case based on Asthana’s report, in which he questioned at least 18 jail officers, including two senior jail superintendents. Though no police officer confirmed this, a prison officer said that during the inquiry the jail officers showed alleged forged court documents, on the basis of which they claim they provided facilities to the Chandra brothers, such as telephones, refrigerators, and work stations inside the prison. However, they did not say who forged those documents. The Chandra brothers were arrested in April 2017 for duping homebuyers in 74 Unitech projects. The two were also being probed by the ED. The ED in a report to the apex court had said that the two used the prison complex to transfer the proceeds of crime and were instructing their people outside to dispose of their properties. The ED said that it also unearthed a secret underground office’ in Delhi, which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra, and was visited by his two sons – Sanjay and Ajay – when they were on parole or bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/32-tihar-officials-booked-for-violation-of-jail-rules-in-delhi-101634065641258.html

Both the boards would be directly under the control of the Union Jal Shakti ministry.A meeting of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) under Jal Shakti ministry, held in Hyderabad on Tuesday, announced that the gazette notification will come into partial implementation from October 14.A similar decision was taken by the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) at its meeting held in Hyderabad on Monday, an official in the Telangana state irrigation department familiar with the development said.“The KRMB decided to take control of even the hydro-power projects on Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala apart from control over the canals and water releases. While Andhra Pradesh agreed to hand over the hydel power projects located on its side, Telangana refused to do so. The KRMB authorities deferred the decision on the same,” the official quoted above said.The KRMB also deferred the decision on all the other projects in the Krishna basin mentioned in the gazette notification due to certain objections from both the states. It also wanted to take over all the project offices, files, staff, machinery and equipment with effect from October 14, but kept the decision in abeyance for now.With regard to Godavari river projects, it was decided that for now, only one medium irrigation project, Pedavagu, would be brought under the control of GRMB, as it is an interstate project. “Both the states agreed for the same, but raised objection over handing over major projects like Kaleshwaram and Polavaram,” the official said.Though the constitution of KRMB and GRMB was done as per the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, it was aimed at only resolving the disputes between the two riparian states post bifurcation.“The boards are essentially meant for monitoring the water releases from the projects on the two rivers as per the allocations made to the states. It does not mean the Centre should take over the complete authority over the projects,” pointed out Madabhushi Sridhar, former Central information commissioner and dean of law in Mahindra University in Hyderabad.The two states have been raising objections over the gazette notification issued by the Centre. They are arguing that only major interstate projects could be brought under the purview of the river management boards and not all the canals, lift irrigation schemes and hydel power projects.At the GRMB board meeting held on Monday, the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh irrigation department authorities raised objections over the Centre taking over of the movable and immovable assets of all the irrigation projects like Kaleshwaram in Telangana and Polavaram in Andhra built on the Godavari river.They sought to know whether the Centre will also take responsibility of the liabilities of the states on these irrigation projects. “We have taken huge loans from banks and financial institutions to complete these projects. If the Centre takes control of them, will it take the responsibility of repaying the loans as well?” the Andhra officials asked.Both the states have also refused to commit on the payment of ₹200 crore each to the Krishna and Godavari boards towards the expenditure incurred on operation and maintenance of the irrigation projects. They asked the boards to present the expenditure details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-to-take-over-major-irrigation-projects-after-resistance-from-telangana-andhra-101634065580925.html

Several alleged Maoists from Tamil Nadu had figured in the case registered by the NIA in Kochi relating to the conspiracy by members of CPI (Maoist). According to the statement from the agency, the proscribed terrorist organisation conducted a training camp, arms training, flag hoisting and celebrations for formation day of CPI (Maoist) during the last week of September 2016 in the Nilambur forest area “and also for engaging in anti-national activities, threatening the unity, integrity and security of India.”Officials of the agency have been raiding the locations across all the three southern states since Tuesday morning. They included 12 premises in Tamil Nadu of the accused Maoists in the districts of Chennai, Coimbatore, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Salem, Kanyakumari, and Krishnagiri. Searches went on in three locations in Kerala’s Wayanad, Thrissur, and Kannur, and five locations in Karnataka in the districts of Chikmagalur, Udupi and Shivamogga. The case was originally registered in the Edakkara police station in Kerala’s Malappuram district in 2017. The NIA subsequently took over and reregistered it in August this year under sections 121 and 122 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), section 3 read with 25(1B) (a) of Arms Act, 1959 and sections 18A, 20 and 38 of UA (P) Act (UAPA).After investigation by the Kerala police, in May this year, five accused people, named Kalidas, Danish alias Krishna, Rajan Chittilapilly, Dinesh D H and T K Rajeevan, were charge-sheeted. “Investigation by the NIA is continuing against the involvement of the remaining 20 members of CPI (Maoist),” the agency’s statement said. “During searches conducted today, digital devices including mobile phones, SIM cards, pen drives, documents including books, manifesto, pamphlets and other incriminating materials have been recovered from the premises of the accused persons.”Police personnel were deployed in the 12 locations in Tamil Nadu. “As per NIA Act, we have to provide local assistance,” said a senior police official of Salem district. “We are not sure if the searches will continue tomorrow.”The NIA said that further investigation in the case will continue. HT has contacted the NIA’s spokesperson and this story will be updated with their comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/niaraids-20-locations-in-3-states-over-2016-maoist-camps-in-kerala-101634065579755.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||‘Farm produce not being graded scientifically’||Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka, who is the administrative secretary in-charge of Nuh district, has recommended that the quality of agricultural produce arriving in mandis for procurement should be graded in a scientific manner.The IAS officer, who recently inspected Kharif procurement operations in Nuh district, said the focus should be on quality-based trading on national agriculture market portal (e-NAM) to ensure greater number of buyers and best value for the farmers’ produce.Khemka, in his inspection report, said during his visit to mandis of Nuh, Ferozepur Jhirka and Tauru on October 1, he came to know that some bogus registration for Bajra on ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal were found during ground verification.“This was due to expectation of government purchase of bajra at minimum support price (MSP) where unscrupulous traders would have sold recycled or bajra brought from other states,” he wrote.The IAS officer said bajra produce was traded between ₹1,250-1,300. However, one lot was sold at ₹1,800 and another at ₹900. “The large difference was explained due to differences in quality. But the quality is being judged by eye estimation. No grading of lots was being done by the market committees,” the officer wrote.“Though the producer did not dispute the low price, the fact remains that had bajra been purchased by government agencies at MSP, all lots would have been purchased at the same price, irrespective of differences in quality,” the officer further wrote.The officer said under the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1937 the national standards for Bajra are notified, considering quality factors such as moisture, foreign matter, other food grains, admixture of different varieties, damaged grains, immature grains, grains infested with weevil (an insect which damages grains) and shrivelled grains.Bajra is graded into four types taking into account the maximum level of tolerance for each of the factors and grading is done using MAAT machines.Khemka said average rate of PUSA Basmati 1509 variety was hovering between ₹2,800-2,900 and one particular lot was sold for ₹1,700. The reason given was that the lot contained large proportion of unripe grains as per eye estimation.However, the quality is not measured and recorded to explain the price difference. The price variation without grading of the produce is prone to misuse by vested interests, he said.Khemka wrote the e-NAM trading was non-existent, the auction was done manually and the auction details were entered manually into the e-NAM portal. The analyst was ignorant of e-NAM trading or grading of the produce.“Instead of being Luddites, the marketing board should make progress with the use of e-NAM quality-based trading. A unified market of farmers produce will ensure best value for it. Buyers should be allowed to register in e-NAM, independent of registration in APMC mandis. Farmers will realise better value of their produce with increasing buyers. Inter-state or unified registration of buyers may be allowed on the portal,” Khemka said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-produce-not-being-graded-scientifically-101634065099495.html

13-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: North MCD to only collect segregated waste from November 1||New Delhi: The North Delhi Municipal Corporation will collect only segregated waste from households and other waste generators from November 1, and have issued directions to officials to ensure concessionaires use green and blue bins to transport wet and dry waste respectively to the processing facility. Officials said the decision was taken to ensure strict compliance to the solid waste management rules 2016, which seeks to ensure 100% segregation of waste at source. North MCD commissioner Sanjay Goel, who chaired a review meeting on Monday with officials and concessionaires on Monday, said there will be provision for a monetary penalty for defaulters but did not specify its quantum.“The North MCD will paste red stickers on the premises of regular defaulters who are found violating the norms for waste segregation. There is also a provision of monetary penalty for the violation of norms. Since nobody can afford to pay fines all the time, we believe that people will soon start adhering to the norms. Until they do, the red stickers will continue for defaulters,” he said. Goel further said that the concessionaires have been directed “to deploy adequate staff at dhalaos to prevent the public from dumping non-segregated waste”.The corporation is also planning to organise public awareness campaigns to educate the public about the benefits of waste segregation. “The officials have been directed to hold regular meetings with RWAs, market associations and bulk waste generators in their respective areas, for waste segregation at source. The officials have also been asked to prepare area specific strategies, including for slums and other settlements, commercial institutions and other non-residential premises, for segregation of waste at source,” said Goel. Meanwhile, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), in association with US Environment Protection Agency, on Tuesday, organised a training-cum-awareness programme on waste management for bulk waste generators at the auditorium in its headquarters. This programme was a part of its Global Methane Initiative (GMI) along with TERI.Briefing about the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and its bye-laws, Alka Sharma, the additional commissioner of EDMC, said that it is the need of the hour to segregate waste at the source. “This little effort can change the whole picture of waste management in East Delhi. We hope that the bulk waste generators will help EDMC to make East Delhi garbage-free,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhinorth-mcd-to-only-collect-segregated-waste-from-november-1-101634064799658.html

13-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Drop in air quality but rain, winds to improve conditions over the week||Delhi’s air quality saw a marginal deterioration on Tuesday, with at least 11 of the 36 monitoring stations in the Capital recording air quality index (AQI) in the ‘poor’ category, up from seven stations a day ago, data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed.However, India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said that the pollution situation in the Capital will improve in the coming days with wind speeds expected to pick up from Wednesday and light to moderate rain forecast on between October 17 and 18.CPCB data showed that on Tuesday, the overall AQI in Delhi was 179, up from the 166 on Monday, both of which are in the ‘moderate’ category.IMD scientists said that the brief deterioration in air quality was because of calm winds. “The winds were calm on Tuesday and the primary pollutant in Delhi was PM 10 (particulate matter of diameter less than 10 micrometres) or dust from local sources. Currently, the impact of stubble fires is not much. From Wednesday, wind speeds will pick up and pollution is likely to go down,” said a senior IMD scientist.He also said that there is a forecast of rain in Delhi and neighbouring states, which will also result in an improvement in air quality.“Since there are not much pollutants in the air now, the rains will help clear the pollution levels. Usually, if the pollution load in the atmosphere is high, and the humidity levels also increase, pollutants stick to it and settle close to the surface,” he explained.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services, said that the wind direction over Delhi is expected to change from October 16, and light to moderate rains are likely over Delhi-NCR between October 17 and 18.“At present, Delhi is receiving westerly winds. From October 16, the wind direction will change to easterly, which will also result in light to moderate rains in the city. The neighbouring states will also receive moderate to heavy rains,” Palawat said.Scientists warned that though the impact of stubble fires is low in Delhi’s air for now, pollution will start rising in the coming weeks as temperatures drop and stubble burning activities pick up.Data collated by United States’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) shows that between September 1 and October 11 this year, Punjab reported 918 stubble fires, much lower than 2,996 instances reported in the same period last year. In Haryana, 442 fires were reported between September 1 and October 11 this year, as opposed to 750 reported during the same period last year.“Last five years of satellite data for stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana clearly shows late and slow starts of the season compared to previous years, potentially due to prolonged monsoon and change in policies. We will have to monitor the numbers in the coming weeks,” said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhidrop-in-air-quality-but-rain-winds-to-improve-conditions-over-the-week-101634064559723.html

It was only when the journalist showed Uzaib a photograph of the alleged terrorist, Mohammad Ashraf, that he identified him and admitted that his father, Naseem Ahmed, helped Ashraf get an Aadhar card at their address.Also Read| ‘Lone wolf terrorist’ from Pakistan held in East DelhiAshraf lived at their house under the name of Ali Ahmed Noor, Uzaib said.“I don’t know the entire details but my father helped him (Ali) get his Aadhar card, as he carried other identification documents (IDs). We did not know his real identity and nationality. Ali came to us through a reference. He lived at our house for nearly a year and then moved out. He lived alone and nobody ever visited him. He told us that he worked at a private company in Ramesh Park, near Laxmi Nagar,” said Uzaib.Since the police broke the news that the alleged Pakistani terrorist used their address to procure his Indian ID, Uzaib and his family members were afraid that they may have to face consequences for keeping a Pakistani citizen at their house, and helping him obtaining an Aadhar card.“We closed our factory as we could not face the questions from journalists, and our neighbours were looking at us as if we were guilty. My husband is stressed. We fear that the police would trouble us, specially our two sons. I don’t understand what crime we have committed,” said Uzaib’s mother, who did not share her name.The family members said Ashraf stayed in an 8x10 feet room on the first floor of their house, and paid ₹700 as monthly rent. He left the room in the morning for work and returned late in the evening.Several residents of Aaram Park refused to speak on the matter, saying that they did not know Ashraf personally or remember seeing him living there.The police said Ashraf was arrested from Gali Number 10 in Ramesh Park, near Laxmi Nagar that has several garment stores apart from residential buildings where migrants, mostly students or those working in private companies, live as tenants.

The health department officials have been directed to investigate and carry out containment measures there,” said Dr Sharma.Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the health department is conducting fogging and spraying anti-larvae medicines in the district. “Our health teams are screening densely populated localities to eliminate chances of mosquito breeding. We are carrying out testing in areas where fresh cases are being reported, and conducting extensive fogging and anti-larvae medicine spraying drives,” Sharma said.Meanwhile, the blood bank at Child PGI hospital has reported an increase in the demand for platelets. “The daily consumption of platelets at Child PGI hospital was five to six units till September, but the consumption has increased to 15-20 units per day in the past two weeks. Since the shelf-life of platelets is only 72 hours, it is very hard to maintain the inventory and we are able to satisfy 80% of the demand, there is still some shortage as the blood donations are to a bare minimum,” said Dr Satyam Arora, associate professor, Transfusion Medicine, adding that the department will hold blood donation camps in the district this month itself.Trilok Sharma, founder trustee, Rotary Noida Blood Bank, said that the blood bank is getting at least 25-30 units. “Earlier, we had a demand of about five units of platelets a day, but it has increased to 25-30 units a day now. Since the shelf-life of platelets is low, for 20% of the demand, we have to ask the patients to bring donors and we provide platelets to the rest,” Sharma added.The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), which also has a blood bank with a platelet facility, there’s a consumption of around five units per day, said the officials. “The hospital does not have critical dengue patients requiring platelets. The daily consumption of five units of platelets at the hospital is usual, and there has been no increase in the demand so far,” said Dr (Brigadier) Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS in Greater Noida.The dengue patients admitted at the district hospital in Sector 30 have no need for platelets so far, said chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr Sushma Chandra on Tuesday. “Dengue patients at our hospital are able to recover without being given platelets as they are not critical.

On Tuesday, Ghaziabad recorded an AQI reading of 190 in the ‘moderate’ category against 225 in the ‘poor’ category a day earlier.UPPCB officials said that the implementation of Grap in the district will include different measures, except for the ban on diesel generator (DG) sets.“During the meeting, senior members of the commission said that different measures will be implemented to improve the air quality in the district. The air quality in the city is in the ‘poor’ category now, but we will implement measures listed under the ‘very poor’ category from October 15, except for the ban on DG sets,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.In 2016, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had conducted meetings with state government representatives and experts, and came up with a plan that listed different measures to be taken when air quality deteriorated. “The measures will include periodic mechanised road sweeping, prevention of burning of garbage at landfill sites, implementation of dust control measures, ensuring smooth flow of traffic, strict vigilance and enforcement of Pollution Under Control (PUC) norms, strict enforcement of the Supreme Court orders regarding ban on firecrackers. The commission will meet every Friday to assess and monitor the process,” Sharma added.At present, Ghaziabad has four continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations at Indirapuram, Loni, Sanjay Nagar, and Vasundhara. “The primary pollutant at the three stations, except for the one at Loni, has PM10 as primary pollutant, and the one at Loni has several hours when the primary pollutant is PM2.5. So, dust control measures need to be enforced strictly. The municipal corporation of Ghaziabad has been asked to provide us the roster of mechanised road sweeping activities which details the route, timings, and information of drivers as well. We will keep a strict check on road sweeping and also burning incidents of garbage or crop residues,” Sharma said.According to government data, Ghaziabad is listed among the 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh with high levels of air pollution. Cities are declared non-attainment if, over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter (PM10) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2). “The implementation of Grap should be strictly monitored and enforced to have a positive outcome. At present, the city has bad road patches and potholes on roads which are yet to be repaired after the monsoon. So, the task would be challenging for different agencies. Further, the Winter Action Plan should be strictly enforced, otherwise, the pollution level will soar again, just like the previous years,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer.The UPPCB on October 5, 2021, chalked out a Winter Action Plan under which at least 18 different departments have been tasked to take up slew of measures to help keep the air pollution in check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/grap-measures-in-ghaziabad-from-oct-15-up-pollution-body-101634063961430.html

13-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Can UAPA be invoked for calling road blockades, asks Umar Khalid||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Umar Khalid, arrested in the conspiracy case related to the north-east Delhi riots, on Tuesday told a city court that police have written fanciful stories in the charge sheet and asked whether he could be charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for calling for (road) blockades in the city. Arguing his bail plea in the riots conspiracy case before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, senior advocate Trideep Pais told the court that the police wished to paint every accused with the same brush while giving a “tadka” (flavour) to it.“Is chakka jam (blockade) an offence, does it invite UAPA? Is a meeting to say that our protest will involve chakka jam automatically a criminal conspiracy? Where does it say it’s a crime? This meeting has found itself on every news item, branded about like some great conspiracy,” Pais said.“Your [prosecution] wish to paint every accused with one brush as if it was one conspiracy crumbles when you look at the charges sheet. Where do you get it from? You got it from your mind. Half of it is a fertile imagination. None of this is supported by any statement,” Pais further said.Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the stringent UAPA for “masterminding” the February 2020 north-east Delhi riots, in which 53 people were killed and over 700 injured.The Delhi Police had earlier said Khalid’s bail plea had no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against Khalid before the court.Pais, during the hearing on Tuesday, referred to three allegations made against the accused in the charge sheet, emphasizing that all three were the result of the fertile imagination of the police and had no consistency.He submitted that the first allegation levelled by the police in the charge sheet was that JNU student Sharjeel Imam created a WhatsApp group of Muslim students on the directions of Khalid on December 4, 2019.Denying this, he said, “Constituting a WhatsApp group of Muslim students, is it a terror? There is no witness to say that it was formed on the instance of Umar (Khalid). It is so easy to rope me in the charge sheet which is just a conjecture.”The lawyer further said there was not even a single shred of communication between Imam and Khalid and no message was shared by the latter in the WhatsApp group.“Just being in a group is not a crime,” the counsel said during the hour-long hearing. He also denied the second allegation levelled by the police regarding a speech given by Khalid at a protest organised by United Against Hate (UAH) at Jantar Mantar on December 7, 2019, where, as per the prosecution, he also introduced Swaraj India president Yogender Yadav to Imam. “Police said Imam was introduced to Yogender Yadav by Khalid, his senior and mentor. Senior, mentor – this ‘’tadka’’ (flavour) has been put by them. It is such a dangerous thing,” Pais said, referring to the charge sheet. He also said the speech purportedly given by Khalid was produced by the police and there is no evidence that it incited anybody. “The officer wants to tell the story but he forgets that he is not a storyteller; he is dealing with the law. Every assertion in the charge sheet must have a basis but this does not have any basis. They want to paint me with a single brush but do not have material for that,” Pais further said.He said the third allegation against him was that he was allegedly part of a “secret meeting” held on December 8, 2019, where organising a chakka jaam (road blockade) was discussed. The lawyer read out the statement of three prosecution witnesses and claimed that none of them described it as a secret meeting.The trio did not sign it, and it was recorded after a delay, Pais claimed. He said, “None of the witnesses spoke about a conspiracy, meeting of minds, or an illegal act. It is not my personal opinion or that of the officer who is writing these fanciful stories using words like a mentor, teachers, or whatever.” “If I am the mastermind, then why are these witnesses not saying what suits you? Mere presence in a meeting or being a part of a WhatsApp group is not a crime. Attending a meeting is not a crime by any stretch of the imagination,” Pais said. The court will now hear the bail plea on November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-can-uapa-be-invoked-for-calling-road-blockades-asks-umar-khalid-101634063959639.html

This is much lower than the state average of 53.48%. Other than the financial district, the state’s other districts which have less than 40% children who have completed the one-year immunisation include Jalna, Parbhani and Beed. Whereas the districts which have the most number of children who have completed the one-year immunisation are Jalgaon, Bhandara, Nashik and Amravati.As per the June 2020 ICDS report, out of the 1,252,799 children in the age group of one to two years, only 669,993 have completed the one-year immunisation. Mumbai fares the lowest when it comes to complete immunisation of children in the age group of one to two years. Mumbai is further bifurcated into Mumbai city and Mumbai suburban district that have the lowest percentage of vaccinated children as only 29.95% and 36.02% have got all the vaccines to be administered to children within their first year of birth. Along with Mumbai, Beed at 36.32%, Parbhani at 38.24% and Jalna at 39.79% are some of the poorest performing districts when it comes to immunisation.Surprisingly, within the urban, rural and tribal community, urban children have the least immunisation coverage. While 30.02% of children in rural areas have been immunised, 32.83% of children in tribal areas and 19.63% of children in urban areas have been immunised. Immunisation is a national-level programme for children under five who are administered vaccines for all approved ailments free-of-cost at government centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mumbai-has-least-number-of-immunised-children-in-state-icds-101634063839666.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||‘Lone wolf terrorist’ from Pakistan held in East Delhi||The Delhi Police on Tuesday claimed to have averted a terrorist strike during the ongoing festive season with the arrest of an alleged “lone wolf” terrorist who was sent to India 17 years ago by the Pakistani intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), for launching attacks in India.The police said Mohammad Ashraf, 40, who was arrested from east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar area on Tuesday morning, had an Indian passport, Aadhaar card and other documents, and was about to launch a “lone-wolf attack”, during the ongoing or upcoming festivals. Lone wolf is a term used by security agencies to describe terrorists who operate alone.Special cell officers involved with the arrest said one AK-47 assault rifle with two magazines and 60 bullets, two sophisticated Chinese pistols with 50 rounds, and one hand grenade was recovered from a place near Yamuna Ghat in south Delhi’s Kalindi Kunj, on the information provided by Ashraf.The officers said the arms and ammunition were sent to him from Pakistan through the Punjab border by his ISI handler, whom Ashraf identified as Nasir.The police, however, did not clarify the place in India where the ISI was planning to carry out the terror attack through Ashraf. Also, they did not specify whether Durga Puja or Diwali festival celebration was on the target of the alleged terrorist.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said, “Ashraf claims that he has not been told about the place and the date when the terror attack had to be executed. He only had received coordinates of the place where the weapons and explosives were delivered. We suspect that Ashraf’s handler was sharing information with him on need-to-know-basis. Ashraf was only told about the delivery of the weapons and explosives but not about the person who was delivering them.”On Tuesday, Ashraf was produced before chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Pankaj Sharma at Patiala House court and was sent to special cell’s custody for 14 days for further interrogation. He has been booked under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Explosive Act and Arms Act.Special cell officers said Ashraf, whose name in the passport and Aadhaar card has been given as Ali Ahmed Noor, was an active part of a sleeper cell module of the ISI, and added that he has confessed to have carried out many terror strikes and espionage activities in Jammu and Kashmir and other states in the country.Also Read| Delhi family that helped ‘Pakistani terrorist’ get Aadhaar fears witch-hunt“We are verifying his disclosures because the claims that he is making are very sensitive and beyond our imagination. That’s the reason we are not revealing details of the terror strikes that he said he was involved in,” said an officer who asked not to be named.Officers said that Ashraf was living in Delhi as a “Peer Maulana” (an ascetic), who solved health, family and personal problems of people through spiritual means. The added that Ashraf was “activated for executing the terror strike” by his handlers in mid-September, soon after the special cell arrested six people who were part of a Pakistan-trained terror module, and were planning serial blasts and targeted killings in at least three states during the festive season.“Although Ashraf is not part of that module and he doesn’t know the six arrested men, the way he was activated after their arrest gives us reasons to believe that the handlers of both the modules may be the same. When the first module was busted, the ISI handler activated Ashraf for the job,” the officer added.DCP Kushwah said information about Ashraf’s involvement in the planned terror strike came through “reliable sources” and he was arrested on Monday. His preliminary interrogation revealed that soon after he completed his Class 10 from a school at his hometown in Pakistan’s Naroval Punjab in 2004, he was recruited by the ISI. He was trained for six months in Siyalkot, Pakistan by his handler, Nasir, who motivated him to work as a sleeper cell agent in India.After completing his training, Ashraf entered India via Bangladesh through Sliliguri border in West Bengal. He stayed in Kolkata for a few months, and then moved to Ajmer in Rajasthan, where he befriended a cleric at a local mosque. In the year 2006, he accompanied the cleric to Delhi. He met relatives of the cleric and managed to win over their trust, and started receiving money from his ISI handler Nasir through online money transfer using IDs of cleric’s relative, said a second special cell officer.“During that time, Ashraf remained in touch with his handler through emails. In the recent past, Ashraf was using encrypted mobile applications for having conversation with his handler,” the DCP added.About Ashraf’s Indian identification documents (IDs), officers said that he first procured an ID from Bihar and used it to obtain Aadhaar card, passport and other papers in Delhi. His Aadhard card is registered at an address in east Delhi’s Aaram Park near Geeta Colony, where he lived as a tenant for nearly a year. Ashraf also lived in Vaishali, Ghaziabad and married a local woman. He left her nearly six months after their marriage and moved to other place in Delhi.“We have found that Ashraf travelled to Saudi Arabia and Thailand four-five years ago using his Indian passport. He may have met his handler there,” said Kushwah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lone-wolf-terrorist-from-pakistan-held-in-east-delhi-101634063659366.html
13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Srinagar: BJP members stage protest against J&K administration||In a rare protest, members and workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Srinagar held a protest against the J&K administration for “not providing security to the panchayat members, corporators and political workers”.The protesting BJP workers also raised slogans against the officers of the J&K administration and alleged that the administration was “compromising on the security issues of the political workers”. The protesters claimed that even officers in the administration didn’t bother to pick their phone calls. Post-abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two UTs on August 5, 2019, this is the first time when BJP workers organised protests against the administration. BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur, who was also a part of Tuesday’s agitation, said that they organised the protest to highlight their grievances, especially the security related issues of sarpanches, corporators and political workers of Kashmir, whose security and accommodations were withdrawn amid a serious threat in the backdrop of the rise in civilian killings. “We have brought issues related to security in the notice of divisional administration and the lieutenant governor. Unfortunately, nothing happened and we were forced to come on the roads. We held two sit-ins at Press Enclave and outside Civil Secretariat.”Thakur said that withdrawal of accommodation to the panches and sarpanches has resulted in the privacy issues and security related problems.“These are the elected representatives of people and not the prisoners,” he said, adding that in 14 hotels booked in Srinagar, more than six leaders are being kept together which is a clear breach of security. Altaf Thakur said that it was unfortunate that these leaders were thrown out of their personal accommodations and kept as “herd of sheep in hotel rooms”.He alleged that officials have been providing wrong feedback to L-G Manoj Sinha. “This is a grave issue that needs to be addressed. Our workers are highlighting problems on the behalf of all political workers and panchayat members, especially when militants are killing civilians and looking for soft targets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/srinagar-bjp-members-stage-protest-against-j-k-administration-101634063599727.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||War of words as NTPC says Delhi only using 70% of power provided, Jain denies||A day after Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain complained that the national capital was only getting about 50% of its scheduled electricity from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited, the Union power ministry and the NTPC hit back and said Delhi was using only about 70% of the electricity that was being made available to it daily.“The NTPC has been making available the required power to Delhi. Data from October 1 to 11 shows that Delhi’s distribution companies (discoms) have been scheduling only 70% of the power that has been made available by us,” said a spokesperson of NTPC Limited, the country’s largest state-run electricity producer.Data shared by the corporation showed that on Monday, 2,285MW was provided by NTPC, of which 1,617MW was scheduled for distribution. On Sunday, 2,024MW was supplied by NTPC, of which 1,378MW was supplied to consumers. On Saturday, 1,846MW was provided by NTPC and 1,362MW was scheduled for distribution.Discoms did not comment on the figures shared by NTPC.The NTPC statement, however, was strongly refuted by Jain, who said the Centre is not considering the fact that on any given day, NTPC Limited is supposed to supply about 4,000MW to Delhi, but it is currently supplying only about 2,000MW or less daily.  “The NTPC has to supply 3,500MW to Delhi under the power purchase agreements (PPAs), but today it is giving only half of it— 1,750MW. For the past few days, NTPC has halved the power generation in its plants across the country. The Central government should answer whether there is an actual coal shortage or whether it (reduced power production) is being done intentionally,” he said. Hindustan Times verified the data and confirmed that owing to reduced generation capacity stemming from the coal shortage, almost all coal-fired plants are producing electricity up to 50-55% of their capacity.The Union power ministry on Tuesday said there was no power outage in Delhi due to a “shortage” of electricity. “The maximum power demand of Delhi was 4,536MW (peak) and 96.2 MU (energy) on October 10, 2021. As per the information received from Delhi discoms, there was no outage on account of power shortage, as the required amount of power was supplied to them,” the ministry said in a statement.Yet, the power ministry added that it has directed the NTPC Limited and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) to supply as much power as is available to Delhi. “The ministry of power has issued instructions to NTPC and DVC to secure the power supply to Delhi. This will ensure that distribution companies of Delhi will get as much power as was requisitioned by them as per their demand,” the power ministry said. In another letter, the ministry warned states and Union territories (UTs) to not indulge in selling excess power. It said a few states are not supplying power to their consumers and are imposing load shedding in areas, while selling electricity at the power exchange for a higher price. When asked, the ministry refused to name which these states or UTs were. “If any state is found selling power in the power exchange or not scheduling this unallocated power, their unallocated power may be temporarily reduced or withdrawn and reallocated to other states which are in need of such power,” said the letter.Jain also alleged that though Delhi has gas-powered electric power plants, the Centre has stopped giving gas to Delhi at a controlled rate because of which the Delhi government is forced to buy gas at market rates to generate electricity. “This has pushed up the cost of power generation. Despite that, there has been no power cut in the capital and the Delhi government is ensuring 24X7 electricity to the people. All coal reliant power plants in Delhi are non-functional. The Delhi government buys electricity from power plants that run on coal located outside Delhi. Chief Ministers of five to six states have written to the Prime Minister on this issue. Be it Punjab, Andhra Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh, power cuts are being imposed everywhere in the country, except Delhi,” he said. However, several residents from across Delhi that HT spoke to said they have been facing power cuts ranging from one to four hours over the past couple of days. Anand K Dubey, a resident of Ghitorni in south Delhi, said there was power cut in their area on Monday evening for at least two hours. “I request chief minister Arvind Kejriwal that there is no need to make Delhi like London or New York; let Delhi be like Mumbai or Bengaluru or even I’ll be happy to compare it with Lucknow or Patna when it comes to electricity,” he said. At least three power officials have confirmed that rotational load shedding is being undertaken to ensure equitable distribution of electricity. A senior power official said on condition of anonymity, “The power demand in Delhi is being met. It is being met in two ways — one is by purchasing power on the spot and two, through minor load shedding to ensure equitable distribution to all areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/war-of-words-as-ntpc-says-delhi-only-using-70-of-power-provided-jain-denies-101634063541517.html
13-10-2021||Pune||Surge in bronchiolitis cases due to RSV infection in babies, children in Pune||PUNE: Amid fears of a third wave of Covid-19, city doctors are now reporting a sudden uptick in the number of Bronchiolitis cases caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection in children.While a spike in this viral infection is usually due to seasonal change such as the rainy season being on its way out as the winter approaches, this year, both the number of cases and the hospitalisation period have gone up. The number of children with bad cough, cold and fever has gone up. Upon investigation, they test negative for Covid-19 but test positive for viruses such as RSV or Para influenza which lead to Bronchiolitis. The respiratory tract infection is taking a toll on an increasing number of children.Dr Tushar Parikh, consultant neonatologist and paediatrician, Motherhood hospital, said, “Bronchiolitis is a lung infection seen in infants and young children in the age group of zero to two years. It leads to inflammation, swelling, and congestion in the small airways (bronchioles) of the lung, and is commonly seen during winters due to cold weather. This condition causes breathing problems. Premature babies discharged from the hospital are more severely affected as their lungs are immature.”Dr Parikh said that most Bronchiolitis cases are due to RSV. This virus causes Bronchiolitis, which spreads through the air when one coughs, sneezes or shakes hands. “Germs are present on hands, toys, faucets, door knobs, tissues, and other surfaces and are contagious for several days or even weeks. Infected children complain of symptoms such as wheezing, cold, rapid breathing, dry cough, congested or runny nose, poor feeding, irritability, tiredness, fever, sneezing, and headaches for up to a week. I have treated around 100 children with this condition in the last two to three months,” Dr Parikh said.“Infants and children may be at the risk of Bronchiolitis as their lungs and immune systems are weak. Other factors like pre-term birth, underlying lung conditions, lack of breastfeeding, second-hand smoke, spending a lot of time in crowded environments, and lack of hygiene can also be the culprits. Not treating children at the right time can lead to low SPO2 levels, dehydration, hospital admissions, viral pneumonia and respiratory failure. Moreover, children with RSV will be susceptible to Covid-19,” Dr Parikh added.Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, a paediatrician who works as a consultant with three more hospitals, said, “Every day, I am seeing about six to 10 severe cases of Bronchiolitis that need admission and in addition, we have about 20 to 25 cases of RSV plus influenza and daily viral infections. Though we get cases of Influenza and viral infections every year, the time taken for recovery is longer this year, with children requiring five to 10 days to recover, up from the earlier three to five days. However I must also say that this pattern is not specific to Pune only and doctors practising across the state are reporting a spike. The most common incidence is among babies who are less than one year old, who are also pre-term and have lower immunity. We are yet to understand what has changed this year. However, we cannot link it to Covid-19 because we do test the infants and they test negative for Covid-19.”Dr Pradeep Alhate, paediatrician, Apollo Spectra hospital, said, “Our hospital too is reporting a spike in the number of children diagnosed with Bronchiolitis. It may start as a common cold but some may even get Cyanosis. Intercostal or Costophrenic Recession is an alarming sign that needs hospitalisation. Symptoms of RSV infection overlap with those of Covid-19. Hence, proper diagnosis is the key. Do not give any over-the-counter medication to the baby as the treating doctor has to decide the line of treatment, considering there is no vaccine to tackle this condition. Take precautions like avoid kissing the baby or shaking the baby’s hands, wear a mask near the baby, keep the baby away from sick people, breastfeed the baby, and keep the baby hydrated with adequate fluids.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/surge-in-bronchiolitis-cases-due-to-rsv-infection-in-babies-children-in-pune-101634063540013.html
13-10-2021||Delhi||Lockdown data to serve as baseline for India’s new air quality standards||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is working on revising the air quality standards in India with data from the Covid 19 lockdown last year serving as the baseline, Sudheer Chintalapati, joint director at ministry of environments and forest and climate change (MoEFCC), said on Tuesday. “We now have baseline data to show what air quality can be like when anthropogenic emission sources are either absent or very low. The Central Pollution Control Board is now working on revising the air quality standards in India with National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI),” Chintalapati said at a webinar on ‘WHO’s revised Air Quality Guidelines: A Health Sector Perspective.’Last month, the World Health Organization tightened its air quality guidelines last month bringing down the annual PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) guideline from 10 micrograms per cubic metres to 5 micrograms per cubic metres and the 24-hour PM 2.5 guideline from 25 micrograms per cubic metres to 15 micrograms per cubic metres. It has also tightened norms for five other pollutants based on recent evidence of health impacts associated with these pollutants.Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi who was associated with the baseline study during Covid 19 lockdown said the new standards should have intermediate targets so that implementation can happen in a phased manner.“WHO guidelines also have intermediate targets to help countries and regions achieve the guideline. We do have a baseline now as to how long pollution levels can go when urban air pollution sources are curbed, but we have to remember that household air pollution sources such as cooking and open biomass burning continued during the period which are also major sources of pollution. Now there is enough evidence on the massive health burden of air pollution, so I hope that is studied and incorporated,” Dey added.Rakesh Kumar, former director of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)- NEERI, said India must work on setting “achievable” targets since the ones fixed by WHO were guidelines only. “Our air pollution levels particularly PM 2.5 levels reduced by 40% to 60% in most regions during the complete lockdown period (March-April 2020). But even then, levels were not close to the WHO standards and often did not meet our national standards. Let’s not jump at numbers from the WHO guidelines. Those are only guidelines. We have to develop standards that are achievable in India and are closer to our baseline,” Kumar said.Maria Neira, Director, Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health Department (PHE), World Health Organisation who also spoke at the webinar said that if the revised WHO guidelines are met globally 80% of the 7 million premature deaths and loss of millions more healthy years of life can be prevented.Dr Arun Sharma, director, National Institute for Implementation Research for Non-Communicable Diseases said the revised WHO guidelines should be taken as a warning. “The latest evidence shows no amount of particulate matter pollution is safe for us which is why the revised WHO guidelines are so low,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-data-to-serve-as-baseline-for-india-s-new-air-quality-standards-101634063360301.html

The airport is located close to the venue of the popular puja.“As soon as the ATC received the complaints, the local police were informed and the laser show was stopped. There has been no more problem since then,” a senior officer at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose international airport told HT on Tuesday.#WATCH Kolkata's Sree Bhumi Puja Pandal designed on the theme of Dubai skyscraper Burj Khalifa witnesses huge crowds pic.twitter.com/Vf2TDURnRkThough the height of the tower meets the limit prescribed by the Airports Authority of India, laser shows are banned around airports across the country since strong beams of light cause visibility problems for pilots during landing, said an official at the airport.Patronized by the state’s fire services minister Sujit Bose, the puja organised at Sreebhumi is known for its unique themes and grandeur.
13-10-2021||Kolkata||Bengal doctors fear fresh Covid outbreak as millions hit streets during puja||The sight of crowds swelling on the streets of Bengal and Kolkata since the inauguration of the Durga Puja festival on Monday - the auspicious occasion of Sasthi according to the Hindu almanac - has panicked doctors with many fearing a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases in the coming weeks. As many as 36,946 community Durga pujas are organised in Bengal. Of these, around 2500 are held in Kolkata. HT talked to senior doctors and experts who said they were shocked to see people being taken over by a false sense of immunity, apparently arising out of the decline in active Covid-19 cases in the state since August coupled with mass vaccination. “If the coronavirus is appearing to be under control right now then it is because of the character of viruses and natural history of diseases they spread, not because of medicines and vaccines. The virus is now coexisting with us. It is herd immunity that has brought down the intensity of the transmission. This mass violation of health protocols can trigger a fresh outbreak. I am surprised to see nobody is speaking up,” veteran virologist Dr Amitava Nandy told HT on Tuesday evening. “The virus is being carried even by those who are vaccinated. They can become spreaders. Of the patients who came to my clinic with fever and symptoms of Covid-19 in recent weeks, around 40% were fully vaccinated. I know of many people who died after vaccination,” Dr Nandy added. While hearing a public interest litigation demanding restriction on the festivities, the Calcutta high court on October 8 ordered that no more than 15 people can enter small pandals to perform puja provided they have received both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine and are wearing masks. For big pandals, the number is restricted to 30. The court also said that no-entry zones have to be marked for common people around five metres of small pandals and 10 metres of the big ones. These do’s and don’ts were laid down by the high court last year when a similar petition was filed. Relaxing some restrictions imposed in 2020, the bench allowed rituals such as anjali (mass recitation of holy scripts before the deity). Even before the four-day puja began on Tuesday, millions of people thronged puja pandals in the state capital and district towns, ignoring social distancing norms, doctors said. A large section of revellers, including children, could be spotted without masks. In sharp contrast to last October, when the rate of infection was peaking, the crowds were alarmingly large, doctors pointed out. When the festival began on October 22 last year, 4157 new cases were recorded and 64 patients died on a single day, according to data provided by the West Bengal health department. Of these, 874 cases and 16 deaths were reported in Kolkata. A year on, the picture is quite different. The number of new cases recorded in Bengal between October 9 and 11 ranged between 597 and 755 respectively, while deaths per day did not cross 15. On Monday, for example, 145 new cases and only one death were reported in Kolkata. As many as 64.3 million of Bengal’s 101.9 million people were vaccinated till October 11. Of these people, 46.4 million have received their first dose while 17.9 million got both the shots, as per the official records. Several forums of Bengal-based doctors have warned people against an imminent danger if health protocols are ignored. The state government has issued warnings although hotels and restaurants have been permitted to operate beyond 10 pm for 10 days. Vehicles have also been allowed to ply at night although local train services are still suspended. The Joint Platform of Doctors, a forum of five organisations, has issued a statement saying Kerala witnessed a surge after the Onam festival and Bengal recorded a rise in infection rate when assembly polls were held in eight phases in April-May. “The court has imposed restriction on entry into pandals and people will be forced to follow it. It is crowding on the streets that we are worried about. People neither wore masks nor maintained social distance during shopping for puja. If this continues, we will be thrown back to where we stood in March-April,” the statement said. “The large turnouts have not gone unnoticed. Community puja organisers are following the court orders. Policemen and volunteers are warning people and persuading them to put on masks,” an officer from the south division of the Kolkata Police, who has been on duty since Monday night, said on condition of anonymity. Some health experts feel that if there is a fresh outbreak then mass behaviour will be responsible for it. “What can the government and police do when people are not conscious even after so many families have dissipated? Health protocols in a pandemic situation cannot be enforced without mass participation. Experts can only give advice,” Dr Kalyan Kar, head of surgery at a well-known private hospital in Kolkata, told HT. Dr Nandy said as a Hindu he was anguished to see a religious ceremony being reduced to revelry in which rules can be broken at random. “Many doctors do not raise their voice because they do not want to antagonize political parties,” he said. Since chief minister Mamata Banerjee, a patron of the festival, is also in charge of the health department, Trinamool Congress leaders did not want to comment on the record on the government’s decision to left certain restrictions. Last year, the Calcutta high court ruled that the grant of ₹50,000 given by the state government to each of the 36,946 community clubs should not be spent on festivities. The money needs to be spent on masks, sanitisers and better community policing, the court ruled. This year, however, no separate guideline was set by the court. “The government is keeping an eye on the situation. The police and civil administration have been asked to ensure that Covid protocols are maintained everywhere,” said a health department official who did not want to be quoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-doctors-fear-fresh-covid-19-outbreak-as-millions-hit-streets-during-durga-puja-101634058620746.html

The RJD chief, who has been recuperating from several ailments in New Delhi since his release on bail in fodder scam cases in April this year, is expected to visit Bihar later this month to campaign for his party for bypolls in two assembly seats due to be held on October 30.“I will show my father what all is happening in the party. Let him come,” Yadav (32) told reporters, but did not elaborate. Tej Pratap, a former health minister of Bihar, is said to be miffed with RJD’s state unit president Jagdanand Singh and younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, the party’s heir apparent. His name did not figure in RJD’s star campaigners’ list for the bypolls.On Sunday, Tej Pratap even refused to meet his mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi, who drove straight to his residence after landing in Patna from Delhi. On Tuesday evening, however, he visited her mother at her residence. Meanwhile, Tejashwi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of senior leaders and functionaries in Patna to discuss the party’s campaign and strategy for the upcoming bypolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/will-expose-many-in-party-once-my-father-returns-to-patna-tej-pratap-101634055439180.html
13-10-2021||Mumbai||Nerul to Uran railway corridor: ‘CIDCO violated Forest Act, HC order on mangroves’||The regional empowered committee (Nagpur), constituted by the Union environment ministry, has held off on green-lighting the City Industrial Development Corporation’s (CIDCO) proposal to divert 23.7 hectares of forest land in Thane district, to make way for Phase 1 of the Nerul-Uran railway corridor. This was done in the light of previous violations of the Forest Conservation Act (1980) and the Bombay High Court’s orders on mangrove conservation in Maharashtra by CIDCO, reveal the minutes of the REC’s last meeting on September 16, a copy of which was accessed by Hindustan Times this week.REC in its considerations noted that CIDCO had already obtained Stage-1 forest clearance for diversion of 4 hectares of forest land for Phase 2 of the Nerul-Uran Railway Corridor, but pointed out that the proposal (number FP/MH/RAIL/25112/2017 on the state forest portal) was subsequently never forwarded to the Central government for consideration. As CIDCO went ahead with the forest diversion without any prior clearances under the Forest Conservation Act (1980), “accordingly there is violation of the FCA, 1980”, the REC noted in its meeting on September 16.The REC also noted that “some construction activity and destruction of mangroves” had been carried out for the Nerul-Uran Railway as early as 2005-2008, in spite of the restrictions put forth by the Bombay High Court in its order on mangrove protection in 2005. While the High Court later allowed CIDCO to proceed with the work in 2008, this was permitted only after other requisite environmental permissions were acquired. “The CIDCO have not taken permission under the FCA, 1980, and resumed work, thus not only violating the provisions of the FCA, 1980 but also contempt of the Hon’ble High Court order,” the REC noted.With these previous violations in mind, the REC decided not to recommend CIDCO’s latest proposal seeking diversion of 23.7 hectares of forest land (mostly mangroves) in Thane district. The integrated regional office (IRO) of the forest department in Nagpur has now been asked to submit a report on CIDCO’s proposal, keeping in mind the applicability of the Forest Act and the HC’s order on mangrove conservation, after which the REC will take a decision on fresh diversion of 23.7 hectares of forest land, and whether post-facto clearance may be given for the 4 hectares which have been cleared in violation.Letters have also been sent from the IRO (Nagpur) to the state forest department (dated September 28 and September 29) seeking clarity on the shortcomings identified by the REC in both proposals. A copy of the letters has been seen by HT. “Once the state government gives us the information we need, we will examine whether the proposals are valid. It would not be appropriate to comment other than the observations which have already been recorded in our minutes,” said a member of REC, seeking anonymity.CIDCO officials, including those in the environment and public relations offices, declined to comment citing protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neral-to-uran-railway-corridor-cidco-violated-forest-act-hc-order-on-mangroves-101634050398300.html

According to ACB officials, the accused, Baliram Kolekar (57), is an Assistant Conservator of Forests in charge of the Murbad and Thane range. The complainant is a Class II officer working under him and looks after the Tokawade area in the Murbad taluka in Thane district. “The state government had sanctioned two tranches of funds for the complainant’s area for the last two financial years. Kolekar was demanding a total of ₹6.22 lakh in exchange for releasing the funds,” an ACB officer said. The complainant approached the ACB last month to complain against Kolekar. After verifying the complainant’s claims, the ACB set a trap. Kolekar was allegedly caught red-handed while accepting ₹5.30 lakh from the complainant at his Naupada office on Monday. He was subsequently placed under arrest and charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act. “While searching Kolekar’s office, we found and seized an additional amount of ₹12.46 lakh in cash.

13-10-2021||Chandigarh||Convicted of murder, dera chief’s sentencing deferred till October 18||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Panchkula on Tuesday deferred the sentencing of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who has been convicted of conspiring to murder his former manager Ranjit Singh in 2002.The CBI has sought death sentence for Ram Rahim, who in turn pleaded for mercy via video conference from Rohtak jail, where he is serving a 20-year term for raping two followers.The special CBI court had convicted the dera head and four others on October 8 in the Ranjit Singh murder case.The hearing on Tuesday began amid tight security. The authorities imposed prohibitory orders in the area in view of the violence reported after his conviction in rape cases in August 2017, in which 36 people were killed in Panchkula.While Dera chief pleaded leniency, citing social work done by him, the CBI opposed it stating that the victim treated him as God and the accused committed offences against him. He had criminal antecedents and committed offence in a cold-blooded manner without provocation.Senior public prosecutor KP Singh said the CBI demanded “maximum punishment” under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which is death penalty. Others convicted for the crime are Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh, Avtar Singh and Sabdil.In the court, CBI cited two judgements by the Supreme Court.“The counsel of some other convicts sought time stating that they are not ready with arguments as they have to go through the judgments cited by the prosecution,” CBI special prosecutor HPS Verma told the media outside the court.On their request, the court deferred the sentencing till October 18.Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra.Murdered for revealing sexual abuse at dera: CBIAccording to the CBI, Ranjit Singh was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter that revealed the sexual exploitation of woman followers at the dera.

The two-day meet, which is taking place virtually, started on Wednesday.India is leading a session on resilience, Australia on disruption, the UK on virtual currency, and Germany on diplomacy.Lt General Rajesh Pant, the national cybersecurity coordinator, is leading the Indian delegation at the event aimed at combating ransomware.“Many governments have been indispensable in organising the meeting, and four countries in particular have volunteered to lead and organise specific thematic discussions: India for resilience, Australia for disruption, the UK for virtual currency, and Germany for diplomacy,” a senior official of Joe Biden’s administration said while reviewing the meeting for reporters.In all, 30 countries are participating in the meet, including Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UAE. The EU is also taking part in the event.The meet on tackling ransomware is a part of the Joe Biden administration’s four-part strategy to counter the scourge of ransomware.Colonial Pipeline, a major US oil distribution company, reportedly paid $4.4 million to a cybercriminal group DarkSide earlier in the year to get back control of its pipelines. And Toshiba, the Japanese electronics giant, had said the same group had hit the networks of its European division in France at the same time.The FBI, however, recovered $2.3 million of the ransomware that was paid by Colonial in Bitcoins.Ransomware attacks are a global menace. Ransomware payments reached over $400 million globally in 2020, the White House said in fact-sheet and topped $81 million in the first quarter of 2021, “illustrating the financially driven nature of these activities”.Disrupting ransomware infrastructure and actors as in the Colonial Pipeline case will the first of the four-part strategy to be announced by the Biden administration. “We’re bringing the full weight of U.S. government capabilities to disrupt ransomware actors, networks, financial infrastructure, and other facilitators,” the official said and went on to cite the Colonial case as an example.The second part of the strategy is to be bolster “resilience to withstand ransomware attacks”, addressing and fixing vulnerabilities in networks. The third is to prevent the “abuse of virtual currency” to launder ransom payments, and the fourth is to marshal international allies and partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cybersecurity-india-takes-lead-on-joe-biden-s-initiative-against-ransomware-101634149601493.html
13-10-2021||World||Facebook expands “involuntary” public figure option to journalists, activists. What it means||Facebook has decided that it will now consider activists and journalists as "involuntary" public figures on its platform so as to increase protection against harassment and bullying targeted at these groups, Facebook's global safety chief said in an interview with Reuters this week.Although it allows critical commentary of public figures and private individuals on the platform, Facebook, which has 2.8 billion monthly active users, went ahead and revamped its approach on the harassment of journalists and "human rights defenders", who it said are in the public eye due to their work rather than their public personas.The social media giant has already been under wide-ranging scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators for its content moderation practices and harms linked to its platforms, with internal documents leaked, forming the basis for a U.S. Senate hearing last week, as reported by Reuters.Facebook's "cross check" system has been in the spotlight lately after the Wall Street Journal reported that it has the effect of exempting some high-profile users from usual Facebook rules.The difference between public figures and private individuals in terms of the protections it affords them around online discussion, Reuters reported, is that users are generally allowed to call for the death of a celebrity on the platform.Earlier this year, Facebook had announced it would remove content celebrating, praising or mocking George Floyd's death, deemed an “involuntary” public figure.Facebook's Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis told Reuters that the company was expanding the types of attacks that would go against its policy for public figures on its platforms, in order to reduce any kind of violence disproportionately faced by women, people of color and the LGBTQ community.Facebook will also no longer allow severe and unwanted sexualizing content, derogatory sexualized photoshopped images, drawings or direct negative attacks on a person's appearance, for example, in comments on a public figure's profile, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-expands-involuntary-public-figure-option-to-journalists-activists-what-it-means-101634140774653.html
13-10-2021||World||Star Trek actor William Shatner becomes world's oldest space traveler at 90 after trip to space in Blue Origin rocketshi||Actor William Shatner soared aboard a Blue Origin rocketship on a suborbital trip and landed in the Texas desert on Wednesday to become at age 90 the oldest person ever in space as U.S. billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos's company carried out its second tourist flight.Shatner was one of four passengers to journey to the edge of space aboard the white fully autonomous 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters-tall) New Shepard spacecraft, which took off from Blue Origin's launch site about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.The four astronauts experienced about three to four minutes of weightlessness and traveled above the internationally recognized boundary of space known as the Karman Line, about 62 miles (100 km) above Earth. The crew capsule returned to the Texas desert under parachutes, raising a cloud of dust.The four astronauts, all wearing blue flight suits with the company's name in white letters on one sleeve, climbed into the crew capsule atop the spacecraft before the launch and strapped in after ascending a set of stairs accompanied by Bezos. Each rang a bell before entering the capsule, with Bezos then closing the hatch. Before that, they rode a vehicle with Bezos at the wheel to the launch pad.Winds were light and skies were clear for the launch, which was conducted after two delays totaling roughly 45 minutes.Joining Shatner - who embodied the promise of space travel in the classic 1960s TV series "Star Trek" and seven subsequent films - in the all-civilian crew were former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, clinical research entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin vice president and engineer Audrey Powers.It marked the second space tourism flight for Blue Origin, billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos's company founded two decades ago.The flight represents another important day for the nascent space tourism industry that, according to UBS, could reach an annual value of $3 billion in a decade. The flight, previously scheduled for Tuesday, was pushed back a day for wind-related reasons.Blue Origin had a successful debut space tourism flight on July 20, with Bezos and three others aboard, flying to the edge of space and back on a trip lasting 10 minutes and 10 seconds. On that flight, pioneering female aviator Wally Funk at age 82 became the oldest person to reach space. The previous record was set in 1998 when pioneering astronaut John Glenn returned to space as a 77-year-old U.S. senator.Bezos, the Amazon.com Inc founder and current executive chairman, formed Blue Origin two decades ago.Shatner, who turned 90 in March, has been acting since the 1950s and remains busy with entertainment projects and fan conventions. He is best known for starring as Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise on the classic 1960s TV series "Star Trek" and seven subsequent films about fictional adventures in outer space.As an actor, Shatner was synonymous with space voyages. During the opening credits of each episode of the series, he called space "the final frontier" and promised "to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""Beam me up," Shatner's character would tell the Enterprise's chief engineer Scotty, played by James Doohan, in a memorable catchphrase when he needed to be transported to the starship.Shatner said there is both irony and symmetry to his space trip, having played a space explorer for decades and now actually becoming one."Having played the role of Captain Kirk ... assigns me the knowledge that a futuristic astronaut would have, but I've always been consumed with curiosity," Shatner said in a Blue Origin video.Shatner's participation in the flight has helped generate publicity for Blue Origin as it competes against two billionaire-backed rivals - Elon Musk's SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc - to attract customers willing to pay large sums to experience spaceflight.Branson inaugurated his space tourism service on July 11, riding along on a suborbital flight with six others aboard his company's VSS Unity rocket plane. SpaceX, which has launched numerous astronauts and cargo payloads to the International Space Station for NASA, debuted its space tourism business by flying the first all-civilian crew to reach Earth's orbit in a three-day mission ending Sept. 18.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration two weeks ago said it will review safety concerns raised by former and current Blue Origin employees who have accused the company of prioritizing speed and cost savings over quality control and adequate staffing. (Reporting by Mike Blake; Additional reporting by Peter Szekely in New York and Eric M.

The United States said Cambodia had a year earlier turned down its offer to repair the base.Cambodia has repeatedly denied reports that it is planning to let China place its forces at the facility.Such a move would be significant for China in a region where the United States has for decades maintained a regional presence through bases it once operated or joint exercises in countries like Thailand and the Philippines.Phay Siphan, Cambodia's government spokesman, said Chinese construction at Ream was part of its development assistance."Our port is open to all when the construction is finished," Phay Siphan said, adding that China was not building a facility for its military."If there are other friends who want to help constructing, we allow and when the construction is finished, we welcome all countries to use it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-out-cambodia-for-non-transparency-over-chinese-activity-at-navy-base-101634133512129.html
13-10-2021||World||G20 talks: China moots tough approach to terror in Taliban-run Afghanistan||China urged the international community to push the Taliban government to adopt a “zero-tolerance” approach to terrorism and create an inclusive government at Tuesday’s special G20 summit convened to discuss the way forward for war-torn Afghanistan, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday.A readout from the ministry quoted President Xi Jinping’s special representative Wang Yi as outlining a four-point proposal for Afghanistan, which also included joint international efforts to help the country.The proposals by Wang, who is also a state councillor and foreign minister, were “putting people first and helping Afghanistan to overcome the humanitarian crisis; encouraging Afghanistan to move toward inclusive development; holding a zero-tolerance attitude to terrorism; and pushing for joint efforts with a consensus toward helping Afghanistan”.Elaborating on the third proposal at the G20 meet, Wang said told the meeting to “adopt a zero-tolerance approach to ensure that Afghanistan keeps itself far away from terrorism”.“It is necessary to promote the relevant Afghan parties to make an early decision and take practical action to root out terrorism. It is also necessary to cause the international community to build a united front against terrorism by abandoning double standards and selective counter-terrorism so as to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a hotbed and harbour for terrorism again,” Wang said in his speech delivered via video link.Referring to the US’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in August, Wang said countries that have caused the current predicament in Afghanistan should learn the lessons and take responsibility to help avoid a humanitarian and refugee crisis.“Countries that still impose unilateral sanctions should lift them, and international financial organisations should increase financial support for Afghanistan’s poverty alleviation and infrastructure construction,” Wang was quoted as saying in the foreign ministry statement after the G20 special session.China has strongly criticised the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and have maintained close and frequent communication with the Taliban, which is now in power.It was one of the first countries to announce a 200 million yuan ($31million) aid for Afghanistan in September, and it has urged the international community, particularly the US, to provide assistance to Kabul.Beijing has also said that while it encourages Kabul to form an inclusive government and cut ties with terrorists, especially the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), it will not interfere in its domestic affairs.In late July, Wang had told a visiting Taliban delegation that it hopes the insurgent group will play a critical role in the reconstruction process of Afghanistan and had urged the insurgent group to crackdown on ETIM, an Islamic group it alleges is fuelling separatism in Xinjiang.In his speech on Tuesday, Wang said, “Today’s Afghanistan is at the crossroads of the rise and fall of governance, and there is still a long way to go to achieve peace and stability.”Wang urged G20 members to contribute to the peaceful development of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan on the basis of respect for its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.The virtual meeting was hosted by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the rotating president of the G20. US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Europe’s G20 leaders also took part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-talks-china-moots-tough-approach-to-terror-in-taliban-run-afghanistan-101634130520050.html

In a year, an estimate of 22,000 girls are losing their lives as a result of pregnancies and childbirth after an early marriage, the report further said.West and Central Africa accounted for nearly half (9,600) of all estimated child marriage-related deaths worldwide, according to the study. The region also has the highest rate of child marriages in the world and the highest teenage maternal mortality rate.In the South Asian region, at least 2,000, an estimate of six a day, child marriage-related deaths are taking place annually, the report found.South Asia is followed by East Asia and Pacific with 650 deaths and Latin America and the Caribbean with 560 annual deaths.worl.In the report, the organisation said the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the progress made against the practice of child marriage across the world. The virus pushed millions of people into poverty, which has eventually led to higher cases of violence against women. "A further 10 million girls are now expected to marry by 2030, leaving more girls at a risk of dying," the report further read."Childbirth is the number one killer of teenage girls because their young bodies aren't ready to bear children," said Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International.He urged governments around the world to focus on girls and bring norms to protect them from child marriage and premature child-births.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-marriage-killing-over-60-girls-a-day-worldwide-finds-study-101634119925245.html

13-10-2021||World||Billionaire Alibaba founder Jack Ma reappears in Hong Kong: Report||Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma, largely out of public view since a regulatory clampdown started on his business empire late last year, is currently in Hong Kong and has met business associates in recent days, two sources told Reuters.The Chinese billionaire has been keeping a low profile since delivering a speech in October last year in Shanghai criticising China's financial regulators. That triggered a chain of events that resulted in the shelving of his Ant Group's mega IPO.While Ma made a limited number of public appearances in mainland China after that, as speculation swirled about his whereabouts, one of the sources said the visit marked his first trip to the Asian financial hub since last October.Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of its regular business hours. Comments from Ma typically come via the company.The sources declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.Ma, once China's most famous and outspoken entrepreneur, met at least "a few" business associates over meals last week, said the people.Ma, who is mostly based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, where his business empire is headquartered, owns at least one luxury house in the former British colony that also houses some of his companies' offshore business operations.Alibaba is also listed in Hong Kong, besides New York.The former English teacher disappeared from public view for three months before surfacing in January, speaking to a group of teachers by video. That eased concern about his unusual absence from the limelight and sent Alibaba shares surging.In May, Ma made a rare visit to Alibaba's Hangzhou campus during the firm's annual "Ali Day" staff and family event, company sources have said.On Sept. 1, photographs of Ma visiting several agricultural greenhouses in the eastern Zhejiang province, home to both Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant, went viral on Chinese social media.The next day, Alibaba said it would invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) by 2025 in support of "common prosperity", becoming the latest corporate giant to pledge support for the wealth sharing initiative driven by President Xi Jinping.Alibaba and its tech rivals have been the target of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on issues ranging from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights. The e-commerce behemoth was fined a record $2.75 billion in April over monopoly violations.Earlier this year, regulators also imposed a sweeping restructuring on Ant, whose botched $37 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market would have been the world's largest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billionaire-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-reappears-in-hong-kong-report-101634105306294.html

Downdetector reports brief outage for users||Twitter services went down for several users on Wednesday morning, according to the online service status tracker Downdetector. According to the tracker which analyses tens of millions of daily problem alerts, the reports from Twitter users complaining of services going down peaked around 8 this morning; however, the graph soon showed a reduction in the number of complaints indicating that the services were soon restored.As per the Twitter status report page on Downdetector, there were as many as 455 reports at 8:03am, the second such peak in a day which also had the baseline peaking with reports at around 5am. Around 52 per cent of users complaining of Twitter services going down specified the issue as relating to the Twitter website, while 38 per cent of users reported that the issue was with the Twitter app. Meanwhile, 10 per cent of users said that the Twitter snag was a result of an error in the server connection.The reported technical snag on Twitter comes days after the Facebook family of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, went dark on earlier this month for nearly six hours before services began to be gradually restored.How does Downdetector work?Downdetector, according to its official website, offers real-time status information for more than 6,000 services across 45 websites representing 45 countries. When a service provider’s customers are experiencing problems, Downdetector aggregates and analyses this data to determine the potential nature of the issue and then works to alert both the company and community of possible issues.The live outage map, which shows the ‘spikes’ in reports over time, helps users gauge the kind of response the website is getting across the world. If there are a number of spikes corresponding to the timestamps, like in the image above, it means other users too are experiencing similar problems with the website and it's not just a singular case of bad internet. Downdetector also has a daily historical view of problem reports compared to the baseline volume.As more and more users submit problem reports directly on a company status page on Downdetector, along with an indicator of the type of problem they are experiencing, the tracking service gathers data through Twitter and uses ‘sentiment analysis’ to detect issues for a given company and its location. It also looks at other key indicators from across the web to determine if an extraordinary volume of users is having issues with a monitored company or service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-down-downdetector-reports-brief-outage-for-users-101634094446412.html
13-10-2021||World||US senator asks Mark Zuckerberg to retain all records related to Facebook whistleblower testimony||Senate commerce committee chair Maria Cantwell on Tuesday called on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to preserve all documents related to testimony last week from company whistleblower Frances Haugen.“The testimony ... raises significant concerns about whether Facebook has misled the public, federal regulators, and this committee,” said Cantwell, a Democrat. “This committee will continue its oversight and work to pursue legislation to protect consumers’ privacy, improve data security, and strengthen federal enforcement to address the digital harms that are the subject of these hearings.”She asked Facebook to preserve and retain internal Facebook research referenced by Haugen and Facebook’s evaluation of the research; ranking or composition systems; experiments or recommendations to change those ranking systems and the impact of Facebook’s platforms on children and teenagers under the age of 18.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in response the company has “absolutely no commercial incentive, no moral incentive, no company-wide incentive to do anything other than to try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook.”Cantwell's letter cited “the potential danger that social media platforms pose for spreading divisive content was demonstrated, with horrifying consequences, by the role the Facebook platform played in fomenting ethnic violence against the Rohingya.”She added, “the role of Facebook’s platform in the Rohingya tragedy illustrates the horrible consequences that failing to effectively limit the spread of divisive content on social media platforms can have in inflicting public harm.”Last month, a US judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down, rejecting its argument about protecting privacy as “rich with irony.”Last week, the Commerce Committee harshly criticised Facebook, accusing Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety, and demanded regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children's mental health and stokes divisions.Zuckerberg defended the company, saying the accusations were at odds with Facebook's goals.Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them.Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-asks-mark-zuckerberg-to-retain-all-records-related-to-facebook-whistleblower-testimony-101634093666684.html
13-10-2021||World||US to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated||The US will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the country moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel, such as trade, since the earliest days of the pandemic. The new rules, to be announced Wednesday, will allow fully vaccinated foreign nationals to enter the U.S. regardless of the reason for travel starting in early November, when a similar easing of restrictions is set to kick in for air travel into the country. By mid-January, even essential travelers seeking to enter the U.S., like truck drivers, will need to be fully vaccinated.Senior administration officials previewed the new policy late Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to speak ahead of the formal announcement.Both Mexico and Canada have pressed the U.S. for months to ease restrictions on travel that have separated families and curtailed leisure trips since the onset of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month's announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel, and instead require vaccination for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.Both policies will take effect in early November, the officials said. They did not specify a particular date.The new rules only apply to legal entry to the U.S. Officials cautioned that those seeking to enter illegally will still be subject to expulsion under so-called Title 42 authority, first invoked by former President Donald Trump, that has drawn criticism from immigration advocates for swiftly removing migrants before they can seek asylum. One of the officials said the U.S. was continuing the policy because cramped conditions in border patrol facilities pose a COVID-19 threat.According to the officials, travelers entering the U.S. by vehicle, rail and ferry will be asked about their vaccination status as part of the standard U.S. Customs and Border Protection admissions process. At officers' discretion, travelers will have their proof of vaccination verified in a secondary screening process.Unlike air travel, for which proof of a negative Covid-19 test is required before boarding a flight to enter the U.S., no testing will be required to enter the U.S. by land or sea, provided the travelers meet the vaccination requirement.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. will accept travelers who have been fully vaccinated with any of the vaccines approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, not just those in use in the U.S. That means that the AstraZeneca vaccine, widely used in Canada, will be accepted.Officials said the CDC was still working to formalize procedures for admitting those who received doses of two different vaccines, as was fairly common in Canada.The delay in the vaccination requirement for essential cross-border travel is meant to provide truck drivers and others with additional time to get a shot and minimize potential economic disruption from the vaccination mandate, officials said.All told, the new procedures move toward a policy based on the risk profiles of individuals, rather than less targeted country-based bans.The vaccination requirement for foreign nationals comes as the White House has moved to impose sweeping vaccination-or-testing requirements affecting as many as 100 million people in the U.S. in an effort to encourage holdouts to get shots.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Labor completed the initial draft of an emergency regulation that will require employers of 100 workers or more to demand their employees be vaccinated against Covid-19 or tested weekly. The Office of Management and Budget is now reviewing the order before its implementation.Mexico has not put in place any Covid-19 entry procedures for travelers. Canada allows entry of fully-vaccinated individuals with proof of vaccination against Covid-19 as well as proof of a negative test conducted within 72 hours of entry to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-reopen-land-borders-in-november-for-fully-vaccinated-101634093942018.html

The passenger bus reroute to Gamgadhi, the district headquarter of Mugu from Nepalgunj was carrying migrant workers and few students who were on their way home for the Dashain celebration.“The incident took place at around 12:30 in the noon and 22 people lost their lives on the spot. We have confirmation that 10 more lives have been lost, 6 hours since the incident. We are fearful that the death toll might rise further,” Jeevan Lamicchane, Inspector at Karnali province police office, told ANI over the phone.As per the official, a rescue operation was carried out in the steep terrain with help of the Nepali army and their chopper along with a private airlines flight was used to rescue the injured ones who were in critical condition. “The bus seems to have gone off the road down the cliff to about 300 meters. We have speculated brake failure to be the reason behind it. We still are continuing our operation,” Rom Bahadur Mahat, chief district officer of Mugu informed.A total of 39 people were on board the bus. Tuesday's incident is the first major accident in the most inaccessible district of Nepal had to face after it got connected to the national highway about a decade ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-at-least-32-dead-in-road-mishap-toll-likely-to-rise-101634093195333.html
13-10-2021||World||From makeup to shampoo: Widely-used chemical linked to 100,000 US deaths a year||Daily exposure to phthalates, a group of chemicals used in everything from plastic containers to makeup, may lead to approximately 100,000 deaths in older Americans annually, a study from New York University warned Tuesday. The chemicals, which can be found in hundreds of products such as toys, clothing, and shampoo, have been known for decades to be "hormone disruptors," affecting a person's endocrine system. The toxins can enter the body through such items and are linked to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, said the study published in the journal Environmental Pollution.The research, which was carried out by New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and includes some 5,000 adults aged 55 to 64, shows that those with higher concentrations of phthalates in their urine were more likely to die of heart disease.However, higher concentrations did not appear to increase the risk of death by cancer."Our findings reveal that increased phthalate exposure is linked to early death, particularly due to heart disease," said study lead author Leonardo Trasande."Until now, we have understood that the chemicals connect to heart disease, and heart disease, in turn, is a leading cause of death, but we had not yet tied the chemicals themselves to death."Trasande cautioned, however, that the study does not establish a direct cause and effect relationship between phthalate exposure and death, in part because the specific biological mechanisms of that relationship are unclear."Our research suggests that the toll of this chemical on society is much greater than we first thought," Trasande said, adding that it "is undeniably clear that limiting exposure to toxic phthalates can help safeguard Americans' physical and financial wellbeing."Other studies have already linked phthalates to more than 10,000 deaths per year associated with reduced testosterone levels in adult men.The study added that the economic loss due to phthalates is between $40 billion and $47 billion -- more than four times what was previously estimated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-makeup-to-shampoo-widely-used-chemical-linked-to-100-000-us-deaths-a-year-101634091847135.html
13-10-2021||World||US hopes Abraham Accords will help Israeli-Palestinian issue: Officials||The United States is working to expand normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab nations, known as the Abraham Accords, and hopes restoring such ties can be leveraged to advance progress on the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, senior State Department officials said on Tuesday.In a briefing with reporters previewing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meetings on Wednesday with his Israeli and Emirati counterparts, officials repeated that the Abraham Accords were not a substitute for the two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians."We continue to welcome the economic cooperation between Israel and all countries in the region. We hope that normalisation can be leveraged to advance progress on the Israeli-Palestinian tracks," a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity said.Blinken will first meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and United Arab Emirates Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan separately at the State Department on Wednesday. He will then host a trilateral meeting with both of them, the first of its kind.The leaders of Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed the Abraham Accords at the White House last September. The following month, Israel and Sudan announced they would normalize relations, and Morocco established diplomatic ties with Israel in December, after U.S. President Joe Biden defeated his predecessor Donald Trump in the election.Palestinian officials said they felt betrayed by their Arab brethren for reaching deals with Israel without first demanding progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state. Until last year, only two Arab states - Egypt and Jordan - had forged full ties with Israel.The U.S. officials did not say precisely how Washington aimed to use the normalisation agreements as a tool to make progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue."Biden administration has started out with a clear commitment to the two-state solution. We continue on with that commitment. We seek to advance as we can, when we can, as best we can," one of the U.S. officials said.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a nationalist atop a cross-partisan coalition, opposes Palestinian statehood.The three countries will also be setting up two new working groups at the meeting, U.S. officials said, with one group focusing on religious coexistence and the other on water and energy issues."These working groups will seek to realise that promise to link up to important U.S. partners in the region and find new ways to solve old problems together, in Israel and the UAE but also across the region," one of the U.S. officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopes-abraham-accords-will-help-israeli-palestinian-issue-officials-101634091441035.html
13-10-2021||World||Pakistan: Things tense between Imran Khan and army chief? Govt says no conflict||The Pakistan government on Tuesday maintained that there is no conflict between prime minister Imran Khan and General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the influential chief of the country's armed forces, over the recent appointment of Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the new director-general of the notorious Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the top spy agency of Pakistan. The buzz over differences in opinion between prime minister Khan and the Pakistani army chief originated last week after the appointment of Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the ISI chief was announced. No relevant notification was issued by Imran Khan's office, which led to renewed speculations about a conflict between the civilian government and the army.Also Read | Who is Lieutenant general Nadeem Anjum, replacing Faiz Hameed as new ISI chief?For context, Pakistan's law states that the prime minister has the right and prerogative to appoint the ISI chief in consultation with the army chief. Pointing this out, the country's information minister Fawad Chaudhry said during a press conference last week that prime minister Imran Khan and army chief Bajwa discussed the matter in a “long sitting” and the premier had subsequently taken the Cabinet into confidence over the issue.However, Pakistani media publications indicate that things may not have gone as smoothly as Chaudhry claims. According to reports, Bajwa made it clear to Khan that the prime minister should not exceed his brief by interfering in military matters and that Lt General Faiz Hameed, who Khan wanted to retain as the ISI chief, could be given an extension till November 15 but not beyond that date. Senior Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi said on a TV show that the prime minister's stance on the issue has resulted in a standoff, and this is the reason why a notification has still not been issued by his office.Also Read | Former DG (ISI) could succeed Gen Bajwa as Pakistan Army ChiefIt was first reported by Hindustan Times on October 7 that Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the former chief of Pak ISI, is in the reckoning to succeed General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who used to be his senior at the Baloch regiment, as the next chief of the Pakistani armed forces. The former spymaster is now the Peshawar Corps commander, a move which Pakistan watchers say was carefully crafted to build up towards Hameed's future position as the army chief, a mandatory requirement being the experience commanding a Corps level formation for at least one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-things-tense-between-imran-khan-and-army-chief-govt-says-no-conflict-101634087936421.html

London ambulance crews took a woman and a child to the hospital for treatment.“Crews were faced with a lot of smoke issuing from the top of a block of flats on arrival," station commander Pete Johnson said. “There was also lots of visible flame, which has prompted a high number of calls to our control officers."Photos from the scene showed flames from the top of the building and a dark plume of smoke drifting into the sky.“I heard a bang and glass smashing. I went out and saw there was glass on the floor. Then I heard a bang and looked up and saw fire," student Ishika Deb, who lives in a neighboring apartment building, told reporters.The fire brigade said the cause of the blaze was not yet known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-erupts-on-20th-floor-of-london-high-rise-injuring-2-101634087494847.html
13-10-2021||World||Finance ministers of G20 nations to meet today in Washington||The finance ministers of G20 (Group of 20) nations are all set to meet on Wednesday in the capital city of the United States, Washington DC, to discuss matters related to the international economy and global health, specifically focusing on efforts geared towards the promotion of more sustainable growth. The ministers will be joined by central bank governors as part of the meeting known as the annual G20 finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBGs) meet.According to an official statement issued by G20, the Wednesday meeting will be held as part of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank Group (WBG) annual meetings. In the third FMCBG meet held in Venice three months ago (the first such in-person finance track meeting since February 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic), the ministers and the governors discussed international taxation matters and financial sector issues.In the fourth FMCBG meeting, the G20 ministers and the central bank governors are slated to discuss the Covid-19 global recovery, thanks to the vaccines against the coronavirus disease, but with a special focus on how recuperation still remains uneven across and even within several countries. According to the agenda of the meeting issued beforehand, the ministers and governors will exchange views on how to continue to sustain the economic recovery and address the adverse consequences of the pandemic, especially on the most impacted groups of the society.This takes special significance since the last FMCBG meeting had seen the ministers and governors have a “very fruitful exchange of views” on the support to the most vulnerable countries. To help countries in critical conditions, the meet is expected to discuss ways to channel a share of the special drawing rights (SDRs) of the $650 billion allocated by the IMF for this purpose. “Exchange of views will also continue on the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and the International Development Association replenishment,” the G20 statement added.Moreover, climate change is also likely to take up an important spot in today's G20 FMCBG meet. Following up on the previous session's commitment to “promote transitions towards greener, more prosperous and inclusive economies and societies”, the dignitaries attending the meet will decide on ways to synergise and build an effective policy mix to move towards carbon-neutral economies. “In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the membership is expected to endorse the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which has been prepared by the Sustainable Finance Working Group,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finance-ministers-of-g20-nations-to-meet-today-in-washington-101634085149217.html
13-10-2021||World||US: 3 dead, including gunman, after postal service worker opens fire at facility||Two US postal service workers were fatally shot Tuesday at a postal facility in Memphis and a third employee identified as the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. It was the third high-profile shooting in or near that west Tennessee city in weeks. US postal inspector Susan Link said the three postal workers were found dead after the shooting at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in a prominent Memphis neighborhood. FBI spokeswoman Lisa-Anne Culp said the shooting was carried out by a third postal service worker, who shot him or herself.No identities or motives were released by Link or Culp at a brief news conference late Tuesday afternoon.The shooting occurred at a post office facility in the historic Orange Mound neighborhood, southeast of downtown Memphis. The carrier annex is only used by employees.The street leading to the complex was blocked by police Tuesday afternoon following the shooting, and the FBI, the US Postal Inspection Service, and other federal authorities went to investigate. Bystanders watching the police activity talked near a convenience store at an intersection. Nearby, officers had blocked the street with yellow crime scene tape and barricades. Some cars slowed down as they drove past police and reporters.A white four-door car was towed from the scene, but it was not clear who it belonged to.“The Postal Service is saddened at the events that took place today in Memphis," USPS said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with the family members, friends, and coworkers of the individuals involved. The Postal Service will be providing resources to all employees at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in the coming days and weeks.”The violence follows other shootings in the Memphis area in recent weeks. The franchise owner of a sushi counter inside a Kroger grocery store in the suburb of Collierville fatally shot one person and wounded 14 others before killing himself on Sept. 23, investigators said. A week later, a teenage boy was shot and critically wounded inside a Memphis school and police detained a second boy believed to be the shooter.US Rep. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat, called the post office “the latest site of gun violence” in the Memphis area.“Today’s shooting at the postal facility in Orange Mound is yet another example of why I am concerned that too many guns are out there and in possession of people who aren’t able to control their anger,” Cohen said in a statement. "I express my profound condolences to all those affected by this terrible event.”Tuesday's incident comes 11 years after another fatal post office shooting in West Tennessee. On October 18, 2010, two mail workers were fatally shot during a robbery at a post office in the rural town of Henning, located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Memphis. That post office was named in honor of slain employees Paula Robinson and Judy Spray last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-3-dead-including-gunman-after-postal-service-worker-opens-fire-at-facility-101634084280734.html

Italy currently holds the rotational presidency of the group. The regular summit of G20 leaders is scheduled for later this month in Rome.“The leaders discussed the critical need to maintain a laser focus on our enduring counterterrorism efforts, including against threats from ISIS-K (another name for IS-K), and ensuring safe passage for those foreign nationals and Afghan partners with documentation seeking to depart Afghanistan,” the White House said.The leaders also “reaffirmed their collective commitment to provide humanitarian assistance directly to the Afghan people through independent international organisations”, and to promote fundamental human rights for all Afghans, including women, girls and members of minority groups.The White House further said that the US “remains committed to working closely with the international community and using diplomatic, humanitarian and economic means to address the situation in Afghanistan and support the Afghan people”.The White House readout did not give details of the American president’s own remarks at the G20 meeting.Biden’s decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan in August paved the way for the Taliban to return to power, jeopardising the gains of the past 20 years, especially rights of women and minorities.The US president has faced severe criticism from allies at home and around the world for having abandoned Afghanistan in a move that has been seen as being driven by domestic political expediency.UN chief: Afghans face ‘make-or-break moment’Warning that Afghanistan is facing “a make-or-break moment”, the UN chief has urged the world to prevent the country’s economy from collapsing. Secretary-general Antonio Guterres also appealed to the Taliban to stop breaking its promises to allow women to work and girls to have access to all levels of education.He said the UN is urgently appealing to various governments to inject cash into Afghanistan’s battered economy.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-leaders-seek-laser-focus-on-afghanistan-terror-crackdown-101634064391066.html

The White House readout did not give details of American President Joe Biden’s own remarks at the G20 meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-leaders-call-for-laser-focus-on-counterterror-at-summit-on-afghanistan-101634063419602.html
13-10-2021||India||Pawar takes dig at Fadnavis over ‘i still feel like CM’ statement||In a dig at senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, who had said that he still feels as chief minister of Maharashtra, NCP president Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said he lacked this trait even though he had served as CM for four times.  Fadnavis on Tuesday said that because of the people’s love, he did not feel that he had ceased to be the chief minister. “It’s good that the BJP leader still considers himself as the chief minister. I congratulate him. After being the chief minister for five years, Fadnavis still feels he is holding the post. I lacked this trait. I had served as chief minister (of Maharashtra) four times. But I don’t even remember,” Pawar said.He also referred to Fadnavis’ famous “Me Punha Yein” (I will return) slogan which had become popular before the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections. The slogan had become a subject of ridicule and inspired many mock-filled messages and WhatsApp memes taking a dig at the BJP leader. Fadnavis, while speaking at an event in Navi Mumbai, had said that the people of Maharashtra never made me feel that I am not the chief minister. “I still feel that I am chief minister as I have been roaming in the state over the last two years. The love and affection of people have not receded,” he had said.Fadnavis became the chief minister of Maharashtra after the 2014 elections and went on to complete a full term, something which no chief minister of the state had managed in the previous three decades. After the Shiv Sena walked out of the alliance with the BJP after the 2019 polls, he forged a tie-up with a breakaway group of NCP MLAs led by Ajit Pawar and was sworn in as chief minister with Pawar as his deputy. But this government lasted only for three days for want of the numbers and was replaced by an alliance of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, headed by Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-takes-dig-at-fadnavis-over-i-still-feel-like-cm-statement-101634149542750.html

13-10-2021||India||Four charts which sum up India’s inflation story||Retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 4.35% in September 2021. Between May and September, inflation has come down by 195 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. While that’s a reason for cheer, a disaggregated analysis shows that the actual inflation picture is slightly more complicated than what the headline numbers suggest. Here are four charts which explain this.Food inflation has crashed, but non-food prices are still elevated39% of India’s CPI basket is food items. This means that food prices play a major role in driving the headline inflation number. The latest deceleration in prices is primarily on account of food prices. Food inflation has come down from 5.15% in June 2021 to 0.68% in September 2021. The latest food inflation figure is the lowest since March 2019, when it grew at 0.3%. Non-food inflation has been hovering around the 7% mark during this period.Food prices are not decelerating across the boardJust two sub-categories of food, cereals and vegetables, account for 40% of the CPI food-basket. These two items also account for almost half of India’s agricultural production. Recent inflationary trends display an unprecedented trend of disinflation in cereal prices, which has been happening every month since February. To be sure, disinflation in vegetable prices has been underway since December 2020, but vegetable prices have fallen even earlier. Inflation in edible oil category continues to be very high. If one were to exclude cereal and vegetable prices from the food category, India is at a unique phase as far as the current CPI series is concerned, as prices of other food items have remained sticky at high levels.What is the impact of petrol-diesel prices on inflation?Petrol-diesel prices are at a record high in India. This is not because crude oil prices are at their highest ever levels, but on account of taxes. What is the role of fuel inflation in the current inflationary situation? The answer is slightly complicated. Anecdotal accounts suggest that at least some businesses have been finding it difficult to pass on the higher fuel costs to consumers, as weak demand conditions continue to persist. For example, a Bloomberg Quint story published on October 8 says that freight prices (trucks) have been lagging despite an increase in the price of diesel. A look at inflation data lends support to the hypothesis of weak demand conditions muting a cascading effect of fuel prices. While fuel inflation is at an all-time high in India, the headline CPI number is significantly lower and the gap between the two is very high by historical standards.But cost pressures could increase going forwardThis is likely on account of two reasons. One, international prices, especially for energy-related commodities have shown a renewed momentum. The Bloomberg Commodity Index crossed 100 in the last week of September 2021, the first time it has done this since 2015, and continues to stay at those levels. Prices of crucial inputs such as coal and crude oil have risen and are expected to rise further as energy consumption in many developed countries soars in the winters.Also, the favourable base effect – higher inflation a year ago – will dissipate from the October-December quarter. This is one of the reasons RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee expects inflation to start increasing from the December quarter onwards. In its latest forecast (October 8) MPC projected inflation to be 5.1% in the September quarter, 4.5% in the December quarter and 5.8% in the quarter ending March 2022.In her research note dated October 5, Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Pvt Limited underlined this possibility.“The fall in inflation over the next three months will be base effects-driven. We worry about high energy prices and cost-push inflation. We also worry about inequality-driven inflation as large companies gain pricing power. Cost adjustments around the world are leading to unpredictable inflationary pressures, which need to be monitored, especially in the face of already elevated core inflation”, the note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-charts-which-sum-up-india-s-inflation-story-101634144261159.html
13-10-2021||India||Chhattisgarh march against Hasdeo mines reaches Raipur, gets Singhdeo support||RAIPUR: Ten days after they began their 300-kilometre march from Madanpur village in north Chhattisgarh, more than 200 tribals and villagers from the Hasdeo Aranya area in Korba reached state capital Raipur on Wednesday to demand cancellation of coal mining projects in the ecologically sensitive region, and land acquisition orders that do not have the legitimate gram sabha’s consent. The protesters are scheduled to meet governor Anusuya Uike on Thursday and have sought an appointment with chief minister Bhupesh Baghel as well. There was no word till late Wednesday evening if the chief minister’s office has scheduled a meeting with the protesters. Chief minister Baghel has said he is open for talks.On Wednesday evening, they, however, met health minister TS Singh Deo who extended his support.“Coal mining is deadly in the wake of environmental conditions and it is the need of the hour to switch to renewable energy… Hasdeo was a no-go zone in the UPA era and its status should be reinstated,” Deo said.“We are demanding immediate cancellation of all coal mining projects in Hasdeo Aranya region and all land acquisition proceedings carried under Coal Bearing-Areas Act 1957 without taking prior consent from the gram sabhas be immediately withdrawn,” said Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan convenor Alok Shukla, who also was part of the march.Shukla said that the villagers also want environment and forest clearance granted to Parsa coal block to be cancelled and a case is registered against company officials for allegedly forging the gram sabha’s consent.The villagers also demanded the implementation of “free prior informed consent” from gram sabhas before land acquisition and allocation of any mining or other projects in the Hasdeo area, and restoration of the community forest rights title of Ghatbarra village in Surguja district which was cancelled in 2016. “We are here to meet the chief minister and will put our demands in front of him. We don’t want to lose our forests and the Constitution has given us the right to protect them... We will not leave the capital until our demands are met… Till now chief minister has not given us time but we hope we will meet him tomorrow or the day after,” said Muneshwar Porte, a resident of Fatehpur village. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said: “Those who want to talk… we are doing it with them. But so far, they have not offered to meet us. You (media persons) are asking this. Doors are open for everyone who wants to meet. Talks only can resolve the problems”, the chief minister said.Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest contiguous stretches of very dense forest in central India spanning 170,000 hectares. It also has 23 coal blocks.In 2009, the Union environment ministry proposed to categorize Hasdeo Arand to be a “No-Go” zone for mining because of its rich forest cover but opened it again to mining because the policy hadn’t been finalized.Elephants have a significant presence in forests of this region throughout the year and is an important part of a large migratory corridor. The Hasdeo Aranya forest is also the catchment of Hasdeo River, Mahanadi’s largest tributary, which is critical for perennial river flow. It is also the watershed of Hasdeo Bango reservoir and thus critical for irrigation of 3 lakh hectare double-cropped land in the “rice-bowl” state of Chhattisgarh. Multiple Government and independent scientific reports have documented the ecological importance of the region and underlined the urgent need to conserve it.According to a statement by Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, around 20 village bodies have been regularly passing resolutions under Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act 1996 and Forest Right Act 2006 (FRA), since 2014 articulating their opposition to any mining in the region.These laws, PESA Act 1996 and FRA 2006, not only ensure that the gram sabha’s consent is necessary for any forest diversion but also places the onus of resource conservation on them.“Given the strong resistance from gram sabhas, the government is now circumventing the need for “gram sabha consent” before the start of mining. The government has argued that consent is not required under Coal Bearing Areas Act and has thus issued notifications for the acquisition of land for Madanpur South, Gidhmudi Paturiya, Kete Extension and Parsa even before any clearance or consultations. For the Parsa coal block, the forest clearance has been issued based on some forged consent/letter based on wide collusion of district administration with the company,” the non-profit alleged in the statement.The Chhattisgarh forest ministry on Wednesday said the forest department notified 1,995 sq km area as Lemru Elephant Reserve which includes 15 coal blocks of Hasdeo Arrand Area. “Moreover, the Biodiversity Assessment Study report for the whole Hasdeo Arrand region has been sent to the state government for consideration which if accepted, would completely prohibit mining in 14 coal blocks of the Hasdeo Arrand Area,” the department said in a written response to HT on the demand of Hasdeo residents for cancellation of mining projects said.On the demand for cancellation of environmental and forest clearances of Parsa coal block, the forest department clarified that stage I forest clearance of the coal block has been granted by the central government but the stage II clearance is still under consideration which shall be decided once the Biodiversity Assessment Study report is finalised.The biodiversity study for the Hasdeo Arand coalfield, conducted by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education in consultation with the Wildlife Institute of India to assess the floral and faunal biodiversity of coalfield has proposed to recommend against clearing 14 of the 23 coal blocks to conserve the relatively dense moist-dry deciduous sal dominated forest tracts that provide home forest for elephants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarhs-300km-march-against-hasdeo-mines-reaches-raipur-gets-singhdeo-support-101634143601380.html

He highlighted that TN was the first state to inoculate pregnant women after the Centre said they were eligible for vaccinations. More than 500,000 pregnant women have been administered the vaccine, he also said.Also read | 5th Covid-19 vaccine camp underway in Tamil Nadu as state aims to achieve 70% first dose inoculation by OctoberThe minister’s remarks came a day after the subject experts committee (SEC) on Tuesday, recommended the use of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on those in the two to 18 age group, HT had previously reported. However, an approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) is required for the vaccine to be administered in children.If approved by the DCGI, Covaxin would become the first vaccine for children under 12 years of age. Earlier, Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D was given approval for people aged 12 and above, but the vaccine is yet to be included in the country’s immunisation drive.Meanwhile, Subramanian lauded the Coimbatore district in the state for immunising 93% of its population with at least one dose and 37% of its population fully. The minister also said that five mobile vans were launched on the day, in five zones in the Coimbatore city, to help reach 100% vaccinations by door-to-door service.Recently on Sunday (October 10), TN concluded its fifth mega vaccination camp, a method the state has adopted to boost Covid-19 vaccination rate in the state and also to create awareness about the vaccine. In the preceding four Sundays, four such camps were conducted in the state.On Wednesday, 1,280 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu as the total confirmed infections reached 2,682,137 while 19 more people lost their lives as the death toll climbed to 35,833, a bulletin from the state health department showed. As many as 52,379,870 doses of the vaccine have been administered in the state till 7am on the day, the Union health ministry’s data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-health-minister-says-state-set-to-become-first-in-country-to-administer-covid-19-vaccines-to-children-above-2-years-101634142661223.html

Apart from the major success in the form of top Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander Shamim Ahmed Sofi’ killing, eight other terrorists: Aqib Bashir Kumar; Imtiyaz Ahmad Dar; Yawar Gani Dar; Danish Hussain Dar; Yawar Hassan Naikoo; Mukhtar Ahmad Shah; Khubaib Ahmad Nengroo; and Ubaid Ahmad Dar have been neutralised so far.The intensification of counter-terrorist operations comes after Union home minister Amit Shah on October 7 directed the security forces and intelligence agencies to neutralise the threat from Pakistan-based terrorist groups in Kashmir. Shah pitched for firm action as the Hindu and Sikh killings in Kashmir were designed to spread terror within minority communities who wanted to come back to the Valley after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35 A.The security agencies have identified their affiliations either with Pakistan-based JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba, or local terror modules like Hizbul Mujahideen and The Resistance Front, both backed by Pakistani terror groups.Also Read | With Shameen Sofi killing, Pulwama massacre heads for closureDanish Hussain Dar, who was a close friend of active militants Afaq Sikander Lone and Ubaid Ahmad Dar, disappeared on June 20, 2021, weeks before the targeted killings started in the Valley. He was affiliated with LeT. Dar had fired upon a civilian at Chatergam Shopian in which the person got critically injured.Aqib Bashir Kumar, a local terrorist affiliated with Hizbul Mujahideen, was killed in Srinagar’s Natipora locality last week. Aqib Bashir Kumar left his home in November 2020 and didn’t return back, prompting his parents to lodge a missing report two days later. The Hizbul terrorist was involved in a grenade attack on a CRPF party at Chanpora in which personnel and one civilian were critically injured. He was also involved in motivating the Kashmiri youth to join ranks in the terror outfit.Initially a stone pelter, Yawar Hassan Naikoo was arrested in 2015 and was released after 15 days in detention. He went missing in December 2020 after which his father lodged a report with Shopian police. Reports suggest that Naikoo was motivated by local terrorists and managed his induction in Hizbul Mujahideen. He was killed in Shopian on Tuesday.Ubaid Ahmad Dar, a TRF recruit, was said to be a close friend of Aafaq Sikander Lone who took the path of militancy in December last year. He disappeared in February this year and joined the LeT offshoot. Accused of attacking a police party at Manzgam area of Kulgam in which two police personnel got critically injured, Dar was also neutralised on Tuesday in at Ferripora Shopian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-intensifies-ct-ops-in-kashmir-9-terrorists-killed-in-six-days-101634142173627.html

The three new fighter jets will increase the count of Rafale jets to 29 out of the total 36 India had ordered as part of the ₹60,000 crore deal inked in 2016.Three Rafale jets were provided mid-air refueling over the Middle East by a friendly Air Force. They will be landing at the Jamnagar air base, government sources told ANI. These Rafales are the first to be coming from France since Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari took over as the Chief of Air Staff earlier this month.The planes coming from France would be distributed between the Golden Arrows squadron in Ambala and the 101 squadron in Hashimara, West Bengal.The Centre had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around ₹58,000 crore. The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29 last year.The next three Rafale jets are set to reach India by the first half of December and they would be joining the operational squadrons by January 26. The 36th and final Rafale would, according to the plan, include special enhancements that would make it more lethal and capable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-more-rafale-fighters-arriving-from-france-to-land-in-gujarat-s-jamnagar-tonight-101634138299572.html

I urge the Union Home Minister @AmitShah to immediately rollback this irrational decision," the CM wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.I strongly condemn the GoI's unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within 50 KM belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on the federalism. I urge the Union Home Minister @AmitShah to immediately rollback this irrational decision.However, Amarinder Singh, who had to resign as the Punjab CM amid heightened tension within the Congress and led to Channi’s elevation as the chief minister, said the BSF’s enhanced presence “will only make us stronger”."Our soldiers are being killed in Kashmir. We're seeing more and more weapons and drugs being pushed by Pakistan-backed terrorists into Punjab. BSF's enhanced presence and powers will only make us stronger. Let's not drag central armed forces into politics," the captain tweeted.According to an ANI report, a fresh order issued earlier this week which authorised the BSF that could take action only upto 15km inside Punjab, Bengal and Assam, to spread its jurisdiction up to 50 km without any hurdle or further permission either from central or state governments.Its jurisdiction has, however, been cut short by 20km in the five northeastern states of Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya -- where it had jurisdiction up to 80 km. In Gujarat, the BSF can freely take action till only 50 km within the state from its earlier jurisdiction of 80km. In Rajasthan, the BSF's area of jurisdiction will remain the same at 50 km.An officer of the rank corresponding to that of the lowest rank of member of the BSF is now empowered under the CrPC to exercise and discharge the powers and duties without an order from a magistrate and without a warrant.A News18 report said the BSF issued a statement hours later saying the step had been taken to “give uniformity to jurisdiction". “The amendment effected on October 11, 2021, establishes uniformity in defining the area within which Border Security Force can operate as per its charter of duties and execution of its role and task of border guarding in its areas of deployment."“This will also enable improved operational effectiveness in curbing trans-border crime and to an extent of 50 km from the international boundary within the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, West Bengal and Assam, running along the borders of India. Earlier, the limit was fixed to 80 km in case of Gujarat and 15 km in case of Rajasthan, Punjab, West Bengal and Assam," the force said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-raises-bsf-s-area-of-jurisdiction-punjab-cm-wants-decision-rolled-back-101634139410246.html

13-10-2021||India||Growing realisation in US on India’s compulsions for S-400 air defence deal||With Russia on course to supply the first batch ofS-400 air defence systems to India within the next two months, the Indian side believes there is greater understanding in Washington about New Delhi’s compulsions for the $5.4-billion deal. Despite US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman describing the S-400 as “dangerous” and saying during her recent visit to New Delhi that the deal is not in India’s security interest, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there is growing realisation on the American side about why India opted for the weapon system to complete an air defence shield for key cities and installations. The people said recent contacts between the Indian and American sides had indicated that India couldn’t be put in the same category as Turkey, which has been slapped with secondary sanctions for buying the S-400 under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). “The American side has shown understanding of India’s compulsions for acquiring the S-400, including the threat emanating from China,” said a person who declined to be named so that he could discuss sensitive issues. “If the aim of the US is to work with partners such as India to counter China’s aggressive behaviour across the region, slapping sanctions on a key system needed for the country’s defence is not the best way to about things,” the person added. The Indian side also believes too much US pressure on Russia at this juncture would only force Moscow into a tighter embrace with Beijing. The people noted that Sherman, in her public remarks in New Delhi, had held out the possibility of resolving problems related to the S-400 deal through discussions. She told reporters that the US wants to “be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems”. The external affairs ministry said last week the Indian side had explained its perspective to the US during recent discussions on the S-400 deal. Russia has described possible sanctions under CAATSA as an “illegal tool of unfair competition”. People familiar with the latest developments on the Russian side said Moscow is on course to deliver the first batch of S-400 systems within the next two months. “The issue is very much decided and the deal is progressing according to schedule. It is in the national interests of both India and Russia. This is part of the strategic cooperation between the two countries and there will be no change in the schedule,” a second person said. The people said several teams of Indian Air Force personnel had already been trained in Russia to operate the S-400, and pointed out that the system is a defensive and not an offensive weapon. India and Russia signed the deal for five S-400 systems in October 2018, and all deliveries were to be completed in a five-year period. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, noted it would be difficult for the US to put India and Turkey in the same category when it came to the S-400 system. “The reasons for Turkey buying the S-400 were different – it is a NATO all that was seeking to diversify defence imports away from the US. On the other hand, India has become much closer to the US in terms of defence purchases over the last 10 years and the S-400 contract was the only big ticket deal with Russia in that period,” he said. “The US has to take a strategic view of the Indian deal and not see it from the narrow view of countering Russia. At this juncture, if the US penalises India for the S-400 deal, it will be seen as an unreliable partner, especially after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the AUKUS deal, which riled France, another NATO ally,” Patil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/growing-realisation-in-us-on-india-s-compulsions-for-s-400-air-defence-deal-101634136280468.html

13-10-2021||India||India set to achieve administration of 100 crore vaccine doses by October end||Before the end of the third week of October, India would have achieved the target of administering 100 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine; and will take stock of the pending population to cover, before embarking on export of stocks to other countries, a senior government official said on Wednesday. The pace of vaccination has picked up as the country prepares for a possible third wave. The government is also keen on speeding up the vaccination drive ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in seven states as it wants to showcase the inoculation programme against Covid-19 as an achievement of the Narendra Modi government. On Tuesday, the emergency use of Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine for the 2 to 18 age-group was also approved.“As on date, 73% of the total population has been given at least a single dose of the vaccine; close to 30% have received both doses and we are following up with states to increase the vaccine administration. There are 8 crore doses kept ready for use by the states,” said the official quoted above. As per Union government data, India has administered over 95.89 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. To a question on whether the Union government has identified any state that is still lagging in vaccination, the official said more or less all the states have inoculated about 60% of their population, but without citing numbers said the percentage of vaccinated people is lower in the tribal areas. “There is no shortage of vaccines, it has however been noticed worldwide that there tends to be a saturation once 70% of the population is covered. So efforts are on to cover the remaining the population and counter any vaccine hesitancy. As for the availability of vaccines, the production for October alone is about 28 crore doses. Of this 22 crore doses are of Covishield, 6 crore of Covaxin and 60 lakh of the DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D),” the official said. To a separate question on how the government plans to counter the bar on travellers inoculated with Covaxin which is awaiting clearances from the World Health Organisation and is not recognised by countries such as Canada, Australia and the U.K., the official said, “While we are awaiting clearances (from the World Health Organisation) we are also working on country-to-country mutual agreements for waiving the restrictions. So far about 15-16 counties including Italy, are allowing travellers vaccinated with Covaxin.” Most countries, including Australia most recently, have begun considering Covishield, the Indian variant of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot, as a “recognised vaccine” for international travellers. India is also yet to take a call on administering booster doses to senior citizens healthcare workers and those with comorbidities even though the WHO recommends booster doses for the immunocompromised. “There is no expert opinion yet in India on the booster doses. The sero survey that was conducted shows a pan India prevalence of antibodies in 67% of the population and we will also be conducting a survey to study breakthrough cases,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-achieve-administration-of-100-crore-vaccine-doses-by-october-end-101634133220782.html

Meanwhile, the Special NDPS court in Mumbai has adjourned the hearing till tomorrow for further arguments."Hard drugs, bulk. Can't be for personal consumption. We have approached the MEA to find how we can find this foreign national,” Additional Solicitor General told the court.At the same time, senior advocate Amit Desai, who represented Aryan Khan in favour of the bail plea claimed that the star kid was apprehended before he even got to the cruise. "Nothing was recovered from Aryan Khan," Desai told the court.The NCB has strongly opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea saying that notwithstanding the quantity of recovery, Aryan Khan can not be given bail as the primary investigation of the agency reveals that he is part of the nexus. Aryan Khan used to procure drugs through Arbaaz Merchant and Arbaaz's sources, the NCB said terming it as an "illegal drug chain".A total of 20 people, including two Nigerian nationals, have been arrested so far in the case related to the seizure of drugs following a raid at a party on the Cordelia cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-approached-mea-to-trace-foreign-drug-peddler-in-aryan-khan-s-chats-ncb-101634126835686.html

Today only, we have supplied two million tonnes and rest of the things I will discuss after the review (of mines),” news agency PTI quoted Joshi as saying.The minister is on a two-day visit to the coal-rich states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh starting Wednesday and is scheduled to review the Gevra, Dipka and Kusmunda mines in Chhattisgarh. He is also expected to hold a meeting with Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, according to news agencies.Also read | Monsoon, shooting import bills: Big reasons why India is facing coal crisisFurther, Joshi said that the coal requirement on Wednesday was 1.1 million tonnes for power generation and the supply has already been 2 million tonnes for the day. “Today, the requirement is 1.1 million tonnes of coal for power generation and we have already supplied two million tonnes. The stock is also rising because of it. I assure that there will be no problem in meeting the supply for power generation in the country,” Joshi said.Meanwhile, Union minister of state for coal and mines Raosaheb Danve responded to reports about power plants being shut in Maharashtra due to coal shortage and said that the state government was claiming coal shortage despite having “sufficient stock".“According to their demand, states write to the Centre for the purchase of coal. Despite having sufficient coal stock, they (Maharashtra govt) are saying that they do not have coal. We have 40 million tonnes coal and 7 million tonnes coal is in power houses,” news agency ANI quoted Danve as saying.Earlier on Tuesday, Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut said that the state was facing a shortage of 3,000MW to 4,000MW of power supply, which he claimed was due to Coal India’s “unorganised functioning and lack of planning.” He also said that many power generation plants in the state were found to have “supercritical stock” with less than four days of fuel as of October 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-pralhad-joshi-says-there-will-be-no-shortage-of-coal-for-power-production-101634128868376.html

Baghel said the RSS workers are controlled from Nagpur the same way the Maoists in Chhattisgarh are being controlled by their senior cadres in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.“The way Naxals here are controlled by their leaders from Andhra Pradesh/Telangana, in the same way, RSS people here are guided from Nagpur,” ANI quoted Baghel as saying.Answering questions on Kawardha violence which took place last week, Baghel assured that there will be an “impartial investigation”. He said that RSS workers continue to work as bonded labourers. “Even now, they are not heard as everything is being controlled from Nagpur. Like the Maoist leaders are in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other states and their cadres (in Chhattisgarh) do the job of firing bullets and getting hit,” he said.The state unit of Congress had alleged the BJP and other right-wing groups were behind the violence.Earlier today, Baghel reacted to the comment by defence minister Rajnath Singh in which he had claimed that it was Mahatma Gandhi who had asked the RSS ideologue to write mercy petitions to the British.Baghel claimed Gandhi couldn’t have communicated with Savarkar since the RSS ideologue was in jail. The Chhattisgarh CM also said that Savarkar sided with Britishers after coming out of jail and propagated the two-nation theory.“Where was Mahatma Gandhi and where was Savarkar at that time? Savarkar was in jail. How could they've communicated? He filed mercy petitions from jail and continued being with Britishers. He was the first to speak of two-nation theory after coming out of jail in 1925,” he said.On Tuesday, Rajnath Singh said there had been “deliberate attempts” to defame Savarkar by spreading lies about him."Time and again, it was said that he filed mercy petitions before the British government seeking his release from jail," the Union minister said at the launch of a book titled 'Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition’."It was Mahatma Gandhi who asked him to file mercy petitions," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-the-way-naxals-baghel-s-remark-on-local-rss-workers-after-kawardha-violence-101634128242827.html
13-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan's bail application hearing adjourned for tomorrow. Here's why||The hearing of the bail plea of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan has been adjourned on Wednesday and the court will resume the hearing on Thursday as ASG Anil Kumar Singh, NCB counsel, could not finish his argument by 5.30pm on Wednesday and sought to resume his argument on Thursday 12 pm.In its reply to Aryan Khan's bail application, the Narcotics Control Bureau said its primary interrogation has revealed that Aryan Khan is part of a bigger chain notwithstanding the fact that he was not in possession of any drug at the time of the raid.  The NCB said the agency is not concerned over one person but the bail of one person can hamper the investigation. Not even on the cruise: What Aryan Khan's lawyer Amit Desai saidInstead of Satish Maneshinde, senior advocate Amit Desai argued for Aryan Khan on Wednesday. He said Aryan Khan was not even on the cruise when the agency raided the rave party. He was apprehended on his way to the party and he and Arbaaz Merchant were stopped at the gate of the party by NCB officials and were asked whether they were carrying drugs. No drug was found from Aryan Khan while Arbaaz Khan was in possession of 6 gram charas. Aryan Khan's lawyer also said that they are not peddlers, racketeers or traffickers. India as a country has moved into considering punishments as an opportunity for reforms, he said adding that the punishment for consumption was brought down from five years to one year in 2001.“They are some young kids. In many countries these substances are legal. Let us not penalise in bail. Let us not make it worse for them. They have suffered enough, they have learnt their lesson, if at all. They are not peddlers, racketeers or traffickers. We as a country have moved into a reformative state. Where earlier the punishment for consumption was five years has been brought down to one year in 2001,” Desai said. 'The argument is I was invited': says ASG Anil Singh opposing Aryan Khan's bailAppearing for the NCB, ASG Anil Singh said the quantity of the drugs recovered is immaterial as they, including Aryan Khan, are a part of a bigger nexus. Singh said Aryan and Arbaaz know each other for eight to 10 years. On that day, they met before and went to the party together. The 6 gram charas recovered from Arbaaz Merchant was for their consumption. Though Aryan Khan was not found with drugs, he was aware of the possession and he was invited to the party, ASG Singh said. The NCB in its reply to Aryan Khan's bail plea said its investigation has revealed that Aryan Khan used to procure drugs from Arbaaz and his dealers. Referring to the WhatsApp chats, ASG Singh said there was mention of ‘bulk quantity’ which must not be for personal consumption and might be for sourcing for others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-s-bail-application-hearing-adjourned-for-tomorrow-here-s-why-101634126607063.html
13-10-2021||India||Independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar extends support to TMC in Goa||An independent MLA, Prasad Gaonkar, announced that he would extend support to the Trinamool Congress, the latest entrant in Goa’s political sphere and claimed that it was only Mamata Banerjee who could ensure the defeat of the BJP in the 2024 assembly elections. Gaonkar, who is a first-time MLA representing the Sanguem constituency had begun this term by supporting the BJP, but later withdrew his support after former Goa CM Manohar Parrikar fell ill and remained an independent MLA largely supporting opposition causes during his tenure. Goankar had earlier briefly been with the Congress and a bunch of his supporters had joined the Congress largely due to the patronage of Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat. On Wednesday, however, he announced he was supporting the TMC but was not formally joining the party at least for now. “I am here to support Didi’s leadership and to strengthen it. I wish to announce that I will support her to take her leadership forward,” Gaonkar declared at a press conference in the presence of TMC MP Derek O’Brien and local unit head Luizinho Faleiro. “In 2017, I entered the assembly, but I haven’t been able to bring about change. I had supported Parrikar but the last five years have been wasted. You see what is going on around the country and in Goa, the way things are moving. We have to change this. This can only come through Didi in 2024,” Gaonkar said. Though Gaonkar didn’t formally join the party, a few of his supporters including his brother Sandesh Gaonkar joined and was welcomed into the Trinamool Congress. Prasad Gaonkar is expected to join the party closer to the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independent-mla-prasad-gaonkar-extends-support-to-tmc-in-goa-101634126559710.html

However, the minister and his son have both denied the claim that he was present at the spot during the incident.“Minister of state Ajay Mishra should resign taking the responsibility of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident of killing of farmers,” Pawar said during a press conference at the NCP office in Mumbai. Further, he also insisted that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party should “take a stand” regarding the incident and said, “neither UP CM [Yogi Adityanath] nor MoS Home [Ajay Mishra] can escape,” news agency ANI reported.Also read | Congress delegation meets President Kovind, submits memorandum on LakhimpurFurther, the NCP chief also said that the ‘Maharashtra bandh’ called by the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition in Maharashtra on Monday was “successful.”“I received telephones from Uttar Pradesh to express gratitude for the support Maharashtra extended towards the farmers and their families in UP,” Pawar said.Earlier on October 11, the MVA consisting of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress, called for a statewide bandh over the Lakhimpur incident. While there were some incidents of violence reported, the transport services remained largely operational barring occasional disturbances.The remarks came on the same day as a Congress delegation, led by party leader Rahul Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum regarding the violence. The party demanded for the resignation of Ajay Mishra and also an independent judicial probe into the matter by sitting judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court.Meanwhile, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who is currently on an official visit to the US, said that the incident was “absolutely condemnable” but said that such incidents are happening elsewhere in the country too. When asked about the violence during an event, the minister said that such incidents should be raised whenever they happen and not just from states where the BJP is in power.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-ajay-mishra-should-step-down-taking-responsibility-of-lakhimpur-kheri-incident-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-101634124551151.html

He demanded the resignation of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish Mishra has been arrested in connection with the violence.“Despite the gruesome killing, the ruling party (Bharatiya Janata Party) in Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre government tried to shrug off the responsibility. ... Ashish Mishra... was arrested only after the Supreme Court pulled up the government,” Pawar said at a press conference. He linked the income tax department’s raids on the premises of his nieces in Pune since last week with a political vendetta and said they were carried out as he likened the Lakhimpur Kheri violence to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during India’s freedom movement. He quoted unnamed central ministers telling him that their leadership has taken the comparison seriously.Also read: Cong delegation meets President Kovind, submits memorandum on Lakhimpur Pawar called the action against his nieces unprecedented. “The raids on my three nieces are on for the sixth day. The income tax teams have not found anything in the raids and the officers want to wind up the operation. But their bosses from Delhi have instructed them to continue the raids. My nieces are apolitical and have nothing to do with the sugar mills or other businesses facing action. Teams of up to 18 members are raiding the houses of my nieces who live in small houses. We are not against the action, but it should not cross the limit,” he said.Pawar questioned Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) actions during the raids on a cruise in Mumbai and the agency’s association with the people facing criminal charges. “I have heard many stories about the zonal chief of NCB during his tenure at the Mumbai airport, but I would not speak about it as I have no specific information,” said Pawar. He added questions were being raised over the agency’s association with the people like Kiran Gosavi, who is facing criminal cases and is absconding as per police records. “He is NCB’s independent witness in the drug raid case. It raises questions over the integrity of the central agency. The agency appears to take action only for the sake of publicity and to show to their bosses in Delhi and to oblige them.”Pawar said the NCP will stand with the government on the India-China border standoff, which appears to be intensifying. “We will not do any politics on the issue...”There were no immediate responses to Pawar’s comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-hits-out-at-govt-over-misuse-of-central-agencies-violence-in-lakhimpur-kheri-101634125000976.html

We reject such comments. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India. Indian leaders routinely travel to the State as they do to any other state of India,” the MEA spokesperson was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A day ago, Beijing said it was firmly opposed to Naidu’s visit to Arunachal as it had never recognised it.Naidu visited the border state in the northeast on October 9 and addressed a special session of the Assembly during which he said the visible transformation of the northeast was a clear evidence of resurgence in the region's pace of development which remained neglected for decades.China routinely objects to Indian leaders' visits to Arunachal Pradesh to buttress its stand. The India-China boundary dispute covers 3,488 km along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet.Replying to a question from the official media about Naidu's visit to Arunachal Pradesh at a media briefing here, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never recognised the state. “China’s position on the boundary issue is consistent and clear. The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh established unilaterally and illegally by the Indian side and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader's visit to the area concerned,” Zhao said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mea-says-china-objecting-to-naidu-s-visit-to-arunachal-does-not-stand-to-reason-101634122976382.html
13-10-2021||India||Kerala assembly violence: Court rejects ministers’ plea for discharge||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala’s ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), which has been trying to end a criminal case filed against lawmakers accused of violence in the assembly in 2015, suffered another setback on Wednesday when a Thiruvananthapuram judge rejected a plea. The six lawmakers include Kerala’s education minister V Sivankutty.Thiruvananthapuram’s chief judicial magistrate R Rekha on Wednesday told the accused to appear before her on November 22 when the court will frame charges against them to start the trial.In their discharge request, the six legislators claimed that they only intended to disrupt the budget speech, and sought to pin the blame for the damaged assembly furniture on the security personnel tasked to bring the situation under control.In 2015, the six were among those accused of creating ruckus in the assembly on March 13, breaking chairs, throwing microphones and standing on tables to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget.Education minister V Sivankutty and Left Front legislator KT Jaleel are among the six legislators to face charges in this case. The other four, CK Sadasivan, EP Jayarajan, K Ajith and Kunjammadu Master, are former members of the legislative assembly (MLAs).When the LDF government led by Pinarayi Vijayan came to power in the 2016 state elections, it started efforts to withdraw the case registered against the legislators. But the courts didn’t play along.The group of six faced charges under sections 447 (criminal trespass) and 427 (causing mischief) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 which is punishable with a maximum sentence of five years.In 2019, the public prosecutor filed a formal request in the local court to close the case but the judge didn’t accept the request. The request, also rejected by the high court, eventually reached the Supreme Court earlier this year which described the state’s request as “incomprehensible”.The top court said the prosecutor’s request was based on a “misconception that elected members of the legislature stand above the general application of criminal law”, and stressed that “acts of destruction of public property” are not covered under the privileges accorded to legislators in the assembly. “Consequently, acts of vandalism cannot be said to be manifestations of the freedom of speech and be termed as ‘proceedings’ of the assembly,” it added.The opposition renewed its demand that Pinarayi Vijayan drops Sivankutty from his cabinet but the ruling party has refused to replace him, insisting that the minister was yet to be held guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-violence-court-rejects-ministers-plea-for-discharge-101634122299410.html
13-10-2021||India||India, Armenia discuss using Chabahar port to boost connectivity||India and Armenia have discussed the possibility of using Iran’s Chabahar port to enhance connectivity between the two countries to boost trade and commerce, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday. Jaishankar is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Armenia since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992. Armenia was the final stop on his three-nation tour that has also taken him to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. India and Armenia are members of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which has the potential to bridge the connectivity barrier between the two sides, and Armenia’s interest in using Chabahar port figured in Jaishankar’s talks with his Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan. “Minister Mirzoyan and I discussed the interest which Armenia has shown in the utilisation of the Chabahar port in Iran, which is being developed by India,” he told a media briefing in Yerevan. “We have also proposed that Chabahar port be included in the INSTC. We would definitely like to welcome the use of Chabahar port and any other initiatives that will increase the connectivity between our countries,” he said, adding the two sides also discussed the possibility of direct flights under an air services agreement. Jaishankar reiterated India’s consistent position regarding the peaceful resolution of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan through diplomatic means. He also expressed India’s support for resolving the dispute under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and for the trilateral ceasefire mechanism brokered by Russia in November 2020. “Regarding the regional security situation in light of developments in the Caucasus region since last year, India’s position has been very consistent... India has always been in favour of peace and stability in this region,” he said. Armenia and Azerbaijan signed the Russia-brokered ceasefire on November 10 last year to end six weeks of heavy fighting that killed some 7,000 military troops and civilians on both sides. Noting that India was one of the first countries to recognise the independence of Armenia and establish diplomatic ties in 1992, Jaishankar said his visit marked the beginning of a new phase of cooperation between the two sides. However, relations between India and Armenia go back several centuries, including the presence of an Armenian diaspora in India and its contribution to the country’s progress, he said. Jaishankar said he and Mirzoyan carried out a comprehensive review of bilateral relations and agreed on a roadmap for future cooperation at various levels. They also agreed on strengthening economic and commercial cooperation, especially in tourism, hospitality, infrastructure and investment. Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, with which India is currently negotiating a trade agreement. The pact is expected to boost trade relations, he said. The two governments will also facilitate more contacts between trade bodies and chambers of the two sides, he added. Jaishankar also conveyed India’s gratitude to Armenia for looking after the welfare of some 3,000 Indian students during the pandemic and facilitating their return home. Most of these students are pursuing medical education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-armenia-discuss-using-chabahar-port-to-boost-connectivity-101634122121648.html

His client Aryan was apprehended before he got to the cruise, his lawyer said on Wednesday. When Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant reached the entry gate, the NCB raid was already going on and they were asked whether they had contraband and Arbaaz Merchant admitted. "Nothing was recovered from Aryan Khan," Desai said, as reported by LiveLaw.To this ASG Anil Singh for the NCB said, Aryan Khan knew of the possession and therefore this would amount to conscious possession. He also said Aryan and Arbaaz know each other for the last eight to 10 years. The drug that Arbaaz was carrying was for their consumption. NCB is not concerned about one or two persons. It is concerned with the entire chain. "The argument is, I was invited for the party, no more details," Anil Singh said."Their maximum case against Aryan Khan is no possession, admission of consumption," Aryan Khan's lawyer said. "If he did not have cash, he had no plans to purchase. If he had no substance, he wasn't going to sell or consume. There is no connection between Aryan Khan and any of the recoveries and yet we have the words 'in connection with' in the remand. They are doing a good job by arresting many, but that doesn't give them the right to hold on to those who are entitled to be set at liberty," Amit Desai said.Aryan Khan used to procure drugs from Arbaaz Merchant, quantity recovered immaterial: NCB in courtThe NCB on Wednesday strongly opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea saying that notwithstanding the quantity of recovery, Aryan Khan can not be given bail as the primary investigation of the agency reveals that he is part of the nexus. Aryan Khan used to procure drugs through Arbaaz Merchant and Arbaaz's sources, the NCB said terming it as an "illegal drug chain"."This is a very serious term that they have dumped on Aryan Khan. I have no doubt that my friends know what is illicit trafficking according to the NDPS Act means," Aryan Khan's lawyer said."The allegation of illicit trafficking is inherently absurd. This boy who has nothing, he was not even on the vessel. It is an absurd and false allegation," Desai added.“They are some young kids. In many countries these substances are legal. Let us not penalise in bail. Let us not make it worse for them. They have suffered enough, they have learnt their lesson, if at all. They are not peddlers, racketeers or traffickers. We as a country have moved into a reformative state. Where earlier the punishment for consumption was five years has been brought down to one year in 2001,” Aryan Khan's lawyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-was-not-even-on-the-cruise-detained-on-his-way-aryan-khan-s-lawyer-101634116760087.html

Ajay Mishra Teni” and “to direct an independent judicial investigation by a Commission comprising of two sitting judges of the Supreme Court of India or the High Court.”The opposition party has urged for the dismissal of the accused, Ashish Mishra’s father, who publicly made violent remarks and threatened the farmers who have been protesting against the three farm laws. This was also included in the memorandum, “Shri Ajay Mishra Teni, MoS, Home Affairs, in a public function openly threatened the agitating farmers and even boasted about his dubious antecedents.” They further questioned, “How can justice be done when the original provocation came from Union MoS Home Affairs himself?”The seven-member delegation included former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, and senior party leaders KC Venugopal, AK Antony and Ghulam Nabi Azad. They deemed the incident as “one of the most gruesome and premeditated acts of bone-chilling murder ever seen and caught on camera.”After the meeting with the President, the delegation briefly interacted with the press and Gandhi reiterated, “We want justice… The person who has committed the crime must be punished.”Accused Ashish Mishra was arrested on Saturday by the Uttar Pradesh police in relation to the violence where eight people, including four farmers, were killed. So far, there has been no response from the senior BJP leaders over the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-delegation-meets-president-kovind-submits-memorandum-on-lakhimpur-kheri-101634120381088.html

This is the first such conviction for the use of a poisonous snake for murder. The court relied on the findings of a test with a snake that showed the difference between natural and induced bite marks.The prosecution sought capital punishment for P Sooraj, 30. Uthra, Sooraj’s 25-year-old wife, suffered a fatal bite at her home while she was undergoing treatment for another snake bite she suffered. It emerged during the investigation that the incident, involving a viper, was also orchestrated by the husband. She managed to recover from the first bite but could not survive the second.The case surfaced in May last year after Uthra’s parents filed a police complaint two days after her death alleging Sooraj and his family members harassed their daughter for dowry. There was no eyewitness or direct circumstantial evidence in the case. The Special Investigation Team (SIT), which probed the case, relied on scientific and technical evidence to nail the culprit. It conducted the test with a snake to show the difference between natural and induced bite marks.Uthra’s parents said they were unhappy as they expected a death sentence. They plan to move the high court for capital punishment. “Capital punishment would have given a clear message to people who have such criminal minds,” said her mother, Manimekhala.The court called the murder a rarest of the rare cases but awarded Sooraj double life imprisonment considering his age and that he has no criminal past. The prosecution insisted on a death sentence saying Sooraj committed four out of five acts listed by the Supreme Court as a reasonable ground for awarding a death sentence.Sooraj was found guilty under the Indian Penal Code’s Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), and 202 (destruction of evidence).Double life term was awarded in the first two and 17 years in jail under the last two sections. He was also asked to pay ₹five lakh fine as well.Prosecutor G Mohanraj said he is happy with the verdict and congratulated the SIT.S Harishankar, the SIT chief, said he is satisfied with the verdict. He added they examined four such snake bite cases reported in the country which later ended with the acquittal of the accused. “We studied four such reported cases in the country in detail. Two took place in the family and two outside and examined major flaws so we prepared a well-researched charge sheet without any loopholes,” said Harishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-snake-bite-case-man-gets-double-life-sentence-for-murdering-wife-101634119240012.html

In an affidavit filed in the Bombay high court on Tuesday, NIA said the two were filing pleas on one ground or the other. NIA urged the court against entertaining the pleas.The affidavit was filed in response to Bharadwaj and Navlakha’s plea for clone copies of the electronic devices such as hard disks seized from them. It added they will be provided once they are received from a Forensic Science Laboratory. NIA said all the accused in the case have been provided with the certified hard copies of the documents the agency has relied upon in its charge sheet. It added some of the clone copies to the devices have been recently received and will be submitted before a special court hearing the case.The affidavit said five final reports related to the devices of Bharadwaj and Navlakha are yet to be received. It added once they are received, they would be submitted to the special court and thereafter to the two accused after following due process of law.The affidavit rejected the allegation of the accused of tampering with the clone copies as a “fanciful submission”. It opposed the plea of the two to stay the framing of charges till they receive them. The affidavit called it just an attempt to delay the process as the incriminating documents and other electronic evidence NIA relied upon have been given to the accused. It maintained the agency has clinching evidence against the accused. NIA said it thus filed the charge sheet. It added the high court has rejected a plea of the accused on the admissibility of the evidence. NIA said the appeal seeking a stay on the commencement of the trial should not be entertained.Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha are among over a dozen activists and academics arrested in connection with the conclave that was held a day before the violence at Bhima Koregaon near Pune. The Pune Police claimed people linked to Maoists backed the conclave. The NIA later took over the probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-says-accused-trying-to-delay-trial-101634118520999.html

"Based on the evolving scenario, it has been decided that the revised guidelines...stand withdrawn and the earlier guidelines on international arrival dated 17th February 2021 shall be applicable to all travellers arriving in India from the United Kingdom," joint secretary Lav Agarwal wrote.Following a wide range of discussions between the India and the UK governments, the UK from October 11 exempted fully vaccinated Indians from mandatory quarantine in the UK.  The move was long-pending as the UK recognised India's Covishield vaccine, which is a formulation of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine but raised some doubts over India's vaccine certificate. Hence, between October 4 and October 11, Indians administered with both doses of Covishield had to undergo mandatory quarantine in the UK like non-vaccinated travellers.India has not made quarantine mandatory for vaccinated travellers coming from any country. The move for UK passengers was in reciprocation to UK's discrimination against Covishield and the Indian vaccine certificate. India had earlier warned that countries that will not recognise India's vaccines will face similar action in India."I'm absolutely delighted that the UK government cooperated very well with the Indian government. Now, this enables Indian visitors, vaccinated with recognised vaccines, which include Covishield, to enter the United Kingdom without quarantine. We now have to get people moving between the two countries. People are desperate to come here (India),” British high commissioner to India Alex Ellis said earlier.After the UK agreed to recognise Covishield and its certificate, the Centre said it will issue similar relaxation for UK travellers and the health ministry will issue the guideline. With the mandatory quarantining now lifted, vaccinated people coming from the UK to India will require a negative RT-PCR test report and a self-declaration form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-10-day-mandatory-quarantine-for-vaccinated-uk-tourists-in-india-101634117864982.html

Owaisi accused the BJP of distorting the history and on Twitter, he also posted a copy of a letter to Savarkar from Gandhi."They (BJP) are presenting distorted history. If this continues, they will remove Mahatma Gandhi and make Savarkar, who was accused of the murder of Mahatma Gandhi and was pronounced complicit in the inquiry of Justice Jeevan Lal Kapur, as the father of the nation," Owaisi told news agency ANI.Speaking at the launch of a book titled 'Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition’, Rajnath Singh claimed that there had been “deliberate attempts” to defame Savarkar by spreading lies about him."Lies were spread about Savarkar. Time and again, it was said that he filed mercy petitions before the British government seeking his release from jail," the Union minister said."It was Mahatma Gandhi who asked him to file mercy petitions," he added.In a series of tweets, Owaisi said that Savarkar wrote the first mercy petition in 1911, followed by another one around 1913-1914 when Mahatma Gandhi was in South Africa. The AIMIM leader opined that the defence minister’s speechwriter should be fired.“It’s not good to have advisers who have a Savarkarite relationship to truth,” he said,Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh also objected to Rajnath Singh’s remark, the BJP leader has given a twist to what Gandhi actually wrote.“Rajnath Singh-ji is amongst the few sober & dignified voices in Modi Sarkar. But he doesnt seem to be free of RSS habit of rewriting history. He has given a twist to what Gandhi actually wrote on Jan 25 1920. Here is that letter to Savarkar’s brother,” the Rajya Sabha MP wrote on Twitter, sharing the letter to Savarkar written by Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-make-savarkar-father-of-nation-says-owaisi-after-rajnath-singh-s-remark-on-gandhi-101634116523495.html

A meeting would be held with the covid expert committee soon after Dasara to discuss the situation and a decision on relaxing the restrictions in border districts would be taken,” Bommai said on Wednesday in Mangaluru.The statements come at a time when Karnataka has actively relaxed restrictions across the state to kickstart economic activity around the festive period.The state government has already relaxed restrictions to allow physical classes for students above 6th grade, 100% occupancy in cinema halls, pubs and other places since October 1. There is a demand to reopen classes for students between 1-5th grades.“Decision will also be taken regarding reopening of primary schools,” Bommai said.The proposal to reopen classes for young students comes even as trials of Covid-19 vaccination for children aged between 2-18 years old is underway.“Children and adolescents will be vaccinated soon. Karnataka is in the forefront of vaccination,” Bommai said.The Covid-19 infection numbers in Karnataka appear to have stabilised, as per the government data. The Bommai-led administration continues easing restrictions after nearly two years of lockdowns. The chief minister also said that he would decide on the withdrawal of cases filed against the public for violation of any Covid-19 norms during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-to-decide-on-easing-curbs-reopening-primary-school-after-consulting-experts-101634117260766.html
13-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan used to procure drugs from Arbaaz Merchant, quantity recovered immaterial: NCB in court||The Narcotics Control Bureau on Wednesday said to the court that the agency's initial probe revealed that Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan used to procure contraband from Arbaaz Merchant, another accused in the case. "The material collated during the investigation has primarily revealed the Aryan Khan has a role in so far as illicit procurement and distribution of contraband is concerned," the agency said replying to Aryan Khan's bail plea.Aryan Khan was not even on the cruise, false allegation: What lawyer saysThe agency said Aryan Khan's case can not be considered in isolation as all these persons are an integral part of a common threat which "cannot be separated or dissected from each other". The quantum of recovery, from an individual, becomes inconsequential, the agency said. No drug was found from Aryan Khan while from Arbaaz, the agency recovered 6 gram charas. The NCB said all persons form a part of a larger chain, nexus and their involvement in a conspiracy to commit illegal acts and violations under Section 29 can not be ruled out.'Because it's a Khan?': What politicians say on Aryan Khan's arrest in drugs caseSo far, it is apparent that Achit Kumar and Shivraj Harijan used to supply charas to both Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant. "The material collated during the investigation has primarily revealed the Aryan Khan (A1) has a role in so far as illicit procurement and distribution of contraband is concerned," the NCB said in its reply to Aryan Khan's bail application.Earlier, the agency opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea by saying that Aryan Khan belongs to an influential family and he may tamper with the evidence. In its reply tothe special NDPS court, the agency reiterated the point and said, considering his influential background, it is plausible that the applicant tampers with evidence and influence other witnesses whom he personally knows. "Also the possibility of the applicant fleeing justice cannot be ruled out," the agency said.After his bail plea was rejected by the metropolitan magistrate court on October 8, the case on Wednesday has come to a special NDPS court.Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3 along with seven others including Arbaaz Merchant after the NCB raided a goa-bound cruise acting on a tip-off that a rave party was going on there.  Till October 7, Aryan Khan was at the NCB custody but in the last hearing the agency lost the custody and all of them including Aryan Khan was sent to 14-day judicial custody. Since October 8, Aryan is lodged at the Arthur Road prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-used-to-procure-drugs-from-arbaaz-merchant-his-sources-ncb-in-court-101634114442492.html
13-10-2021||India||‘All new coal power plants should be halted to achieve net-zero emissions’||Construction of all new coal-fired power plants will have to be halted as of this year and 40% of the existing global coal power fleet retired by 2030 if the world has to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees C, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said. The IEA’s first World Energy Outlook released on Wednesday includes a scenario for the global transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve the scenario, approval of new oil and gas fields, coal mines, or mine extensions will also have to be stopped. Additionally, no new LNG export projects are to be developed, said Oil Change International, an advocacy organisation on the impact of fossil fuels, in an analysis of the IEA report.The report said the energy intensity of the global economy needs to decrease by 4% annually this decade. It added global clean energy investment needs to more than triple by 2030, with 85% of total energy investment directed towards clean technologies. IEA said getting the world on track for 1.5 degrees C requires a surge in annual investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure to nearly $4 trillion by 2030. It added fossil fuel-related methane emissions need to be reduced by 75% by 2030. The report said the electricity sector needs to almost decarbonise by 2035 in developed nations and by 2040 in all countries. The sales of new internal combustion engine cars need to end by 2035 globally, it added.The IEA has underlined four measures to help achieve the net-zero emissions scenario--doubling of solar PV and wind deployment relative to what countries have already announced; a major expansion of other low-emission fuels including the use of nuclear power where acceptable; a huge build-out of electricity infrastructure including from hydropower; a rapid phase-out of coal etc. It has called for decreasing the energy intensity of the global economy by more than 4% per year between 2020 and 2030 through energy efficiency measures. The IEA has sought a rapid reduction in methane emissions and clean energy innovation.Most of the emission reduction for net-zero targets come from technologies that are at the demonstration or prototype stage now. These are important to address emissions from iron and steel, cement, and other energy-intensive industrial sectors – and also from long-distance transport. Deployment of hydrogen-based and other low-carbon fuels, as well as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage will be crucial, the IEA said.This transition could lead to unstable energy markets. “The world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs, and uncertainties over policies and demand trajectories create a strong risk of a volatile period ahead for energy markets. Transition-related spending is gradually picking up but remains far short of what is required to meet the rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way. The deficit is visible across all sectors and regions. At the same time, the amount being spent on oil and natural gas, dragged down by two price collapses in 2014-15 and in 2020, is geared towards a world of stagnant or even falling demand for these fuels,” the report said.The report has come in the middle of an energy price crisis. The IAE explained its causes in a separate blog. “Recent increases in global natural gas prices are the result of multiple factors, and it is inaccurate and misleading to lay the responsibility at the door of the clean energy transition,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. “This increase has been driven by the surge in gas, coal, and carbon prices in Europe.” Birol said well-managed clean energy transitions are a solution to the issues in gas and electricity markets – not the cause of them.The IEA has also flagged the large gap in what countries have committed to and the actions needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. It said a lot more needs to be done by governments to fully deliver on their current announced pledges. “Looking sector-by-sector at what measures governments have actually put in place, as well as specific policy initiatives that are under development is captured in IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). Under STEPS, global average temperatures would rise by about 2.6 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels,” it said. “This despite countries accounting for between 60-70% of global CO2 emissions announcing net-zero emissions pledges.” It said if countries actually deliver on their current pledges captured in the Announced Pledges Scenario, they start to bend the global emissions curve down but that would only limit global temperature rise to 2.1-degree C.The report said an equitable energy transition is a must for achieving net-zero emissions. While advanced economies reach net zero emissions before emerging markets and developing economies like India, the scenario also underlines full energy access and significant reductions in air pollution as set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ensures that energy affordability is maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-new-coal-power-plants-should-be-halted-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-iea-101634113299812.html

Though the court had called it one of the rarest of the rare cases, it spared the death sentence considering the age of the husband, P Sooraj. The court said it will give a wrong message to people with such criminal minds.The 32-year-old has to undergo all sentences separately, the court said, adding that life sentence will start only after 17 years, which means he has to spend rest of his life in jail.The court had on Monday convicted Sooraj of murder for letting loose a cobra on his wife while she was sleeping, and forcing it to bite her. The prosecution had sought capital punishment for him.Uthra, his 25-year-old wife, suffered a bite at her home while she was undergoing treatment for another snake bite she suffered. She managed to recover from the first bite, but could not survive the second.The parents of Uthra said they were not satisfied as they expected death sentence. They said they will move the Kerala high court for death sentence.This was Sooraj's second attempt, after having failed in his first with a viper earlier in February last year. Both the snakes were procured through a snake handler Suresh.The case had come to the fore in May last year after Uthra’s parents filed a police complaint two days after her death alleging Sooraj and his family members harassed their daughter for dowry. Uthra’s parents told the investigators that her in-laws frequently harassed her for more dowry. They said they gave 90 sovereigns of gold, ₹5 lakh cash and a car to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-court-gives-double-life-term-to-man-in-snake-bite-murder-case-101634107978271.html
13-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur violence: Rahul Gandhi-led Congress delegation meets President Kovind||A Rahul Gandhi-led delegation of the Congress party on Wednesday met President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi and demanded the resignation of Union minister Ajay Mishra in connection with the violent incident at Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri where eight people, including four farmers, were allegedly mowed down by the minister's son Ashish Mishra.Following the meet, Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress delegation duly placed before the president its demands, which include the removal of Union minister Mishra and in his absence, a fair probe conducted by two sitting judges of the Supreme Cindiaourt. Congress general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, also said that President Kovind provided the assurance of following up the matter with the government within today, itself.“We told the President that the accused's father, who is the Union minister of state (MoS) for home affairs, should be removed from the post as a fair probe is not possible in his presence,” Rahul Gandhi was quoted by the ANI news agency as saying. “Likewise, we also demanded that inquiry be done by two sitting judges of the Supreme Court.”Speaking to reporters, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “The President has given us the assurance that he will discuss the matter with the government today itself.”Besides Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, others who were part of the Congress delegation to the President on Wednesday include senior leaders such as Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, KC Venugopal, and AK Antony.The delegation presented a detailed memorandum of facts and placed its demands before the President. The party, earlier on October 10, wrote to the Rashtrapati Bhavan seeking an appointment with President Kovind for a seven-member party delegation to meet him.As many as eight people including four farmers had died in the violence that took place on October 3. Uttar Pradesh police have so far arrested three people including the son of Union minister of state Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a body of several farmer unions, had issued a statement regarding the incident. Meanwhile, refuting SKM's allegations, the minister said his son was not present at the spot, adding that some miscreants merged with protesting farmers and pelted stones on the car, which lead to the ‘unfortunate incident’. Ashish Mishra also refuted SKM's allegations and reiterated his absence at the spot where the incident took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-rahul-gandhi-led-congress-delegation-meets-president-kovind-101634107259300.html

The 10-day "all mask campaign" will sensitise people about the importance of wearing masks."During the campaign, people should were masks even at home all the time except during meals and family members should not dine together," the state government said in an order released on Monday.The campaign was launched by Mizoram health minister Dr R Lalthangliana in Zoram Medical College (ZMC) central library. He said that the daily Covid-19 cases of Mizoram have outnumbered the total number of the seven other Northeastern states taken together several times.The minister said that the "all mask campaign" has been launched on the recommendation of a team of experts on Covid-19 management, and cited some studies to say that wearing masks appropriately can effectively protect people from being infected with coronavirus.Dr R Lalthangliana also inaugurated a 10-bed new ICU ward in ZMC. A 34-bed ICU has been already set up at the medical college.A four-member central team visited Mizoram earlier this month to assess the Covid-19 situation in the state.On Monday, Mizoram reported 307 new Covid-19 cases, the lowest in over a month since August 24, and four related fatalities. The tally now stands at 1,06,136, of which 13,408 are active, according to a government bulletin.Over 6.86 lakh people have been vaccinated till October 9, and 4.71 lakh of them have received both doses.Till the start of October, the state was recording around 1,500 cases daily and the positivity rate stood at 18 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wear-mask-all-the-time-even-at-home-mizoram-launches-campaign-against-covid-101634108203102.html
13-10-2021||India||Deve Gowda trains guns against Congress over BJP ‘B-Team’ remarks||Former prime minister and Janata Dal (Secular) national president HD Deve Gowda on Friday lashed out at the Congress party for allegations that the regional outfit has fielded Muslim candidates in the October 30 bypolls to help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gowda said that the Congress acts like it has taken the “contract” of Muslims and their welfare in the state. “A Muslim has won there (Sindgi) before. They (Congress) say that we are brokers helping the BJP win. We will all go and camp there. Go to every house. Tell them what I have done. Tell them (electorate) that I have come to your doorstep at the last stage of my life and ask them to help my candidate win,” Gowda said on Friday in Bengaluru. The statements come even as the Congress continues to allege that the JD(S) is tacitly helping the BJP by fielding a Muslim candidate in both bypoll constituencies in an effort to split the minority vote. “We will put in all our efforts to see if we can swim against this tide (of going against the two national parties),” he said. Sindgi MLA, MC Managuli from the JD(S), died this January. CM Udasi died this June, necessitating the bypolls in Hanagal. However, Managuli’s son has since joined the Congress and has been announced the party candidate from the constituency on October 5, according to the All India Congress Committee. Gowda said that Congress continues to poach its candidates and then speak against a party that gave all of them (referring to Siddaramaiah) political birth. “JD(S)’ target is the Congress and not the BJP,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition, said on Thursday. He implied that the JD(S) fields minority candidates to help the BJP and that the former is the latter’s B-Team’. “I am not saying that you (JDS) should not field a minority candidate. But they don’t do it where they are supposed to,” Siddaramaiah said. He added that the JD(S) will not field a Muslim candidate in Mandya and Hassan, the stronghold of the regional outfit, since their main support base, the Vokkaligas are found there in large numbers. The bypolls come at a time when the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government has been facing increasing pressure from Hindu groups over restrictions on Durga Puja celebrations and temple demolition in Nanjangud. The Bommai government is also under pressure from dominant communities like the Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, to change their reservation status and continues to give the administration new deadlines to yield to their demands. The BJP is hoping to win both seats to add to its tally while the Congress is trying to get some momentum to its 2023 assembly election campaign. The JD(S) has seen its numbers dip, first with the defection in 2019 and now with the imminent exit of at least three more legislators before the next elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deve-gowda-trains-guns-against-congress-over-bjp-b-team-remarks-101634108378862.html
13-10-2021||India||'Schools with more women staff see more squabbles': Rajasthan minister makes controversial remark||Rajasthan's education minister Govind Singh Dotasra has created a buzz on the social media as he made a bizarre remark about women staff. Speaking during an event, the minister who is also the president of Pradesh Congress Committee, said, "Where there's female staff, either the Principal or teacher would take saridon (medicine for headache)'' due to their "inner conflicts." "If they overcome this, they will be ahead of men," he can also be heard saying in a video posted on Twitter by news agency ANI.Interestingly, the event in which Dotasra was speaking, was organised to mark international girl child day.The senior Congress leader also emphasised that the state government has made policies that prioritised women. "In the selection process, promotions, women are getting a priority, which has made some people disgruntled. This is injustice... they tell me," he also said while smiling.Speaking further, the minister said, "I will say one thing because I am also the head of the department...You also have a lot of fights among yourself. Sometimes a quarrel of coming late, sometimes a quarrel of coming early. If you successfully overcome this, then you will always be ahead of men."The problematic remark comes just days after Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar created controversy after he targeted women and said, "modern Indian women want to stay single and are unwilling to give birth even after marriage and desire children by surrogacy." He called this a "paradigm shift in thinking" and said, "it is not good."He also lamented the "western influence" on Indian society, and said people don't want their parents to live with them anymore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-with-more-women-staff-see-more-squabbles-rajasthan-minister-makes-controversial-remark-101634106675617.html

13-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence 'absolutely condemnable': Nirmala Sitharaman tells Harvard students||The Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which four farmers were killed, is “absolutely condemnable,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said, emphasising that there are issues of such nature happening in other parts of India equally which should be raised "when they happen and not when it suits others" because there is a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.Sitharaman, who is on an official visit to the US, was responding to a question during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday about the killing of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and the arrest of Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra.She was asked why there is no word on this from the prime minister, senior ministers and why there is a “defensive reaction” when somebody asks questions about such things.“No, absolutely not... It's nice of you to have picked up that one incident which is absolutely condemnable, every one of us say that. Equally there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern."“India has issues of such nature happening in very many different parts of the country equally. I would like you, and many others, including Dr Amartya Sen, who all know India, to raise it at every time when it happens, not just raise it when it suits us because it's a state where BJP is in power, one of my cabinet colleague’s son is in probably trouble, and also assume that it's actually them who did it and not anybody else. Due course of justice will also have a complete inquiry process to establish it,” she said.“And it's not being defensive about my party or my Prime Minister. It's being defensive about India. I will talk for India, I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked at. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say ‘Sorry, let's talk on facts’. That's my answer for you,” she said.Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3.To a question on the farmers’ protests, Sitharaman said that the three acts which the government brought in were discussed by the various parliamentary committees over a decade.She said all the three acts have been discussed variously by the State governments, by the Center after the BJP came into power in 2014."This has been in the making for a decade now. Every stakeholder has been consulted,” she said.“When the farm laws were brought in the Lok Sabha, there was an elaborate discussion and the agriculture minister gave his reply as well. It was only when it came to the Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of noise and disturbance,” she said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26 last year, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.Sitharaman said the protesters belong to one state and some parts of other states - “Punjab, Haryana and some parts of western Uttar Pradesh."She said the government has been saying that it is willing to talk with the protesters and has been engaging with them.The government has asked pointedly what is that one aspect in any one of the three laws which have been passed to which the protesters object, she said. “We are willing to talk about it, tell us that one particular aspect in any one of the three laws.Till date, we have not had even one particular aspect which is being questioned. And therefore, the protesters are not sure on what score they are protesting, what is it that they are objecting.“Then there's this issue about the minimum support price to be given to farmers,” she said, adding that the MSP are announced well in time and the farmers can decide whether they want to grow a crop or not and they can otherwise choose to grow something else.She said once the farmers choose to grow any of these, for which a minimum support price is announced and procurements are done, through direct benefit transfer using technology, money is deposited as a lump sum into their accounts.“The highest amount of procurement, the largest ever payment per farmer under the minimum support price which is declared has happened in the last seven years after Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has come. Highest ever.“The number of farmers, the total quantum of money, total quantum of grain procured in each one of them - the highest as has happened season after season in the last seven years," she said.Highlighting that there are recorded conversations “which you can see of farmers even from Punjab, even from Haryana”, she said farmers have got the entire amount into their account.“This is verifiable, not a claim which I'm making. You can go and check it out. Highest amount and the entire amount is given into the account directly the day after procurement is done. No staggering, no delaying,” she said.“So we have not been told what it is that they're protesting against as yet and the minister is willing to talk even today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-absolutely-condemnable-nirmala-sitharaman-tells-harvard-students-101634104208975.html
13-10-2021||India||$25 for credit card, $80 for Gmail: How much your stolen data costs||Cryptocurrency accounts have a premium attached to them while there has been an overall increase in the sale prices of hacked financial details on the dark web.You may have often wondered how data stolen by hackers is sold online, and how much it eventually costs. There is a marketplace at work for it on the dark web, an underbelly of the internet where anonymity rules and access remain largely untraceable. Data privacy and cybersecurity research firm Privacy Affairs has released the latest Dark Web Price Index 2021. It shows how the average cost of stolen personal information has fluctuated year on year. There is a price tag attached to everything, including your stolen credit card details, digital payment accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, social media accounts, streaming services, forged passports, and potent malware.Financial details and payment tools remain popular. These include credit cards, digital payment services, and cryptocurrency accounts. The latter, in particular, has gained popularity over the past year or so. Cloned credit cards fetch hackers around $25 ( ₹1,883) per card. Within this bucket, some hold a premium. A Mastercard or Visa card with PIN access costs $25 each and that of American Express $35. Credit cards with an account balance of up to $1000 fetch as much as $150. Those with a balance of up to $5000 can get $240 on the dark web.“Notable corporations and organizations like NASA, McDonald’s, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Lockheed Martin, even cybersecurity companies FireEye and SolarWinds have all been victims to serious breaches in 2020 alone,” says security researcher Zachary Ignoffo in the report.The researchers at Privacy Affairs compared the dark web market prices of these stolen details with those of last year. There has been an increase across the board. The most has been a $55 price hike for stolen online banking logins with a minimum of $2000 in the account. The price now is $120 each, compared with $65 last year.Within the credit card category, prices vary according to the country the card has been issued in. A hacked global credit will fetch $35 while that issued in the UK $20. An Israeli credit card will fetch $65. Stolen PayPal accounts fetch between $14 and $340, depending on the balance.Cryptocurrency accounts have a premium attached to them. A hacked Coinbase verified account fetches around $610. The values attached with Kraken verified ($810), Cex.io verified ($710) and Crypto.com verified ($300) are significantly higher. The crypto accounts were not valued last year and have been for the first time included in the Dark Web Price Index.Social media accounts fetch a significant amount of money on the dark web. A hacked Facebook account fetches $65 while that of Instagram $45 and Twitter $35. A Gmail account linked to all Google services and the attached payment methods as well fetches $80 each. There has been a slight reduction in the prices of hacked social media accounts, compared with last year. A Facebook account, for instance, is fetching $10 lesser now. The same is true about online subscriptions. Netflix (a 1-year subscription) costs $44 while that of Adobe Creative Cloud $160. eBay, as a shopping platform, may not be very popular in India, but an account on the website with a good reputation is fetching as much as $1000 each.Certain malware products are fetching higher prices compared with 2020. Malware for Android devices now fetches $900 per 1,000 installs, compared to $300 last year. Premium malware across a variety of computing including Windows computers, and smart devices now costs $5000. “For every 1,000 installs, hackers stand to steal tens of thousands of dollars,” says Ignoffo. The popular methods for sneaking in malware on systems continue to be fake online casino popups, social media networks, and websites that promise free software downloads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-for-credit-card-80-for-gmail-how-much-your-stolen-data-costs-101634104958023.html
13-10-2021||India||Gati Shakti: Modi launches 100-lakh crore national master plan for multi-modal connectivity, details here||In a landmark event marking a milestone for the infrastructural landscape of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched the ‘PM GatiShakti - National Master Plan’ for multi-modal connectivity to economic zones in the country. The plan is an important part of Prime Minister Modi's ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-dependent India) vision and ambitiously aims to lend more power and speed to projects under the $1.5-trillion National Infrastructure Pipeline and boost the goal of achieving a $5-trillion economy, especially in wake of the recent economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.PM @narendramodi unveils the #PMGatiShakti - a National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi today. The project will incorporate infrastructure schemes of various Ministries & State Governments designed & executed with a common vision.The PM GatiShakti launch event took place at 11am at New Delhi's Pragati Maidan. Prime Minister Modi, who was present at the launch event, reviewed the model of the new exhibition complex at Pragati Maidan, before launching the GatiShakti plan with the press of a remote button. The ambitious plan envisages a centralised portal to unite the infrastructural initiatives planned and initiated by as many as 16 central ministries and departments. Speaking at the event, the Prime Minister said that PM GatiShakti targets to cut logistic costs, increase cargo handling capacity and reduce the turnaround time.Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal, who was also present at the event, said that the PM GatiShakti initiative will give infrastructure creation a new direction and also provide a new pace to existing projects.Also Read | Gati Shakti: A major leap in governanceWhat is PM GatiShakti?The PM Gati Shakti plan, envisioned by the Prime Minister, is a campaign to lend more speed (Gati) and power (Shakti) to projects by connecting all concerned departments on one platform. This way, the infrastructure schemes of various ministries and state governments will be designed and executed with a common vision, Modi said. He added that taxpayers' money in the past was ‘insulted’ through a lethargic approach to development work, with departments working in silos and there was no coordination on projects.As an example, he said the first inter-state natural gas pipeline was commissioned in 1987. From then to 2014, 15,000-km of the natural gas pipeline was built. Currently, more than 16,000-km of the new gas pipeline is being constructed.“What was done in 27 years, we are doing in it in less than half that time,” the Prime Minister said.It is not possible to carry out the development of the country without a holistic approach to quality infrastructure, said Prime Minister Modi, echoing his 15th August Red Fort speech earlier this year on the occasion of the 75th Independence Day. The various government departments which will join hands for coordinated developmental projects include the ministries of road to railways, aviation to agriculture. This will, in turn, reduce logistic cost and turnaround time, and also help India become an attractive investment destination.The six pillars of ‘PM GatiShakti - National Master Plan’:1. Comprehensiveness: It will include all the existing and planned initiatives of various ministries and departments with one centralized portal. Each and every department will now have visibility of each other’s activities providing critical data while planning and executing projects in a comprehensive manner.2. Prioritisation: Through this, different departments will be able to prioritise their projects through cross-sectoral interactions.3. Optimisation: The National Master Plan will assist different ministries in planning for projects after the identification of critical gaps. For the transportation of the goods from one place to another, the plan will help in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost.4. Synchronisation: Individual ministries and departments often work in silos. There is a lack of coordination in the planning and implementation of the project resulting in delays. PM GatiShakti will help in synchronising the activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance, in a holistic manner by ensuring coordination of work between them.5. Analytical: The plan will provide the entire data at one place with GIS-based spatial planning and analytical tools having 200+ layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency.6. Dynamic: All ministries and departments will now be able to visualise, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and progress of the projects will be updated on a regular basis on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gati-shakti-modi-launches-100-lakh-crore-national-master-plan-for-multi-modal-connectivity-details-here-101634103432861.html
13-10-2021||India||Delhi air pollution: 75% of children experience breathlessness, says study||With the onset of winters, Delhi's air quality worsens every year. The climatic change leaves more than 75 per cent of the children feeling suffocated, according to Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan; the report is based on a study conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).The health survey was conducted on 413 children, out of which 75.4% complained of breathlessness, 24.2% complained of itchy eyes, 22.3% complained of regular sneezing or runny nose and 20.9% of children complained of coughing in the morning.The children in the survey aged between 14-17 years.The TERI report also stated that air in Delhi has a high concentration of major pollutant PM2.5, which it claimed is pushing Delhiites, especially children, towards respiratory and heart diseases.Researchers also identified heavy metals as a major component of PM 2.5 that may result in potential health effects. In October 2019, the concentration of zinc in the city's PM 2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter) was 379 ng/m3 (nanograms per cubic meter of air). In September 2020, this increased to 615 ng/m3 (nanograms per cubic meter of air).Similarly, the lead content in Delhi's air was 233 ng/m3 (nanograms per cubic meter of air) in 2019, which increased to 406 ng/m3 (nanograms per cubic meter of air) in 2020, with an arsenic content of 3 ng/m3.According to experts, some of these metals are extremely hazardous to human health and regular exposure to them could lead to some fatal health consequences. The increased amount of cadmium and arsenic in the air also put the locals at higher risk of cancer, kidney problems and high blood pressure, diabetes and heart diseases."PM 2.5 level - less than 60 ug/m3 - is considered an acceptable norm, but if there is a high concentration of toxic metals in the air, then it may lead to Your health is at risk," the Live Hindustan quoted TERI Associate Fellow (Environment and Health), Kanhaiya Lal, as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-pollution-75-of-children-experience-breathlessness-says-study-101634100292129.html
13-10-2021||India||Kerala court to announce punishment in snake bite murder case today||A court in Kerala's Kollam will on Wednesday decide the quantum of punishment for man who was found guilty of killing his wife using a cobra. The court on Monday convicted P Sooraj of murder by letting loose a cobra on his wife she was sleeping, and forcing it to bite her, saying the convict did not deserve any sympathy for this heinous crime. The prosecution sought capital punishment for the 32-year-old.Sooraj was found guilty on Monday under IPC sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 328 and 201 after the prosecution had argued that he killed her on May 7, 2020, using a cobra after drugging her.Uthra, his 25-year-old wife, suffered a bite at her home while she was undergoing treatment for another snake bite she suffered. It emerged during the investigation that the incident, involving a viper, was also orchestrated by the husband. She managed to recover from the first bite, but could not survive the second.During the probe, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) found a local snake handler Suresh, who later turned an approver. He admitted to training Sooraj to handle the snake and even providing him with the reptile. On May 6, 2020, after Uthra fell asleep, Sooraj allegedly threw the snake on her. He also provoked it to bite her twice.The case surfaced in May last year after Uthra’s parents filed a police complaint two days after her death alleging Sooraj and his family members harassed their daughter for dowry. The couple had been married for two years at the time of the murder. In an attempt to mislead investigators, Sooraj’s parents filed a counter-complaint against Uthra’s brother saying he wanted to usurp her father’s property. Uthra’s parents told the investigators that her in-laws frequently harassed her for more dowry. They said they gave 90 sovereigns of gold, ₹5 lakh cash and a car to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-court-to-announce-punishment-in-snake-bite-murder-case-today-101634096044398.html
13-10-2021||India||NTA to conduct first-ever aptitude test to map abilities of Indian learners||The National Testing Agency (NTA) has announced the first-ever aptitude test for school students and youth aged between 13 and 25 to assess their conceptual understanding in a scientific manner and help them make better career decisions. The test is part of NTA’s ongoing “exploratory research” to map the “abilities of Indian learners.”The NTA, an autonomous testing organisation under the ministry of education, will conduct the National Aptitude Test as a pilot project. Candidates for the test have been divided into four age brackets: level 1 (13-15 years), level 2 (16-18 years), level 3 (19-21 years), and level 4 (22-25 years). That means students from class sixth to those who have completed their postgraduate programmes can participate in the national-level test.The agency is targeting to cover around 5,200 candidates in the first two categories and 5,000 in the third and fourth categories during the pilot.The NTA has invited online applications from candidates, who would like to take the test. No fees will be charged for participation. The applications will be available on the NTA website till October 18. According to a notification issued on the website, tests for levels one and two will be conducted on October 23 and for level three and level four a day later.Officials said the test is in line with the new National Education Policy 2020 that recommends high-level aptitude assessments of students to help them make the right career choices. The test is likely to be conducted annually.The agency said several concerns have emerged during recent studies. “A) 65% of the jobs our students will be doing in the future do not even exist today. (b) Employers seek abilities like critical thinking, problem solving, innovations and creativity in their human capital but these abilities were deficient in about 70% school pass outs. (C) Considering the skills gap is much evident, including in digital jobs that require graduates with relevant mathematical, science and engineering backgrounds.”NTA said it believes that the right candidates joining the best institutions will give India demographic dividend. “It envisages that besides acquired knowledge and skills, it should include skills for the future that would be expected in them, say after 5 years. These are technical skills, creativity, emotional intelligence (EQ), analytical thinking, growth mind-set, decision making, interpersonal communication, and adaptability, that have been identified as skills for the future,” the agency said in the notification.Defining aptitude as an estimate of “what a person is likely to do”, the agency has developed nine domains to assess the candidates. The domains include critical reading ability, numerical ability, abstract reasoning, analytical reasoning, spatial reasoning, verbal ability, finding irregularities, data interpretation, and physical and mechanical analysis.The test will have 10 multiple-choice questions in each of the domains and candidates will be given two hours to complete it. The language of the examination will be English, and there will be no negative marking.On October 5, the agency, in a communication to the city coordinators of NTA, said it is committed to providing a platform to the students to assess their aptitude and ability in a more scientific and transparent manner. “The agency is engaged in conducting exploratory research to map the abilities of Indian learners....” The city coordinators were asked to identify 10 schools, including two government schools, two Kendriya Vidyalaya, four private schools, and two minorities or aided schools, to carry out the pilot project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nta-to-conduct-first-ever-aptitude-test-to-map-abilities-of-indian-learners-101634095897555.html

13-10-2021||India||Muslims who migrated to Pak have no respect there: Mohan Bhagwat||Noting that ancestors of all Indians are the same, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said that the Muslims who had migrated to Pakistan "have no respect there" and there is a liberal culture in India.Speaking at the launch of the book 'Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition' the RSS chief said that the person "who belongs to India will always be like that".The book has been written by Uday Mahurkar and Chirayu Pandit."After partition, the Muslims who migrated to Pakistan have no respect there. There is a liberal culture in India. This is our cultural heritage. This culture binds us together. This is the culture of Hinduism. Savarkar had written that how the saffron flag of Hindu raja and green flag of Nawab stood together against the British rule," he said.Referring to Savarkar, the Sangh chief said "Hindu nationalism" is about unity even as the country has different religious practices."Savarkarji had said that the British had understood they can only rule India by creating divisions. So they worked towards increasing radicalism. After returning from Andamans, Savarkarji wrote in his book that Hindu nationalism is about unity despite different religious practices," Bhagwat said.The Sangh chief said Britishers knew that "they had to divide and rule to survive and loot the nation" and Savarkar experienced this strategy of Britishers in Andaman prisons."Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had said that he is the son of Bharat Maa (in Lahore). It is only that his way of worship was Islam. This was the temperament of Bharat. The wave of radicalism was there in India in the past also. In history, where there was Dara Shikoh and Akbar at one side then there was Aurangzeb also who reversed the narrative. The names like Dara Shikoh, Hakim Khan Sur, Hasan Khan Mewati, Ibrahim Khan Gardi, Ashfaqulla Khan, and others should be commemorated," Bhagwat said."I recently visited Jammu and Kashmir and got to know that an initiative is being taken there to rename schools on these great revolutionaries who believed in 'Bharat'. It is a welcome move. There might be differences in ways of worship but our ancestors are the same. We cannot change the motherland," he added.Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also spoke on the occasion. Union Ministers Parshottam Rupala, Gen VK Singh (retd), SPS Baghel and Arjun Ram Meghwal were also present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslims-who-migrated-to-pak-have-no-respect-there-mohan-bhagwat-101634094725018.html
13-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Rahul Gandhi-led Congress delegation to meet President||A Congress delegation led by Rahul Gandhi will meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday over the violence in Tikunia village in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district in which eight people were killed. According to the party, the delegation will submit a memorandum on the facts of the October 3 violence to the President.Also Read | Farmers, politicians pay homage to deceased protesters in LakhimpurThe Congress had, on October 10, sought appointment with the President for a seven-member party delegation to meet him. The request was approved on Tuesday.The seven members of the delegation are Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, AK Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, KC Venugopal, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury besides Rahul Gandhi.The Congress has been attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Uttar Pradesh government over the violence, and also questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on the issue. Priyanka and Rahul, who visited the Tikunia village in Lakhimpur Kheri, where the violence took place, took a jibe at PM Modi who visited Lucknow for inaugurating development projects. The Congress leaders said the Prime Minister did not have time to visit Lakhimpur Kheri.The BJP, meanwhile, said that a lot of politics is happening around the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Naming Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that they were trying to project themselves as "champions of Dalits". "Yet, the incident of a young Dalit man in Rajasthan (ruled by the Congress) beaten to death a few days ago has gone uninvestigated and unnoticed," Patra added.Four farmers were among the eight killed in violence on October 3. Uttar Pradesh Police have so far arrested three people, including Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a body of several farmer unions, had issued a statement regarding the incident claiming that the farmers died after being run over by the vehicles of Ashish Mishra's convoy.Union minister Ajay Mishra has refuted these allegations, saying that his son was not present at the spot. However, the farmers and opposition parties, including Congress, have been demanding that he should be sacked from the Union Cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-rahul-gandhi-led-congress-delegation-to-meet-president-101634093946404.html
13-10-2021||India||‘Twitter didn’t act against handles posting anti- national posts’: J&K Police||The Jammu and Kashmir Police received no response from Twitter even as letters were written to the company in July and August seeking action against certain handles for posts “glorifying terrorism”, a person aware of the matter said.“The first letter was sent in July, where the handle of businessman Mubeen Shah was mentioned. ...it was mentioned that the handle was spreading terrorist-related data and anti-national material on a daily basis and glorifying terrorism on social media. A second letter was sent in August where five URLs of Twitter profiles were mentioned for taking action, but we got no response from the platform,” said the person, requesting anonymity.The five were reported for “anti-national posts and comments” between July 15 and 31.Among other posts flagged included Shah’s post on Facebook, where he asked Kashmiri not to rent out places to non-locals. Shah, who is based in Malaysia, was booked for sedition on the basis of this post last year.The government and security agencies say such posts tend to aggravate the situation on the ground.In response to a query on what action was taken, a Twitter spokesperson said, “Twitter has dedicated contact channels for law enforcement, and we respond to legal requests issued in compliance with applicable law. We have clear rules in place to address hateful conduct and take action when we identify accounts that violate these rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-didn-t-act-against-handles-posting-anti-national-posts-j-k-police-101634094156207.html
13-10-2021||India||Monsoon, shooting import bills: Big reasons why India is facing coal crisis||Amid concerns flagged by various state governments of shortage in supply of coal, which could lead to power crisis, the central government has stepped in. On Tuesday, PK Mishra, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, held a meeting with coal secretary Anil Kumar Jain, power secretary Alok Kumar, and railway board chairman Suneet Sharma to discuss the issue.The plan focuses on ensuring uninterrupted fuel supplies to power plants. The state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) has been asked to supply an additional 200,000 tonne of coal on a daily basis to ramp up the fossil fuel supplies to 2.1 million tonne per day.Also Read | Will curtail electricity supply to states selling power, says CentreThe meeting comes a day after Union home minister held a similar exercise with coal and power ministers and asked them to maintain the supply of coal to thermal power plants.Delhi, Punjab and Chhattisgarh are among the states which have repeatedly warned of a "critical" situation, urging the Centre to fulfill the coal requirements of power plants to avoid any disruption in service.So, what are the reasons for the current crisis? Why is India facing supply shortage? News agency ANI quoted people aware of the developments to report that there are multiple reasons for the current scenario.• First reason, according to people quoted above, is that state governments have not paid heed to coal ministry's notes (since January) to pick up and stock coal.• Rajasthan, West Bengal and Jharkhand have their own mines but they did little to extract coal, they further said. It is learnt that despite clearances, some of the state governments sat on decision and gave Covid and rains as reasons for not doing enough mining, said the people quoted above.Also Read | As concerns rise over coal shortage, Centre reassures with ‘fact-check’• Heavy rainfall, especially in the coal-producing regions of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal in September, added to the problem.• The shooting prices of imported coal also contributed to the current situation. There is a 12 per cent fall in imports of foreign coal which power companies blend to cut losses. Due to high prices, they also shifted to domestic coal.• There is also the issue of pending dues - some state governments have defaulted on payments to Coal India, said the people aware of developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-shooting-import-bills-big-reasons-why-india-is-facing-coal-crisis-101634089603536.html
13-10-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine for children: These four are on the horizon||The expert group looking at vaccine approvals on Tuesday recommended that Bharat Biotech's indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin should be given emergency use authorisation for children in the age group of two to 18 years.The recommendation is a step further towards launch of a Covid-19 vaccine for children ahead of the festival season and amid concerns over a possible third wave of infection. However, the final approval is yet to be given, which will be done by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).That step is expected to be completed within days, according to people aware of the matter.Union minister of state for health and family welfare Bharati Pravin Pawar on Tuesday said that evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine for children is under progress. "The process is on and we don't interfere in this matter. Will go ahead after discussions with experts," the minister said.There are so far only four vaccines on the horizon for children. These are:ZvCoV-D by Zydus Cadila: Approved for use in age groups 12 and above, in line with trials. However, it has not been included as part of the vaccination drive. Indigenously developed and needle-free ZyCoV-D has received EUA from the drug regulator, making it the first vaccine to be administered in the age group of 12-18 years in the country.Covaxin by Bharat Biotech: Recommended for use in ages 2 and above. This vaccine has also not yet been included as part of the vaccination drive.Corbevax by Biological E: This vaccine has been cleared for trials in children aged 5-18. The vaccine has been developed with support from the Department of Biotechnology and its PSU Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) from the preclinical stage to phase 3 studies.Covovax by Serum Institute of India (SII): It has been cleared for trials in children aged 2-18. It is the Indian version of the Novovax vaccine brought in India by the SII for children. The company's chief Adar Poonawalla said last month that he expects Covovax to be approved for those below 18 years in January or February next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-for-children-these-four-are-on-the-horizon-101634088280107.html
13-10-2021||India||Savarkar India’s first, biggest defence expert, says Rajnath Singh||Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue VD Savarkar presented India with a “robust defence and diplomatic doctrine” and was India’s biggest and first defence and strategic affairs expert in the 20th century.At an event to release a book on Savarkar in Delhi, the minister also said people who followed Marxist and Leninist ideologies accused Savarkar of being a fascist and proponent of Hindutva.“He was very forthright in saying that India’s relations with other countries should depend on how conducive they are to our security and National interests. He was clear that it did not matter what kind of government there was (in the other country) but what mattered was that country will remain a friend as long as it remained conducive to our interests,” Singh said.The minister said a campaign was unleashed to discredit him. “He was a freedom fighter and there are no two ways about it. It is not forgivable to paint him otherwise,” he added.Referring to the controversy about Savarkar’s mercy petitions to the British while he was serving a life sentence in Andaman in the 1910s, the minister said, “It was the right of a prisoner…Gandhi ji told him to do so, and in his appeal he said Savarkar should be released, just as we are peacefully fighting for freedom, he would do so too.”Singh was speaking at the launch of a book, Veer Savarkar – The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition authored by Uday Mahurkar and Chirayu Pandit.RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who also spoke on the occasion, said those who did not understand the multi-dimensional personality of Savarkar discredited him. He said Savarkar’s ideology was congruent to the idea of being able to walk together and speak in one voice even in the face of divergent political ideologies.“We believe that political difference of opinion exist and it is natural. (Mahatma) Gandhi and Savarkar had differences of opinion, no attempts should be made to disprove that…but their feelings towards each other were similar to those of compatriots who work selflessly,” he said.The Sangh has been at the forefront of denouncing the description of Savarkar as a Hindutva proponent and a polarising figure in Indian history. They have also vehemently denied that he colluded with the British or sought leniency when he was imprisoned in the cellular jail in Andaman during India’s freedom struggle.Bhagwat also sought to stress on Savarkar’s idea of inclusivity, which was reflected in his acceptance of ideological differences and following different faiths.“There is absence of correct information about Savarkar. The campaign to discredit him was started soon after Independence,” he said.He went on to say that Savarkar was not a proponent of a school of thought that says unity is not possible without uniformity. He said the attack of Savarkar is symptomatic of the attack on India’s pride. “ I was told that the real reason for the campaign to discredit him that began soon after independence was to attack Swami Vivekananda, Maharishi Aurobindo and Dayanand Saraswati…” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/savarkar-india-s-first-biggest-defence-expert-says-rajnath-singh-101634086863161.html
13-10-2021||India||Drugs case: Aryan Khan's bail plea to be heard by special NDPS court today||A special court, hearing matters related to the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, will hear the bail petition of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and others on Wednesday. The case came to the special court after a magistrate's court rejected their plea on the ground that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide on the matter.Khan and eight others were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on October 3, after a raid on a cruise ship a day before.Also Read | No drugs found on Aryan Khan; what are the accusations against him?The NDPS court had issued orders to the NCB on Monday and asked it to file its reply regarding the matter by October 13.The federal investigative agency claimed to have recovered banned drugs from some persons aboard the cruise ship, hinting at an “international drug trafficking” network which needs to be probed. Khan's legal counsel, however, maintains that he was “falsely implicated” and that the NCB has no grounds to keep him in custody since no psychotropic substances were recovered from his personal possession.But the NCB opposed the bail plea claiming that releasing Khan on bail at this stage could interfere with the ongoing investigation into the narcotics network. On Monday, the agency said that there was “no extreme urgency” to hear the bail application and sought a week to file an affidavit.At the October 8 hearing before the magistrate's court, Aryan Khan's counsel insisted that “no incriminating contraband drugs or any other material were recovered from him” and that there is nothing on record to suggest that he is “in any way connected with the production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transport, import, export or use of any psychotropic substance or the financing, illicit trafficking and/or harbouring of offenders in relation to any narcotic drugs.” It also mentioned that Aryan Khan has “strong roots in the society” and therefore is not going to abscond or flee from justice.Also Read | 20 arrested in cruise rave party case. What does this mean for Aryan Khan?However, the NCB said the investigation in the case was still on and there was quite a lot of material collected by the agency and at this stage, it needs to be seen if releasing Aryan Khan on bail would hamper the probe into the case. The NCB had last Monday claimed before a city court that “shocking and incriminating” material was recovered in WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan and two others arrested in connection with the case. Apart from Aryan Khan, four other accused in the case - Arbaaz Merchant, Munmun Dhamecha, Nupur Sateja, and Mohak Jaiswal - have also filed bail pleas in the special court.The federal investigative agency has so far arrested 20 individuals in connection with the Mumbai cruise drug raid case. Aryan Khan has been charged with offences under Sections 8(c), 20(b), 27, 28, 29, and 35 of the NDPS Act about the possession, consumption, and purchase of drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-to-be-heard-by-special-ndps-court-today-101634081722666.html
13-10-2021||India||PM Modi to launch GatiShakti master plan for modal connectivity today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday will launch 'PM GatiShakti', a national master plan for multi-modal connectivity. According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), this plan seeks to address the issue of a lack of coordination among various agencies by institutionalising holistic planning.PM Modi will also inaugurate the new exhibition complex (Exhibition Halls 2 to 5) at Pragati Maidan during the event. The India International Trade Fair (IITF), the flagship event of the India Trade Promotion Organisation, will be held in these new exhibition halls from November 14 to 27, the PMO noted.Describing it as a historic event for the nation's infrastructure landscape, the PMO on Tuesday said that the GatiShakti project will break departmental silos and institutionalise holistic planning for the stakeholders across major infrastructure projects.It further said that all departments will have visibility of each other's projects through a centralised portal and the multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for the movement of people, goods and services. "On the auspicious occasion of Maha Ashtami, tomorrow, 13th October at 11 AM, the PM GatiShakti - National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity will be launched. Here are the details about why this initiative is special," PM Modi tweeted on Tuesday.The PMO said that GatiShakti is based on the six pillars of comprehensiveness, prioritisation, optimisation, synchronisation and being analytical and dynamic. It will generate large-scale employment opportunities, cut down logistics costs, improve supply chains and make local goods competitive globally.Noting that infrastructure creation suffered in the nation for decades from multiple issues, including a lack of coordination between different departments, the PMO cited the example of newly-constructed roads being dug up by other agencies for activities like laying of underground cables, gas pipelines etc. "This not only caused great inconvenience but was also a wasteful expenditure," the PMO said, adding that measures have been put in place to improve coordination.The PMO further said that steps have also been taken to address other issues such as a time-taking approval process and multiplicity of regulatory clearances etc. It asserted that in the last seven years, the government has ensured unprecedented focus on infrastructure through a holistic outlook.Instead of planning and designing separately in silos, the projects will now be designed and executed with a common vision and will incorporate the infrastructure schemes of various ministries and state governments like Bharatmala, Sagarmala and inland waterways, the PMO stated.“Economic zones like textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters and agri zones will be covered to improve connectivity and make Indian businesses more competitive,” the PMO said.According to the PMO, GatiShakti is the result of PM Modi's constant endeavour to build next-generation infrastructure, which improves ease of living as well as ease of doing business. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for the movement of people, goods and services from one mode of transport to another and it will facilitate the last-mile connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce travel time for people.GatiShakti will provide the public and the business community information regarding upcoming connectivity projects, other business hubs, industrial areas and the surrounding environment and also enable the investors to plan their businesses at suitable locations, leading to enhanced synergies, the PMO stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-gatishakti-master-plan-for-modal-connectivity-today-101634081675803.html

13-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur: Farmers, politicians pay homage to deceased protesters, journalist||Thousandsof farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and other parts of Uttar Pradesh, farm leaders and political leaders converged in Lakhimpur’s Tikunia village for the ‘antim ardas’ (final prayers) of the four farmers and a journalist killed in the October 3 violence.The ‘antim ardas’ for the four deceased farmers, Daljeet Singh and Gurvinder Singh of Bahraich district, Nachhattar Singh of Dhaurahra (Lakhimpur) and Lovepreet Singh of Pallia (Lakhimpur) and journalist Raman Kashyap of Nighasan (Lakhimpur) was held amidst heavy police presence. The units of the police, Provincial Armed Constabulary and Rapid Action Force were deputed near the venue to ensure law and order and avert any untoward incident.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, UP Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary and Samajwadi Party leaders including its district president Rampal Singh Yadav were among those who paid tribute to the deceased.Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Bharatiya Kisan Union leaders Rakesh Tikait, Darshan Singh Pal, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Dharmendra Malik besides local farm union leaders also arrived in the village to pay tributes.Paying homage to the deceased, farmer leaders reiterated their demand for the arrest of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni. “Insaf tabhi hoga jab mantri giraftar hoga (Justice will be done only after the minister (junior minister for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni) is arrested,” said a local farm leader, Joginder Singh.Notably, farm unions blame Mishra and his son Ashish for the October 3 incident in which a convoy of vehicles belonging to the junior home minister ploughed through farmers returning from a protest. The UP police arrested Ashish Mishra in connection with the case on Saturday.Family members of the deceased farmers also reiterated the same demand. “The police cannot conduct a fair investigation till minister Ajay Mishra resigns from his post and is arrested for criminal conspiracy that resulted in the violence,” said Gurjinder Singh, uncle of deceased farmer Gurvinder Singh.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws started last year. The farmers were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers travelling to welcome deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to the area. The remaining deceased -- two BJP workers, a journalist and a driver -- were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and then lynched by angry protesters.Meanwhile, the police on Tuesday arrested the fourth accused, Ashish’s accomplice, Ankit Das’ driver Shekhar Bharti, who was allegedly driving the black car behind Mishra’s car that allegedly mowed down four farmers.Last week, the police said names of total six accused surfaced during the course of investigation. Apart from Bharti and Ashish, latter’s two accomplices Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey have also been arrested. The police said that three other accused, including Mishra’s driver and two BJP workers, were killed during the violenceThe police, on Tuesday, also took the main accused, Ashish Mishra into three day custody after the court order on Monday, for further interrogation to crime branch while Ankit Das filed his surrender application in a local court on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-farmers-politicians-pay-homage-to-deceased-protesters-journalist-101634076670135.html
13-10-2021||India||PMO draws up plan to ensure supply of coal to power plants||The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has drawn up a plan to ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies to power plants even as the Union power ministry issued a directive that unallocated electricity supply will be snapped to states selling power on exchanges at higher rates instead of supplying to their customers.Two government officials familiar with the matter said that the plan — discussed in a meeting on Tuesday held by PK Mishra, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, and attended by coal secretary Anil Kumar Jain, power secretary Alok Kumar, and railway board chairman Suneet Sharma — involves the state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) supplying an additional 200,000 tonne of coal on a daily basis to ramp up the fossil fuel supplies to 2.1 million tonne per day.Also Read| ‘No power outage in Delhi, AAP ensuring supply via gas-based electricity’: JainIt was also decided to facilitate operationalising the imported coal fuelled power generation capacity of 17.06 gigawatt (GW) to help ease the pressure on domestic coal fuelled power projects, they added.The meeting at the PMO followed home minister Amit Shah’s meeting with coal minister Pralhad Joshi and power minister Raj Kumar Singh on Monday amid concerns by some states that depleted coal stocks at power plants may lead to blackouts. The power ministry on Sunday said “any fear of disruption in power supply is entirely misplaced”.Officials said that Indian Railways will provide the additional rakes for the transportation of coal. Mint reported on Tuesday that extra supply will be ensured by Coal India Ltd (CIL). India has the world’s fourth largest reserves and is the second-largest producer of coal.“An additional 60 railway rakes carrying coal will be supplied by CIL that will increase supplies by an additional 2 lakh tonnes of coal. The total coal supply at thermal power plants was 1.9 mt on Monday and with this additional supply, it will go up to 2.1 mt. This quantum is expected to be reached by 20 October. With the supplies being increased, the coal depletion at the plants has stopped and will help towards building up stocks,” said one of the two government officials cited above on condition of anonymity.Queries emailed to the spokespersons of the PMO and ministries of power, coal and railway on late Tuesday night remained unanswered till press time.Also Read| As concerns rise over coal shortage, Centre reassures with ‘fact-check’In a letter to all state governments and distribution companies (discoms), the Union ministry of power requested all states and UTs to utilise unallocated power of the central generating stations (CGS) to meet the requirement of their own consumers only. In case of excess power, it asked the states to inform the ministry, so that the electricity can be diverted to needy states. “It has been observed that some states are not supplying power to their consumers and imposing load shedding in some areas. At the same time, they are also selling power in the power exchange at a high price,” read the letter signed by deputy secretary, GoI, Devashis Bose, without naming any state.While CIL’s annual production target is 670 mt for the current fiscal, the coal offtake is expected to be 740 mt. The miner started the year with a 99 mt stock, and the current coal stock available for supply at CIL mines is 40 mt.There are a number of reasons for the current situation. International prices of coal have surged, increasing the demand for local coal. Power demand, and therefore the derived demand for coal, has increased sharply in the past couple of months, perhaps a reflection of pent-up demand on account of the disruption from the second wave of the pandemic in April-May and a surge in activity ahead of the festival season. Heavy rainfall, especially in the coal-producing regions of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal in September, added to the problems. This also comes at a time of China facing crippling power shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmo-draws-up-plan-to-ensure-supply-of-coal-to-power-plants-101634076732237.html
13-10-2021||India||Domestic flights to operate at 100% capacity from Oct 18||The Union ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) on Tuesday allowed domestic flights to fly with 100% capacity from October 18 onwards, coinciding with what is usually the beginning of the peak season for the aviation business in the country.The ministry reduced the permissible capacity to 50% with effect from June 1 due to the second wave of the pandemic. It increased it to 72.5% with effect from August 12, and further to 85.% with effect from September 18. The passenger traffic has increased from around 3.1 million in June to 6.9 million in September. Most airlines say their busier routes are seeing an average occupancy of 70.2%.According to DGCA data, average load factor of six major airlines in August was 70.2%. IndiGo said its current load factor is 75% to 80% and average daily flights is around 1,200.IndiGo said it is happy with government’s decision to allow airlines to operate with full capacity from October 18.“It is a welcome move as we believe that with recent pent-up demand combined with the upcoming festive season, it will be great to operate flights on pre-pandemic levels. We are quite bullish about the overall growth and demand for domestic travel,” IndiGo spokesperson said.The ministry’s announcement comes against the backdrop of business activities returning to normal — the Nomura India Business Resumption Index or NIBRI crossed 100 for the first time in the week ended August 15, 2021 — and with some people even returning to the office, and with the average of cases and deaths falling. The 7-day average of cases was 19,018 on October 11, the lowest since early March and that of deaths, 244, the lowest since late March.Airlines have been lobbying for an increase in capacity for several months and welcome Tuesday’s announcement.“Vistara welcomes the Government’s decision to remove the capacity cap. We believe that it will be helpful in accelerating recovery from the severe impacts of the pandemic as demand continues to grow, especially with the growing confidence in air travel and the much-awaited festive season,” said Vistara spokesperson.Tuesday’s circular read, ‘...it has been decided to restore the scheduled domestic air operations with effect from 18 without any capacity restriction.’However, scheduled international operations continue to remain suspended further till October 31. International operations under the Vande Bharat Mission will however continue.Suprio Banerjee, vice-president and sector head of ratings agency ICRA, said, “In ICRA’s view this is a step in right direction, given on a sequential basis from June 2021 there has been a steady rise in domestic passenger traffic on month-on-month basis, reflecting pick up in leisure and corporate travel to an extent compared to necessary travel when the second wave of Covid-19 hit. With onset of the festive and tourist season... 100% permissible capacity will allow the airlines to serve a wider market and in turn will encourage air travel.”Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder of EaseMyTrip, said, “...we believe the lifting of capacity restrictions will have a positive impact on airline partners to rise from the challenges that they have been facing over the past year and a half.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flights-to-operate-at-100-capacity-from-oct-18-101634076334390.html
13-10-2021||India||‘It will return to haunt you’: India attacks Pak over terror||Forces of extremism, radicalisation and violence “come back to haunt those who nurture them,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday in a thinly veiled attack on Pakistan’s support for cross-border terrorism.Jaishankar also used his speech at a meeting of foreign ministers of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Kazakhstan to target China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations must be at the heart of all connectivity projects, he said.His remarks came against the backdrop of mounting concerns in New Delhi over Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15. India has also opposed initiatives under BRI, such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), because a key stretch passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Jaishankar described terrorism as the “biggest enemy” of the common goal of peace and development for members of CICA, a multinational forum for cooperation to promote security and stability in Asia that was established under Kazakhstan’s leadership in 1999.“In this day and age, we cannot countenance its [terrorism’s] use by one state against another. Cross-border terrorism is not statecraft; it is simply another form of terrorism,” Jaishankar said in an apparent reference to Pakistan.“The international community must unite against this menace, as seriously as it does on issues like climate change and pandemics. Any calculation that extremism, radicalisation, violence, and bigotry can be used to advance interests is a very short-sighted one. Such forces will come back to haunt those who nurture them,” he said.Any lack of stability in the region will undermine collective efforts to bring the Covid-19 pandemic under control, and the “situation in Afghanistan is, therefore, of grave concern”, he added.Jaishankar also raised the situation in Afghanistan when the foreign ministers of CICA states collectively called on Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.He said on Twitter that he had underlined CICA’s relevance in addressing challenges such as terrorism, pandemics and protection of global commons, and highlighted that “Afghanistan developments have generated understandable concern”. CICA can be a positive factor in shaping a global response, he said.During his speech at the CICA foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar also said Asia suffers from a “deficit of connectivity”, which is needed to promote economic and social activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-will-return-to-haunt-you-india-attacks-pak-over-terror-101634067797475.html
13-10-2021||India||NIA raids in Delhi-NCR in Mundra drug haul case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday carried out raids at five locations in Delhi and Noida in connection with the 3,000 kg Afghan heroin consignment seized from Mundra port last month.The drug haul, worth an estimated ₹21,000 crore, was the largest ever seizure in India. NIA is investigating a narco-terror link as the heroin was sent to India from Kandahar after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan on August 15.The places raided include residential premises of some suspects and godowns at Lajpat Nagar, Alipur, Khera Kalan in New Delhi and Noida, the federal anti-terror agency said in a statement.The premises were linked to individuals, including some Afghan nationals, under investigation in the case, an official said, requesting anonymity.The consignment was intercepted by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on September 14 and 15 on the basis of specific intelligence that high-quality heroin was being smuggled in two containers from Afghanistan to Gujarat’s Mundra port via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port.The two containers checked by India’s apex anti-smuggling agency had 1,999.58 kg and 988.64 kg heroin packed and layered between talc stones to avoid detection by security and customs officials. HT exclusively reported the seizure on September 20.At least eight people, including Chennai couple Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and Machavaram Sudhakar, who allegedly imported the heroin concealed in semi-processed talc stones through their Vijaywada-registered Aashi Trading Company from a Kandahar-based company; four Afghan nationals; and an Uzbek woman and others have been arrested by the DRI so far.The home ministry transferred the case to NIA last week to probe any Taliban-Pakistan connection.Vaishali and Sudhakar are said to be small players as they got only ₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh commission for allegedly allowing to use their talc stones containers to smuggle heroin. A larger network of Afghan nationals is suspected to be behind the consignment, an officer said .There are 800 to 900 mid- and high-level drugs traffickers and syndicates in Afghanistan, according to estimates by the United Nations. Kandahar is among the provinces, along with Helmand, Badghis, Uruzgan and Faryab, where the country’s major poppy cultivation takes place. Heroin is processed from poppy.The potential opium production in Afghanistan in 2020 was estimated at 6,300 tonnes and the average opium yield was 28.0 kg per hectare, UN data suggest. The country produces over 85% of the world’s opium.The total area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was estimated at 224,000 hectares in 2020, which represented an increase of 37%, or 61,000 hectares, compared with 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-raids-in-delhi-ncr-in-mundra-drug-haul-case-101634066239773.html
13-10-2021||India||2023 assembly elections will be my last, says Kumaraswamy||JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy on Tuesday said that the 2023 assembly elections in Karnataka will be his last, and sought an opportunity from the people to independently run a government for five years, so as to implement programmes for the larger public good.“I have been the Chief Minister twice with your blessings. I have decided that the 2023 assembly election will be my last fight. It is not for me to come to power or become the Chief Minister. With the blessings of God, I have already been Chief Minister twice, despite not having a majority,” Kumaraswamy said.Speaking to party workers and the public, he sought their blessings and support in bringing JD(S) to power independently, for implementing ‘Pancharatna’, the five fold programme envisaged by him that include quality education, health, housing, farmer welfare and employment.“I’m marching ahead with a challenge...I request you with folded hands to give us (JDS) an opportunity to run an independent government in this state for five years. I seek your blessings,” the former Chief Minister added.JD(S) has already announced “mission 123” (winning 123 seats in the 224 member assembly) to bring the party to power, after the 2023 assembly polls.Pointing at farm loan waiver announced by him as chief minister of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government and a beneficiary farmer from Hangal inviting him for his housewarming ceremony, Kumaraswamy said... “but our farmers forget Kumaranna (as he is popularly called) while voting, this is the situation we are in.” “Give one opportunity to the party you have nurtured, bless us to form a government on our own strength, believing in me....If I don’t live up to my words on implementing Pancharatna, I will never come to you again, seeking votes for my party. Test us, you have seen both BJP and Congress,” he added.Kumaraswamy had headed a coalition government with both national parties in the past, for 20-months with BJP from February 2006 and with Congress for 14-months after the May 2018 assembly polls.Earlier in the day, speaking to reporters, the JD(S) leader claimed that the recent Income Tax raids specifically on a person who is said to be former CM B S Yediyurappa’s Personal Assistant and Water Resources department related contractors, was an attempt by the BJP to “control” Yediyurappa, following his alleged late night meeting with Congress leader Siddaramaiah. “Anyone with the slightest understanding of politics can understand that the recent IT raids were for what reasons....IT raids were with a political motive...it is to control or checkmate Yediyurappa...as both (Siddaramaiah and Yediyurappa) had a late night meeting about political developments, and the BJP that has government both at Centre and state got to know about it from their sources, and probably have tightened things,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2023-assembly-elections-will-be-my-last-says-kumaraswamy-101634066062631.html
13-10-2021||India||3.5 magnitude quake hits Kalaburagi district in Karnataka||An earthquake measuring 3.5 magnitude in richters scale shook parts of Kalaburagi district on Tuesday, however, no loss of life or damage to property has been reported, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) in a statement said. This is the fourth earthquake reported in Kalaburagi in the last few days. On Monday, authorities had recorded a 4.0 magnitude earthquake in the same district around 11.10 am. However, the intensity of Monday’s earthquake was felt in a radial distance of 50-60 kms, authorities said. The first tremor was on October 1.This is the sixth earthquake to hit north Karnataka region around Bidar and Kalaburagi since October 1. While two had occurred in Basavakalyan on October 1 and 5, four were recorded in Kalaburagi on October 9, 11 and 12.In a statement, the KSNDMC said that Tuesday’s earthquake occurred around 8.07 am and measured 3.5 on the richters scale. “As per seismic intensity map of the earthquake from the epicentre, the intensity observed is low and the earthquake might be felt up to a maximum radial distance of 7-12 kms. These type of earthquakes do not create any harm to the community, although some tremors can be felt locally. The community need not panic as the intensity observed is low and not destructive,” the KSNDMC said. The epicentre was 1.6 kms of Kupnoor Grama Panchayat in Chincholi taluk of Kalaburagi, it said. “These are very minor events. They are local adjustments or intra-plate activity or activity within plates. People should be alert, but we cannot say whether this will lead to a higher-intensity earthquake. Earthquakes cannot be predicted,” said JL Gautam, head of operations at National Centre for Seismology (NCS). Manoj Rajan, the commissioner of the KSNDMC said that agency’s scientific personnel have visited the affected areas and have taken up field surveys in and around these regions of Vijayapura & Kalaburagi districts and have created awareness among the people as they were in panic. “We have requested director, National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) to depute a team of scientists to conduct a detailed survey on earthquakes in and around Vijayapura & Kalaburagi districts and submit its report,” Rajan told Hindustan Times on Tuesday. Authorities have reached out to the mines and geology department to understand the phenomena and also raise awareness among the people who have been living in constant fear over the recent events. Rajan said that the phenomenon related to the occurence of micro tremors originating from shallow depths is associated with subterranean sounds which was experienced between 2006-2009 at Hasargundgi, Yelakapalli, Yempalli, Chimanchod of Chincholi taluk and Kalaburgi district. “During 2010 to 2014, 25 micro tremors in Vijayapura of magnitude 1.2 to 3.1 have been reported by the Permanent Seismic Monitoring Stations Network established by KSNDMC along with subterranean sounds. In Kalaburgi, during 2016, two micro tremors of magnitude 1.5 and 1.6 respectively has been reported and in Bidar during 2017, 3 micro tremors of magnitude 2.0 to 2.2 have been reported by the KSNDMC Network,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35-magnitude-quake-hits-kalaburagi-district-in-karnataka-101634066061473.html
13-10-2021||India||Karnataka launches NEP in engineering colleges||Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai on Tuesday launched the National Education Policy (NEP-2020) in engineering colleges which the former referred to as big reform in technical education in the state.Bommai said that internet technology has broken all shackles and multidisciplinary learning is the need of the hour.“The new NEP-2020 policy to incorporate it in engineering education, curriculum on par to make Karnataka a destination for technical education, four-year BSc honours and engineering education in Kannada medium. Such a big reform has never happened in Karnataka’s technical education,” Bommai said on Tuesday.The ‘Destination Karnataka for Technical Education’ initiative has been done with the aim to produce a better quality of talent pool in the state, the government said.Karnataka has been speeding up the implementation of NEP despite opposition from various quarters over the contentious policy mooted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) union government.“The world has already moved from the age of ‘percentage’ to (the) age of ‘percentile. Educational institutes of the state should closely observe this and adapt accordingly,” according to a statement from the higher education minister, attributing the quote to Bommai.Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, Karnataka’s minister for higher education minister said the curriculum of BE and B.Sc. honours has been designed on par with IIT and IISc respectively along the lines of NEP.“Now, 66 engineering colleges have been given approval to commence B.Sc. honours course. As a mark of India completing 75 years of Independence, the government aims to start B.Sc. honours in 75 colleges,” the minister said.Narayan said that the campaign, “Destination Karnataka” for Technical Education, 4 years B.Sc. honours programme in engineering colleges and teaching-learning of engineering in Kannada were also launched on Tuesday.In August this year, the Karnataka government had launched the admission module through the Unified University & College Management System.Narayan had at the time said that all the information regarding major subjects, minor subjects, core electives, open electives, vocational training among others will be provided in this module.Karnataka has made no secret of its goals to be the first to implement the contentious policy among all other states in the country.“In all 32 subject-wise and faculty-wise committees have been constituted to prepare the curriculum as per the NEP principles. For the current year, the curriculum has to be prepared for 1st year of degree courses and 1st year of post-graduation courses before the commencement of classes by the 1st week of October,” Narayan had stated on August 9.The Karnataka government has defended the policy stating that the NEP will bring in flexibility in learning and teaching process by eliminating the rigidities and it will allow students to design their own courses based on their interest.The government has also tried to allay fears that the NEP will further impose Hindi on non-Hindi speaking states. He had earlier stated that regional languages like Kannada will be strengthened by adopting this policy as the language would be mandatory.The Karnataka government on Tuesday also said that it would ensure that there would be no power outages in the state on account of the shortage of coal.Bommai said that he has spoken to all stakeholders, including union ministers and two additional rakes will come to Karnataka to compensate for any shortage.“Now there is no power cut. We will ensure that there is no power cut in the coming days,” he said. The minister said that there was a shortage due to the heavy rains that led to stalling of loading rakes in states like Odisha and the situation was now sorted with rakes headed Karnataka’s way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-launches-nep-in-engineering-colleges-101634066059805.html
13-10-2021||India||Four killed as heavy rains pound Kerala||Heavy rainfall due to a low pressure system in the Arabian Sea lashed many parts of Kerala on Tuesday, claiming four lives, two of them children. The India Metrological Department has issued high alerts as many rivers and dams were filled to the brim. State authorities have shifted people living along river banks and low-lying areas to relief camps. At Karippur in Malappuram district, two children — eight-month-old Rizawna and seven-year-old Rinsana — died after a wall of their house collapsed due to heavy rain and winds when they were asleep, police said. Though they were taken out immediately by local people, they could not be saved. Their mother escaped with minor injuries. In Kollam, 65-year-old Govindarajan died after he fell into a flooded stream, while a local journalist — 52-year-old K Radhakrishan — died in Pandalam after a tree fell on his bike, police said. The Met department has issued orange alert in six districts and yellow alert in four districts till Thursday. State authorities have advised fishermen not to venture out to sea, while travellers have been asked to avoid travelling at night in hilly areas. In Idukki, the district administration has banned night travel till Thursday. The district had witnessed several landslides in the past two years, including one in August last year when 70 people were killed after a major landslide decimated a colony of plantation workers in Pettimudi. Incidents of waterlogging were reported in many areas in Kollam, Kochi and Kozhikode districts while vehicular traffic was disrupted in many parts of Alapzuha district. Services were suspended on the Kollam-Chengotta rail line after a landslip. The state government was closely monitoring the situation and district collectors have been asked to open relief camps in affected areas, revenue minister K Rajan said. The Met department said multiple weather conditions in the Andaman Bay and Arabian Sea triggered heavy rain, which is expected to continue till Friday. Another low-pressure is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal by Wednesday under its influence. “In some areas, rainfall will be as high as 20 cm. We are separately monitoring the situation in dam-catchment areas. Rainy situation will prevail till Friday,” said K Santhosh, regional Met director in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-killed-as-heavy-rains-pound-kerala-101634065519679.html
13-10-2021||India||Kerala Cong revamp delayed, senior leaders to be consulted||The organisational revamping in Kerala Congress has been further delayed after senior leaders V M Sudheeran, who recently resigned from the Congress, and former PCC chief Mullapally Ramachandran, among others, expressed reservations over the proposed state office-bearers’ list. Party state president K Sudhakaran, who was in New Delhi last week to finalise the list, returned to the state capital without the list on Tuesday. Sudhakaran said he would be talking to the concerned leaders to avoid a fiasco similar to when the party announced the district Congress committee (DCC) presidents list. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal clarified that he was not behind the delay after a section of leaders blamed him. Talking to a news channel on Tuesday, he rejected charges by a section of Kerala Congress that he was cultivating his group in the faction-ridden party. “It is completely wrong. There is a tendency to put everything on me if anything happens in the state unit. Our only aim is to strengthen the party in the state,” he said on Tuesday. The announcement of the new DCC presidents’ list by Sudhakaran sent Kerala Congress into a frenzy, with disciplinary action against several leaders, and some leaders resigned over their disagreement with the list. Senior leaders like former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala also aired their displeasure in public. After a poor show in the April assembly elections, the party was forced to carry out major surgery in the state unit. It decided to clip the wings of two powerful groups and elevated a new crop of leaders. K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Kannur, became the PCC president, and another popular leader V D Satheesan was appointed as the opposition leader, sidelining two powerful blocs led by Chandy and Chennithala who ruled the party for more than a decade. Currently, the PCC has 100-odd secretaries, several vice-presidents and other office-bearers. But the new PCC will have only 50 members, said Sudhakaran, adding he’s planning to transform the party into a semi-cadre organisation, and hard work and organising capacity will be only criteria for leaders, not their factional affiliations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cong-revamp-delayed-senior-leaders-to-be-consulted-101634065462291.html
13-10-2021||India||Given nod for withdrawal of Sabarimala cases: Kerala CM Vijayan||The Kerala government has granted permission to withdraw cases of non-criminal nature registered during the Sabarimala agitation in the aftermath of the Supreme Court verdict three years ago, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the assembly on Tuesday. He said cases registered during the Citizenship Amendment Act stir in the state in 2019 will also be withdrawn. Responding to a question raised by opposition leader V D Satheesan, the CM said the state has directed the police chief, district police superintendents and district collectors to examine the nature of cases, after which a special committee will evaluate them and recommend suitable cases for withdrawal. A final decision would be taken by the concerned courts, Vijayan said, adding the procedure will be expedited. “The government issued the order in this regard in February itself. But the state has limitations on this since it is falling under the purview of the judiciary. We will do everything possible to expedite this,” he said. Before the assembly elections in April, the government had decided to withdraw 2000-odd cases registered during the 2018-19 Sabarimala agitation, but formalities dragged. The opposition leader sought the attention of the chief minister, saying that many people are forced to frequent courts and it was affecting youngsters badly. Most of the people were booked for just participating in the hymn-chanting sessions during the peak of the stir. “Though the government announced its decision before the assembly election nothing happened on the ground. Many affected are still struggling with cases,” Satheesan said. The state had witnessed large-scale violence, and five shutdowns in 2018 after the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to the hilltop temple, annulling an age-old bar on women of reproductive age. For the first time in the history of the state, more than 50,000 people were booked in connection with the agitation. After widespread protests in 2019, the SC referred the case to a nine-member bench and a final verdict is pending. The former chief minister and Congress leader Oommen Chandy had recently written a letter to Vijayan asking him to approach the Supreme Court to speed up the verdict, and withdraw its earlier affidavit that favoured entry of women of all ages. He said the Kerala government’s fresh affidavit in the apex court in 2016 created much confusion, which ultimately led to the five-bench verdict in 2018. The Nair Service Society, a socio-cultural organization of upper caste Nairs, which took a proactive role during the agitation, had also asked the chief minister to withdraw cases against those who participated in the agitation. Its secretary G Sukumaran Nair had cited the plight of youngsters and the elderly. But Bindu Ammini, one of only two women who entered Sabarimala three years ago, said she was worried that even some progressive outfits diluted their stance for vote bank politics. The college teacher said she expected a steady stream of women to the temple after her entry, but it never happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/given-nod-for-withdrawal-of-sabarimala-cases-kerala-cmvijayan-101634065461089.html
13-10-2021||India||Agencies search, former Mumbai commissioner Param Bir Singh still not traced||Law enforcement agencies in Maharashtra have no clue about the whereabouts of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who has been incommunicado for past two months even as speculation rages that he has left the country.A team from Maharashtra crime investigation department (CID) has visited Singh’s known addresses: his official residence in Mumbai, family home in Chandigarh, and a house in Rohtak, Haryana. It also visited a hospital in Chandigarh to check if Singh was admitted there as he sought extension of his sick leave, claiming he needed surgery.Another team from Mumbai police visited his private residence in Vile Parle and sent him notices on two of his known email accounts.After all this, Singh remains untraced, has chosen not to reply to any of the emails, and dodged a summons to appear before the police on Tuesday.An Indian Police Service (IPS) officer who asked not to be named said that Singh hasn’t opened the emails. His last known location was Chandigarh, the officer said.Some police officers claimed that Singh might have escaped the country even before a so-called lookout notice was issued on August 12. Such a notice effectively prevents anyone from legally leaving the country.“There is a possibility that he might have used the Nepal route to escape the country. There is also a possibility that he might have travelled to Andaman and from there flown to another country. But there is no specific information as such,” said a senior Maharashtra police officer who asked not to be named.Other senior officers insist that an IPS officer as senior as Singh would not flee from the country in such a manner.Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil said on October 1 that “any civil service officer needs the approval of the central government (for leaving the country). The Union home ministry is also searching for his whereabouts. We have no clue about his whereabouts as of now and we too are searching for him.”Singh was removed from the post of Mumbai police commissioner on March 17 following his handling of the Antilia explosives scare and the murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. He was shifted to Maharashtra home guards on March 22.He subsequently lashed out against then state home minister Anil Deshmukh in a letter to the chief minister, and also sought legal redress over his transfer.On April 7, Singh appeared before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to record his statement in the two cases. He was subsequently summoned by the federal agency, but did not appear before it.Singh last attended his office on May 4, and went on leave from May 5, citing health issues.Thereafter he communicated with the Maharashtra home department, requesting extension of his leave due to health issues. He claimed to have undergone a surgery. In mid-August, he again requested extension of leave over health grounds.It was the last anyone heard from him, said another senior police officer requesting anonymity||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agencies-search-former-mumbai-commissioner-param-bir-singh-still-not-traced-101634064920165.html
13-10-2021||India||Modi to launch ‘PM GatiShakti’ infrastructure initiative today||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday will launch ‘PM GatiShakti’ — the national master plan for multi-modal connectivity —which will institutionalise holistic planning of major infrastructure projects, hitherto planned and designed in silos, Union commerce and industry ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Infrastructure creation in India suffered for decades from multiple issues, including lack of coordination between different departments, the statement said, citing the example of current practice of road construction, which is often dug up by other agencies to lay underground cables and gas pipelines. “In order to address this issue, save time and cost and shield the common man from inconveniences, the government has put in place a coordinated efforts of 16 ministries and departments under the PM GatiShakti,” a senior official of the ministry said requesting anonymity. “Instead of planning and designing separately in silos, the projects will be designed and executed with a common vision,” the official added. The initiative will have coordinated efforts in infrastructure related to airways, highways, waterways, and ports. It will also rope in users such as economic zones such as textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters and agri zones. The effort will make Indian businesses more competitive, the official said. The high-technology online system is developed by Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BiSAG-N) and based on six pillars — comprehensiveness, prioritisation, optimisation, synchronisation, analytical and dynamic, said the ministry’s statement. “PM GatiShakti will include all the existing and planned initiatives of various ministries and departments with one centralised portal. Thus, different agencies will be able to prioritise their projects through cross–sectoral interactions and help them in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost,” it added. The system will help in synchronising activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance in a holistic manner by ensuring coordination of work between them. It will provide the entire data at one place with GIS-based spatial planning and analytical tools having over 200 layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency, the statement said. It will facilitate ministries and departments to visualise, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and progress of the projects will be updated on a regular basis on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan, the statement added. “PM GatiShakti is the result of Prime Minister’s constant endeavour to build Next Generation Infrastructure which improves Ease of Living as well as Ease of Doing Business,” the commerce minister statement said. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for movement of people, goods and services from one mode of transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce travel time for people, it added. PM GatiShakti will provide the public and business community information regarding the upcoming connectivity projects, business hubs, industrial areas and surrounding environment. This will enable the investors to plan their businesses at suitable locations leading to enhanced synergies. “It will create multiple employment opportunities and give a boost to the economy,” the statement said. “It will improve the global competitiveness of local products by cutting down the logistics costs and improving the supply chains, and also ensure proper linkages for local industry and consumers,” it added. PM will also inaugurate the New Exhibition Complex (Exhibition Halls 2 to 5) at Pragati Maidan during the event. India Trade Promotion Organisation’s (ITPO) flagship event, India International Trade Fair (IITF) 2021 will also be held from November 14-27, 2021 in these new exhibition halls. Union ministers for commerce, road transport and highways, railways, civil aviation, shipping, power, and petroleum will also be present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-launch-pm-gatishakti-infrastructure-initiative-today-101634064739720.html
13-10-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi calls for unified effort on Afghanistan at G 20 summit||Only a unified response by the world community will ensure the desired change in the situation in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday against the backdrop of a looming humanitarian crisis and the Taliban’s efforts to gain international acceptance.In his virtual address to a G20 extraordinary summit on Afghanistan, Modi emphasised the need to ensure that Afghan soil doesn’t become a source of terrorism. He also called for an inclusive administration in Kabul to preserve the socioeconomic gains of the past two decades.Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi hosted the special summit of the Group of 20 major economies amid growing concerns about the excesses of the Taliban setup in Kabul, and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, including shortages of food, medicines and other essential goods.Since the Taliban took over after the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, Afghanistan’s economy has been under severe stress. A team led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been holding talks with US officials and European Union (EU) envoys in Qatar as part of the Taliban’s stepped up efforts to gain international recognition.Modi called on the international community to “forge a unified international response without which it would be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan’s situation”, the external affairs ministry said.He “underlined the need to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally”, and called on the world community to enhance the “joint fight against the nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and arms in the region”.Modi also called for an “inclusive administration in Afghanistan, which includes women and minorities”, to preserve the socioeconomic gains of the past 20 years and to restrict the spread of radical ideology.The Prime Minister backed the UN’s important role in Afghanistan and sought renewed support from the G20 group for UN Security Council resolution 2593.Resolution 2593, adopted when India held the rotating presidency of the Security Council in August, demands that Afghan soil should not be used to threaten or attack any country, or to shelter or train terrorists. It also calls for combating terror in Afghanistan, including UN-designated individuals and entities – a key demand of India, which has strong concerns about the presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters on Afghan territory.The resolution also calls on all parties in Afghanistan to seek an inclusive and negotiated political settlement, with the full participation of women.The international community, Modi said, should ensure that Afghanistan has immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. Noting that the Afghan people have a “great feeling of friendship” for India, he said that “every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition”.Modi also referred to the centuries-old people-to-people ties between India and Afghanistan and said that over the past two decades, India has promoted socio-economic development and capacity-building for Afghan youth and women. He recalled that India had implemented more than 500 development projects in Afghanistan.The summit was convened by Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20. The meeting discussed a response to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan, security and the fight against terrorism, and mobility and human rights.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen presented an Afghan support package worth one billion euros during the summit to prevent what she described as “humanitarian and socio-economic collapse”. She said while the EU has been clear about the conditions for any engagement with the setup in Kabul, the Afghan people “should not pay the price of the Taliban’s actions”.Chinese President Xi Jinping did not join the G20 summit and it wasn’t clear if Russian President Vladimir Putin would participate, reflecting the differing approaches to the situation in Afghanistan. While Western countries want to demand accountability from the Taliban, China and Russia have adopted a position of non-interference.In recent weeks, India has cautioned the world community not to rush into recognising the Taliban setup, pointing out that the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-calls-for-unified-effort-on-afghanistan-at-g-20-summit-101634064444115.html

Her parents alleged that a teacher raped her, and accused the college authorities of trying to hide the crime by making her sign a statement defending the teacher.The district court in Rajasthan’s Bikaner district convicted Pragya Prateek Shukla, the principal of the college where the victim studied, his wife Priya Shukla, the warden of the hostel where the victim resided, and Vijendra Singh, the physical education teacher who raped the victim.Pragya Prateek Shukla and Priya Shukla were each sentenced to six years in jail for abetment of suicide and fined R 20,000. Vijendra Singh was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined R20,000 each.“Justice has been served after five long years,” said Anwar Ahmed, the victim’s lawyer.Vivek Sharma, who represented the Shuklas, said that they will appeal the judgment in the Rajasthan high court. “We believe there was no hard evidence to convict my clients,” he said.Singh was convicted for abetment to suicide, abduction, rape, and under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.Pragya Prateek Shukla and Priya Shukla were convicted for abetment of suicide and under the SC/ST and Pocso acts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/college-teacher-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-for-dalit-minor-girl-s-rape-in-rajasthan-101634064379659.html
13-10-2021||India||Will curtail electricity supply of states, UTs selling power: Centre||The Centre on Tuesday warned states and Union Territories that it will curtain electricity supply if they are found selling power to cash in on surging prices amid rising concern that depleted coal stocks at power generation plants could potentially to blackouts.In a letter to all state governments and distribution companies (discoms), the Union power ministry requested all states and UTs to utilise unallocated power of the central generating stations (CGS) to meet local consumer demand only. In case of excess power, it asked the states to inform the ministry so that the electricity could be diverted to needy states.“It has been observed that some states are not supplying power to their consumers and imposing load shedding in some areas. At the same time, they are also selling power in the power exchange at a high price,” read the letter signed by deputy secretary, GoI, Devashis Bose. HT has seen a copy of the letter.“Further, if any state is found selling power in power exchange or not scheduling this unallocated power, their unallocated power may be temporarily reduced or withdrawn and reallocated to other States which are in need of such power,” the letter added.The letter came on a day the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) reviewed the coal supply and electricity situation as the government looked to defuse the energy crisis in several states that have suffered staggered power cuts since the past one week.We have continued our supply, even continued in the past despite dues. We are requesting them (states) to increase stock...There won’t be a coal shortage,” Union coal minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters.India is the world’s second largest coal producer and has the world’s fourth largest reserves but a steep surge in power demand has outstripped pre-pandemic levels, triggering a shortage.Government reports dated October 11 showed of the 115 plants with critical stock, 107 have coal for five days or less. Usually, any coal based power plant should have stocks OF up to 15 days.In its letter to states and UTs, the Union power ministry also said that at present, the demand from coal based power plants had increased. Central government-controlled power producers sign long-term purchase agreements with distribution companies but 15% of their output is controlled by the federal administration as “unallocated power”, which is given to needy states.Coal-fuelled capacity accounts for 52.41%, or 202.80GW, of India’s installed power generation capacity of 386.88GW.There are a number of reasons for the current situation. International prices of coal have surged, increasing the demand for local coal. Power demand, and therefore the derived demand for coal, has increased sharply in the past couple of months, perhaps a reflection of pent-up demand on account of the disruption from the second wave of the pandemic in April-May and a surge in activity ahead of the festival season. Heavy rainfall, especially in the coal-producing regions of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, added to the problems.“Due to rains, there was coal shortage, causing an increase in international prices- from ₹60 per ton to ₹190 per ton. Subsequently, imported coal power plants are either shut for 15-20 days or producing very less. This put pressure on domestic coal,” Joshi said on Tuesday.He said the government was making full efforts to meet the coal demand of power producers. “We at the ministry and CIL are making full efforts to meet the coal demand... Yesterday (Monday), we supplied around 1.95 million tonnes of coal. Around 1.6 million tonnes from CIL and the remaining from Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. All put together, 1.95 million tonnes we have supplied.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-curtail-electricity-supply-of-states-uts-selling-powercentre-101634064081109.html
13-10-2021||India||High returns: Farmers in Maoist belt risk jail to grow marijuana||It is early evening and the 45-year-old tribal man is making his third visit of the day to his standing crop. Around him, the forests of Swabhiman Anchal, a region wracked by the state-Maoist conflict in Malkangiri, stand tall and dense. Right next to the plantation is a massive man made lake, along the banks of the Balimela reservoir. The man has been growing the same crop for many years, undeterred, as are most others who do what he does. He has heard whispers that growing the crop is now dangerous, that the police now have access to the area, that there will be raids. But he will only believe it when he sees them. The profits are too high. After all, the crop he grows, is not paddy, but marijuana .“I have been growing Ganja (cannabis sativa and cannabis indica) along the banks of Balimela reservoir for the past several years. Not just me, several people in my village do it. Though I keep on hearing that there could be police raids, I have not seen any police in last several years,” said the tribal farmer in Badapadar grampanchayat. They certainly haven’t come this year.His crop, planted in two acres, stands a foot tall and is a month-old. The season starts in September, just as the monsoon begins to withdraw. He waters the crop thrice a day and has used urea too. Once the plant starts blooming, he will dry the pods in the sun, cure them and pack them in slabs. “The work is more difficult than paddy or millets. But it is easier in this terrain, and earns us more too. There are more risks now, but it is still worth it,” he said.If caught, he could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to ₹1 lakh under Section 20 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act that was enacted in 1985 replacing the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930. Though cannabis cultivation or intake was not a criminal activity earlier, it was criminalized in 1985 after the NDPS Act came into being.By January, his slabs will be ready for sale and a local aggregator will collect it from the farmer who rattles of the economics of the business: cultivators get ₹700-800 a kg; every plant yields around a kg of the final product; an acre can accommodate 500 plants which means 500 kgs; that’s ₹3,50,000 - ₹4,00,000 an acre for five months of work. “Nothing goes unsold though at times I have been short-changed as the aggregator pays less than what he had promised saying some of his consignments were caught. We don’t complain as the return is far better than what we get growing millets or paddy,” the farmer says.Marijuana costs anything between ₹500 and ₹1,000 for 10 grams, which works out to ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 a kg.Even as stories of drug seizures in big ports and raids on rave parties on cruise boats make the headlines, it is states such as Odisha that have emerged the primary source of drugs such as cannabis. And while a broader debate on whether cannabis should be illegal does rage, the story of the tribal farmers of Anchal highlight the difficulties in implementation of existing laws.The growing numbers in OdishaLast week, police and excise officials said that they destroyed around 23,538 acres of cannabis in 10 districts of Odisha in 2020-21, the highest-ever. In 2020, Odisha seized 154,900 kg of cannabis, another highest ever figure, up from 19,800 kg in 2015. This year, it has so far reached around 140,000 kg and police officials estimate will cross last year’s record by the end of this month. In contrast, in Andhra Pradesh, a state that has traditionally been associated with high cannabis cultivation, the police seized 42,300 kg of cannabis last year while this year they have seized over 80,800kg till the end of September. The NCRB Crime in India report 2020 puts the total seizures of “cannabis based drugs” under the NDPS Act at 853,554.414 kg.There is no nationally aggregated figure of cannabis seizure available with NCRB for last two to three years.Senior police officials said there were two reasons for the increase in number of seizures in 2020. The first, the lack of vehicular movement on the road during the lockdown induced by Covid-19. “It was easier to identify and confiscate cannabis-laden vehicles last year due to lockdown as there were less traffic on roads last year,” said Abilash G, sub-divisional police officer of Malkangiri, one of the main centres of the cannabis trade in the state.The second, officials said, was an increased focus on the issue at the highest levels of the state government. Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra last week asked officials to identify land records of people on whose land cannabis is cultivated and provide poor tribal families making a living from the trade with alternate livelihood opportunities through a convergence of Odisha Livelihood Mission, National Livelihood Mission and MGNREGS.“Odisha has been among the biggest suppliers of cannabis for a long time due to large-scale plantation in the Maoist-affected hilly districts of Malkangiri, Koraput, Kandhamal, Gajapati, Boudh, Rayagada, Bargarh and few others. Now with the DGP focused on striking at the root of cannabis business, we are seeing seizures almost every 2-3 days in huge quantities,” said Jainarayan Pankaj, deputy inspector general of police of Special Task Force, the unit of Odisha police that has been tasked to go after the narcotics trade. The DIG was referring to DGP Abhay, who took over in December 2019. The DGP has, in the past, also held the post of the director general of NCB. The DGP has implemented a rewards system where police officials who conduct record seizures are being given commendation discs.Additional director of enforcement, NCB, Piyush Kumar Singh said that in terms of cultivated area of cannabis, Odisha tops the list. “Over the last couple of years, Odisha has upped its enforcement making a lot of seizures. If you see the cannabis seizures in northern states, invariably those too will be from Odisha,” Singh said.The Smuggling In India report for the year 2019-20 released by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, identified Odisha as a source state, along with Andhra Pradesh, and flagged a more ominous, but inevitable consequence. “There is a distinct trend emerging from these seizures which indicates a flow of huge quantities of ganja coming from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, passing through Telangana, Chattisgarh and MP before reaching the consumption centres in northern states of India, mainly UP and Bihar. Ganja not only has narcotics angle but also a national security concern as the illicit proceeds from the trafficking of it are used for feeding the growth of extremist activities,” the report said.How Maoism is inextricably linked with cannabisOfficials say that it is no coincidence that in Odisha, cannabis is largely grown in its deeply forested, hilly, sparsely populated tracks, intersecting with districts that have traditionally seen the highest Maoist influence. “The Maoist hotbed of Swabhiman Anchal where most of the cannabis is grown, remained out of bounds for police till two years ago. It’s only after Maoist activities declined that police are being able to breach these areas. Even now police are not able to venture deep into the entire swathes of Swabhiman Anchal. In other districts such as Kandhamal and Gajapati, the topography is challenging,” said a senior official of the excise department.In 2008, the Justice P K Mohanty Commission of Inquiry which investigated the activities and operation of drug mafia in the state, detailed that the cultivation of cannabis in Maoist-affected districts was supported by Chasi Mulia Samiti, a frontal organisation of CPI(Maoist). “We have information about some Maoist leaders supporting the cultivation in lieu of cuts they receive,” said Malkangiri SP Prahlad Meena.A senior Intelligence official who looks closely at LWE (left wing extremism) affected states such as Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana and Odisha says that there is an inextricable link between the sustenance of Maoism, and the cultivation of a crop that is poorly regulated. “A very common question that is asked is where do Maoists get their funding from? A big source, that is not talked of, is the cut from crop sales of products in these forests that go under the radar. The pattern is the same. In Chhattisgarh, in the districts of Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada, arguably the worst violence hit districts, the Maoists run on cuts from tendu-patta. The tendu leaves are used for making beedis and are a huge, basically unregulated industry. Cannabis serves the same purpose in Odisha. In Madhya Pradesh for instance, where the Maoists are trying to enter slowly, they have been trying to get bamboo cultivators on their side.”The economics of cannabis cultivation also makes it difficult for the government to checkmate the flourishing trade, and those looking to make money from the process, like Maoists. The money (as evident from the price the Anchal farmer receives for cannabis) is good. It is also quick, and made through digital payment systems. “In most cases, the people sitting in other states invest in the cultivation. The farmers run little risk as the crop is grown in mostly government or community land making it difficult for the police to zero in on the culprits as no one would come to claim ownership,” said Varun Guntapalli, superintendent of police of Koraput.The cat and mouse gameBut even as the police and the administration have increased their vigilance in Odisha, they have come across an ingenious transportation network. Investigators said traders use empty fuel tankers, ambulances, passenger buses, oxygen cylinders, even India Post’s speed post.On September 20 this year, police in Malkangiri district seized 2250 kg of cannabis from a truck that was carrying the contraband concealed under mounds of coal. In August last year, two drug peddlers were caught at Bhubaneswar’s Railway Mail Service booking counter with 411 kg of cannabis, trying to pass it off as cashew nuts. In June this year, 1277 kg of cannabis were seized by Koraput police from a truck transporting oxygen cylinders to Lucknow. “Oxygen cylinders were loaded at Visakhapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh. On its way to Delhi, ganja was loaded onto the vehicle in Koraput district for scheduled delivery in Lucknow. In Covid times normally no one would stop vehicles carrying oxygen cylinders. But we are also trying to be one up on the smugglers,” said Rajesh Pandit, deputy inspector general of police (south-western) range.Activists in Odisha say it will not be easy to demolish a system that has flourished for long not only with Maoist support, but also the tacit approval of police, revenue and excise officials. This year, one sub-inspector and two constables in Koraput have been dismissed from service because of their involvement in cannabis trafficking.“For every cannabis truck that is seized, there may be two others that were allowed to go in lieu of money,” said Durga Prasad Tripathy, an activist in Malkangiri district. “The government has to not just incentivise alternative farming like turmeric, maize or other crops, but also think of out of box solutions that go beyond MNREGA schemes. Mowing down the cannabis fields will mean nothing, as they will always re-emerge if the market, and the workforce for it exists,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-returns-farmers-in-maoist-belt-risk-jail-to-grow-marijuana-101634063538847.html

The West Bengal Government has been specifically asked to send their senior officials for the next round of talks. The all-around development and prosperity of the Darjeeling hills, Terrai and Dooars region is the topmost priority of the Modi Government,” the statement added.Among the issues particularly discussed during the meeting includes granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to 11 hill tribe-communities of the Darjeeling hills, Terai and Dooars region -- a longstanding demand of the indigenous tribal population in the area.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 by allying with the GJM (Gorkha Janmukti Morcha). In 2019, the BJP had an alliance with the GJM (Gurung faction), the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and other small political parties in the Darjeeling hills.The BJP has promised to find a permanent political solution to the demand for a Gorkhaland, raised by the Nepali-speaking Gorkhas living in the Darjeeling hills and adjoining Siliguri, the Terai and the Dooars region in north Bengal.Earlier, in its election manifestos in 2014 and 2019, the BJP had promised that it would find a permanent solution to the Gorkhaland demand.Officials familiar with the development said Tuesday’s meeting is significant as the government is trying to find a permanent solution to the issue.Following the meeting, Bista told the news agency ANI – “It was a historical day for Indian Gorkhas. For the first time, there was over one hour of talk with the Union home minister without any protest or ‘Bandh’. It was a successful talk. The meeting was better than we expected. We have placed our demands before the home minister, and he has assured us that the government of India will sincerely try and solve our demands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-holds-dialogue-with-gorkha-delegation-vows-all-round-growth-101634063481234.html
13-10-2021||India||Expert panel clears use of Covaxin for ages 2-18||The expert group looking at vaccine approvals has recommended the use of Covaxin in the 2-18 age group, officials aware of the matter said on Tuesday, raising the possibility that the first of children could soon begin to receive doses since the shot is already being administered in India.The approval by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) will need to be accepted by the Drugs Controller General of India – which is expected within days – and has to be followed by a formal inclusion in the government’s coronavirus immunisation campaign.“As per the data that the company submitted, the vaccine has been found to be safe and efficacious in children. The experts were of the opinion that it should be allowed for use in children,” said a senior official in the know of things, asking not to be named.However, even as India discusses delivering the dose to children, the company’s phase III clinical trial data is yet to be peer-reviewed. It has released the efficacy data only in press statements and in papers uploaded on pre-print servers.The recognition of Covaxin as a valid vaccine by other countries at large has also been under a cloud — the World Health Organization is likely to take a decision this week on whether to add the shot to its list of approved vaccines.These factors, experts say, could trigger hesitancy among parents — especially since the vaccine’s initial approval in January was rushed through, although data from the press release and the papers uploaded on pre-print servers suggest the vaccine has a high 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid, 93.4% against severe Covid, and 65.2% against the infection caused by the Delta variant.Much will also depend on what data the company and the regulator choose to release over the next few days.“…As a paediatrician, I would go slow; I will see how the data comes in, or when the vaccine is actually is being given to children at different centres in various parts of the country. We need to see how the response is...,” said Dr Manish Mannan, head of paediatrics and neonatology, Paras Hopsital, Gurugram, in a statement.This is the first vaccine to have received clearance for children under the age of 12. Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D, which was tested in volunteers aged 12 and above, received an approval last month. The product is yet to be included in the vaccination campaign.A second official, from the health ministry, said the decision on when to begin administering Covaxin to children will depend on government the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI).“Whether it will be introduced in the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, and if yes, then how soon, will be for the expert panels on immunisation to decide,” this person said.Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, confirmed the SEC approval. “Bharat Biotech has submitted data from clinical trials in the 2-18 years age group for COVAXIN (BBV152) to CDSCO. The data has been thoroughly reviewed by the CDSCO and Subject Experts Committee (SEC) and have provided their positive recommendations. This represents one of the first approvals worldwide for COVID-19 vaccines for the 2-18 age group. Bharat Biotech sincerely thank the DCGI, Subject Experts Committee, and CDSCO for their expedited review process. We now await further regulatory approvals from the CDSCO prior to product launch and market availability of COVAXIN for Children,” the company said in a statement issued on Tuesday.According to experts involved in the clinical trials, the safety and efficacy of Covaxin in the paediatric age group has been found to be almost similar to that in adults and the level of antibodies that developed in the volunteers was similar to what has been recorded in adults.This data acts as a comparator, and suggests that the efficacy in children is likely to be similar to the 77.8% efficacy recorded in the adult clinical trials.“Paediatric vaccine is the same as the adult vaccine in terms of dosage, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy that has already been established in the adult population. It is equally safe and effective in children and the need for conducting a trial among paediatric age group was to generate evidence for it,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, department of community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, who is also the principal investigator for the Covaxin trials at the AIIMS site.Bharat Biotech completed phase 2/3 clinical trials in children in September and submitted the data to the DCGI in October.Experts aware of the matter said the roll-out for children will likely be in stages, with the entire population in the 2-18 age group unlikely to be covered at one go. “Members of expert committees have suggested the idea of introducing it in a phased manner for children, giving priority to those who suffer from specified comorbidities,” said a person aware of the discussions, while adding that it will be done in “the same way as it was done for adults”.Government experts are working on a list of comorbidities that could determine which children are eligible for a vaccine first.“They will have to do it in a phased manner as if you look at the numbers there should be about 400 million children, and 1-2% of them likely to be at higher risk because of their medical condition and the kind of treatment they would be taking such as chemo, transplant medication, etc. It will be a huge challenge logistically; therefore, doing it in phases makes sense,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.When introduced in the programme, the vaccination is likely to happen through pre-filled syringes to have better dose accuracy, the first person quoted above said.According to the conditions under which use in paediatric population has been approved, the firm should continue the study as per the approved clinical trial protocol and provide safety data, including the data on AEFI and AESI, with due analysis, every 15 days for the first two months. After that, this data needs to be submitted on a monthly basis.India has so far fully vaccinated around 29% of about 944 million eligible adults, as per government data, which includes administration of more than 110 million doses of Covaxin. Covishield, the India-made version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, accounts for over 840 million doses that have been delivered.Another 44% has been partly vaccinated.Several countries have been working to authorise vaccines for children, with the United States clearing Pfizer’s shot for children aged 12 and above. According to Oxford University’s Our World in Data project, over 50 countries have allowed children of some age groups to begin receiving doses.In addition to ZyCoV-D and Covaxin, two more vaccines are being tested in children. The Drugs Controller General of India on September 1 granted permission to Hyderabad-based Biological E Limited to conduct phase 2/3 clinical trial of its made in India vaccine, Corbevax, on children and adolescents aged between 5 and 18 years with certain conditions.In July, Serum Institute of India (SII) was given permission to conduct phase 2/3 trials of Covovax (the dose developed by Novavax) on children aged 2 to 18 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-clears-use-of-covaxin-for-ages-218-101634063420735.html

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) targets making all statutory towns open defecation free (ODF), achieving scientific processing of solid waste, and managing wastewater in cities with less than 100,000 people.As per details issued by the government, over the next five years, the Swachh Bharat Mission will focus on achieving garbage-free urban India and ensuring complete access to sanitation facilities to serve additional population migrating from rural to urban areas. “This will be done through the construction of over 3.5 lakh individual, community and public toilets. Complete liquid waste management in city‘s with a population of less than one lakh will ensure that systems and processes are set up in every city so that all waste water is safely contained, collected, transported and treated and no waste water polluted the water bodies”, a government statement said.A financial outlay of ₹141,600 crores was finalised for the mission, including a central share of ₹36,465 crore for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26, which is nearly 2.5 times the financial outlay of ₹62,009 crores in the last phase of the mission.The Swachh Bharat Mission is a flagship scheme of the Narendra Modi government launched in 2014 to eradicate open defecation and ensure management of solid waste in all statutory towns. AMRUT, which was launched in 2015, will focus on providing 26.8 million water connections and 26.4 million sewer and septage connections. As per the data provided by the government, so far 11 million households have been provided tap connections and 8.5 million sewer connections have been given under the scheme.“AMRUT 2.0 will target universal coverage of water supply by providing household tap connections in all 4,378 statutory towns. The mission targets to provide 100% coverage of household sewage management in 500 AMRUT cities. The Total indicative outlay for AMRUT 2.0 is ₹277,000 crore including central share of ₹76760 crore for five years from financial year 2021-22 to 2025-26,” the government statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-second-phase-of-swachh-bharat-amrut-101634063361618.html
13-10-2021||India||Viewing human rights with political lens harmful: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that some people viewed human rights through a political lens, adding that this selective behaviour is harmful for democracy. Speaking virtually at the 28th foundation day ceremony of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Modi said: “There is an aspect of human rights which I want to talk about today. In recent years, some people have started interpreting human rights in a way that benefits them. They see violation of human rights in one incident while they don’t see any violation in other, similar incidents. Such mentality also harms the very concept of human rights.” He added that human rights are grossly violated when they are seen through a political lens. “This selective behaviour is equally damaging for the democracy,” he said.Modi also drew an analogy between human rights and India’s independence movement, saying that the respect for human rights in the country is largely due to the long freedom struggle that the nation went through. “We fought for our rights across centuries and, as a country and society, always protested against injustice and tyranny,” PM Modi remarked. India, he said, has always been “committed and sensitive” towards issues concerning human rights. The PM further asserted that human rights should not be seen separately from duties. “Human rights are not just about rights, but our duties as well. Both are linked and are necessary for human development.”Modi’s comments come against the backdrop of domestic and international organisations criticising his government’s human rights record, although both the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have maintained that localised crimes are unnecessarily being politicised and that similar instances in states governed by parties other than the BJP are ignored. This view was reinforced at the meeting on Tuesday by the NHRC chief, justice Arun Mishra, who said “it is now a norm to accuse India of human rights violation at the behest of international forces”. Echoing this sentiment, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra later said that a lot of politics is happening around the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where eight people, including four farmers, died. He specifically named Rahul Gadhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra of the Congress, who, he said, were trying to project themselves as “champions of Dalits”. Yet, the incident of a young Dalit man in Rajasthan (ruled by the Congress) beaten to death a few days ago has gone uninvestigated and unnoticed, he said.“If Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi go to Hathras or Lakhimpur Kheri, why have they not gone to Kashmir, they will ask. The question why Modi went neither to Hathras and Lakhimpur nor Kashmir, doesn’t occur to them,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said. Talking about the steps taken by the government to eliminate injustice from the society, Modi said that ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ works on the basic principle of ensuring human rights for all. Delivering basic needs like toilets, cooking gas, electricity and homes to the poor give rise to their aspirations and make them more aware of their rights, the PM said. Similarly, he said, by bringing the Triple Talaq law, his government ensured rights for Muslim women. “India is committed and sensitive towards ensuring human rights,” he said. Speaking at the NHRC meeting, home minister Amit Shah said his government has been working for the welfare of the poor and underprivileged, thereby ensuring their human rights. Shah said that after the Narendra Modi government came to power, toilets were built in 100 million households, protecting the basic human rights, especially of women. Another 40 million households received electricity connections, and 130 million, cooking gas connections. The home minister also lauded the work NHRC has done. He said the commission has handled 2 million cases and awarded ₹205 crore as compensation to people for violation of human rights in its 28 years of existence.  NHRC is a statutory body that was constituted on October 12, 1993, under the Protection of Human Rights Act. It takes cognisance of human rights violations, conducts enquiries and recommends compensation to victims from public authorities besides other remedial and legal measures against the erring public servants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/viewing-human-rights-with-political-lens-harmful-modi-101634063358828.html
13-10-2021||India||Akhilesh Yadav starts SP's poll campaign with Vijay rath, lashes out at BJP||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday launched his party’s ‘Mission 2022’ poll campaign with a rath yatra, and lashed out at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying it had “crushed farmers” and on return to power in Uttar Pradesh, would “crush the Constitution” as well.“The Samajwadi Vijay Rath will run from Ganga to Yamuna. We are starting this yatra with the blessings of Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav). We have come out to seek the cooperation and support of the public. The people of UP have been cheated by the BJP government…a change is inevitable,” said the former chief minister while kick-starting the rath yatra from Kanpur’s new Ganga bridge. The yatra will cover all 403 assembly segments ahead of the 2022 state polls.In an apparent reference to the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed, Yadav said: “The BJP has crushed farmers, and if they come back to power, they are all set to crush the Constitution. Therefore, the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will go to the people and throw the BJP out of power.”Stating that Uttar Pradesh is the land of farmers, Yadav attacked the BJP for “oppressing them”.“They were promised double income but their income has been taken away. The farmers are not being given the price of their standing paddy crop,” the SP chief said.Yadav said the state should be rebuilt and put on the path of development. “The BJP government is selling everything – from airports to ports. It won’t be a surprise, if in days to come, the government is outsourced,” he added.The former CM said his party would focus on farmers, youth and their problems during this journey (rath yatra), the first leg of which will end on October 13. In Ghatampur, the former CM said his party would not hesitate in giving free power and water to people, if voted to power.The yatra will pass through Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun in the first phase. Since 2001, rath yatras have been an important part of the SP’s poll campaigns. Yadav had led the yatra in 2012 as well during the successful poll campaign after which he was sworn in as the CM.Yadav greeted the crowd from his motorised rath (a Mercedes bus, which has been converted into a rath) and was accompanied by Khazanchi Nath, a five-year-old boy who was born in 2016 while his mother Sarvesha Devi was standing in a bank queue in Kanpur Dehat to withdraw cash during demonetisation. Waving the party flag, Khazanchi flagged off the yatra, which halted at Hamirpur where a meeting was held.Rejecting Akhilesh’s allegations, state minister and senior BJP leader Sidharth Nath Singh said: “No vijay yatra will be able to fulfil Akhilesh’s dream of ‘acquiring power’. Those who failed to serve people and handed over the state’s honour and dignity to criminals and goons, have no right to be in power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-starts-samajwadi-party-s-poll-campaign-with-vijay-rath-lashes-out-at-bjp-101634063239467.html
13-10-2021||India||LG ex-adviser’s premises, 40 others searched by CBI in fake arms licence case||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday conducted searches at 41 places, including the premises of Baseer Khan, the former adviser to Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, across states in connection with a case involving fake arms licences, officials familiar with the development said. The agency said its teams conducted raids at Srinagar, Anantnag, Baramulla, Jammu, Doda, Rajouri, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Jammu & Kashmir and also in Leh, Delhi and Bhind (Madhya Pradesh). “(The searches were conducted) at the official & residential premises of around 14 then public servants including then DMs (IAS/KAS), DIO, Clerks etc; around 05 private persons (middlemen/agents); around 10 Gun houses/dealers in an on-going investigation of a case related to Arms licence racket,” a CBI statement read. Khan’s house is in Baghat in uptown Srinagar. “A team of about six people were in the house of Khan for up to two hours,” said a police officer aware of the details. Khan was a divisional commissioner in Kashmir when he was appointed as advisor to the first J&K LG, G C Murmu, in March 2020. After Manoj Sinha became LG, Khan continued as his advisor. Last week, he was suddenly removed from his post following a communication from the ministry of home affairs to the Union territory administration. The case pertains to a multistate racket first investigated by the Rajasthan ATS in 2017 after it seized weapons bought using fake arms licences which were made in J&K’s Kathua and Kupwara districts. It then decided to refer the case to the CBI as the footprints of the racket went beyond Rajasthan to Madhya Pradesh, J&K and Punjab. MP ATS had also probed the case separately.The CBI took over the case in October 2018 at the then J&K government’s request after the names of a few senior officers emerged in the investigation for issuing arms licences under forged documents. They were accused of issuing weapons licences to outsiders and took favours in return.Khan is also one of the eight accused officials in the 2009 multi-crore Gulmarg (Baramulla) land scam case which dates to the time when he was the deputy commissioner of Baramulla. The accused officials, according to the police chargesheet, had illegally transferred ownership rights of state land in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-ex-adviser-s-premises-40-others-searched-by-cbi-in-fake-arms-licence-case-101634062819485.html

It is for the partners inside the Quad to discuss that. But remember there are many exercises that go on in the Indo-Pacific and globally which bring like-minded navies and partners together,” Gilday said, in response to a question on the possibility of more navies coming together under the Malabar banner. He is in India on a five-day official visit.The second phase of Malabar exercise is being conducted from October 12 to 15. Gilday said the cyber domain is one area that the Quad navies would continue to refine in terms of working together as well as high-end operations in the air, on the sea and under the sea.“We are committed to operationalizing our #USIndiaDefense partnership, including through enhanced information-sharing, regional security, and exercising at sea together,” he wrote on Twitter.The Quad navies conducted the first phase of the exercise off the Pacific Ocean island of Guam from August 26-29. It involved destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters, long-range maritime patrol aircraft and elite special forces elements including the US Navy SEALs and the Indian Navy’s marine commandos (MARCOS).The Indian Navy is taking part in the exercise’s second phase with INS Ranvijay, INS Satpura, P-8I long range maritime patrol aircraft and a submarine, the US Navy is represented by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson along with USS Lake Champlain and USS Stockdale, Japan is taking part with JS Kaga and JS Murasame and the Royal Australian Navy has sent HMAS Ballarat and HMAS Sirius for the drills.Malabar began as an annual bilateral naval exercise between India and the US in 1992. It has increased in scope and complexity over the years.It was in the 2005 edition of the drills that the aircraft carriers from the Indian and the US Navy operated together for first time. In 2014, the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) became a permanent participant in the drills followed by Australia in 2020.Also Read| Indian, American, Japanese, Australian navies kick off Malabar drillsThe Quad navies had earlier carried out complex naval drills under the Malabar banner in November 2020 in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.Wary of the Quad, China has been monitoring its activities closely.

Infrastructure creation in India suffered for decades from multiple issues, including lack of coordination between different departments, it said in a statement giving an example of the current practice of road construction, which is often dug up by other agencies to lay underground cables and gas pipelines.In order to address this issue, save time and cost and shield the public from inconveniences, the government has put in place the coordinated effort of 16 ministries and departments under PM GatiShakti, a senior official of the ministry said requesting anonymity. “Instead of planning and designing separately in silos, the projects will be designed and executed with a common vision,” he said.The initiative will have coordinated efforts in infrastructure related to airways, highways, waterways, and ports. It will also rope in users such as economic zones, textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters and agri zones. The effort will make Indian businesses more competitive, he said.The high-technology online system is developed by Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BiSAG-N) and is based on six pillars – comprehensiveness, prioritisation, optimisation, synchronization, analytical and dynamic, the ministry said in a statement. PM GatiShakti will include all the existing and planned initiatives of various ministries and departments with one centralized portal. Thus, different agencies will be able to prioritise their projects through cross-sectoral interactions and help them in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost, it said. The system will help in synchronising activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance in a holistic manner by ensuring coordination of work between them. It will provide the entire data at one place with GIS-based spatial planning and analytical tools having over 200 layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency.It will facilitate ministries and departments to visualise, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and the progress of the projects will be updated regularly on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan, it said. “PM GatiShakti is the result of Prime Minister’s constant endeavour to build Next Generation Infrastructure which improves Ease of Living as well as Ease of Doing Business,” it said.The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for the movement of people, goods and services from one mode of transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce travel time for people, it added. PM GatiShakti will provide the public and business community information regarding the upcoming connectivity projects, other business hubs, industrial areas and surrounding environment. This will enable the investors to plan their businesses at suitable locations leading to enhanced synergies. It will create multiple employment opportunities and give a boost to the economy, it said.“It will improve the global competitiveness of local products by cutting down the logistics costs and improving the supply chains, and also ensure proper linkages for local industry and consumers,” it added. The PM will also inaugurate the New Exhibition Complex (Exhibition Halls 2 to 5) at Pragati Maidan during the event. India Trade Promotion Organisation’s (ITPO) flagship event, India International Trade Fair (IITF) 2021 will also be held from November 14-27, 2021 in these new exhibition halls. Union ministers for commerce, road transport and highways, railways, civil aviation, shipping, power, and petroleum will also be present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-gatishakti-on-wednesday-for-holistic-planning-of-major-infra-projects-101634060299788.html
13-10-2021||India||Is it time to reduce the waiting time for second dose of Covid-19 vaccines?||India on May 13 increased the waiting period between two doses of the Covishield vaccine from four-eight weeks to 12-16 weeks. The idea back then was to administer the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines to as many people as possible. As of 6 PM on October 12, Covishield accounted for 88% of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country. But with a decline in registrations as well as the number of first doses of the vaccine administered, is it time to reduce the gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine? An HT analysis shows it is an idea that merits serious consideration.Also Read| Expert panel clears use of Covaxin for ages 2-18Proportion of first doses has started decreasingThe Co-Win dashboard provides data on daily vaccinations by first and second doses. The number of first doses has been falling consistently since September 17. The proportion of the first doses in total doses has been declining since late August. This is the third time since May that this proportion has decreased, but is perhaps the most significant because the number of those vaccinated may be nearing an important milestone.Have vaccinations in India hit a ceiling?India’s projected adult population in March, as per a National Commission on Population report, was 940.2 million. By October 11, 684.1 million have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccines. The share of the adult population that has received at least one dose is 73%. Comparing the time taken to provide the first dose for each 10% of India’s adult population, the increase in coverage from 50% to 60%, between August 18 and September 13, was the fastest. This pace has slowed since then. The weekly average of first doses administered in the week ending October 9 is the lowest since the week ended July 29. It will likely slow even more.That the slowdown is on account of low demand is evident from data on number of registrations on the Co-WIN dashboard. The dashboard gives a combined number for online and offline registrations. After the week ended September 17, there has been a consistent decline in new registrations. In that week, there were 39.36 million registrations. In the week ended October 8, new registrations were 58% of that number at 22.66 million. To be sure, there has been one more such period of consistent decline since May 1, when vaccinations were opened up for all adults. In the week ended July 16, new registrations were only 45% of the new registrations in the week ended June 25. Still, when seen along with the fact that 73% of the eligible population has received at least one dose -- many experts say coverage will max out at 75-80% -- the reason for the current decline is evident.States with higher first dose coverage are showing a bigger fall in new vaccinationsThe number of registrations across states is not available from the Co-WIN dashboard. However, growth rates of new first doses across states have some correlation with coverage. Himachal Pradesh has given first doses to its entire population, according to the 2021 population projections. Here, the overall rate of first doses delivered since September 1 is 4,591 per day, which is 15% of the rate in the May to August period. In West Bengal, where only 65% of adults have been given at least one dose, the overall per day rate of first doses since September is 2.5 times the rate in May to August.Is it time to expedite second doses?The decision to prolong the gap between the first and second doses of Covishield was motivated by supply constraints. Data on falling demand for the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines shows that India might be reaching a point of moderation in demand for the first dose. Can this window be utilised to accelerate the process of administering second doses, and boost immunity levels against the pandemic?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-it-time-to-reduce-the-waiting-time-for-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccines-101634057178895.html
13-10-2021||India||5 J&K terrorists killed amid spate of attacks||Five terrorists were killed in two separate gun battles with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir’s Shopian district on Tuesday amid intensified counter-insurgency operations after a series of targeted attacks left seven civilians dead this month. One of the five was involved in the killing of a street vendor in Srinagar, police said.The gunfights came a day after five Indian Army soldiers lost their lives in an encounter in the region. The latest casualties are the worst security forces have suffered in anti-insurgency operations in J&K this year.On Tuesday, a gunfight broke out following a raid by soldiers and police in the Imam Sahib area of Shopian, the police said. Security forces cordoned off the area late on Monday and firing began after the terrorists refused to surrender, they said. Three militants were killed early in the day. In another incident, two terrorists were killed at an apple orchard during an operation in Feeripora in southern Shopian district, according to the police.Several operations have been launched across Kashmir since the civilian killings. The police said two of the terrorists involved in two killings at Hajin and Srinagar have so far been shot dead. The five terrorists killed on Tuesday included Mukhtar Shah, who shifted base from Ganderbal district to Shopian after allegedly killing the vendor, Virendra Paswan.“In the last 24 hours, based on specific inputs about the presence of terrorists in the twin villages of Shopian – Tulran and Feeripora – two anti-terrorist operations were carried out, resulting in the elimination of five ultras. The slain terrorists include Mukhtar Shah, who was involved in the targeted killing of a non-local vendor at the Lal Bazar area of Srinagar,” a police statement said.An official said the three terrorists killed in the first gunfight on Tuesday were affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF) – a shadow outfit of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). TRF has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in the recent days.A joint operation was launched in Feeripora following inputs from J&K Police, defence spokesperson Emron Masuavi said. “Repeated calls to surrender were turned down by the terrorists, who fired on our forces in return, forcing the forces to take action. Two terrorists were eliminated in the gun battle,” said Masuavi. An AK-47 rifle and armament were recovered from the spot.On Monday, police said Imtiyaz Ahmad Dar, who went underground after allegedly killing taxi driver Mohammad Shafi Lone last week, was killed in a gun battle at Gundjahangir in Bandipora district. Four people were arrested in connection with Lone’s killing on Sunday, the police said. The killing was carried out at the behest and instructions of Lashkar-e-Taiba handler Lala Umar of Pakistan, they said.One terrorist was killed in another exchange of fire with security forces in Verinag on Monday. A policeman was injured.October, just before the onset of winter, usually sees an increase in infiltration attempts with handlers of the terrorists in Pakistan trying to get more of them into India before traversing the already inhospitable terrain becomes almost impossible.Four exchanges of fire were reported across the Valley on Monday when five soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer, were killed in an exchange of fire with heavily armed terrorists in a forest in Surankote in Poonch district amid a spike in violence in the region.The J&K Police said terrorists involved in the attack on security forces in Poonch district in which five army personnel lost their lives were in the area for two to three months. Deputy inspector general of police (DIG), Rajouri-Poonch range, Vivek Gupta said the terrorists have been confined to a particular area and asserted that the operation shall be taken “to a logical conclusion in the shortest time”.Security forces have killed 120 terrorists in Kashmir this year, including over a dozen top commanders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-terrorists-killed-in-separate-places-in-j-k-s-shopian-101634040376489.html
13-10-2021||India||Waive IPR for equitable Covid vaccine access: India at G20||Developed countries need to waive intellectual property rights to ensure equitable access to Covid-related medicines by poorer nations, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday. He also asked the G20 nations to dismantle new trade barriers, such as vaccine differentiation and Covid-19 passports, to ensure delivery of critical services. Goyal’s comments were in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s June 12 statement at the G7 Summit that urged the developed nations to support India and South Africa’s proposal for a TRIPS waiver on Covid-19 related technologies. TRIPS is short for trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. “Our response to the pandemic needs to ensure equitable access to vaccines and other Covid-19 related health products by ensuring quick resolution of the supply side constraints,” Goyal said at the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial meeting in Italy. “One of the ways to demonstrate this is by accepting the TRIPS waiver proposal.” Goyal is India’s Sherpa for the G20, a grouping of 19 major economies and the European Union. Its members account for 80% of global gross domestic product, 75% of global trade and 60% of global population. The next G20 Leaders’ Summit is scheduled on October 30-31 under Italy’s presidency. India, which is a member of the group since its inception in 1999, will be holding the G20 presidency from December 1, 2022, and will convene the G20 Leaders’ Summit in 2023 for the first time. “We need to actively resolve new trade barriers like vaccine differentiation or Covid passports, which impose mobility restrictions and impede the movement of personnel needed for delivering critical services,” Goyal said at the meeting. The G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting is important precursor of the World Trade Organization’s 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), as it is a “springboard for a successful outcome”, according to the official G20 Italy website. MC12 is scheduled to take place in Geneva from 30 November to 3 December 2021. The proposal to waive TRIPS was advanced jointly by India and South Africa last year to ensure access to technologies needed to prevent, contain or treat Covid-19. “The Covid-19 crisis is a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness, and the need for a coordinated global strategy to overcome such an unprecedented public health situation,” Goyal said, underlining the need for an early universal vaccination against Covid-19.“Apart from focusing on facilitating free flow of goods, I invite G20 countries to join in efforts to make health services accessible and more affordable for the citizens of the world by enabling free flow of health services,” he said. “As a quick response to the pandemic, I am happy to inform that our telemedicine initiative, eSanjeevani, has been serving millions of Indians. I am happy to offer it to the entire world.” Among other issues, Goyal called for an equitable and balanced outcome to trade negotiations in the fisheries sector, advocating that countries engaged in distant water fishing should stop subsidising fishing in high seas and gradually reduce their fishing capacities, particularly for overfished stocks. Goyal also discussed the agreement on joint multilateral positions in fisheries with his Australian counterpart during a one-on-one meeting on Monday . India was committed towards the United Nations 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goyal said in his address, asking the developed nations to keep their end of the bargain. “India is among the few countries which is on track to exceed its commitments as per the Paris Agreement. We urge the members to fulfil their commitments regarding transfer of technology and climate finance, which are far from being fulfilled by the developed countries,” he said. Goyal said sustainability has to be linked to making available grant-based, long tenure, low cost and concessional and affordable technologies. “India has consistently maintained that environmental, sustainability measures need careful assessment to ensure they do not become new trade barriers and the right forum for them is the dedicated Multilateral Environmental Agreements,” he said. On the sidelines of the G20 Trade Ministers Meeting at Sorrento in Italy, Goyal advanced India’s trade position and negotiated bilateral and multilateral agreements in his meetings with nearly 15 ministers, including from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Brazil, China, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada, South Korea and Mexico. He also met the director general of the World Trade Organisation. Goyal made it clear that India was working towards the success of the upcoming WTO 12th Ministerial Conference (WTO MC12) next month, but it expected the outcome to be just and equitable. “Historical wrongs against developing countries must be corrected rather than being carried over,” said a commerce ministry statement, quoting Goyal. In his meetings with the Canadian minister, Goyal discussed steps to take forward the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the newly elected government while calling upon his South Korean and EU counterparts to accelerate review of the FTA. With the Mexican minister, Goyal discussed cooperation in healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-g20-to-dismantle-trade-barriers-to-ensure-equitable-access-to-vaccines-101634039356206.html
13-10-2021||India||HC dismisses plea challenging Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief||The Delhi high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the city police commissioner. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh pronounced the operative part of the order. A detailed judgment is yet to be released.On August 25, the Supreme Court asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment. The bench reserved its order on September 27.In his plea, lawyer Sadre Alam sought quashing of Union home ministry’s July 27 order appointing Asthana as well as that granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him. The plea contended that a high-powered committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister, and the Leader of Opposition, on May 24 rejected the appointment of Asthana as CBI director due to procedural lapses. It added the same rules should apply to the appointment of the Delhi Police commissioner.NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation also filed an intervention application through advocate Prashant Bhushan, challenging the appointment. The petition was earlier filed in the apex court, which asked Bhushan to approach the high court. Bhushan, during the proceedings, contended that Alam’s petition was a “copy-paste” of his plea.Also Read: Suspected terrorist held in Delhi, AK-47 rifle seizedThe Centre justified Asthana’s appointment and told the court that most of the appropriate level of officers of a cadre of officers for Union territories did not have the sufficient balance of experience and policing for an appointment as a top cop of the city.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, contended that filing Public Interest Litigation has spawned into an industry of vested litigation.Asthana, in his affidavit, told the court there was a sustained social media campaign against him, and the legal challenge to his appointment was an abuse of process of law arising from vendetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-asthana-s-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-101634019012927.html
13-10-2021||India||Will the festive season trigger the third wave?||It's festival time in India and despite the Covid cloud public places are buzzing across the country. A decline in cases, with numbers hovering around the 20,000 mark and a surge in vaccination, crossing the 900million mark, has boosted confidence. However, the policymakers have been sending warning signs, alerting of an imminent third wave, that may see a sporadic rise in cases. Recently, the Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR, warned that revenge tourism may trigger the third wave, with cases surging by over 40%. As we begin the festivities the most pertinent question being asked is, is the worst over for India and has Covid-19 now turned into an endemic, as being suggested by few experts or is it the lull before the storm? hindustantimes.com Editor- Audience Engagement, Vertika Kanaujia, speaks to eminent public health experts - Dr. Raj Shankar Ghosh, Senior Advisor, Vaccine Delivery, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Dr. Anant Bhan, Researcher – Global Health, Bioethics and Health Policy and Dr. Ratna Devi, Chair of the Board of Trustees, International Alliance of Patients’ Organizations, to help us decipher the current situation and the road ahead.Talking about fears of the much-touted third wave, Dr Bhan said, “during the festive season adherence to public health measures is drastically going down. It is likely that there would be more possibility of exposure.""Schools and colleges are opening, offices are calling employees back and markets are flooded with people, this is a cause for worry. However, vaccination has been the saving grace. It is likely that the third wave will not be as severe. We can expect upward trends but not a significant surge," he added.Globally, and in India too, overconfidence has been observed among the youth over a falsely presumed invulnerability, that clubbed with vaccine production concerns, can India meet its December deadline for full vaccination coverage?Dr Ghosh believes, ‘considering the current covid vaccination coverage pace India should be in a position to vaccinate its entire population by the first quarter of 2022.’As we stare at a third wave that may or may not come, schools are set to open. Even as we understand that school reopening has become a necessity now - but does the benefit of opening schools outweighs the risks? Dr Ratna Devi said, “benefits, especially of mental health, far outweigh the risks because children are supposed to be in the playgrounds and not confined to homes. Several schools have opened but there have been no major concerns reported as comorbidity burden on children is far less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-the-festive-season-trigger-the-third-wave-101633976808364.html

13-10-2021||Today's||COP26: Play both the good and bad cop||As the planet warms, the politics heats up faster. Some have labelled the imminent COP-26 climate negotiations talks as the “last chance” to stabilise global temperature rise. But expectations from COP-26 depend on who you ask. Cut through the clutter and one finds two competing narratives.

As is the norm with political campaigns, since parties believe that projecting the inevitability of their victory and the defeat of their opponent is essential to creating a “hawa” (broadly referring to a political climate in their favour), SP’s leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said that Yogi Adityanath would be swept away in 2022.
