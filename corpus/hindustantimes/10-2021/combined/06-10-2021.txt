Justice Avneesh Jhingan, while dismissing the bail petition, observed that in the present case, considering the facts and circumstances in totality, the custody period and non-progress of trial can’t be the sole ground for grant of bail. He further observed that the ground of delay in trial is not available to the appellant at this stage as this issue is sub judice before the Supreme Court. The court order further stated another aspect that needs to be taken care of is that there are complaints filed by the victim’s father of an attempt to influence the witnesses. The Central Bureau of Investigation, in its reply, has categorically said that the appellant and his father tried to influence the witnesses. “Be that as it may be, the apprehension that there can be an attempt to tamper the evidence or influence the witnesses in the present case can’t be said to be baseless. In the circumstances mentioned, no case is made out for grant of bail,” the order said. On September 8, 2017, the accused, a student of class 11 at the time, had allegedly killed a class 2 student at a private school in Bhondsi. Initially, the city police had arrested a bus conductor for the murder but later, a CBI inquiry had found that the juvenile was allegedly involved in the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bhondsi-school-murder-high-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused-101633543377298.html
06-10-2021||Gurugram||Dengue count at 83, over 11K households get notice for larvae breeding||Amid rising dengue cases, which reached 83 on Wednesday, notices were issued to 11,311 households in the district where mosquito larvae were found, officials of the health department said. The district reported 10 cases of dengue on the day.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “There is a risk of mosquito-borne diseases, especially dengue, malaria and chikungunya spreading this year due to heavy waterlogging and stagnation of water. People should take precautions and ensure there is no place for water to collect and give special attention to cleanliness around them and do not allow mosquitoes to breed near their homes.”Last year, 52 cases of dengue were reported, while 22 cases were reported in 2019.This year, the health department has identified 13 hotspots in the city, from where dengue cases have been reported. The hotspots identified are Wazirabad, Palam Vihar, Basai, Jharsa village, Kanhai Colony, Sarhaul village, Sector 21A, Sector 39, Sector 12A, Sector 47, Dharam Colony, Udyog Vihar Phase-1 and Sector 12.The district administration on Wednesday said that over 2.27 million houses have been checked to control mosquito-borne diseases. The administration has also issued two helpline numbers, 18001801817 and 0124-44055779, for residents to request fogging drives in their areas from 9am to 5pm.Officials said that anti-larval activities are being carried out by health department teams at suspected locations, such as coolers and overhead tanks, where mosquitoes are likely to breed and temephos medicine is being sprayed at such places. Along with this, rapid fever surveys are also being conducted.The health department, in collaboration with the fisheries department, has introduced gambusia fish, which feed on mosquito larvae, in 173 water bodies of the district.The department has also directed private hospitals to send reports related to surveillance and case management of mosquito-borne diseases. Setting a cap for tests, private hospitals were instructed not to charge more than ₹600 for NS-1 and LGI test to detect dengue and chikungunya, respectively, and ₹1,000 for RT-PCR tests to detect dengue. Hospitals are mandated to state the prescribed rates on the notice boards on the hospital premises.Yadav said, “Residents should clean the surroundings of their houses once a week and ensure that there is no standing water anywhere. If a person feels high fever, nausea, joint and muscle pain, red rash on the skin and tiredness, then they should immediately contact the health centre and not self-medicate. There is no specific medicine available for dengue and malaria; residents can take paracetamol to reduce fever or pain, but must not take aspirin.”Meanwhile, residents said that corrective action is taken only after issues are raised on social media multiple times. On Wednesday, HT found water stagnating at several places in the city, with residents also raising the matter on social media handles of the district administration.Mahendra Tiwari, a member of the managing body of Sagar Kunj group housing society in Sector 9A, who had complained last week about water stagnation, said, “After I raised the matter two to three times on social media, action was taken but nothing is being done by the authorities on their own. For fogging or clearing water from our locality, we have to keep following up with the authorities.”Rajesh Pandit, a resident of the Gupta Colony in Palam Vihar, said, “There are small patches of empty land where water has been stagnating since the start of the monsoon, but no action has been taken by the authorities. A 15-year-old boy in our locality is suffering from dengue and more people can get infected.”Officials said that as the post of the chief medical officer of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is vacant at present, the staff is working on the directions from the health department. They accompany health department teams to areas where high cases of fever are reported based on rapid surveys to conduct fogging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-count-at-83-over-11k-households-get-notice-for-larvae-breeding-101633543376197.html

MCM officials said that the indoor badminton court was upgraded following demands from Manesar residents.“There was a demand from residents for upgrading the badminton court, which was in a dilapidated condition, to an international standard. Subsequently, the matter was taken up on priority and a badminton court with synthetic mats was set up so that players can use it both for leisure and competitive training,” Ajay Nirala, executive engineer, MCM, said.Nirala said that the MCM had floated tenders for setting up synthetic mats at Nakhrola sports complex for badminton as well as for kabaddi. “Cumulatively, the two projects cost around ₹ 3.24 lakh and the synthetic mats have a shelf life of at least 10 years. Once the work order was issued, it took the contractor around three weeks to complete the task,” Nirala said.Officials said that last week, they also opened tenders for setting up solar octagonal streetlight poles across the sports complex so that the sports facilities can be used during the night as well.Besides the badminton court, the sports complex has an open ground, where cricket, football and kabbadi are played.“The only proper badminton court in Manesar is located inside a golf club, for which membership is needed. Hence, the requirement for a public badminton court that is accessible to all, with proper amenities, had been a longstanding demand of residents in the area,” KN Prasad, a resident of Sector 80, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/badminton-court-at-manesar-s-nakhrola-court-revamped-101633543318803.html

At present, 64.5% of the eligible population has been given both doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the district. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “With special vaccination camps along with routine vaccination, we are targeting to fully vaccinate 80% of our eligible population by Dussehra and 85% by Diwali. We want to make sure that there is herd immunity among people during the festive season, which may prevent a surge in cases in future.” A special vaccination camp will be set up at the Sheetla Mata temple during Navratri, starting Thursday. In anticipation of a heavy footfall of residents from across the National Capital Region (NCR) for a fair that is set to be held on the premises from October 7 to 14, officials of the health department said they are planning to allocate 400 vaccines doses per day, half each for first and second doses, for the session site. In Gurugram, over 1.78 million people are eligible for Covid-19 vaccinations. In the district, the first dose has been administered to over 2.04 million and the second dose to 1.15 million people.

06-10-2021||Gurugram||Swimming pool, international sports stadium projects in Gurugram remain in limbo||Even as the newly constituted Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) has started setting up sports infrastructure in Manesar, three sports projects of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) —Wazirabad sports stadium, Kamla Nehru Park swimming pool, and a sports stadium in each of its four zones — continue to remain in limbo.Announced in June 2016 by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the international sports stadium in Wazirabad is yet to take off as designs have been altered on at least three occasions.For its construction, the MCG leased a 12-acre plot from the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) for 99 years. Until April 2019, a ₹130-crore archery range and multi-purpose indoor sports complex was to be developed at the site, but a month later, the MCG decided that a ₹20-crore recreational sports complex along the lines of Azad Maidan and Shivaji Park in Mumbai, with a multi-purpose sports ground and basic indoor sports infrastructure, was more feasible.In August 2020, the project was revised once more, with the MCG finalising a ₹200-crore sports complex with a hostel for players and amenities, such as a swimming pool, shooting range, basketball court and kabaddi court.“A DNIT [detailed notice inviting tender] and detailed project report (DPR) have been sent to the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB) for approval. A representative of the ULB has already studied the DNIT and DPR, and will be visiting the MCG on Friday for further clarity and discussions on the matter,” TL Sharma, the chief engineer of MCG, said. Sharma said that the swimming pool in the Wazirabad project will be of international standard, where national-level competitions could be held. Similar to the Wazirabad sports stadium, the fate of the Kamla Nehru Park swimming pool is also uncertain.Despite the MCG floating a ₹2-crore tender for renovating the swimming pool in January 2020, only demolition work has been carried out by the MCG. The pool, located near Sadar Bazar, was constructed in 1975 and has been lying unused since 2012 due to poor upkeep.“The scope of work for the project has changed. The estimated projected cost of ₹2 crore was far lower than the actual cost needed for the project. In addition, some enhancements are also being made to the original project which will take the cumulative cost of the project to ₹6-7 crore. A new estimate, hence, will be prepared afresh,” Sharma said. He said that the MCG will try to complete some aspects of the project in the sanctioned ₹2-crore project, while the additional ₹4-5 crore worth of work will be tendered and then allotted to a contractor separately.During an MCG House meeting in August 2018, an agenda for constructing an international sports stadium in each of its four zones was approved. However, there has been no further development in the matter for the last three years.“There was no seriousness in regard to the proposal. When the agenda was floated, it did not list any details such as potential sites or the type of sports infrastructure which need to come up. It was simply raised and approved without any discussion or afterthought. Hence, there is no progress in the matter,” an official with the MCG’s engineering wing said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/swimming-pool-international-sports-stadium-projects-in-gurugram-remain-in-limbo-101633543316293.html
06-10-2021||Lucknow||Probe ordered into AMU land lease||Agra The Uttar Pradesh government has ordered a probe regarding the land leased out by late Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh to the Aligarh Muslim University in 1929. Commissioner, Aligarh division, has been asked to conduct the probe and he has sought a report from the district magistrate of Aligarh. “A letter in this regard was received from additional chief secretary SP Goyal. The matter to be probed relates to land leased out for 90 years by late Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh to the Aligarh Muslim University. The term of the lease has lapsed and so a report has been sought from the district magistrate of Aligarh,” said Gaurav Dayal, commissioner, Aligarh division. It may be recalled that late Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was a known freedom fighter, social reformer and academician. He had leased out land owned by him to Aligarh Muslim University for 90 years in 1929. The term of the lease has lapsed but, according to the complaint lodged in the chief minister’s office, the said land has not been handed back to legal heirs of late Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh. Taking note of the complaint lodged by Ashok Chaudhary from ‘Ahuti’, a social organization in Aligarh, the chief minister’s office, through additional chief secretary, has directed commissioner, Aligarh division to probe the matter and submit the report. On the said land leased out to the AMU, there stand a ‘Tikonia Park’ and the city school run by Aligarh Muslim University. The legal heirs of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh had suggested to the AMU to hand over land on which Tikonia Park stands and name the city school run by AMU after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh. In this regard, a committee headed by the vice chancellor was constituted by the AMU Executive Council, to consider the proposal. When contacted, AMU spokesperson Prof Shafey Kidwai admitted that a proposal from the legal heirs of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was considered by the Executive Committee of Aligarh Muslim University. However, no final decision had been taken yet, he added. “The Executive Council of Aligarh Muslim University was ready to give back the land on which Tikonia Park is located. Further, the Executive Committee said it was acceptable that the city school run by AMU on remaining land will be named after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, an alumnus of AMU, and the lease of this land be extended,” said Prof Shafey Kidwai. Recently, at a grand function, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, had laid the foundation stone of a university to be built in the name of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh near Aligarh. As many as 396 degree colleges in Aligarh division are to be affiliated with this upcoming university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/probe-ordered-into-amu-land-lease-101633543256887.html

06-10-2021||Pune||Pune district administration sends notices to 1,000 firms seeking 15% premium on exempted land||The district administration over the past ten days has sent notices to 1,000 firms (industrial plot holders) in Pune city, demanding that they pay 15% of the transfer fee out of their transactions involving the conversion of commercial land space from industrial to residential purposes. The conversion of land use from industrial to residential purposes is termed as ‘residential zoning’ by the district administration. Initiated under section 20 of the Urban Land Ceiling Act (UCLA), the action sees 15% fee on the transfer transaction.District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “The notices have been issued as per the procedure wherein replies of the property holders have been sought. We are taking necessary steps in this regard.”The move comes following complaints by civil society members that the conversion of industrial zones into residential zones was deliberately neglected by the former district administration, leading to serious loss of revenue for the state. Civil society members alleged that both the state and revenue department conveniently ignored the issue of conversion of land use.Meanwhile, officials said that permission for converting land from existing commercial purposes to residential purposes was given by the state government in 1997, according to which it is mandatory to deposit 15% of the transfer fee with the state government. However, property holders did not pay the requisite amount leading to losses worth crores of rupees.The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (ULC Act) was enacted to prevent concentration of urban properties in the hands of a few, and to ensure equitable distribution-cum-utilisation of vacant urban lands. The ULC Act provided for a ceiling on holding vacant land in urban agglomerations of the state. Accordingly, possession of surplus vacant land was taken over by the ULC authorities as per procedure laid down under the ULC Act.On applications by landowners holding excess vacant land, the state government granted exemptions under section 20 of the ULC Act, which provided for vacant lands to be utilised for specified purposes and the land holder to implement the terms and conditions of the exemption order. The ULC Act was subsequently repealed by the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1999 (Repeal Act) and the Maharashtra state legislature adopted the Repeal Act on November 28, 2007. A specific category of land exempted for industrial purposes was introduced, wherein it was decided that such lands should be freed from the conditions of the exemption order by charging a onetime premium at the rate of 15% of the current annual scheduled rates for the total exempted land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-administration-sends-notices-to-1-000-firms-seeking-15-premium-on-exempted-land-101633542417322.html
06-10-2021||Other||Railway schools to be brought under KVs or run on PPP model||Schools of the Indian Railways would now be brought under the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVs). In places where the KVs option wasn’t feasible, these schools would be handed over to the state government or to be developed on Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, railway officials said. This follows the recommendations of the principal economic advisor of the union ministry of finance, Sanjeev Sanyal and its approval by the Cabinet, railway officials said. In 2015, the Bibek Debroy committee on restructuring railways too had suggested closing down these schools and had suggested association with KVs and private schools for wards of railway employees. The Cabinet secretariat had sent the recommendation to the Railway Board for implementation, and which has now sent them to all zonal railways including the North Central Railways (NCR) headquartered in Prayagraj, officials said. “We have received the letter from the Railway Board and would be taking suitable steps as per their instructions,” Chief public relations officer (CPRO), NCR, Shivam Sharma said. At present 94 schools are run by Indian railways for education to children of railway employees as well as children of non-railway employees. In 2019, 15,399 wards of railway employees were enrolled in the schools against 34,277 students hailing from families not employed with railways. Indian Railways also supports 87 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) where 33,212 railway wards and 5,386 non-railway wards are enrolled. Total number of railway wards in the age bracket of 4 to 18 years is 7,99,703 and of this only 2 per cent students attend railway schools, officals said quoting the recommendations, a copy of which is with HT. Geographically, the Railway schools aren’t necessarily concentrated in the most deprived parts of the country and have to compete with private schools which also exist now in places where there are railway colonies, the finance ministry recommendation states. As per those recommendations, operating railway schools takes up large amount of time of the railway management whose core competence is in running and maintaining the railway service. “Thus, we recommend minimizing this time of railway management in running schools, except where absolutely necessary,” the recommendation states. It has been recommended that wherever possible Railway schools be brought under KVS with a quota for the children of railway employees, which is the most preferred option. As per Sanyal’s recommendations where KVs does not have the capacity to run the railway schools, they could be handed over to respective state governments with the preference to children of railway employees. Besides where appropriate, Public Private Partnership (PPP) model may also be explored, it suggests. However, it adds that these schools might be continued in such remote areas where they are considered necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/railway-schools-to-be-brought-under-kvs-or-run-on-ppp-model-101633542175772.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai reports over 600 Covid cases after over 80 days||The city reported above 600 Covid-19 cases (624 infections) on Wednesday over 80 days after 619 infections were reported on July 14. This comes a day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) maintained that any spike due to festivals and starting of seasonal migration cannot be completely ruled out.On Wednesday, the city reported 624 cases and seven deaths, taking the case tally to 746,703 and toll to 16,136. The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 722,636 recoveries. The fatality rate is 2.16% and there are 5,451 active cases. The city reported a 1.50% positivity rate on Wednesday, up from the trend of 0.90% to 1.40% since the past two weeks now.On Monday, reportedly, the BMC’s counsel Anil Sakhare informed the high court that the work is on (of vaccination) very smoothly. Now, there is no shortage of vaccines too. Mumbai is safe. We do not see a third wave (of the Covid-19) coming. However, the BMC has said any spike further cannot be ruled out.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, on Tuesday had told HT, “”The situation right now in the city is very comfortable and it is maybe safe considering we are able to handle the caseload very well and there is adequate health infrastructure to handle cases. However, we cannot completely rule out any further spike. There are festivals upcoming, including Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali where there will be gatherings.”Kakani added, “We cannot make any claim that a third wave will not come. In Ahmednagar district, several villages are facing a spike and we cannot claim anything on the above lines. We have to remain cautious and continue following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, and get vaccinated, considering it is definitely helping control the spread.”On the other hand, experts had indicated that there can be a spike due to almost complete unlocking, but there will not be any third wave, but a steady spike in the number of cases.Further, when it comes to Maharashtra, the trend indicates a decline in the second wave of Covid-19, Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate has declined to 2.07% from last week’s 2.11%. In addition, there is no district which has a positivity rate of more than 5%, indicating that Covid-19 is under control. The positivity rate is a crucial metric that shows how widespread the virus is in the community and also provides an idea of the ability of the region to contain the virus. It is the proportion of the total tests that turn positive in that region. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that this should remain below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control.Maharashtra currently has 11 districts, which have positivity rates above the state average of 2.07%. These include Sindhudurg (4.71%), Pune (3.59%), Nashik (3.29%), Ahmednagar (3.03%), Satara (2.94%), Palghar (2.81%), Ratnagiri (2.69%), Osmanabad (2.64%), Sangli (2.30 %) and Thane (2.11%).Similarly, 11 districts have Covid-19 growth rate higher than the state average of 0.044 %. These include Ahmednagar (0.152%) Palghar (0.112%), Raigad (0.106%), Sindhudurg (0.105%), Mumbai (0.078%), Ratnagiri (0.075%), Satara (0.075%), Sangli (0.082%), , Osmanabad (0.078%), Solapur (0.116%) and Pune (0.066%). Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force and director, critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said the cases are declining. “Although the number of cases is going down, the process is taking time. Currently, we need to keep close watch and be proactive by taking timely action whenever we witness a surge,” said Dr Pandit. The state cabinet expressed apprehensions on the growing cases in districts like Ahmednagar and Pune. It said that local administration should be instructed to take steps to reduce the numbers. Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, credits the vaccination process and various proactive steps taken responsible for the decline of cases. “Vaccination has played a major role in blunting the effects of the virus and also reducing the death rates,” said Dr Mandot. “However, we should not let our guard down on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 2,876 Covid-19 new cases and 90 deaths. The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,567,791. There were 150,584 tests done on Wednesday, while the number of recoveries clocked 2763.The total active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 33,181, while the total deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 139,362. There are currently 33,181 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 8,929 patients followed by Mumbai and Ahmednagar with 5,451 and 4,186 active patients respectively. The death toll has now reached 139,362 with Pune leading with 19,495 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 16,136 and Thane with 11,382.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-over-600-covid-cases-after-over-80-days-101633542122677.html

06-10-2021||Mumbai||With quarantine or Covid-19 vaccination centres on premises, over 20 municipal schools yet to restart||Three days after all schools in the city restarted classes 8 to 12, about 20-25 municipal schools had still not opened until Wednesday, as they have vaccination or quarantine centres in the premises. The schools are likely to open from Monday onwards. In its circular issued last Wednesday, instructing schools to start from October 4, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) asked all assistant commissioners of the 24 administrative wards in the city, to find alternate feasible premises to shift quarantine or vaccination centres that were housed in municipal schools. There were 16 municipal schools that had quarantine centres and 35 that had vaccination centres. These were to be moved to nearest municipal amenities centres, such as marriage halls. However, in some cases, officials were not able to find alternate locations, and about 20-25 schools did not start on Monday this week. “It is more difficult to find alternate locations for vaccination centres and quarantine centres in schools located in slums, because there are no buildings as such nearby. In such cases, we have identified municipal open spaces and are constructing mandaps on them with tarpaulin and tin sheets to start vaccination centres. Now that monsoon is almost over, this is feasible,” a senior civic official said. On Wednesday, Marathi and Hindi medium schools had a holiday due to pitrupaksha, and English and Urdu medium schools were working. On Tuesday, attendance dropped in BMC schools in comparison to Monday. According to figures from BMC, 30,250 students attended schools on Monday, while 23,162 students attended on Tuesday. A total of 755 municipal schools have restarted and operated classes on all three days this week. Data for Wednesday was being updated till the end of the day. A senior civic official said, “It is early to say attendance has dropped. It may be fluctuating, as many schools are taking different classes on alternate days. So attendance of students may vary grade wise. By the end of the week, the picture will become clearer.” Principals of municipal schools have started conducting awareness sessions with parents and students and informing them about the safety measures being taken within the school premises, so more students get permission from parents to attend school. While attendance is not mandatory, all students require consent letters from parents to attend school. On Wednesday, 7,332 students attended schools, as only English and Urdu medium schools were open. Marathi and Hindi medium schools had a holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-quarantine-or-covid-19-vaccination-centres-on-premises-over-20-municipal-schools-yet-to-restart-101633541699171.html

After that, NHAI requested the corporation to develop infrastructure as they are expertise in road construction.Finally, the corporation showed a positive response and agreed to develop infrastructure as per the requirement of the Defence Ministry.On August 27, 2017, Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone of the project.

06-10-2021||Bhopal||MP CM Chouhan thanks PM Modi for gifting India with ‘Swamitva Yojana’||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for gifting the nation with the Swamitva Yojana. Chouhan called PM Modi ‘a man of ideas’ ahead of the virtual programme where PM Modi addressed 171,000 villagers across 3,000 villages and 19 districts of Madhya Pradesh while distributing the rights records under Swamitva Yojana to them.PM Modi distributed rights records and interacted virtually with the concerned beneficiaries of Harda, Dindori and Sehore districts.“The Prime Minister is a man of ideas. Before him, no one had noticed that the land in the village should be given ownership, there was no paper, so the land had no meaning. But today, when the ownership of that land is being received in the form of a letter of authority, we have now seen that land can be availed in many ways,” Chouhan said ahead of the virtual event.Chouhan also congratulated PM Modi on completing 20 years of service as the head of a government.PM Modi while addressing the beneficiaries said the soul of India resides in its villages. “I am satisfied that the economically weaker people in Madhya Pradesh are getting the ownership papers of their land easily. Citizens are being empowered and made self-dependent by giving them ownership rights over inhabited land. I believe that rights records will be available in all the villages soon in Madhya Pradesh,” PM Modi said.“The strength of the villages of India is in their land. People are not using it for their development. They have to face disputes, fights and many difficulties. Gandhiji had also expressed concern about this situation. It is our responsibility to make improvements in this area,” PM Modi further added.Chouhan highlighted that the Swamitva Yojana empowered the villagers of the country. “While the records of land would be available to the villagers, on the basis of these records with the implementation of the Swamitva Yojana in the country, the villagers would now be able to take loans from the bank for building a house or opening a shop,” Chouhan said.Chouhan dedicated 380 solar-powered Anganwadi buildings in Harda district on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-cm-chouhan-thanks-pm-modi-for-gifting-india-with-swamitva-yojana-101633540454700.html

Fadnavis insisted that the issue is of drugs and not any political affiliation.“The question isn't who was there or not there; if they were affiliated with BJP or not. Question is whether a drug party was going on in the cruise, and if indeed it was, would Nawab Malik support it, why doesn’t he talk about that,?” Fadnavis told reporters on Wednesday.“Evidence says drugs were coming in and a drug party was going on the cruise,” he added.Popular Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan's son Aryan Khan was arrested by NCB from the cruise along with Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha on Sunday after it carried out a raid in a cruise off the coast of Mumbai.Fadnavis also claimed that Malik has been criticising NCB because it “arrested his direct relative in a drug-related case”. The leader of the Opposition was referring to the arrest of Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan in connection with the seizure of 200 kilograms of marijuana after the agency arrested British national Karan Sejnani from Khar and two sisters Rahila and Shaista Furniturewala from Bandra on January 9.Khan and his co-accused were granted bail by a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court on September 27, after his counsel argued that substances seized from Khan were only tobacco and herbal products and not covered under the NDPS Act.Malik alleged on Wednesday that the two men seen escorting Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant to NCB’s Mumbai office were private individuals and not officers. He said at a press conference in Mumbai that one of the men is Manish Bhanushali who claims to be a BJP office-bearer and the other is KP Gosawi, who claims to be a private detective based out of Kualalumpur. He also played a recording of Khan and Merchant’s arrest.“According to the Bhanushali’s Facebook page, he is a BJP vice president and has photos with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda and other senior leaders including those from Maharashtra such as Devendra Fadnavis and Ashish Shelar,” Malik told reporters at party headquarters at Ballard Pier in South Mumbai.NCB deputy director-general Gyaneshwar Singh, however, told reporters that both Bhanushali and Gosawi were two of the nine independent witnesses and the agency had carried out the raid while following proper legal provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/question-isn-t-who-was-there-or-not-there-devendra-fadnavis-hits-back-at-ncp-s-claims-101633540236373.html

Daytime temperature, meanwhile, continued to climb, touching 35.1°Celsius (C) on Wednesday, breaching last year’s record for the month. In October 2020, the city had recorded a maximum temperature of 35°C on the 10th, 28th and 29th of the month. The highest October temperature was recorded at 38.6°C in 2015. The city has recorded above normal daytime temperature for four straight days now. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the mercury remained at 34.5°C. “It is not expected to fall below 35°C over the next week unless there are daytime showers to break the heat,” said a spokesperson with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.Meanwhile, occasional thundershowers and moderate rain, along with partly cloudy skies, are expected to prevail till at least October 12, as per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) seven-day forecast for its monitoring station in Santacruz.As forecast by the IMD earlier this week, the delayed withdrawal of the southwest monsoon began on Wednesday from some parts of India, including Gujarat and Rajasthan. While the monsoon is expected to withdraw entirely from north India in the next three to four days, it will linger over parts of central India and Maharashtra, including Mumbai, for about another week. “The withdrawal of monsoon over the city still seems unlikely before October 15. Till then, post-monsoon showers will happen once in a while,” said the official.Train services disruptedOwing to heavy rainfall and thunderstorm in the city, local train services on the main and trans-harbour line of Central Railway (CR) were impacted on Wednesday. On the trans-harbour railway route, train services were disrupted due to electric supply on the overhead wires near Airoli railway station on Wednesday evening. On the main line, local train services were functional between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan, but were disrupted between Kalyan and Karjat and Karjat and Kasara railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/postmonsoon-thundershowers-prevail-as-temperature-continues-to-rise-in-mumbai-101633538755533.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab transport policy in limbo for three years||Three years after its notification, the state transport policy has been implemented only in bits and pieces in Punjab. The transport department is now planning to come up with a revised policy after taking feedback from all stakeholders.The policy notified in 2018 mainly envisaged streamlining of bus operations, of both private and state transport undertakings, and curtailing unhealthy competition that results in speeding and unauthorised stoppages.Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener, PRTC-linked trade unions, said the main component of the transport policy was to digitise timetables of private and government buses.The policy clearly stated that to curb unhealthy competition, which causes discomfort to passengers on board and threatens road safety, a computerised timetable and roster of movement will be introduced within one year.“Nothing has been done so far in this regard, as private players continue to flout manual time tables, leading to losses to state undertakings,” said Dhaliwal.Among other key components, the policy stated that public and private operators should install global positioning system (GPS) and radio frequency identification tags in order to enable monitoring of their entry and exit at bus stands, adherence to routes, speed, stoppages and regularity of service. With an eye on safety and security of passengers, operators were also required to install CCTV cameras and panic buttons in buses. Dhaliwal said the transport authorities should conduct a field survey to check the implementation.Overhaul in the offingAmrinder Singh Raja Warring, the newly inducted transport minister, said the policy requires an overhaul, for which he has already instructed senior officials to gather feedback. “Officials have been instructed to ensure implementation of the timetable and roster at bus stands , while the whole process will be digitised soon,” said Warring.The minister said the department is also finalising working hours for drivers. “In case of an accident, the driver will have to go through a proper medical process and orientation programme for three months under the revised policy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-transport-policy-in-limbo-for-three-years-101633538695513.html

Besides, divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal also instructed the district education officer to enforce Covid-19 guidelines at all city schools. “Private schools have been asked to disperse 50% of students at a time and another half after a gap of 15 minutes. Students of classes 1 to 5 can be released first, followed by classes 6 to 12. Similarly, a gap of 15 minutes is mandatory during lunch hour, so that all students do not rush in the campus together,” Agarwal said, adding that similar closing time of schools also leads to huge traffic jam in various localities.This comes after several parents complained to the district administration about alleged violation of Covid-19 protocols at schools, as a huge crowd of students and guardians was spotted every day near school premises during dispersal. Private schools can formulate internal plans for regulating crowd inside and outside their premises, said the divisional commissioner. All schools in the state are functional at full strength after the state government allowed their reopening for classes 9 to 12 from August 6, and for classes 1 to 8 from August 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/regulate-dispersal-of-students-patna-district-admn-tells-schools-101633538155330.html

Police on Tuesday resorted to lathicharge after people refused to remove encroachment from the government land. Locals allegedly pelted stones at the police. One of the injured, identified as tea stall owner Rajesh Thakur (36), was taken to a private nursing home, where he died during treatment on Tuesday night. As the news of the death spread, irate locals took to streets. A team of police officers and administration officials rushed to the spot with additional forces to bring the situation under control. After six hours, locals agreed to lift the blockade when the administration agreed to fulfil their demands, including compensation, a government job for the next of kin of the deceased and rehabilitation of people whose huts and shops were removed for the metro project. The administration paid ₹20,000 for performing last rites of Thakur, said a police officer.About 20 huts had encroached government land at Malahi Pakari area, where about 100 families used to stay. The Patna municipal corporation had issued notices to people to remove their belongings.Naveen Kumar, subdivisional officer (Patna Sadar), said, “The administration on Wednesday provided benefits under the government scheme to the kin of deceased for last rites. The body was sent to the PMCH for autopsy. I saw a video of Tuesday’s incident. However, there was nothing to prove that the deceased was injured. We will look into the matter after the autopsy is done.” CPI-ML MLA Mehboob Alam staged a dharna at Malahi Pakri, demanding compensation for the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/man-injured-in-police-lathicharge-in-patna-dies-101633537615387.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||One in seven patients missed cancer surgery during lockdowns: Lancet study||One in seven patients missed planned cancer surgery during the lockdown, a new study published in The Lancet Oncology has found. While immediate and short-term outcomes were not compromised, there could be a reduction in long-term survival among patients, who had delayed or cancelled surgeries, the study said. A cohort of 20,006 patients, including 1,566 from India, with 15 types of cancers was followed up for the study. These patients were under treatment in 466 hospitals across 61 countries and had a decision for curative surgery during the pandemic. They were followed up until the point of surgery or till they stopped the follow-up up to August 31, 2020. “Of eligible patients awaiting surgery, 2003 or 10% of 20,006 did not receive surgery after a median follow-up of 23 weeks, all of whom had a Covid-related reason given for non-operation,” said the study led by experts from the University of Birmingham. As many as 5,000 surgeons and anaesthetists from across the world collaborated on it. Of the 2,003 non-operated patients, 453 patients were formally re-staged and 179 had progressed to unresectable disease. At least 48 patients died before their planned surgery – 14 due to Covid related complications and 34 due to non-Covid related causes. It was observed that increasing cases of Covid-19 were associated with increased rates of non-operation. Both moderate and full lockdowns were consistently associated with an increased likelihood of non-operation. “Accessing healthcare facilities was difficult for patients during lockdown restrictions,” said Dr Shailesh Shrikhande, deputy director of Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) and one of the collaborators in the study. “There was also fear about Covid-19 infection and lack of information among patients that may have resulted in the delay,” he said. TMH is one of the biggest cancer centres in the country that registered an average of 80,000 new patients annually before the pandemic. In 2020, when the pandemic hit Mumbai, TMH saw a decline in footfall with 62,000 registrations. The hospital, however, took the lead in starting elective surgeries amid the pandemic, by scientifically and strategically choosing patients. “Cancer will not wait for Covid-19 to disappear. We have to therefore plan our hospitals well and triage well in order to face such challenges in the future,” said Shrikhande. He said that even as the Mumbai centre recorded a decline in registrations, newly developed hospitals under the Tata Memorial Centre in other cities recorded an uptick during the pandemic. This suggested that patients opted to get treatment at local or nearest centres as travelling to Mumbai was difficult due to the lockdown. Dr Nikhil Agrawal, a gastrointestinal cancer surgeon at Max Superspeciality Hospital in Delhi, also a collaborator to the Lancet study, said, “We should strengthen our cancer care delivery pathways for future shocks like the Covid-19 pandemic.”From operating nearly 200 patients a month, the surgical oncology department at Max Superspeciality Hospital came down to performing only about 10% to 20% of procedures when the pandemic hit in 2020. “As we got to know more about the virus and the infection, we put systems in place and the number of operations slowly went back to the normal average,” said Agrawal, adding the surgery numbers were again affected during the second wave when Delhi struggled with Intensive Care Unit beds and oxygen supply. The Lancet study, too, emphasised the need to strengthen the resilience of elective surgery systems. “In order to prevent further harm during future lockdowns, we must make the systems around elective surgery more resilient – protecting elective surgery beds and operating theatre space, and properly resourcing ‘surge’ capacity for periods of high demand on the hospital, whether that is Covid, the flu or other public health emergencies,” James Glasbey, co-lead author of the study from the University of Birmingham said in a media release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-in-seven-patients-missed-cancer-surgery-during-lockdowns-lancet-study-101633537135259.html

IMD officials said that a low pressure area is likely to form over the north Andaman Sea around October 10. It would move towards the coast of south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh over the next four to five days. “Chances of rainfall activity over the districts of south Bengal, including Kolkata and its adjoining areas, are likely to increase between October 13 and October 15. There could be light to moderate rainfall in Kolkata, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly during that period,” said a senior IMD official in Kolkata. Durga Puja is the biggest annual festival in West Bengal. Mahalaya, which marks the beginning of the Durga Puja festivities in the state, was celebrated on Wednesday, while the Durga Puja would be held this year from October 11 to October 15. Immersion would start from the afternoon of October 15 and would continue till October 17. Officials also said while there are chances of scattered rain and thundershowers in Kolkata and other districts of south Bengal between October 6 and October 8, from October 9 to October 12 the weather is likely to remain fair over south Bengal and chances of rain are less. In north Bengal the weather would remain fair from October 9 to October 15. Durga Puja will be celebrated in a muted manner for the second consecutive year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Calcutta high court has banned the entry of visitors inside Durga puja pandals once again this year to check the spread of the viral disease. While at least 36,000 community pujas are held across the state, in Kolkata alone 2500 community pujas are held by various clubs. These are just the clubs that are registered with the state government. This apart there are pujas held in housing societies and residences. There are around 1500 pujas which are organised by women only. The state government too has issued a series of guidelines based on the high court orders. The puja carnival which is held during the immersion has been cancelled this year, while puja committees have been directed not to organise any cultural programs. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurated some of the big puja pandals on Wednesday. “Please wear a mask when you go for pandal hopping. Puja committees should distribute masks to visitors,” she said while inaugurating a puja pandal in south Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/rain-likely-during-durga-puja-in-south-bengal-northern-parts-to-enjoy-fair-weather-101633536895338.html

This has given a new identity to UP,” he said while addressing a gathering in Chandauli district where he laid the foundation of a ₹274-crore government medical college that would be named after Baba Kinaram. The chief minister also laid foundation/inaugurated development schemes worth over ₹550 crore. Yogi said development projects worth over ₹800 crore were being initiated in Chandauli because people elected good representatives in 2017. “People, who were in power in UP from 2004 and 2017, didn’t do anything for development. They engaged in self development and filled the pockets of mafias and contractors from funds meant for development projects, instead of utilizing the money for UP’s development,” he alleged. “The medical college, which will be ready by November 2022, will produce doctors and also provide better medical care to locals. Youths will not have to go out of the district for medical education,” stated the CM. Yogi Adityanath said financial penalty would be slapped on the executing agency if did not complete the medical college project within the deadline. A medical college each would be ready in all 75 districts of the state by 2024. He said the state government also decided to give employment guarantee to youths. “Jobs were auctioned during the rule of SP and BSP. But his government ensured free and fair recruitment,” added Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mafia-terror-bulldozed-to-create-atmosphere-of-security-in-up-yogi-101633532154519.html

The judge said so on Wednesday during a hearing in the case built by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Special judge S R Navander asked special public prosecutor (SPP) Prakash Suryavanshi to submit a list of witnesses he would be examining. Whereas defense lawyer, advocate Suvarna Avhad-Vast, denied the list of documents submitted by the SPP during the last hearing. “I have submitted the list of documents. Now that they have been denied, I will have to prove the documents in court during the trial,” SPP Suryavanshi said. Judge Navander told SPP Suryavanshi, “We will decide during the next hearing. You make a programme and give it to the court (for witness examination).”The judge is considering using a bigger room in the court premises as an alternative in order to facilitate social distancing as the current courtroom has restricted space. The judge might also decide to hold the trial inside the jail. The judge said that these options are being considered as the defense wants the accused to be physically present when the trial begins.Three of the accused - Virendrasing Tawade, Sachin Andure, and Sharad Kalaskar – were shifted to Yerawada jail from different jails in the state for this purpose. The two other accused, advocate Sanjeev Punalekar and Vikram Bhave, are out on bail. While Punalekar is facing charges of destruction of evidence, all others are facing charges of terrorism, murder and criminal conspiracy. All have pleaded ‘not guilty’.Dabholkar was shot dead near Omkareshwar bridge in Pune at around 7.30am on August 20, 2013 while he was on a walk. Andure and Kalaskar have been accused of being the bike-borne shooters; Tawade has been accused of being the mastermind; Bhave has been accused of conducting the recee and providing the bike; while Punalekar has been accused of advising Kalaskar to throw the weapon away.Advocate Avhad-Vast also rekindled the issue of an article written by advocate Nihal Singh Rathod published in a well-read Marathi daily. After the last hearing, the newspaper had published an apology written by the original author. Therefore, the judge called it an act of ‘criminal defamation’ but refrained from initiating any legal action against the paper’s editor and Rathod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dabholkar-murder-trial-judge-to-decide-covid-appropriate-location-101633531074627.html

The HC bench asked why the rule was not applied to the employees of the local bodies at villages, tehsils and district councils, though similar provisions were applied to their elected representatives by introducing a disqualification clause.“As such, we express our disapproval to Rule 6 of the 2005 Rules and request the state government to delete Rule 6 and make these rules applicable uniformly to all employees of the state government, state instrumentalities, local authorities and local bodies, if the laudable object of controlling the growth of population is to be achieved,” said the bench.Also Read: Won’t make false promises: Maharashtra CM on BJP’s criticism over no relief to farmersThe court’s direction came while hearing a plea by Ramnath Sasane, an employee of a village panchayat in Ahmednagar district, who had challenged a show cause notice asking why action should not be taken against him for flouting the small family - maximum two children - norm. Sasane argued that the 2005 rules were not applicable to him as he was employed months before it came into force in March 2005, and because he was not a government employee, as contemplated under the 2005 rules.

06-10-2021||Mumbai||NCP sees a BJP link to Aryan Khan arrest in drugs case; NCB rebuttal follows||MUMBAI: Two men, who escorted Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and another accused Arbaaz Merchant to the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) Mumbai office, were private individuals and not officers, Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik said on Wednesday. Malik allegedly that the arrest was a conspiracy involving NCB and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defame Maharashtra, the state government and the film industry, a charge that was promptly denied by the NCB and BJP. NCB later said the two men were among the nine independent witnesses.One of them is Manish Bhanushali who claims to be a BJP office-bearer and the other is KP Gosawi, who claims to be a private detective, said Malik at a Press conference in Mumbai where he played two widely-circulated video clips of Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant. In the first, KP Gosawi can be seen bringing Aryan Khan to NCB office and in the second, Manish Bhanushali can be seen bringing Arbaaz Merchant to the NCB office, Malik said.In what capacity were the two private individuals allowed to bring high-profile accused to its office, asked Malik, who is also the minority affairs minister in Uddhav Thackeray cabinet. He also asked the BJP what its connection was with the two people.Gosawi had earlier also taken a widely-circulated selfie with Aryan Khan before the 23-year-old was formally placed under arrest on Sunday, initially triggering criticism on social media on the assumption that the man was an NCB officer. NCB subsequently issued a statement, clarifying that the individual was not an NCB officer.“According to the Bhanushali’s Facebook page, he is a BJP vice president and has photos with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda and other senior leaders including those from Maharashtra such as Devendra Fadnavis and Ashish Shelar,” Malik told reporters at party headquarters at Ballard Pier in South Mumbai.Malik alleged that the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, in connivance with the federal drug enforcement agency NCB, was trying to defame Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government and film industry, which is based in the commercial capital, Mumbai.“BJP is using NCB to defame people who are against them and also using its leaders and workers in raids. What is Bhanushali’s connection with the massive drug haul caught in Gujarat...BJP in connivance with NCB is defaming Maharashtra, MVA government and the film Industry,” Nawab Malik alleged.“It all started with Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case. The claims were made that he was murdered because of drugs and NCB’s zonal office in Mumbai came into limelight. Stories were planted, attempts were made to defame film industry, those related to the industry were called one by one, cameras were set up in advance and news channels ran the stories 24x7 and a perception was created that entire Bollywood, which is based in Mumbai, has a nexus with drug racket. In the same series, we saw that Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3,” he added.NCB takes a swipe at Nawab MalikMumbai zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Sameer Wankhede said there is no substance in the allegations. NCB deputy director general Gyaneshwar Singh later told reporters that the ahecy officials followed the legal provisions. Singh said there were nine independent witnesses and Manish Bhanushali and Kiran Gosawi were among them.“The allegations made against the agency are baseless and if anyone has any reservation, he or she can approach the court and we will appropriately reply to them,” Singh added. The allegations are perhaps levelled by persons affected by the action taken by the agency, Singh said, without mentioning that NCB recently arrested Nawab Malik’s son-in-law in a drugs related case.The BJP said the NCP should clarify whether they are opposing or supporting the action against drug mafia.“First of all, NCP should clarify whether they support or oppose action against the drug mafia. We suspect Nawab Malik has other intentions behind making the allegations rather than supporting actor Shah Rukh Khan,” said Keshav Upadhye, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson.“It is up to the NCB to decide if they want to take action over involving private people in the raid. We have no objection to it. By having pictures with senior BJP leaders, one cannot become a BJP leader,” he clarified, in response to the allegations of BJP’s involvement in the raid.Bhanushali said he was a BJP party worker. “I did not bring Arbaaz Merchant to NCB office but was accompanying the NCB officers as I was asked by them to come and sign the documents as a witness. The raid was conducted with the help of the information provided by me about the drug party, Bhanushali told ABP Majha, a Marathi news channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-sees-a-bjp-link-to-aryan-khan-arrest-in-drugs-case-ncb-rebuttal-follows-101633529155536.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Majha region has already reported 200 farm fires||Even as paddy harvesting is yet to pick up the pace due to the delayed monsoon withdrawal, as many as 201 cases of stubble burning have been reported already in three of the four districts in Punjab’s Majha region. With 162 cases, Amritsar tops the list, while Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur have reported 35 and two cases, respectively. In Pathankot, harvesting is yet to begin. Stubble burning is a quick and cheap way to prepare soil bed for the next crop. However, widespread farm fires reduce the air quality to dangerous levels in the region every year. The agriculture department officials have been visiting villages and making announcements from gurdwaras to encourage farmers not to burn paddy stubble. Though the exact figures for the corresponding period in previous years are not readily available, Kuljit Singh Saini, who is the chief agriculture officer for Amritsar and Tarn Taran, says that, in his experience, the number of stubble burning incidents reported in the two districts has gone down. “Our teams are in the field, organising awareness camps against stubble burning. Those farmers who are not burning stubble will be honoured. Special prizes will also be given to panchayats that encourage farmers to shun this polluting practice,” says Saini. However, scientists and environmentalists have warned that this year, farm fires in north India are likely to be more intense than in previous years, considering the delayed monsoon withdrawal from the region. On Wednesday, the air quality index was recorded at 70 in Amritsar. Though in the “satisfactory” range so far, it could quickly turn “poor” if stubble burning incidents continue in the coming days, warn experts. However, farmers say they are forced to burn the paddy stubble despite knowing its environmental consequences. “We know that stubble burning not only pollutes the environment, but also damages the fertility of our fields. We have been demanding that adequate machinery be provided to us through village-level societies for stubble management besides a bonus of ₹200 per quintal. But, the government is doing nothing,” says Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC)’s state convener Kawalpreet Singh Pannu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-majha-region-has-already-reported-200-farm-fires-101633528674062.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||MDS counselling in Punjab from October 14||After a six-month delay, Baba Faridkot University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) will start the counselling for admissions to the Master of Dental Surgery (MDS) courses at 12 dental colleges in Punjab on October 14. The Faridkot-based university on Wednesday invited applications after the department of medical education and research issued a notification. Dr Nirmal Ouseppachan, registrar, BFUHS, said the eligible candidates who have cleared the NEET-PG (MDS) 2021 can apply online through the university website (https://bfuhs.ac.in) till October 11. The provisional merit list of candidates will be displayed on October 13. The first round of physical counselling will be conducted at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH), Faridkot, on October 14. The 12 private and government dental colleges in the state offer 135 MDS seats under state quota. Another 10 MDS all-India quota seats in two government dental colleges are filled by the medical counselling committee MCC through the central counselling process. As per the government notification, an MDS student has to pay ₹4.5-lakh fee for the full three-year course in a government college and ₹5.85 lakh in a private medical college. The NEET-PG (MDS) examination was conducted on December 16, 2020, and the result was declared on December 31. However, the counselling process, which usually starts in March, was suspended by the central government for an indefinite time amid the second wave of the pandemic. The counselling for admissions to MD, MS and MDS courses usually starts at the same time, but the NEET-PG exam was postponed till August. Following this, MDS counselling could also not be conducted. After a number of pleas were filed in the Supreme Court against the delay, MDS counselling is now starting before the counselling process for admissions to MD and MS courses. “The result of NEET-PG 2021 has also been declared; so the admission process for MD and MS courses will also start soon,” said Dr Ouseppachan. Counselling for para-medical courses on Oct 25 BFUHS has also invited applications for admissions to certificate, diploma, PG diploma and MSc courses at GGSMCH, Faridkot. “Duly filled application form along with requisite fee and documents must reach at the principal office, GGSMCH, Faridkot, by October 18. Counselling will be held at GGSMCH on October 25,” reads the notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mds-counselling-in-punjab-from-october-14-101633528434094.html

The suspect, Rohit Manral, a resident of Burari in New Delhi, was absconding since the murder, said police. Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer (SHO), Dadri police station, said on July 8, Dadri police found a body with bullet wounds near a canal in Dadri. “The police launched an investigation and found that the body was of one Danish, a 23-year-old resident of Bulandshahr.

Iqrar performed the last rites of his son and also filed a case against an unknown person for the murder. Tripathi said police scanned Danish’s mobile number and picked up a few suspects, who were frequently in touch with him, for questioning. “We also picked up Rohit for interrogation and he admitted to have murdered Danish. Rohit revealed that Danish had asked him to meet in Dadri saying he had hatched some plans to commit a series of loot. He also promised Rohit a share of the looted valuables,” said the SHO. However, when Rohit reached the spot where Danish called him, he found Danish did not want to commit any crime. “Danish was talking to some woman on his phone on loudspeaker when Rohit asked him to disconnect the call. This led to an argument and in a fit of rage, Rohit killed Danish,” said Tripathi. Police said Rohit and Danish belonged to Billu Dujana gang in Greater Noida. Rohit is also wanted in seven criminal cases in Greater Noida. “We have recovered the countrymade gun used in the murder.

06-10-2021||Mumbai||Lakhimpur Kheri incident: MVA calls for Maharashtra Bandh on October 11||The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition partners on Wednesday called a strike in Maharashtra on October 11 to protest against the killings in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri. The announcement was made by the Nationalist Congress Party chief Jayant Patil.The decision from the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress - all members of the MVA coalition - comes a day after the Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for a short meeting regarding the incident.Following his meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Raut said that a unified opposition is necessary for the country. “I met Rahul Gandhi. I have also held discussions with him on the Lakhimpur incident. A united opposition is very important for the country and to save democracy,” Raut said.Earlier in the day, the Maharashtra cabinet passed a resolution expressing regret over the death of farmers in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri. The lawmakers also stood in silence as a mark of respect in the legislative assembly.The Shiv Sena has criticised the Modi-led government for not paying attention to the demands raised by the farmers. In its editorial Saamana, the party said that the BJP-led government illegally detained Priyanka Gandhi and wanted to know why she was being held from visiting the family of the victims.Former Maharashtra chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis came out in support of the Yogi Adityanath-led government and said that the UP government is capable of investigating the case on its own.“The UP government is capable of investigating the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. The MVA government should look at the plight of farmers in Maharashtra,” Fadnavis said.Four farmers died in Sunday’s violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. Four other people - two BJP workers, a journalist and Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra’s driver - were lynched by the farmers who were protesting against the three farm laws and the visit of the Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister KP Maurya at a nearby village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-mva-calls-for-maharashtra-bandh-on-october-11-101633526715309.html

The drive, which began on October 4 and will continue till October 13, is aimed at inoculating at least 10,000 people within the 10-day period.As part of the drive, 10,000 fisherfolk and people from vulnerable communities in south Mumbai will receive the two doses of the Covishield vaccine as per government directives and protocols, free of cost. The drive will serve marginalised people who have not been able to access them earlier due to the nationwide vaccine supply shortage and vaccine hesitancy.Launched by ChildFund India in collaboration with the Municipal Corporation Greater Mumbai and city-based Surana Hospital, the drive is supported by HSBC Bank. The drive was flagged off by Colaba MLA Rahul Narwekar BMC's Ward 226 corporator Harshita Narwekar at a private Covid-19 vaccination centre in Colaba in the presence of  ChildFund India country director Neelam Makhijani, HSBC India's head of corporate sustainability Aloka Majumdar, south Mumbai A ward medical officer (health) Dr Prajakta Amberkar and community leaders from the Machhimar nagar.India has 7,200km of coastline and around five crore fisherfolk making their living from the sea. Given these numbers, it is easy to see how a pandemic such as Covid-19 would have far-reaching implications. Vaccination support to the community was imperative and our efforts have been directed towards the same.ChildFund India claimed that it supported millions of people, including children, with awareness and vaccination drives, relief material, livelihood recovery opportunities, psycho-social support and necessary medical aid, as part of the COVID-19 response in the past 18 months. These efforts have so far reached over eight million people including children from vulnerable communities across the 15 states.“Through this initiative, ChildFund India and HSBC together are proactively contributing to the nation's goal of complete vaccine coverage. We are grateful to HSBC for joining hands in our endevour to keep people safe, secure and sustained,” Neelam Makhijani said.“Our interventions include providing medical equipment to 100 primary healthcare centres and comunity healthcare centres, setting up child-friendly Covid-care centres, providing food, hygiene and educational kits to families, launching an intensive vaccination drive and most importantly, providing livelihood opportunities,” Makhijani added.Aloka Majumdar said the marginalised communities in Mumbai have been particularly vulnerable and also lacked the access to adequate health care. “Vaccination has emerged as an effective measure to check the spread of the pandemic and this is the latest initiative amongst our various efforts to combat the pandemic and support our communities,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/10000-vaccinations-in-10-days-covid-19-inoculation-drive-launched-in-mumbai-101633524229281.html
06-10-2021||Ranchi||‘First preference for those who voted for me’: BJP’s Dhanbad MLA sets up a row||RANCHI: Bharatiya Janata Party legislator from Dhanbad Raj Sinha has sparked off a controversy by his remarks at a public event, telling his audience that areas that supported him in elections have the first right on development projects. “I speak very clearly. In my view, people who don’t vote for me don’t have the first right on development projects. But still, if I do 10 development works, I do at least two here and eight elsewhere. Don’t people who have made me a legislator have the first right over development work,” Sinha said at an event on Monday in the Muslim-dominated Wasseypur area of Dhanbad.After leaders of the Congress and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) criticised him for his approach that they alleged was aimed to polarise the city, Sinha shot back: “I don’t expect roses from the JMM and Congress”.Sinha told local reporters on Tuesday that people of Wasseypur generally do not approach him for work but whenever they do, he does solve their problems.On Wednesday, the minister said he stands by his statement.“I told them they keep voting for others just to oppose the BJP even if they don’t deliver. I requested them they should join the mainstream and vote for us (BJP). What’s wrong with that? It’s not that I don’t do development work in that area. Even that day, I was in that area to inaugurate a newly-constructed road,” Sinha told HT.Isn’t his statement contradictory to the Prime Minister and BJP’s slogan, ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas’? Sinha said this wasn’t correct since everyone has access to central schemes.“All schemes, be it roads, free gas, free ration, free housing from the Centre are being provided without discrimination in areas like Wasseypur as well,” he said.Leaders of rival parties, the JMM and Congress, continued their attacks on the BJP.“Using polarisation has always been a diversionary tactic of the BJP,” said JMM spokesperson Manoj Pandey, arguing that the effort to communalise was linked to the central government’s performance. “When they fail, they use communal politics. People now understand their tactics and will teach them a lesson when the time comes,” added Pandey.Jharkhand Congress spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said BJP and its leaders claim to work for the last man standing but in practice, they discriminate.“Otherwise, they talk of Ekatma Manawtawad (Integral Humanism professed by former Janasngh president Deendayal Upadhyay) but in practice, they discriminate on basis of religion. Earlier also BJP legislator from Ranchi targeted a specific area of the minority community for allegedly spreading Covid-19,” added Prasad. Raj Sinha said he wasn’t bothered about criticism from his opponents but his constituents. “They need to survey what even people from minority communities have to say about me and how much work I do for them,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/first-preference-for-those-who-voted-for-me-bjp-s-dhanbad-mla-sets-up-a-row-101633519959206.html

06-10-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: The 18 peths of 18th century Pune - Part 2||Development of Pune during Peshwa period could not be contained in seven peths named after week days. The major impetus of growth started after 1743 and many more peth areas were added on the map of Pune. Nagesh-Nyhal peth has been lost to public memory today as it was merged with Somwar peth and other contagious peths in later days. The peth supposedly got its name after an officer named Nyhal who was appointed by Khajagiwale to build the fortification around Pune during Nanasaheb’s times (work was left half-way and could be completed for unknown reasons). Nestled between Nagjhari and Daruwala bridge near Rasta peth, towards the Parsi Agyari, it was a small in area and a connection between Kasba, Somwar and Rasta peth. It might have been named Nagesh due to presence of the Nagoba temple or Nagjhari stream. Unlike all other peths of the city, Nyhal/Nagesh peth never took off to become a major trading settlement nor was it occupied by any significant dwellers. It merely served as a connection and was finally lost in oblivion.Ganesh peth was another small peth which was rebuilt by Jivajipant Khajagiwale on orders of Madhavrao Peshwa I and prospered after the Nizam’s raid in 1963. It houses the famous temple of Dulya Maruti built in the late 17th century and renovated by Naro Anant Natu. The peculiar epithet of Maruti is assigned after an interesting anecdote which was formed when news of the Panipat battle was received in the city. It is believed that the idol of Maruti shook vigorously on hearing of the dreadful defeat at Panipat. The peth housed the Peshwa mansion and prospered around the end of the 18th century. It had a mixed population including migrants from Karnataka and mainly consisted of timber stores.Narayan peth was established in 1761 and redeveloped by Lashman Vishwanath who named it after Narayanrao Peshwa. It was dominated by rice traders carried out by Marwadi Jains who began to live in Pune from the 1770s and traded with rice growers from Mawal region. The ward was mostly inhabited by wealthy Brahmins and had a number of temples, gardens and vast compounds. The peth also had a mansion built by the Gaikwads of Baroda for their residence in Pune.Bhavani peth was established by Mahadev Vishnath Limaye as per the kaul order during reign of Madhavrao Peshwa I and was supervised by Nana Phadnis. It was named after the famous Bhavani temple which was part of the older town of Pune. In the last decades of the 18th century, it had residences of several dignitaries living during their sojourns in Pune. The houses and shops were renovated according to a Peshwa records, and banking facilities were made available for the same. It rapidly became a commercial centre for trade and prospered after establishment of the Cantonment nearby. It housed the palace of the Gaikwads and the offices of Lokmanya Tilak’s Kesari and Maratha newspapers.Bhavani peth housed two hospices, takiyas (congregation spaces for Muslim fakirs), five temples, five maths and three police stations. The peth had eclectic mix of caste and communities including Kamathis, Kunbis, Lingayat Wani, Johari, Brahmin, Muslims, Sandaniswar (couriers riding camels), fakirs, Kaikadis (twig basket makers), Ramoshis and so on. The Kamathi migrant population from Andhra Pradesh could be found in large numbers here.Muzzafarganj peth was set up in 1768 by a commander in the army of Maloji Ghorpade, but it ceases to exist now. A group of beneficiary Karnataka Brahmins from the village Karkal used to camp around the banks of the Ambil stream, giving it the name “Karkolpura”. The divergence of the Ambil stream opened a large area from Ramanbaug to present day Tilak road. Sadashiv peth was set up by Nanasaheb Peshwa to commemorate the death of his cousin Sadashivrao Bhau at Panipat. Appaji Mudhe was made incharge of the Shete office to set up the peth and was given a kaul to such effect on August 19, 1769. The peth housed the famous “Khajina Vihir” water complex constructed by Nana Phadnis bringing water from the aqueduct at Ambegaon. Sadashiv peth’s precincts were serenely decorated with expansive gardens such as Haripant Phadke’s baug, Naro Chakradev’s Baug, Dada Gade’s baug near present day Khunya Murlidhar temple, Raste’s baug near present day Pune Vidyarthi gruha, and Nagarkar’s baug. It was a prestigious ward consisting of mansions of wealthy Brahmins including Vishrambaug wada. To quote a present day reference, it was the “Kothrud” of the Peshwa times (just as Kothrud is an extended Sadashiv peth of modern Pune)! The peth limits stretched upto Parvati and it consisted of residential mansions more than the commercial establishments. It is till date known as the “Brahmin heart” of Pune. Ghorpade peth established by 1781 by Vyankatrao Ghorpade (grandson of Maloji Ghorpade), who was in charge of the royal standard, “Jari Patka”, during the reign of Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa. It was originally meant for the cavalry and was later dominated by Malis (gardeners) and Chambhars (cobblers).Nana peth was established much later in 1789 by Nana Phadnavis and Shete officer Phirangoji Khonde. It is a commercial peth with wholesale merchants and those who provide transport facilities using bullock carts. “Ghodepir”, the well-known Muslim shrine set up by Nana’s servant, Nathu Khan, and the Nivdungya Vithoba temple are situated in the peth. Ganj peth was the salt store and place of heavy commercial activities with Jains and Wanis amongst the principal residents. Rasta peth also known as “Shivpuri” was one of the most prosperous established by Anand Lakshman Raste, commander of the Peshwa cavalry, in1783. Rastes from Wai, who has marital relations with the Peshwas, built the stately mansion of Raste wada in the heart of this peth and had their cavalry parked nearby. It is planned on a grid pattern, has straight roads and regular plots and assured water supply from the Raste aquaduct. Brahmin, Shimpi, Kunbi and Mali were the dominant castes. It was inhabited by immigrants in later periods, including the Bene Israeli-Jews and south Indians. Lastly, there exists the 19th peth of the 19th-20th century, which subsequently developed during the colonial period, which does not follow the “peth process”, but is obsoletely referred to as “Navi” i.e. new peth. It serves as extension of Sadashiv peth and connects the city to the western part of Pune. Commercial activities and the number of diverse inhabitants increased in late 18th and early 19th centuries in Pune. Pune also witnessed period additions to the city population. One was the number of army contingents under various commanders and its environs during festival celebrations such as Holi, Diwali and Dasara. Another great congregation was held during the holy month of Sharavan when Peshwas distributed Dakshina (grants and gifts) to Brahmins from all across India. Such congregations would put pressure on housing, transportation, food supply and goods, but would also increase trade and commerce, bringing cash flows in to the city. All in all, the expansion of the city through the setting up the 18 peths was a successful development venture initiated by the Peshwas. It contributed to the riches of the city and diversity of residents giving it a more cosmopolitan character. With population of around 100,000 at the end of the 18th century, Pune faired well when compared to contemporary urbanisation across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-the-18-peths-of-18th-century-pune-part-2-101633517259807.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Stepping into post-pandemic festive season with caution||As we bravely limp into this New World of ours, gingerly treading with caution towards attempting to once again live a normal life, massive behavioural changes and difficult adjustments stare us grimly in the face. How long will we have to live in this punishing atmosphere is anyone’s guess but what is certain is that our Earth, as we knew it, no longer exists! Its gentle and forgiving nature that we took for granted has metamorphosed into an aggressive, self-serving force, desperate for its own survival. The newer, mutant varieties of coronavirus and the threat of the imminent third or fourth waves of the Covid-19 pandemic hang over our heads like the proverbial sword of Damocles. We are still not sure of the way forward and most of us are in a daze or roaming about like headless chickens, mouthing prophesies, quoting newspaper articles or hearsay without much clarity or coherence. I’m still coming to terms with this radical turn of events where the first thing I notice in an old film or series on TV is the proximity of actors which alarms me, the sight of a large congregation of unmasked people makes my eyes goggle and it takes a while to orient my thoughts at the now strange sight of people sharing ice-creams, shaking hands or passing around a bottle of water. My brain does an incredulous jig at their negligence and disregard for Covid protocol before it sinks in that it will be a long time before that kind of casualness will return to our lives. Spontaneous trips and holidays have become a distant dream because a stern voice will nudge our conscience on the futility and imprudence of putting pleasure over caution and restraint. Imagine the horror of falling prey to the virus in a strange city or town! Even in our wildest imagination could we have ever dreamed that an innocuous piece of paper declaring ‘fully vaccinated’ would take precedence over passports, quickly become our chief identification and declare us kosher for any kind of travel? That there will be drawing room conversations and entire evenings devoted to arguments over the efficacy, time gap, quality and brand of a vaccination that we adults have to take? That quarantine, antigens and CPR are words that slip off even children’s tongues so easily today? But be that as it may, we humans are a resilient, stubborn lot! Just as easily as we fear, dread and press the panic button, we also have convenient memory lapses. A casual and Devil may care attitude is slowly sinking into our collective psyches. About two years since the first infections wafted across the seas and borders of the world, we have now adopted an almost cavalier attitude towards the Covid-19 pandemic and as we go into the fag end of the year, it is not possible to restrain the festive spirit, innate optimism and anticipation of good times to come. So, I hope and pray Mother Earth has forgiven us our transgressions and is gracious enough to give the human race a second chance and an opportunity to redeem ourselves. pallavisingh358@gmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stepping-into-post-pandemic-festive-season-with-caution-101633515998893.html

We will restore the area within 12 kilometers of its radius...covering the restoration of all historical structures, including Rifa-e-Aam Club...,” said divisional commissioner Ranjan Kumar, Historians say the restoration of the club would revive a chapter of the city’s rich heritage and culture. “The club’s restoration would not only save an important heritage structure from getting lost but will also make the present generation aware of its historical importance,” said Roshan Taqui, a historian, who has written books on Lucknow’s nawabi-era structures. He added it was perhaps the state’s first Indian club before independence.The club was established by nawabs and taluqdars in 1860 to hold their family functions. “It is said that since all British establishments carried a board mentioning ‘dogs and Indians not allowed’, the nawabs formed their own club. Later on, it was named as Rifa-e-Aam and was opened to commoners,” said Taqui. “The club was formed in response to the British government’s racial discrimination.”Also Read | Lakhimpur Kheri: Sidhu to lead Punjab Congress march to UP against BJPHe added the building hosted historical events and personalities including first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi. “The club hosted meetings of All India Muslim League and Indian National Congress that eventually led to the Lucknow Pact of 1916 (for separate representation to Muslims)...”A mound of garbage surrounds the building, which has also been encroached upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dozen-heritage-structures-to-be-restored-in-lucknow-101633515338839.html
06-10-2021||Patna||Nitish Kumar confident NDA will win both bypoll seats in Bihar; voting on Oct 30||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday asserted that the ruling NDA in the state, of which his JD(U) is a constituent, will win the bypolls to Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats. By-elections to the two seats will be held on October 30, and the results will be declared four days later, on November 3. "The NDA will win elections to both the constituencies without any difficulty. Both the seats were bagged by the JD(U) in the assembly polls last year. People have seen our work, they will vote for us," the CM told reporters at Patna airport, following his aerial survey of flood-hit areas in Vaishali, Muzaffarpur and East Champaran and other districts. Awadh Bhushan Hajari and Rajiv Kumar Singh of the JD(U) are the two National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidates for Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, respectively. Tarapur fell vacant after JD(U) MLA Mewa Lal Chaudhary succumbed to COVID 19. The party's candidate from the seat happens to be an old lieutenant of Kumar. The Kusheshwar Asthan candidate is the son of MLA Shashi Bhushan Hazari, who breathed his last at a Delhi hospital while undergoing treatment for Hepatitis B. Besides the BJP and the JD(U), former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of Mukesh Sahani are the two other NDA constituents in Bihar. Asked about his reaction to reports stating that RJD supremo Lalu Prasad may campaign for the upcoming by-elections, Kumar said, "What can I say? He can do whatever he wants. He was working from the jail in any case." Responding to another question on the apparent rift in the Grand Alliance over bypoll candidature, the CM quipped, "I came to know about it from you all (media persons). Every political party has its style of functioning. People are watching everything." Both the RJD and the Congress, the two main constituents of opposition Grand Alliance, have fielded candidates for the bypolls, bringing to the fore the cracks in the coalition. The CM, during his aerial tour, was accompanied by several senior officials. He said that his government would provide all possible aid to people suffering due to the flood. More than 34 lakh people have been reportedly affected by heavy rain and subsequent flooding in 32 districts of Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-confident-nda-will-win-both-bypoll-seats-in-bihar-voting-on-oct-30-101633514251123.html

On Tuesday, before the hike, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹108.67 while a litre of diesel was available at ₹98.80 in Mumbai. In Thane, a litre of petrol was available at ₹109.10 and a litre of diesel was priced at ₹99.31 following the hike on Wednesday. In Maharashtra’s Parbhani, a litre of petrol was being sold at ₹111.52 and in Amravati, diesel was available at ₹100.72 a litre. Petrol and Diesel prices were hiked on Tuesday, sending retail rates to all-time high levels, with a substantial increase expected in coming days as international oil prices touched seven-year high.State-owned fuel retailers have in the past few days resorted to modest increases to align domestic rates with cost. But with international benchmark Brent crude soaring to 82.37 $ a barrel as a result of the decision by OPEC+ not to increase output more than 0.4 million barrels per day, fuel rates are likely to rise even further.Also Read: Shirdi Sai Baba temple reopens tomorrow, check Covid-19 guidelinesGlobal oil prices are also rising because of rapid demand recovery due to easing of pandemic restrictions and improving vaccination rates. International oil rates, which are often volatile, directly influence the retail prices of petrol and diesel in India. Heavy loads of central and state taxes are also responsible for astronomically high rates.Through 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States, too, followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the central and state levies on petrol and diesel are over 50% of their retail prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/diesel-price-crosses-rs-99-l-in-mumbai-after-latest-fuel-price-hike-101633499136225.html

She would start with the puja pandal at Chetla Agrani in the afternoon, which is patronised by Firhad Hakim, a state minister. On Friday she is likely to inaugurate more puja pandals, including the one patronised by another state minister Sujit Bose in the northern fringes of the city,” said a TMC leader. Banerjee is also likely to inaugurate a few other big puja pandals on Wednesday afternoon including those in Jodhpur Park, 95 Pally, Babubagan and Selimpur Pally. “The auspicious occasion of Mahalaya marks the beginning of the much-awaited festive season. The countdown has begun! I extend my heartiest greetings and best wishes to all. Shubho Mahalaya!” Mamata Banerjee tweeted. “Shubho Mahalaya!

May everyone be happy as well as healthy in the times to come,” Narendra Modi, Prime Minister tweeted. In 2020, when the corona pandemic was raging, the chief minister had inaugurated more than 80 puja pandals including 69 virtual inaugurations.

While at least 36,000 community pujas are held across the state, in Kolkata alone 2,500 community pujas are held by various clubs registered with the state government. This apart, there are pujas held in housing societies and residences. Around 1,500 pujas are organised by women only. Durga puja is the biggest festival in West Bengal.

With the presence of the dry condition, AQI will remain satisfactory to moderate for the next three days.Safar said most of the air quality influencing factors are expected to contribute towards the deterioration of AQI levels in the coming days. The local wind speed and ventilation factor will remain in the moderate category leading to “low to moderate” dispersion of pollutants in the air, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/partly-cloudy-sky-in-delhi-with-air-quality-in-moderate-category-101633493075808.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||Trace rain in Delhi, change in wind likely to bring pollutants||As monsoon begins to withdraw from northwest India, parts of the national Capital received rainfall on Tuesday. Raisina Hill and India Gate complex in central Delhi saw moderate showers, while parts of north Delhi and other areas received light rain.According to the India Meteorological Department, 0.5 mm rainfall was recorded on Tuesday till 5.30pm.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), monsoon will begin withdrawing from many parts of northwest India starting Wednesday, leading to a gradual reduction in temperature and moisture.“The thunderstorm activity over some parts of Delhi [on Tuesday] was mainly due to high day time temperatures and moisture. There is also a western disturbance which is impacting the region. Withdrawal will happen gradually from all of northwest India,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.The minimum temperature on Monday were recorded at 25.7 degrees Celsius, while the maximum was recorded at 36.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature on Tuesday settled at 35.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above the normal.The weatherman has forecast cloudy sky for Wednesday, and the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 35 and 25 degrees Celsius respectively.The India Meteorological Department has issued green alert from October 5 to October 10, indicating uneventful weather conditions.Delhi’s air quality is likely to deteriorate and remain moderate on October 6 and 7, according to the ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system.One of the main reason for the drop in air quality in the capital is that now the predominant surface wind is likely to blow in from the northwest direction. North-westerly winds tend to blow fumes from stubble fires from northern India towards Delhi.Despite a late-onset, the monsoon this year has seen some erratic, record-breaking patterns. The monsoon officially arrived in the national capital on July 13, after a delay of 16 days instead of its usual onset on June 27. The resultant rainfall, arising from the late arrival of monsoon was, however, covered with only a few spells of heavy rain, with July receiving 507.1mm rain, compared to the normal precipitation of 210.6mm, and recording a surplus of 141%.In August, monsoon patterns changed again when the city experienced two spells of break monsoon. IMD officials said one such spell of break monsoon lasted for 10 days, making it one of the longest dry spells the city has ever seen in the monsoon season.In August, Delhi received 214.5mm rainfall against the average monthly precipitation of 247.7mm. The rainfall trends changed again in September. Unlike August, which by and large remained dry due to the break monsoon, Delhi recorded eight rainy days between September 1 and September 10 with the rainfall recording standing at 248.9mm against the normal of 62.6mm for those 10 days. The overall monthly average rainfall for September is 125.1mm. Last September, Delhi’s rainfall recording was only 20.9mm for the whole month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/trace-rain-in-delhi-change-in-wind-likely-to-bring-pollutants-101633471309792.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Portrait of an introvert||He has no known friends or relatives. Utterly alone, he seems to prefer his own company. This unnamed monkey lives in the dargah of Hazrat Chirag Dehlavi.He first surfaced in the south Delhi Sufi shrine during the lockdown early this year, when the city was reeling under the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. “No idea where he came from,” confesses Syed Moeez Ahmed Nasiri, a khadim, one of the shrine’s hereditary caretakers, who lives in the dargah with his family. The residences of the caretakers are situated at one end of the sprawling courtyard that is crisscrossed with centuries-old graves of known and unknown mystics.The monkey spends a large part of the day in this courtyard. Right now he is sitting by a rose-strewn grave. His expressive face has a curious kind of inner transparency, enabling one to interpret in it a reflection of one’s own feelings.The serene place shelters a variety of creatures, including at least five cats and scores of pigeons. The resident birds stay hyperactive during the day, flying across the shrine’s many domes; at night they disperse themselves within the courtyard’s six gigantic neem trees. “We also used to have lots of mynahs and parrots but most have gone away… don’t know where,” says Peerzada Aamir Ahmad Nasiri, another khadim in the shrine. The peacocks have completely disappeared, he says. “They haven’t been seen since the courtyard was paved with marble some 10 years ago.”The monkey is an introvert but everyone in the dargah, including the fakirs, have grown fond of him. “He is a bhoodha bandar (aged monkey),” asserts fakir Muhammed Qadir, explaining that “he walks very slowly, and like any old person he eats only soft food.”The monkey is now sitting by the dargah’s gateway, amid a handful of alm seekers and devotees. Nobody appears to be alarmed by his presence. A pilgrim enters and starts distributing bananas to everyone in the shrine; he hands one to the monkey, too. The monkey peels the skin (with some indifference), and goes on to eat the fruit very slowly.At night, the monkey retires to a roof in the dargah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-an-introvert-101633470336384.html

Police said they used to contact potential buyers using fake Facebook profiles. Two .32 bore pistols, four live cartridges, two magazines and three mobile phones have been recovered from their possession. The suspects have been identified as Harinderpal, 39, of Lallian Khurd village, Jalandhar; Balwinder Singh, 39, of Badhala village, Jalandhar, and Arjan Kumar, 22, of Rajasthan, who is currently living in Haibowal. They were arrested on the basis of a tip-off near Lajpat Nagar Park, close to the Ludhiana bus stand. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, investigation) Simratpal Singh Dhindsa said Arjan Kumar hails from Madhya Pradesh, from where he used to smuggle illegal weapons to other states including Punjab, with help of his two accomplices. “The accused made fake profiles on Facebook and posted pictures of weapons in different groups and also contacted potential buyers through direct messages. After receiving the order, they delivered the weapons to them,” said the DCP. “Harinderpal is a convict in a murder case and is facing trial in five cases, including assault, possessing illegal weapons, drug peddling and murder. He had got 20 years imprisonment in the murder case, but after serving six years of his sentence, he came out on bail and got involved in illegal activities again,” he added.

The director, along with his crew, then left the place. Later, they stopped replying to my phone calls,” said the dhaba owner.“After repeated attempts to contact Dhillon, I finally deposited the cheque but was shocked to know that the filmmaker had already stopped payment against the cheque,” said the complainant.Kumar said that on July 13, 2017, he filed a complaint to the then senior superintendent of police (SSP), who marked an inquiry to superintendent of police (investigation).

06-10-2021||Delhi||Rohini court shootout: 8 people plotted to kill Gogi, say cops||The plot to kill gangster Jitender Gogi was allegedly hatched in Delhi’s Mandoli jail and eight people were part of it, said police officers interrogating jailed gangster Sunil Maan, alias Tillu Tajpuriya, Gogi’s arch-rival.Gogi was gunned down on September 24 in a Rohini court, and Tajpuria, who was already in jail for another offence, was questioned as the prime conspirator.His three-day custodial interrogation ended on Sunday, and police learnt the original plan was to kill Gogi in a court in Panipat, Haryana. But when the gangsters learned that Gogi will be produced in Rohini a week before, they decided to take him down in Delhi, said an investigator, seeking anonymity.“Sunil Maan, who was once a friend of Gogi and now a member of Tajpuriya’s gang, was a co-accused in a decade-old attempt-to-murder case in Alipur, in which he and Gogi were arrested. As both of them were supposed to be present in the same courtroom on September 24, there is a strong possibility that Maan may have tipped off Tajpuriya about the court visit, allowing him to plot Gogi’s assassination. To verify this, we may seek Maan’s custody from jail,” the investigator said.Police said Tajpuriya’s old accomplice, gangster Naveen Bali, was also a co-conspirator. Like Tajpuriya, Bali is in Mandoli jail, and on Tuesday, the crime branch team secured his custody for two days.Around 1pm on September 24, Gogi, who was in Tihar Jail, was escorted to court number 207 on the second floor of the Rohini court complex by 10 personnel of the 3rd Battalion, Delhi Police, while 15-20 plainclothesmen from the Special Cell and the Rohini district police were present as well.Judge Gagandeep Singh in court when the two assailants, dressed as lawyers and seated on chairs in the courtroom, whipped out pistols and began firing at Gogi. As Gogi was hit, the policemen present there responded and killed the suspects in retaliatory fire.The next day, Special Cell sleuths arrested two more suspects, Umang Yadav and Vinay Yadav, who had accompanied Gogi’s shooters in an i-10 car to the court from a flat in Haiderpur village, three hours before the shootout. The duo’s interrogation and footage from the CCTV cameras installed at the court complex revealed that a fifth suspect was also present. The suspect was not known to the four men, as he was directly getting orders from his handler in jail.“Umang and Vinay had told us that the fifth man was sent by Tajpuriya. We interrogated Tajpuriya about that man’s identity and whereabouts. However, he claimed that he did not know the man because he was sent there by Bali. We will question Bali about him once we have his custody,” said a second police officer, requesting anonymity.The police are also looking for Tajpuriya’s second-in-command (his name has been withheld) for arranging for the firearms and other logistical support required in the execution of the crime.So far, the cellphone allegedly used by Tajpuriya in jail to get live updates about the shooting through internet video calling hasn’t been found. He told police that he destroyed the phone by first crushing it and then setting it on fire, the second officer said.Sandeep Goel, director general of Delhi prisons, said no burnt phone was found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rohini-court-shootout-8-people-plotted-to-kill-gogi-say-cops-101633469784699.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Law and order situation in a shambles in UP, says HP Congress||The Himachal Congress on Tuesday staged protests across the state over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, where a car from the convoy allegedly belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra ran over the protesting farmers, and the subsequent detention of Opposition leaders who were on their way to meet the victims. State Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore, who led the protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office in Shimla , said, “The law and order situation in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh is in a shambles and Opposition leaders are being put under house arrest to stop them from going to Lakhimpur Kheri.” “Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra mowed down farmers with his car, just a few days after the minister openly threatened the crush the farmers’ protests.The BJP leadership is doing all it can to suppress the farmers’ protest against the three contentious farm laws and has also resorted to massacring farmers,” the HP Congress chief said. “Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was arrested without an FIR. The BJP government is trying to stifle democracy and have always acted against farmers. In Himachal too, the police had opened fire on farmers and killed three people,” she said. Meanwhile, leading a protest at Shahpur in Kangra, state Congress general secretary Kewal Singh Pathania said the Union minister’s son run over the peaceful protesters and fuelled the violence. Saying Vadra’s arrest will mark the current dispensation’s downfall, Pathania said, “In 1977, the then Jan Sangh government’s downfall started with the arrest of former PM Indira Gandhi on October 3. Forty-four years later, the arrest of Vadra on October 3 also mark the beginning of current regimes downfall,” he said.The protesters have submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding strict action against those accused of killing farmers and the release of Opposition leaders. They also demanded resignation of Union minister Teni and a judicial probe into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-law-and-order-situation-in-a-shambles-in-up-says-hp-congress-101633469481292.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal bypoll: Posters calling Kripal Parmar an outsider crop up in Fatehpur segment||With politics heating up in Himachal Pradesh ahead of the byelections, posters have cropped up against former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar,a front-runner for BJP’s ticket in Fatehpur assembly segment of Kangra district. Fatehpur is among the three assembly segments and one parliamentary constituency going to polls on October 30. The byelection to the constituency was necessitated after the death of former Congress minister Sujan Singh Pathania, who represented Fatehpur in the current assembly, in February due to prolonged illness. The posters, calling Parmar an ‘outsider’, were put up in the streets and in front of the BJP’s local office at Rehan town by some unknown people on Monday night. Slogans like ‘Kripal Parmar Go Back,’ ‘People of Fatehpur will not accept an outsider’ and “Abki Bar Chakki Par’ (This time will send him across Chakki River) were written on posters. The slogans are a veiled reference to Parmar’s hometown Pathankot in Punjab. Chakki River forms the boundary between Punjab and Himachal. The incident also indicates that the local BJP unit is plagued with factionalism. Earlier too, similar posters had cropped up when he fought the 2017 assembly elections from Fatehpur. Parmar, who is currently the Himachal BJP vice-president, had lost to Congress’ Sujan Singh Pathania by a small margin of 1,284 votes. The main reason for his loss was infighting in the Fatehpur BJP unit. Party leader Baldev Thakur had contested as an independent and secured more than 13,000 votes while former BJP MP Rajan Sushant had polled over 6,200 votes. Interestingly, the slogan “Abki Bar Chakki Par” was coined by the BJP against Congress veteran Sat Mahajan who would contest from Nurpur. Parmar said his detractors don’t want him to be politically active in the constituency even though he has been living in Fatehpur for many years. The BJP has sent three names including Kripal Parmar, Baldev Thakur and Rita Thakur to the party high command for a final selection. Parmar is being touted as the strongest contender as he has the backing of national as well as state leadership given his close relationship with Prime Minister Narender Modi. Congress has declared Sujan Singh’s son Bhawani Singh Pathania as a candidate from Fatehpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bypoll-posters-calling-kripal-parmar-an-outsider-crop-up-in-fatehpur-segment-101633468156253.html

Even as committees have been formed over the years to conduct a viability survey of the buses to find out whether these can be put to use again or not, no concrete steps have been taken at ground level. The matter was also discussed during the meeting of the Board of Directors of Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited held in Zone D of the MC on Tuesday. Officials from the administration and the police department also participated in the meeting. Pardeep Sabharwal , MC commissioner, said a committee was formed to conduct a viability survey a few months ago and the secretary, RTA, was also a part of the committee. The committee members have sought 10 more days for completing the survey. The required recommendations will be made to the higher authorities in the local bodies department as per the report of the survey. If these buses can be used in some way, it will also generate employment opportunities. The buses have been dumped at the site for over eight years now and are lying in a dilapidated condition with many of the parts being stolen in the past. MC officials requesting anonymity said even then the MC would not be able to run the buses on city roads as these are big in size and cannot be run on narrow internal roads of the city which are marred by traffic jams. The authorities have also failed to run the facility at its full capacity. The project was started in February 2011 with the target of introducing 200 buses under the Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), but the authorities have not been able to properly run 120 buses, which were purchased. Out of the 120 buses, only 83 were transferred to the company and 37 are gathering dust at the depot. Out of the 83 buses in possession of the contractor, only few are being run on city roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-fails-to-explore-viability-of-reusing-37-defunct-buses-101633467256292.html

06-10-2021||Pune||Ahmednagar’s Covid surge adding to Pune’s health infra burden||PUNE: Pune’s neighbouring district and also the largest in the state – Ahmednagar (Nagar) – is now reporting an alarming number of new Covid-19 cases, possibly due to Covid-19 inappropriate behaviour and increased interaction during festivities. On Monday, Nagar reported 347 new Covid-19 cases. Currently, it has the third highest number of active cases after Pune and Mumbai. The increase in the number of cases in the neighbouring district implies an additional burden on health infrastructure facilities in Pune.During a Covid-19 review meeting on Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the increase in number of Covid-19 cases in Ahmednagar means additional pressure on tertiary care hospitals in Pune. “At least 40% of the patients admitted at B J Medical college hail from Ahmednagar.”According to Ahmednagar civil surgeon Dr Sunil Pokharna however, the current situation is much better than what it was a few days ago. “A few weeks ago, Ahmednagar was reporting more than 600 new Covid-19 cases but now as per the state health department, the numbers have come down to less than 400 new cases daily. We have found that this can be attributed to inappropriate Covid-19 behaviour by people who refuse to wear masks or follow sanitation rules or even social distancing. They hide their medical history or even when they test positive for Covid-19. What we see as of now is the thick tail of the second wave which has not yet receded completely in Ahmednagar district,” Dr Pokharna said.Rajendra Bhosale, district collector of Ahmednagar, said, “The recent surge in absolute numbers could also be because of the increased number of tests we have conducted. We have carried out up to 15,000 tests daily which led to reporting of more cases. Increased interaction among people during festivities could have also resulted in the rise in numbers.” As per Bhosale’s latest order, about 61 villages in the district have been declared as containment zones to avoid any further surge in numbers. Dr Pokharna said, “We have strict instructions from the district collector to ensure that there is no spurt in numbers and also to bring current numbers down from three to two digits. Hence, these measures have been taken. However, the situation is much better than what it was earlier.” Dr Pokharna further said that to increase their tertiary care strength, the hospital is now converting non-intensive care unit (ICU) beds into ICU beds.As of Tuesday, Ahmednagar has 4,280 active cases, which is the third highest with Pune and Mumbai reporting the highest and second-highest number of cases at 8,593 and 6,161, respectively. One of the reasons for the drop in number of new cases in Pune and most other cities has been the increased rate of vaccination. As per state figures, Ahmednagar has an estimated 3,321,684 population above 18 years of age. A total 2,114,176 beneficiaries (63.64%) have got their first dose while 734,875 beneficiaries (22%) have got their second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ahmednagars-covid-surge-adding-to-pune-s-health-infra-burden-101633466656630.html

Presently, 154 mills have paid 100% FRP to farmers. Nearly 190 sugar factories, both cooperative and private, are expected to participate in the upcoming season.Shekhar Gaikwad, sugar commissioner, said, “In just a week, FRP worth ₹125 crore has been paid by 23 sugar mills to farmers. Payment of FRP worth ₹100 crore is still pending but I am sure that it will be completed in the next 10 days. Now, 99.09% FRP has been paid in Maharashtra. Sugarcane crushing licenses will not be issued to sugar mills without full payment of FRP.”Earlier, the sugar commissionerate had colour-coded sugar mills based on their payment history. The step was taken to provide a ready guide for sugarcane farmers to decide where to sell their sugarcane. “This list has reached more than 30 lakh farmers in the state. There are four mills which have paid below 60% FRP; eight which have paid 60 to 80% FRP; and 24 mills which have paid 81 to 99% FRP.”Till September 30, the sugar mills in Maharashtra have paid ₹31,243 crore in FRP to sugarcane farmers with payment of ₹100 crore of FRP still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/23-sugar-mills-cough-up-125-crore-in-frp-ahead-of-crushing-season-101633466415536.html
06-10-2021||Pune||Vax 1% of eligible population daily in Oct, state tells civic bodies||PUNE Even as September saw the highest percentage of Covid-19 vaccinations, the state now aims to keep up the pace in October. In September, on average, 750,000 people were vaccinated daily in the state. Now the health department aims vaccinate up to 900,000 people per day. The state has instructed that at least 1% of the eligible population of Pune district must be vaccinated daily.Pune has an estimated eligible population of about 3.93 million and so the administration would have to vaccinate more than 30,000 people daily. The district has seen its highest vaccination drive on July 31, when more than 234,000 beneficiaries got the jab. This is now the highest single-day vaccination number for any district in the state. In September, along with Pune, many districts in the state saw a smooth supply of vaccines and so the issue of shortages has been resolved. However, a shortage of syringes is the new problem for the administrationThe state administration has instructed the district administration to further increase the vaccination drive in October given the upcoming festivities. Dr Pradip Vyas, principal secretary, Public Health Department, Maharashtra, in a letter dated October 4, said, “At present we have less than 36,000 active Covid cases in the State. This number is similar to the second week of February 2021, when the second Covid wave in our state started and ultimately peaked in the the last week of April, 2021. There is real apprehension that with the opening of the economy, increased activity, opening of schools/colleges and ensuing festive season, the number of Covid cases may increase by November 2021, if we are not very careful.”The letter further states: ‘In this situation, it is important to further increase the pace of Covid vaccination in our state. We have vaccinated at an average rate of about 7.5 lakh doses per day in September, 2021. With increased availability of Covid vaccines we can easily achieve an average vaccination rate of up to 10 lakh doses per day in October, 2021. We must try to administer Covid vaccination doses equivalent to at least 1% of the eligible population of your district every day. So if the eligible population of the district is say 50 lakh, then 50,000 doses per day. These are minimum desirable levels and can be further scaled”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vax-1-of-eligible-population-daily-in-oct-state-tells-civic-bodies-101633466356200.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly elections: Gabria to be SAD candidate from Ludhiana South||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will again be fielding former cabinet minister Hira Singh Gabria from Ludhiana South constituency during the 2022 Punjab assembly elections.The 74-year-old veteran leader had lost two assembly elections in 2012 and 2017 respectively, the first against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjit Bains from Atam Nagar constituency and thereafter against Bains’ elder brother Balwinder Singh Bains from Ludhiana South constituency.SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, during his previous visit to the city, had announced candidates from nine constituencies of Ludhiana district, but left the South constituency hanging.Former mayor Hakam Singh Giaspura’s son Jaspal Singh Giaspura and Youth Akali Dal (YAD) district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha were also in the race, but it was Gabria who finally clinched the ticket. Before offering the seat to Gabria, SAD pacified the disgruntled elements and appointed two-time councillor Jaspal Giaspura as the leader of opposition in the municipal corporation (MC) general hHouse.Gabria, who had once acted as a patron for Bains brothers and paved way for their induction in SAD, is now considered to be their biggest political opponent. He has been among those who have been aggressively attacking Simarjit Bains over the rape charges against the latter.Earlier, the party was planning to field Gabria’s son Rakhwinder Singh from the South constituency, but the decision was changed after inputs from workers in the area, said sources. Gabria is believed to enjoy a considerable hold on the Dalit and Ramgarhia population living in the area.When contacted, Gabria said SAD has the best chance of winning the election. “People are fed-up of Congress and the ongoing circus in the party. People of both South and Atam Nagar constituencies have realised that Balwinder Bains and his brother Simarjit Bains have amassed a lot of wealth but done nothing for people of the area. People are pinning their hopes on SAD to usher in an era of progress and development. I am thankful to the party for offering me a ticket so that I can serve the people here,” said Gabria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-elections-gabria-to-be-sad-candidate-from-ludhiana-south-101633465818864.html

Schools are ranked on the basis of the results of this test.The department recently sent NAS practice books to government schools across Ludhiana even as students are awaiting the NCERT textbooks. As per information, Class-10 students in Ludhiana have not received textbooks of English literature, Punjabi (Vangi), drawing, painting and SST..Students of Class-7 are yet to get the English grammar and geometrical drawing books. In Class-8, students are waiting for the textbooks of Hindi, English grammar and Science while in Class-9, students haven’t received the books of Maths and English grammar.The issue had also been raised by parents during the parent-teacher meeting on September 29 and September 30. Sunita Kumari, the mother of a Class-9 student of a government school in the district, said, “I was asked to buy the mathematics book from a private book shop by the subject teacher of my child. The teacher told me that since my child previously studied in a private school, we (parents) can at least afford his books. When I objected to this, she told me that the books will be available soon.”Meanwhile, the principal of a government senior secondary school said that the department had extended the deadline for new admissions till September 30, and those who recently got enrolled are the ones without books. “Most of the students have all the textbooks. Only a few new admission kids are yet to get the complete set. They will get it soon,” said the principal.Meanwhile, PSEB chairperson Yograj Sharma claimed that over two crore books were printed and sent to schools this March and subsequently supplementary copies were also sent.“We completed our job in March itself but if students are yet to get the books, the district education officials are responsible. There is no shortage of books from our side. Still, I will check with the Ludhiana education officials and do the needful,” said Sharma.Meanwhile, deputy district education officer (DEO) Charanjit Singh said, “Schools should inform us on time about any issue related to books. It is our duty to provide books to the students, and parents should not be asked for the same. We will send a directive to all school heads to check the requirement so that we can make arrangements,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-month-before-pseb-exam-class-10-students-in-ludhiana-still-await-textbooks-101633465516164.html

Expressing shock over no concrete action being initiated against those responsible for the brutal murders, the committee demanded a judicial probe into the incident and inflammatory speeches by Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra. It also condemned the Uttar Pradesh government for stopping the party delegation, led by Prem Singh Chandumajra, from proceeding towards Lakhimpur Kheri. AAP govt interfering in Sikh matters The core committee took strong notice of the interference by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi in the internal affairs of the Sikh community. “AAP government is preventing the constitution of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) on one or the other ground, despite the fact that the SAD won the election with clear majority,” said the party spokesperson. “It was shocking that how on flimsy grounds the co-option of Manjinder Singh Sirsa as an SGPC nominee in the DSGMC was stopped,” said Sukhbir, adding that Sirsa’s nomination claim was genuine and it was also certified that he was well-conversant with Punjabi language, but it was made an excuse to reject his nomination. Ex-Milkfed chairman joins SADFormer Milkfed chairman and Congress leader Capt Harminder Singh joined the SAD on Tuesday. Inducting him into the party, Sukhbir also announced him as the party candidate from the Sultanpur Lodhi seat in 2022 Assembly polls. Before joining the SAD, Capt Singh remained with the Congress party for at least 20 years and was president of the rural unit of Jalandhar district. Addressing the media, Sukhbir said Capt Singh had emerged as the consensus candidate of the party from Sultanpur Lodhi. Hailing the work done by former finance minister Upinderjit Kaur, who represented the party from Sultanpur Lodhi in the 2017 elections, Sukhbir said the veteran leader had informed him six months back that she will not be contesting the 2022 elections. Therefore, the party had decided to field Capt Singh from the constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/act-swiftly-against-farmers-killing-in-up-sad-core-committee-to-centre-101633464082294.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to put a cap on per acre yield of paddy||The Punjab food and civil supplies department is working on putting a cap of 34 quintals on the paddy yield per acre of crop.This is mandatory under central norms that call for integrating land records with grain procurement, to be implemented for the first time in the state. Introducing changes in the procurement system, Centre’s food and public distribution ministry has asked the state to ascertain how much paddy per acre is expected to be purchased by state agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI).This would help rein in the illegal practice of pilferage and sale of recycled rice, transported from other states at a cheaper price and mixed with freshly procured paddy for bigger profits.Fixing of per acre yield will also come as an end to the Centre’s open-ended procurement policy, under which the government buys every grain of wheat and rice brought by farmers, far more than the annual requirement, leading to heavy storage costs and subsidy burden.Average limit to be determinedA district-wise report, sought by the state government from the agriculture department, had found a state-wide cap on the yield unfeasible, as there are variations across districts. So, the plan now is to determine an average figure.This year, paddy has been sown over 72.5 lakh acres. Of this 12 lakh acres are occupied by basmati.For procurement, the agriculture department had pegged the total paddy arrival at 190 lakh tonnes, for which a Cash Credit Limit (CCL) of ₹35,700 crore has been received from the Reserve Bank of India. “No concrete decision on the limit for yield has been reached yet. We are working on a consensus for a cap of 34 quintals per acre. This will satisfy the farmers and also follow the rule book,” said an official of the state food department, not willing to be named. But RS Cheema, representing a section arhtiyas as president of the association, said, “Even in the beginning of the procurement process, the purchase agencies are not buying more than 25 quintals. Where will farmers sell the remaining stock?”Contradicting Cheema, an officer of the Punjab Mandi Board, the agency that regulates food grain purchase in state’s 3,000 mandis, said, “The initial arrivals are of the early varieties, which give an average per acre yield of 22 to 25 quintals. After October 10, we are expecting the late varieties with yield of around 35 to 40 quintals,” he said, requesting anonymity, adding that the issue will be addressed then.Land records being linked to database Meanwhile, the state government has completed the process to integrate land record with grain procurement, for 10.5 lakh farmers. Centre had made it compulsory for Punjab to carry out procurement only after taking land details from farmers, who will get the payment (MSP) for their produce (wheat and paddy) only when the revenue record of their agriculture land is linked with the Public Finance Management System (PFMS).In rabi (wheat) procurement season this year, the state had started the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system through PFMS, by transferring crop payment directly into farmers’ bank accounts, bypassing the traditional system of routing payment through the arhtiyas (commission agents).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-put-a-cap-on-per-acre-yield-of-paddy-101633464079686.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab chief minister meets Amit Shah, condemns violence in Lakhimpur Kheri||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday took up with Union home minister Amit Shah the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed during a protest on Sunday. Channi, who called on Shah at the latter’s residence in Delhi in the evening, conveyed his deep anguish over the tragic incident and the manner in which Congress leaders going to meet the victims’ families were stopped or arrested. “Met Home Minister @AmitShah & told him that the system of arresting our leaders should stop & the barbaric killings in UP (Lakhimpur Kheri) will not be tolerated,” the chief minister tweeted. He also sought the Union home minister’s personal intervention to resolve the farmers’ imbroglio, requesting him to repeal the farm laws that have led to protests. This was Channi’s first meeting with Shah after taking over the reins of the state on September 20 from Capt Amarinder Singh, who had to resign following a bitter tussle with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and some other detractors. The new CM also drew the home minister’s attention towards the illegal trafficking of drugs and weapons from across the border into the state, urging him to seal the border. This initiative would help Punjab break the supply chain of drugs, he added. He also raised the demand for reopening of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, urging the home minister to take an early decision in this regard to enable devotees to pay obeisance at the sacred place. Shah assured the chief minister that they will soon take a decision to open the corridor after detailed deliberations, according to an official release. Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Singh Nagra travelled with the chief minister to Delhi. Equates violence to Jallianwala Bagh tragedy Before leaving for Delhi to meet Shah, Channi, along with some ministers and legislators, staged a protest at Gandhi Smarak Bhawan in Chandigarh, where he said the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri reminded him of the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy. Alleging that the killing of the farmers was intentional, the chief minister asked the BJP to respect the democratic ethics and values, rather than perpetrating the rule of “danda raj (coercion)” to stifle people’s voice. “It should not force the country’s youth to draw inspiration from martyrs like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and Udham Singh for restoring democracy in the country,” he said. He also slammed the UP government for arresting Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who wanted to meet the victims’ ‘families at Lakhimpur Kheri. Cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Rana Gurjit Singh, Pargat Singh, Sangat Singh Gilzian and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa were among those present. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu was absent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-chief-minister-meets-amit-shah-condemns-violence-in-lakhimpur-kheri-101633464078443.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Blockade at Delhi borders: Supreme Court notice to 43 farm unions||The Supreme Court has issued notice to 43 farmer unions on an interim application filed by the Haryana government seeking their impleadment in a case pertaining to unblocking of inter-state and national highways. The farmers’ unions, sought to be made a party to the case, are steering the protest over the enactment of three central agri-marketing laws and squatting at the doorstep of the national capital. The matter has been listed for October 20. The apex court while hearing a petition, which sought unblocking of the highways leading to the national capital, had on August 23 said the central, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments must co-ordinate to ensure that the inter-state roads and national highways do not remain blocked due to farmers’ protest. However, when the protesting farmers did not turn up for talks on September 19, the state government moved an application to make them respondents in the case. As per an application filed by the state government, the state president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Punjab, Darshan Pal; president Bhartiya Kisan Union, Rakesh Tikait; national president of Swarai Abhiyan, Yogendra Yadav; president of Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta, Ugrahan, Joginder Singh; Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch’s Kavitha Kuruganti, president, Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Committee’s Satnam Singh were among the 43 entities sought to be made respondents in the case. The state government in its application before the apex court said the dharna on Singhu and Tikri borders had been organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which was a body of number of kisan unions. The application said to resume free flow of traffic on these roads for the convenience of general public, a state-level committee called a meeting on September 19 and asked the farmer leaders to join the meeting. Unfortunately, the farmers did not come forward for discussion. “A plea for impleading the farmer leaders as respondents was made and the SC permitted the state government to move an appropriate application for impleadment, and accordingly the present application is being filed,” the application said, adding that to resolve the issue and in view of the facts narrated, it is necessary that the parties as mentioned may kindly be impleaded. The apex court, on a petition filed by a Noida-based woman, Monicca Agarwaal, had said the solution lied n the hands of central and the state governments concerned. The bench said they must coordinate to ensure that if the protests were on, at least the inter-state roads and national highways were not blocked in any manner whatsoever, so that to and fro on those roads does not cause great inconvenience to people using those roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/blockade-at-delhi-borders-supreme-court-notice-to-43-farm-unions-101633464076148.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||No specialist officer deployed to monitor mining operations in Punjab||The Punjab irrigation department’s mining wing has not deployed even a single specialist officer to supervise the mining operations in the state even as the states are bound to do so according to the provisions of the central law. Section 18 (J) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, directs states to deploy qualified geologists or mining engineers to supervise mining operations. However, the department has been relying on civil engineers, who lack expertise, skill and technicalities of mines and minerals, to oversee the mining operations in the state. The eight geologists the mining department has on its roll are deployed in ‘insignificant’ posts with executive engineers of the irrigation department’s drainage wing heading mining operations in all districts. They have been given charge of mining officers to supervise mining operations, said officials. Earlier, the mining operations were headed by general managers, who had expertise and skill in the commerce sector as the mining wing was functioning under the department of industries and commerce. But in July 2018, the state government had shifted the mining wing under the irrigation department. A mining wing official said, “Deployment of civil engineers for supervision of mining operations is like making doctors perform the work of lawyers. Besides, it is also in violation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act Act. “Only a geologist has the expertise on identification and exploration of mines and minerals. Only they know how to extract minerals without leaving any harmful impact on the environment. A civil engineer can only check adherence to mining rules and regulations,” he added. A geologist of the department said, “Apart from sand, other minerals also exist in Punjab and only we have expertise to explore them and make them a source of revenue for the state exchequer.” Sarvjit Singh, principal secretary, water resources department (mining wing), said, “The geologists are always there to help, advise and assist the civil engineers. We will look into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-specialist-officer-deployed-to-monitor-mining-operations-in-punjab-101633463656518.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||During Covid crises, over 14,000 industries closed down In Punjab||The Covid-19 pandemic proved catastrophic for the state industry as a total of 14,429 units shut down during this period, reveals the data shared by the All India Trade Forum (AITF). The data has been compiled from the annual revenue report of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). With electricity being the base raw material for industries, the data reveals that during the Covid pandemic, as many as 10,617 small power, 3,210 medium power and 422 large power units were closed in the state. “But the state government never turned up to give any relief to the industries. The load of small power connections decreased from 10,99,243 KVA to 10,55,227 KVA and that of medium industries from 20,29,163 KVA to 16,08,963 KVA and from 67,52,580 KVA to 58,74,316 KVA of large industrial units,” said Badish Jindal, president of theAITF. The data reveals that in 2012, the number of small power connections was 90,372, which is now 91,546. The number of medium connections was 26,361 and in 2021, it increased to merely 29,069. Similarly, in the large power consumers, the number of connections was 6,577, which increased to a meagre of 6,697 during the same period. The total number of regular industrial connections increased from 12,3310 to 12,7312 during the last eight years. Besides, there are 2,475 medium and 2,572 large seasonal units which consume negligible power. Thus, the number of regular industries merely increased to 4,002 whereas during the same period the number of residential connections increased to 1477113, reveals data. The number of commercial connections increased to 1,92,437 and number of agriculture connections increased to 2,31,975 in Punjab. Even the population growth in the state during the same period increased from 2,77,43,338 to 3,05,01,026. This shows that even after the growth in population of about 27.57 lakh, the number of industries increased merely to 4,002. On the other hand, neighbouring Haryana collected ₹5,618 crore GST in August 2021 whereas Punjab collected ₹1,414 crore in the same period. In 2011, the VAT collection was ₹12,200 crore in Punjab and ₹11,082 crore in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/during-covid-crises-over-14-000-industries-closed-down-in-punjab-101633463596064.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||GST revenue growth robust in Punjab, surpasses pre-Covid levels||In a sign of sustained improvement in business sentiment, Punjab has reported a robust growth in the goods and services tax (GST) collection in the first half of financial year 2021-22 with a hefty increase in revenue from the pre-Covid levels. The GST revenue, including state goods and services tax (SGST) and integrated goods and services tax (IGST) in the first six months (April to September) of the current fiscal stood at ₹7,851 crore, which is 67.55% more than in the corresponding period a year ago, and 54% higher than the mop-up in the pre-pandemic year of 2019-20, according to the indirect tax data compiled by the state taxation department. The state’s GST collection was ₹5,097 crore in the April-September period of 2019-20, but it dropped to ₹4,685 crore in the same period of 2020-21 after coronavirus broke out, bringing business activities to a halt and battering the economy. The jump in revenue in the current fiscal indicates a sustained recovery after strong economic rebound after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with pent-up demand driving sales across sectors. The taxation department expects the positive trend to continue in the second half of the current fiscal as well. Increased demand, anti-evasion measures Taxation commissioner Nilkanth S Avhad said the GST collection in the first six months of 2021-22 was indicative of growth in consumption and better enforcement and increased compliance. “Anti-evasion activities, including increased supervision, data analysis, plugging loopholes and on-road detention, have also contributed, but there is a lot more that needs to be done,” he said. The department officials have detained 3,000 vehicles and imposed penalty of ₹76 crore in the past six months for various violations. Despite the rebound, the GST revenue continues to be way below the protected revenue of ₹2,739 crore per month, putting it among the states with the highest revenue shortfall and dependent on compensation from the Centre for almost half of its indirect tax revenue. At the time of switching to the GST, the Centre had guaranteed 14% year-on-year growth over the 2015-16-base and the state was to be compensated for any shortfall. The indirect tax regime was implemented from July 1, 2017, and the compensation is scheduled to end on June 30, 2022, unless it is extended by the GST Council. The state posted a 25% year-on-year increase in the GST collection in September, taking it to ₹1,316 crore in September 2021 from ₹1,055 crore in the corresponding month of previous fiscal. Rising fuel prices swell VAT kitty The value-added tax (VAT) mop-up from petroleum products has also seen a 66% year-on-year surge in the April-September period, increasing to ₹4,024 crore this year from ₹2,426 crore in the corresponding months of 2020-21. The jump is primarily on account of rising fuel prices as 90% of VAT revenue in government kitty comes from diesel and petrol, and the remaining 10% is from aviation turbine fuel, and liquor. With fuel prices at unprecedented levels, ₹627.43 crore were collected from VAT in September 2021 as against ₹444.70 crore in the same month last year, showing a 41% increase. In September 2019, the VAT revenue was half of last month’s collection at ₹317 crore. At ₹2,907 crore, the excise collection has also reported an increase of 18% in first six months this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gst-revenue-growth-robust-in-punjab-surpasses-pre-covid-levels-101633463356233.html

Standing Committee chairman Hemant Rasane has written a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding the dues, especially with the PMC facing a fund crunch.Rasane said, “As 23 villages have been merged in the city, the civic body’s GST compensation increased, but state government has not handed it over.

The party will be officially launched in November following which it shall seek a symbol from the Election Commission of India, officials said.The former president of the Hill State People Democratic Party (HSPDP), one of the oldest regional parties in the state, said that he shared a common ideology, belief, and conviction with his team and hence the common desire to ensure an alternative option of true governance to the people if chosen to lead in 2023.“As concerned citizens of the state we cannot sit idle and turn a blind eye to the situation of the state,” Basaiawmoit told journalists at a press conference. He asserted, “We all have witnessed how the state has failed in every aspect with the present government, as the current political leaders of the state lack political will to bring changes in the state.”He said the VPP wants to first unite the people and together work towards reviving the state. He rued that even as the state will be celebrating its 50 years of statehood, yet it is lacking behind in all fronts shamefully. “The only solution is a new set of leaders with the conviction and dedication to serve the people and put them first always,” Basaiawmoit said.He said the failure of the present MDA dispensation to serve the people is the main reason to float the new party. “We have been talking of change but where is it? We need to see real change and this is what we want to achieve and we appeal to the people to come forward and join us in our mission.”The president also informed that an ad-hoc team has been constituted to take matters forward. It includes Dr Kara H Shen as vice president, Dr Ricky AJ Syngkon as general secretary, Dr Batskhem Myrboh as assistant general secretary cum spokesperson, Dr Peter Daniel S Khariong as finance secretary, Winston Tony Lyngdoh as organizing secretary and Rocky Marak as organizing secretary in-charge Garo Hills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-legislator-floats-new-political-party-in-meghalaya-101633460272447.html

06-10-2021||Noida||Traffic police launches special drive for cab verification in Gautam Budh Nagar||The traffic police in Gautam Budh Nagar has launched a drive for verification of cabs to check these vehicle-related incidents, officials said on Tuesday.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said there are instances when commuters are looted after taking a lift, or passengers who don’t make online bookings -- a valid process -- snatch away cabs from drivers.“There are 13,000 registered cabs in Gautam Budh Nagar. We have launched a verification drive for all the private cabs and taxis in the district. We will verify the registration paper of a cab, pollution certificate, insurance, and driver’s credentials,” Saha said, adding that verification of all the drivers is also important for the safety of the commuters.“People with criminal records or tainted pasts will not be allowed to drive cabs. We will make a database of these vehicles and the drivers, which will be used when needed,” he said.Such drivers will also be sensitised to only ferry people who book cabs following a valid process. “These drivers cannot offer lifts to unknown people without a valid booking process, like online bookings,” Saha said.After a cab ride is booked online -- through a mobile application -- it is easier to trace the suspect(s), police said. There are several cases where the suspects pretend to be commuters, and later snatch cabs from the drivers.Anurag Kulshrestha, president of TRAX -- an NGO working towards road safety -- said that the verification of cabs and drivers is a good move. “But most of these cabs have a national capital region (NCR) permit. This means a vehicle registered in Noida can ply in Delhi and Gurugram, and vice versa. Hence, only verifying cabs in Noida may not yield the desired results. The police department should sensitise all cab drivers and also install CCTV cameras at important roads or points for safety,” he said.On September 30, 2021, two suspects allegedly snatched a Volkswagen Vento from a driver -- Ram Dhiraj -- in Noida. Dhiraj, a resident of Sangam Vihar in New Delhi, said that he had come to Greater Noida Sector 36 to drop a passenger that morning. “I was returning to Delhi when the two suspects signalled me to stop the car for lift near Pari Chowk. The suspects asked me to drop them to Noida Sector 37. They snatched my car at gunpoint near Kalindi Kunj,” Dhiraj said. A case has been registered against the suspects at the Sector Beta 2 police station. The car has not been found yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-police-launches-special-drive-for-cab-verification-in-gautam-budhnagar-101633462157542.html

This is two degrees higher than normal, after temperatures remained consistently at normal or below normal in the last week of September, according to the India Meteorological Department’s automatic weather station in Santacruz. The night-time minimum temperature, too, remained 2 degrees above normal at 26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The city saw heavy thunder and lightning activity on Tuesday evening, between 7 pm and 8 pm, along with light to moderate rains in a few locations. IMD officials said that the withdrawal of the monsoon over Mumbai and the rest of the Konkan coast is unlikely before October 15, and also warned that the intensity of rains may also pick up briefly between October 10 and 11.As per the met department’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, daytime temperatures may rise to as much as 37 degrees by October 11 and nighttime temperatures are expected to remain between 26 and 27 degrees Celsius. In October 2020, the city had experienced a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius on the 10th, 28th and 29th of the month. The highest October temperature was recorded at 38.6 degrees Celsius in 2015.A meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai warned that the weather is likely to get muggier in the next few days. “The temperature will rise by at least a couple of degrees while the city remains under a cloud cover due to delayed monsoon withdrawal, so the heat will remain trapped closer to the ground and the relative humidity levels will go up. There are chances of moderate thundershowers on Wednesday, and a thunderstorm with more intense rain may occur between Thursday and Friday. There are no signs of monsoon withdrawing from Maharashtra yet as the withdrawal is expected to only start from the northeast October 6 onward,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-likely-to-witness-higher-temperatures-thunderstorms-this-week-101633462099675.html

The distance between the two Metro stations will be covered in 20 minutes by ropeway, the officials said.“With minor revision, the detailed project report of the project is almost final now. The project cost is now ₹450 crore. Once it is approved by the government, we will float a global tender for selecting an agency to execute the project. The agency will make an investment of about 60% of the cost. The rest of the cost will be shared by the Centre and UP agencies, including the authority,” said Krishna Karunesh, authority’s vice-chairperson.Ropeway is a transport system for ferrying goods or people especially used in mountainous areas or mines, wherein the carrier cars are suspended with the help of moving cables, powered by a motor system.The GDA has opted for the ropeway project in order to reduce the per kilometre construction cost which is higher in case of a metro connectivity.The DPR has proposed four stations for the ropeway at Mohan Nagar, Sahibabad, Vasundhara and Vaishali. At the two starting and ending points, it will be connected to the respective metro stations with the help of skywalks of 150 metres which will be constructed by the authority, the officials said, adding that the ropeway project will be based on 27 pillars, and will move over the Regional Rapid Transit System project alignment near Sahibabad.According to the DPR, a passenger will have to spend a minimum fare of ₹20 and maximum of ₹30 for travelling the entire distance. It is also estimated that the ropeway system will be used by 80,000 passengers in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-now-ropeway-project-to-link-metro-stations-pegged-at-450-crore-101633462097045.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers worried as rain delays paddy, cotton harvest in Malwa||Punjab’s cotton and paddy growers are left worried about the loss of quality of their ready-to-harvest produce after untimely rain lashed south Punjab on Monday evening.According to an official survey conducted by the field staff of the state agriculture department, Muktsar was the worst-hit district where about 10% damage to the paddy was assessed. Muktsar agriculture officer Gurpreet Singh said Malout, Lambi and Gidderbaha bore the maximum brunt of rains. Farmers of Bathinda and Mansa districts said they were already braving losses caused by pink bollworm attack and the inclement weather would hit them further. Picking of cotton is underway, whereas paddy harvesting in Malwa is yet to pick up. The wet conditions will now stall reaping till the weekend. According to the Punjab Agricultural University’s observatory at the Bathinda-based regional research centre, Bathinda recorded 70mm of rainfall on Monday evening. Strong winds were reported from Bathinda, Fazilka, Muktsar and adjoining places. Unsold raw cotton at several mandis of Muktsar, Bathinda and Fazilka was damaged due to sudden showers in the evening. Officials of the state agriculture department said rainfall at this juncture would affect the quality of cotton bolls and paddy grains. “Initial field inputs suggest lodging of cotton and paddy crops at several places across the state. Rains are undesirable for kharif crops as paddy and cotton are ready for harvest,” said Bathinda chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh. Cotton harvesting would be stalled for at least five days following rain in various parts of the Malwa region, said Manjit Singh, who also holds the dual charge of Mansa district. “Unfriendly weather conditions will also push paddy harvesting, which is yet to gain momentum, by four days. Farmers are being advised to delay harvest,” he said. Sharanjit Singh from Mann Khera village of Mansa district said inclement weather would be a double whammy for farmers. “Pink bollworm attack has done considerable damage to the crop. Late harvesting of cotton and paddy will further delay wheat sowing in the area. We are keeping our fingers crossed to tide over these challenging times,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-worried-as-rain-delays-paddy-cotton-harvest-in-malwa-101633461976508.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Key accused in Tarn Taran blast case dies||AmritsarThe main accused in the Tarn Taran blast case, where two persons were killed, died during treatment at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GNDH), Amritsar, Tuesday. The deceased, Malkit Singh, alias Sher Singh, of Kotla village in Amritsar was among nine persons against whom the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had filed a chargesheet in March last year. Malkit had not been keeping well since his arrest in October 2019. Two of the accused — Vikram Singh, alias Vicky, and Harpreet Singh, alias Happy — were killed on the spot when a powerful explosion took place at Pandori Gola village of the district in September 2019. However, their third accomplice, Gurjant Singh suffered an injury. Police investigation had found that all three accused were trying to retrieve ammunition, which was concealed underground, to unleash terror activity in the state. Malkit was arrested later after the investigation found that he along with his co-accused had concealed the ammunition underground. He had kept the ammunition in his possession for several days, besides testing them, the NIA investigation had said. During investigation, it was found that the accused were radicalising pro-Khalistan youths who had formed a terrorist group under absconding accused Bikramjit Singh Panjwar, alias Bikkar. The members of the group carried out secessionist activities on ground as well as on social media to instigate youth to agitate for the secession of Punjab. Malkit’s family members have alleged that he was ill-treated in jail and died due to the lack of proper care. However, the jail authorities have denied the charges. “Malkit was admitted to the GNDH. He was discharged from the hospital on October 2 with an instruction that he should be taken to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, on Tuesday. He remained in jail on October 2, but his health deteriorated on October 3. We shifted him again to the GNDH where he died during treatment,” said an assistant jail superintendent of Amritsar, who didn’t wish to be named. He said: “Barring a few days, Malkit remained in hospitals since his arrest. We left no stone unturned for his treatment.” Amritsar jail superintendent Parvinder Singh didn’t respond to repeated calls. In July 2020, Malkit’s family had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking a bail on medical grounds. The court had dismissed the plea. Earlier, the NIA court in Mohali had ordered the Amritsar jail authorities to get the accused treated from a specialised doctor at the GNDH, and in case the required treatment was not available there, he should be treated from the PGIMER, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/key-accused-in-tarn-taran-blast-case-dies-101633461798063.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers block highways over slow, conditional procurement||Upset over poor and conditional procurement of paddy in the grain mandis in Haryana, farmers blocked highways.In Kurukshetra, farmers blocked the Delhi-Chandigarh NH-44 causing traffic jam for several kilometres on one of country’s busiest highways. The farmers lifted the blockade from NH-44 following an assurance from the government to speed up procurement operations from October 6. Thousands of commuters remained stranded for several hours as the blockade lasted for more than six hours.The protesters of Kaithal district blocked the Hisar-Chandigarh highway at the Pehowa Chowk. They lifted the blockade by the evening. Local gurdwaras were serving langar to the commuters stranded due to traffic snarls.Following the farmers blocking the highways for hours, the Kurukshetra police issued an advisory for the commuters travelling on NH-44 and NH-152 Ambala-Hisar highway.The commuters of NH-44 were advised to travel on diverted routes from Shahbad-Ladwa-Indri to Karnal and people travelling on the link road NH-152 were advised to travel via Thol-Jhansa and Malikpur link road.Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said the matter has been taken up at the headquarters level and the issue will be resolved soon.The protesters alleged that the government agencies are not procuring the produce and most of the paddy is lying in the mandis unprocured for the past couple of days despite the government claiming that procurement was started in all mandis in Haryana from October 3.Ramesh Kumar, of Kaithal district, alleged that he is waiting for buyers of his produce since September 30 and nobody has come to buy his paddy yield.Haryana BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains said the government agencies are not procuring the paddy lying in the mandis for the past several days on pretext of high moisture content.Bains said the government has imposed a limit to procure 25 quintal per acre whereas the average per acre yield of Parmal varieties remains around 35 quintal. He said the protest will continue until the government makes changes in the procurement norms.BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni has threatened to intensify the agitation again and asked his supporters and farmers to again gherao the houses of BJP-JJP MLAs and MPs on October 6 if the paddy lying in mandis is not procured.As per officials associated with procurement agencies, rice millers have not joined the procurement process yet as they are opposing the new norm of depositing 5% of the total value of paddy to be provided to them for milling under the custom-milled rice policy.“As the government and rice millers have not reached any consensus yet, lifting of paddy could not be started in mandis,” said a mandi official, pleading anonymity.Additional chief secretary to Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, Anurag Rastogi said procurement of paddy in mandis of Haryana was started from October 3 and gate passes for procurement of about 3.60 lakh tonne paddy were generated on e-Kharid portal of Haryana.However, the ACS did not provide the figures of total paddy arriving in mandis and lying unprocured but said the situation will be normalised in the next couple of days.BOXWhat farmers wantPaddy lying in mandis before beginning of procurement should be procured firstPaddy with higher moisture content of permissible limits of 17% should be procured with deduction in MSPPer acre limit of procurement should be increased from 25 quintal to 30 quintalProcured paddy lying in mandis should be lifted immediately to make space to accommodate more paddy in mandis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-farmers-block-highways-over-slow-conditional-procurement-101633461556578.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Former Chandigarh MPs’ sons make their presence felt in city politics||As the municipal corporation election campaign heats up, sons of two former Lok Sabha members from Chandigarh are making their presence felt, which many political analysts say is indicative of a coming generational change in the city’s politics.In the Aam Admi Party (AAP), former MP Harmohan Dhawan’s son Bikram Dhawan has taken over as the vice-president of the local unit. Meanwhile, in the Congress, former MP Pawan Kumar Bansal’s son Manish Bansal is actively taking part in the party affairs and even presides over campaign meetings.Both had played a prominent role in the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaigns of their fathers as well. Manish, in fact, had been managing the former MP’s elections from behind the scenes. “I have been working for the party in all elections. Generally, I am busy with my business. But during elections, we all Congressmen must work for the party’s success,” said Manish.Bikram too claimed that he has been dedicatedly working for the party since the last Lok Sabha elections, and has “actively worked in the election campaigns of my father”. However, the increased presence of these two has been met with opposition within their parties. In the Congress, former city unit chief Pardeep Chhabra’s move to join the AAP was attributed to his differences with the party leadership on Manish’s role in the party affairs.In the AAP, though no differences have come out in the open yet, many insiders are questioning the move to give official position to Bikram while long-term party workers were left out in the recent rejig.‘No dynastic politics at play’ Both the parties have categorically brushed any dynastic politics in the rise of these two sons.Downplaying Manish’s presence in the party’s meetings and campaigning, Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said: “He doesn’t hold any party position. He mostly attends party and public meetings as a cover for Pawan Bansal, when he is not in the city.” Manish said: “I don’t hold any post in the party. I am working like any other ordinary Congressman for the party’s victory in the MC elections. I don’t know why people are reading too much into it.” Bikram himself admits that questions have been raised within the party and outside over his appointment. “Many have connected my appointment with my father’s return to active politics. Also, it is seen as continuation of dynastic politics. But nothing could be further from the truth. I don’t have any political ambitions. I am here only for the party’s win in MC elections,” he said.Chhabra, who is now the Chandigarh AAP co-incharge, said: “Neither Harmohan nor Bikram wanted any position for him (Bikram). He is here to support the party and his father.”Meanwhile, taking a dig at both opposition parties, Bharatiya Janata Party state president Arun Sood said: “In our party, too, families do work for the organisation’s cause, but they are not promoted just because they are sons or daughters of senior leaders. Take the city’s example; neither mine, nor Sanjay Tandon’s nor Satya Pal Jain’s family members are being promoted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-chandigarh-mps-sons-make-their-presence-felt-in-city-politics-101633461499828.html

06-10-2021||Noida||Action plan to check pollution in Ghaziabad readied, 10 hotspots identified||The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has chalked out an action plan for Ghaziabad to combat air pollution in the upcoming winter season and also identified 10 major hotspots affecting the air quality of the city. Officials said 18 departments have been tasked to undertake certain steps to reduce air pollution. According to government data, Ghaziabad is listed among 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh with high levels of air pollution. Cities are declared non-attainment if, over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM10 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide). “In our action plan for the upcoming winter season, the district administration has roped in 18 departments and given them specific roles, which are to be completed in a time-bound manner. These roles include sprinkling water on roads, central verges, formation of quick response teams to tackle instances of garbage and crop residue burning, checking environment norms related to construction works, night patrolling, using smog guns and dust suppressants, etc,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The district magistrate has directed the departments to complete the tasks by October. The UPPCB has also identified 10 major pollution hotspots across the city and zeroed in on the pollution generating sources in each of them. The 10 hotspots are Sahibabad, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar Extension, Delhi Meerut Road, Loni, Bhopra-Delhi border, South Side GT Road, Sanjay Nagar, Vasundhara, and Siddharth Vihar“The 10 hotspots are the ones where infrastructure projects are being undertaken or are affected by high volume of traffic, road dust, industrial activities, burning of waste, dumping of construction and debris, among other issues. In 2020-21, the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations reduced in the city. We will be closely monitoring the situation this year too,” said Sharma. According to statistics of the pollution board, in 2019-2020, Ghaziabad recorded an annual average PM10 concentration of 218 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm), while it reduced by 14.5% in 2020-21. Likewise, the PM2.5 concentrations stood at an average of 53.04mpcm between April and September this year, compared to 64.20 mpcm during the same period last year. The standard limit for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100mpcm and 60mpcm, respectively. Residents and environmentalists said that the city has been battling high levels of air pollution over the last few years, which are compounded by factors such as crop residue burning in neighbouring states. “The action plan is a short-term measure. It must be enforced in totality and if possible, be formulated under the guidance of environmental experts. In the long term, it is advised that a detailed study of meteorological, demographic factors, constructions and green areas be taken up to understand why pollution is impacting the city so badly for the past 5-6 years now,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. The list of 10 hotspots also features Kaushambi township. Members of the Kaushambi Apartments Residents’ Welfare Association (Karwa) have petitioned the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and even moved the Supreme Court to resolve different pollution-related issues affecting the township.“They make plans every year, but results show that the city often reaches ‘severe’ air quality due to pollution in winter. We have been fighting a legal battle against the agencies since 2015 in the NGT and now, in the Supreme Court. Now, they (government agencies) have realised the seriousness of pollution-related issues and included Kaushambi in the list of hotspots,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/action-plan-to-check-pollution-in-ghaziabad-readied-10-hotspots-identified-101633461495895.html

It is alleged that Rekha Agnihotri along with other women exhorted the accused to kill the police personnel and it was alleged that she along with other women was heard saying that no one should be left. The ambush took place on July 3, 2020, when police went to arrest Vikas Dubey from his house in Bikru village of Kanpur Nagar. Vikas Dubey and his associates opened indiscriminate fire on the police force, which led to eight police personnel being shot dead and six others getting grievous gunshot injuries. Rejecting the bail application of Rekha Agnihotri, justice Samit Gopal observed, “The dare devil manner in which the incident took place leaves much to be said. The incident cannot be committed with just a handful of people. It was a pre-planned incident wherein all the aspects appeared to have been designed and persons were entrusted with their jobs which had been performed by them independently and even collectively. The bail application of co-accused Khushi, identically placed co-accused, has been rejected by a coordinate Bench of this court. In the present matter, the involvement of the applicant is there. Her participation is also there for which there are eyewitnesses also”.

Farmers said unseasonal rains would not only affect the yield but will also increase the harvesting cost.“Rains have flattened not just the matured crop but also the lateral Basmati varieties that were in the milking stage and will have an impact on the yield,” said Dharambir, of Nilokheri in Karnal.Moreover, rains have also affected harvesting and procurement operations badly as thousands of quintals of unprocured paddy lying in the open in mandis got drenched.As per reports, Karnal city reported 45mm rainfall and Kurukshetra’s Shahabd and Pehwa received 14 and 12mm rain on Monday night.According to farmers, the moisture content in paddy lying in grain markets has increased due to rains and farmers alleged that there were no arrangements of sheds and most paddy is lying in the open and uprocured.“The government agencies did not come to buy my paddy of two acre yet but last night’s rain has increased the moisture content again and now I have to wait for two-three days again,” said farmer Ram Pal, waiting for buyers of his 60 quintal paddy in a grain market in Kurukshetra district.Officials of the state agriculture department said rains are harmful for paddy at this stage as it will affect harvesting as well as procurement.“Rain and wind have flattened the crops and will increase the harvesting cost as most crop is ready to harvest but now the farmers will have to wait for a few more days to start harvesting,” said Aditya Dabas, deputy director of Haryana agriculture department in Karnal.He advised the farmers to avoid harvesting in the next 2-3 days as rains have increased the moisture content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-adds-to-haryana-farmers-woes-101633461381191.html

The CBI had filed an application before the Prayagraj court seeking further custodial remand of 14 days of the three accused. CJM Harendra Nath granted extension of the accused persons’ custody. After getting the remand extension, the agency is now focusing on scientific investigations and recovery of evidence from various places which the three accused can point out in Prayagraj and Haridwar, besides quizzing those persons whose names have surfaced in the investigations so far. “The CBI is now laying stress on scientific investigations of the case and recovery of clues from Anand Giri’s mobile and laptop, besides connecting the dots to collaborate sequence of events for unearthing clues,” said an official privy to the investigation.According to investigating official, during the seven days remand, Swami Anand Giri claimed innocence when questioned by the CBI officials. Anand Giri ruled out suicide angle as cause of the death of his guru and instead claimed that he was murdered. He also named some persons who might be involved in the foul play and revealed names of those individuals who have already been quizzed by CBI officials while some are yet to be grilled. During this period, the CBI also took Anand Giri to Haridwar and recovered his laptop and mobile. However, CBI officials failed to find any morphed photograph or video as mentioned in the purported suicide note found in the room where Mahant Narendra Giri’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan in the evening on September 20. Now, CBI may carry out narco analysis test of Anand Giri and some other persons to smoke out truth and get clues to crack the mysterious death of Mahant Narendra Giri. However, for the test, the CBI will require consent from the accused, officials shared. CBI officials have so far questioned around 30 people, whose names surfaced during probe, questioning of the accused and call details found from the mobiles of Mahant Narendra Giri and Anand Giri. CBI has collected scientific evidences from Baghambari Gaddi Math, Bade Hanuman temple and other possible places on the basis of which the investigations will be carried forward. Meanwhile, Anand Giri’s advocate Vijay Kumar Dwivedi said that Anand Giri had full faith in CBI investigations and judiciary. CBI probe will soon clear the mystery behind Mahant’s death.

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ranjit Singh murder case: HC dismisses plea for transfer of trial; says allegations imaginary||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday dismissed a plea seeking transfer of trial in Ranjit Singh murder case terming the allegations imaginary and based on surmises and conjectures.With this, trial court can now pronounce judgment, stayed two days ahead of final order on August 24 by the HC, in the case involving Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim.“The petitioner (Ranjit’s son), in the garb of transfer petition, cannot be permitted to have bench of his choice or to get result of trial as per his wishes. With advancement of technology and activism on social media, the allegation levelled by such litigants needs to be scrutinised carefully. On asking of apprehensive litigant, transfer of trial at fag end would result in browbeating the judge and interference in fair administration of justice,” the bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan said in the 20-page judgment.The plea filed in August by Jagseer Singh had sought directions for transfer of the case to any other court in the region.The son had questioned adjournments granted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court a number of times since joining of the special judge and also levelled allegations against CBI public prosecutor KP Singh for “interfering” in the “administration of justice” and “influencing” the proceedings. The HC bench observed that on mere apprehension trial cannot be transferred and that apprehension must be reasonable and not imaginary. The power of transfer is to be sparingly exercised. There cannot be a straight jacketed formula for transfer of trial, it said, adding that the petitioner watched and participated in trial before special judge since April 2021, when he was transferred and has now approached the HC when the matter is reserved for final order. Referring to the complaint made against the judge in some other case, the bench said no adverse inference can be drawn against the special judge as the affected party in that case was Enforcement Directorate, which has not raised any question. Moreover, the bail in question was granted by his predecessor and he only confirmed that order. As of the allegations of judges’ proximity with public prosecutor, the bench said allegations are on “hear-say”. The bench also took note of CBI terming the transfer of public prosecutor when judge too was transferred to Panchkula as “routine administrative decision” and petitioner not levelling allegations against CBI but against the public prosecutor. The court also said the presence of public prosecutor in the court during trial is duly explained since he is a regular public prosecutor in CBI court at Panchkula and senior public prosecutor and a special public prosecutor have been specifically appointed to represent CBI in this case only. The court also did not find any substance in the allegations that the CCTV footage of a particular date have intentionally not been sent. As of allegations of the special judge showing undue hurry to conclude the trial, the court said there was no substance in the allegations as enough time was given to CBI counsels to present their side. The special judge, in his report, had termed the plea as a “case of interference in the judicial process”, to which the petitioner’s lawyer had objected to. “If the trial is transferred on the basis that filing of comments by the special Judge would affect the outcome of the trial, the trial of such pressure would not only end with the transfer but will proceed to the next judge also. Moreover, a judge is aware of the powers bestowed and how to conduct fair trial,” the bench observed rejecting the contention of the petitioner. Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra. As per the CBI, he was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter highlighting sexual exploitation of female disciples on the Dera premises. The dera head is lodged in Rohtak’s Sunaria jail serving life term. There are mainly three cases of the period 2002-03 registered against the Sirsa-based dera chief. In two cases, one related to sexual exploitation of female disciples and second of murder of a journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, Ram Rahim has been convicted. The third case is of Ranjit Singh’s murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ranjit-singh-murder-case-hc-dismisses-plea-for-transfer-of-trial-says-allegations-imaginary-101633460898192.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi committed to reforms in road infrastructure, says Sisodia||The Delhi government is known for its reforms in the education and health sector, but it is equally committed to the infrastructure improvement, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday at a global workshop .The workshop, being organised by Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, state government’s think tank, in partnership with WRI India, is an attempt by the Delhi government to learn from global examples such as Seoul, Singapore and New York as it begins work on redesigning 540km of road network in the capital. The city government will look at how these cities transformed streets in a short span, and mitigated challenges such as building consensus to reduce space for cars on roads.Singapore’s 45-minute city master plan; London’s ambitious streetscape plan to develop temporary cycle lanes and low traffic neighbourhood and Seoul’s bold move to demolish flyovers or turn them into dedicated cycling corridors were some of the ideas discussed by experts at the workshop.Apart from international cities, experts from Indian cities also shared details about street redesign projects executed in Bengaluru and Mumbai.“The government is currently identified with its social reforms in education and health sector, and it is committed to focus on infrastructural reforms and road redesigning with similar vigour,” Sisodia said.The Delhi government’s road redesign project, PWD minister Satyendar Jain said, is aimed at developing streets in Delhi at par with international standards.One of the key challenges before any government agency executing such a project is building public consensus to shrink car space to provide pedestrian pathways and cycling tracks. Sisodia asked experts about how these global cities went about addressing this issue.Shashi Verma, director of strategy and chief technology officer at Transport for London (TfL), said, that large scale public consultation is essential and governments have to play a proactive role in giving voice to public transport users, who are in substantial numbers.Alex Williams, director of city planning at TfL, said London has focused on increasing the use of bicycles and buses. He said effort have been made to make buses more reliable and consistent with 24-hour operations, which has reduced the traffic congestions due to private motor vehicles and made roads safer for cyclists and pedestrians.Experts from New York, Singapore, Bogota, Seoul said large scale public consultation has been an important factor in their transformation journey.Sharing that Seoul places public transport and pedestrian mobility as top priority areas in its transport policy, GyengChul KIM, CEO DMROC, said that political will and support from the leadership are significant to redesign and implement such a transformative program. He said flyovers have been demolished in Seoul to provide pedestrian friendly infrastructure.Experts said that a good integrated public transport system is essential for the success of road redesign projects.Ong Eu-Gene, Director at Land Transport Authority, Singapore, shared the island city-state’s decision to be a “car-lite” nation and how it implemented the road repurposing project. He also spoke about the land transport master plan-2040, which was prepared in 2019, that focuses on making Singapore a 45-minute city. He said “Rail network is the backbone of the nation’s public transport system to enable the 45-minute city.”Jasmine Shah, vice-chairman of DDC Delhi, said most of these cities have managed to transform their streets in a short span of 15-20 years. “All of them cited political leadership as critical to making the transformation happen. Under the leadership of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government is determined to building world-class streets in the national capital.”While experts spoke on the need for traffic calming measures, upgradation of street infrastructure, dedicated pedestrian pathways and cycling corridors, Michael Replogle, former deputy commissioner of policy, New York City Department of Transportation, stressed on the need to integrate data driven processes in redesigning roads, recording progress and revising yearly priorities.Sharing the example of New York’s Speed Camera Program, he said most vehicles that received penalty for one traffic violation, did not receive another within a calendar year in areas where the program was implemented. He said speed limit restrict and strong enforcement and data driven technology has played a significant role bringing down road fatalities.Dario Hidalgo, senior transportation consultant in Bogota, said that Delhi could learn from Bogota’s initiatives, as the two cities have similar population density.In India, too, cities have started work on transforming streets. Jana Urban Space (Jana USP), a sister concern of Janaagraha, present the work done by them with help from government agencies in redesigning 229kms of road infrastructure in Bengaluru and three other cities.During the conference, Jana Urban Space presented the TENDER SURE project being currently implemented to redesign 50km of roads in Bengaluru in collaboration with BBMP. Officials from Mumbai also participated in the programme and shared details of their experiences in setting up the Mumbai Street Lab to implement design interventions in road redevelopment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-committed-to-reforms-in-road-infrastructure-says-sisodia-101633460239132.html
06-10-2021||Noida||59 kids among 86 dengue patients in Gautam Budh Nagar||In Gautam Budh Nagar, children below 18 years comprise more than 60% of the total dengue cases, according to the latest data, officials said on Tuesday.Amid an increase in the infection, Gautam Budh Nagar reported 86 dengue cases till Tuesday (October 5), out of which, 59 are children -- all from Postgraduate Institute of Child Health in Noida -- between the age of five and 18 years.“The 59 infected children -- none critical -- have recovered following treatment. Out of the remaining 27 cases among adults, seven are still undergoing treatment,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Last week, officials identified two dengue hotspots in the district. “Localities in Barola and Chalera villages of Noida were identified as hotspots after 10 dengue cases were reported from there. Health teams have taken containment measures, and are making door-to-door visits to inspect larvae breeding sites and clear those at the earliest,” Sharma said.In the past one week, the district health department has also issued notices to 32 private premises with mosquito breeding sites, he added.“At present, there are five rapid response teams in the district -- one at the district level, and four at the block level -- which have been tasked to ensure that no mosquito breeding takes place. Since dengue mosquitoes usually bite during the day, all the office authorities in the district have been asked to stay vigilant and avoid collecting water in containers where these mosquitoes are likely to breed,” Sharma said, adding that the department is conducting fogging and anti-larvae medicine spraying drives in the district.“The health teams are screening densely populated localities to eliminate chances of mosquito breeding. Dengue is an urbanised disease, and these mosquitoes breed indoors -- in artificial or man-made containers. So, the teams are focusing on such areas. The teams are also going door-to-door to check on people suffering from fever, and are also taking their samples for dengue and malaria testing,” added Sharma.Meanwhile, there are no fresh cases of scrub typhus or leptospirosis in the district. The total tally of scrub typhus in Gautam Budh Nagar is four, after a private hospital in Noida had reported one fresh case last week. Two leptospirosis cases were also reported. “All three patients of scrub typhus (1) and leptospirosis (2), reported from private hospitals in the district, have recovered,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/59-kids-among-86-dengue-patients-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101633460237771.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||2 killed in separate cases over trivial matters in Delhi, suspects held||Two men were murdered in the city in two separate incidents between Saturday and Monday, allegedly over trivial issues, the police said on Tuesday, adding that the suspects in both cases have been arrested.In the first murder on Saturday night, reported from central Delhi’s Anand Parbat, a 19-year-old man was stabbed to death allegedly by a group of five persons, including two minor boys, over ₹300 that the man had borrowed from one of them and was not returning. In the second case, a 25-year-old rickshaw puller was stabbed to death with an ice pick allegedly by another rickshaw puller after their vehicles “grazed each other” in south Delhi’s Sarita Vihar on Monday night.This is the third case of murder over a trivial matter reported in the city since Saturday. On Sunday night, a 30-year-old woman, who ran a grocery shop in south-west Delhi’s Dabri, was stabbed to death allegedly by a plumber over the money he owed her for groceries. The woman was attacked on a busy lane in the market and the assault was captured by CCTV cameras, the footage of which was widely circulated on social media soon after. Locals overpowered the suspect and thrashed him before a police team reached there.The mob also attacked the police personnel, but they managed to rescue the 45-year-old plumber, who was later arrested for murder, police said.In the Anand Parbat case, deputy commissioner of police (central) Sweta Chauhan, said the deceased, Shailendra Kumar, had borrowed ₹300 from a man named Ravi a few days ago and was not returning it. The two exchanged heated words over phone and Ravi’s juvenile friend, who was previously involved in a crime, decided to teach Kumar a lesson. On Saturday afternoon, Kumar was with his friend Vinod Kumar in Gali No-11, when five persons, including Ravi and the juvenile, overpowered him and stabbed twice in his thigh. Kumar died of excessive bleeding. A murder case was registered and Ravi and his associate Vishal were arrested, while two juvenile accused were apprehended. The fifth suspect is on the run, the police said.The Sarita Vihar murder,police said, took place near the LIG flats on Monday around 8.30pm. Police said the 25-year-old rickshaw puller, identified by his first name as Arvind, was stabbed with an ice pick by rickshaw puller Awdhesh (single name), following an altercation over “their rickshaws allegedly grazing past each other”. Both lived in Sarita Vihar with their families and ferried passengers between Sarita Vihar colony and the nearby Metro station, police said.Police said Awdhesh allegedly stabbed Arvind with an ice pick before fleeing the spot. Arvind was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Awdhesh was arrested and booked for murder, said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey.In 2020, 472 murders (including 53 deaths in the Delhi riots) were reported in Delhi, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, down from 571 in 2019. Police said every year, about 20-25% murders in Delhi are a result of “ sudden provocation” or over trivial issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2-killed-in-separate-cases-over-trivial-matters-in-delhi-suspects-held-101633460115783.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||Sundar Nagar, Golf Links, Bengali Market to stay in Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone||The Centre on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that the matter of the exclusion of eight neighbourhoods of the national capital from the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) has been remanded back to the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) as the commission’s earlier recommendation -- to exclude these areas -- has been rejected. Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a clutch of petitions seeking the implementation of the DUAC recommendations, was informed by the DUAC counsel that a meeting of the commission has been scheduled for October 7 to review the Centre’s action.Spread over an area of over 28 sq km, the LBZ is governed by a strict building law that does not allow construction of basements and caps the number of floors.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the residents of the areas that were proposed to be excluded, contended that the rejection of the DUAC recommendation was mala fide and without any due application of mind by the Centre.Several plot owners and residents of Sundar Nagar, Golf Links, Bengali Market, and Panchsheel Marg, who are desirous of reconstructing or making alterations to existing buildings, have approached the high court seeking a direction to the ministry of housing and urban affairs to implement the recommendations made by DUAC in 2019.The petitioners said one of the recommendations, which was made by the commission, was that certain areas of the city -- including Jor Bagh, Golf Links, Sunder Nagar, Bengali Market, Ashoka Road, Mandir Marg, Panchsheel Marg, Sardar Patel Marg, and Chanakyapuri -- ought to be excluded from the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone.In the petition concerning the Bengali Market area, the petitioner defended the exclusion on the ground that the area comprised small residential plots of land measuring 212.5 square yards to 500 square yards and the developed properties could not be considered as ‘’bungalows’’ as is commonly understood and as also described in the report submitted by DUAC.In August, the court directed the ministry to decide on the recommendations made by DUAC within three weeks, while bearing in mind the peculiar bungalow style features of the zone and the fact that the recommendations did not seek to interfere with the LBZ guidelines but only suggested the exclusion of some areas that have modern constructions.The court said it expected the commission to examine the queries put forth by the Centre at the time of remand.“Issue is that they (Centre) are not accepting (recommendations). As a court, we will hear the matter at length. We will have an idea (after the commission’’s meeting),” the court said and listed the matter for further hearing to October 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sundar-nagar-golf-links-bengali-market-to-stay-in-lutyens-bungalow-zone-101633459997079.html

Rai said that based on the complaints received on the green Delhi app last year, the government has identified 150 pollution hot spots where focused mitigation measures will be taken.“The 13 pollution hot spots that we had identified last year were based on consistently high levels of pollution in these areas. These 150 hot spots, however, have been selected based on the complaints of waste burning, open dumping and traffic jams that we received via the green Delhi app. We will be keeping a close watch on these areas this time from our green war room, and immediate action will be taken to control the sources of pollution there,” Rai said.Some of the areas in the list are: Asaf Ali Road, Vijay Nagar Road, Mange Ram Park (Buddh Vihar), Bhagwan Mahavir Marg (Rithala),Vijay Vihar phase-1 (Rohini), Quresh Nagar, Swami Dayanand Enclave, Ajit Vihar, T-block Mangolpuri, Industrial Estate (Mayapuri), Janta Colony (Paschim Vihar), West Punjabi Bagh, Khanpur Colony, Raghu Nagar, Nasirpur and Subhash Market Trilokpuri.Rai said that a 21-member team has been formed to manage the green war room, which will work 24x7 to monitor the pollution situation in the national capital. Through the green Delhi app, citizens can send any pollution-related complaint, which will be forwarded to the green war room for action.The minister said last year 27,000 complaints were received through the app, of which more than 23,000 were resolved. While the app and the war room were launched by the government last year, Rai said, this year they have worked towards improving the technology to make these measures more efficient.He added that the maximum number of complaints on the app came from the three municipal corporations (north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the Public Works Department (PWD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/150-pollution-hot-spots-in-city-this-year-delhi-environment-minister-gopal-rai-101633459995895.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt sanctions ₹79.48 crore for hybrid hearings in 7 district courts||The Delhi government on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that it sanctioned ₹79.48 crore for setting up the hybrid system for conduct of trials and hearings in the seven district courts in the national capital. The preliminary estimate for the project was ₹227 crore, the court had been informed earlier.Taking note of the submission, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed the city government to file a status report duly containing a chart showing the items that were proposed in the preliminary estimate and the items that were subsequently approved.The court was hearing two pleas by lawyers Anil Kumar Hajelay and Manashwy Jha, seeking hybrid hearings in district courts on in-person hearing days in view of the Covid-19 threat.The high court had earlier asked the Delhi government to file an affidavit on the steps taken by it to provide infrastructure to subordinate courts for conducting hybrid hearings.The bench said the status report, to be filed within three days, must contain details of the amount as well as a chart showing items which have been approved/not approved by the government.“Those items which have not been approved should clearly be highlighted,” the court said and listed the matter for further hearing to October 18.The court had earlier made it clear to the Delhi government that if the proposal to set up infrastructure for hybrid hearings in trial courts and quasi-judicial bodies is turned down on the grounds of expenditure, then the court will examine the expenses incurred by the government on account of subsidies and public advertisements, from April 2020 till date.On Tuesday, appearing for the Delhi government, advocate Shadan Farasat told the court that infrastructure for hybrid hearings in district and state consumer forums will be set up within the next two months.The bench observed that arrangements should be made in such a manner that in case the third wave of Covid-19 comes, people are not required to go to the courts physically.“The bird view is that if at all the third wave of the pandemic comes, people shall not be required to go to courts and the hybrid system shall be put in place.The question is when it will be put in place. Give us a date from when the hybrid system will be in place in the district courts. The problem is that it is taking so long and the whole purpose will be defeated,” the bench said.It also directed the Centre, represented through standing counsel Anil Soni, to file an affidavit disclosing the steps taken by it to facilitate hybrid hearings in tribunals and forums which come under its responsibility.“You are caught sleeping. You don’t know anything it seems,” said the court after the central government counsel failed to answer its query on infrastructure required in forums coming under the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sanctions-79-48-crore-for-hybrid-hearings-in-7-district-courts-101633459935908.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi cabinet gives financial nod to ambitious e-health card project||The Delhi cabinet on Tuesday gave the financial nod to the e-health card project, conceived as a repository to store an individual’s entire medical history, which will be connected to a cloud-based health information management system. Anyone with a Delhi voter ID, or a parent with a Delhi voter ID in the case of a minor, will be issued an e-health card from the Delhi government healthcare institutions. There will soon be a provision for self-registration for health cards through a web or mobile-based interface, officials said. The system will not only allow doctors to access a patient’s entire medical records, it will also give patients benefits such as booking consultant appointments online. This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the National Digital Health Mission, under which there will be four main components -- a unique digital health ID, health care professionals’ registry, health facility registry, and electronic health records. Delhi’s programme to create a world-class health management system was first approved by the cabinet in 2018. The health card will have the complete demographic and key clinical details of a person, along with related information about the individual’s eligibility under various health schemes and programmes of the Delhi government. Delhi residents will be able to register themselves for issuance of a temporary e-health card, with a validity of one year, which will be converted to a permanent one once the person’s details have been validated through surveys and all required data is updated subsequently. There will be provisions for getting the card reissued and changing incorrect demographic details. The government will also set up a centralised help desk for the same, officials in the know of the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-gives-financial-nod-to-ambitious-e-health-card-project-101633459405289.html

There will be a presentation of 15 to 20 minutes followed by a discussion.“UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit has asked for a review of the recommendations of each of the standing committees and action taken by the administration thereon,” said a senior UT official.Notably, this is the first time when a special advisory council meeting is being convened to assess only the implementation progress of the recommendations or decisions of the committees.For long, members of the council derided the ineffectiveness of the council and unresponsiveness of the administration to their suggestions. “In the last advisory council meeting chaired by former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, some of the members demanded that the administration should regularly submit action taken reports. It was also suggested to break-up the advisory council meeting into smaller groups to make it manageable. There are 60 members in the council in addition to senior UT officials,” the official further stated.In the first introductory meet of the council on September 2, after Purohit took over as the UT administrator, the issue of its effectiveness came up again. The administrator had assured that steps will be taken to streamline its working including submission of action taken reports.The council’s two-year tenure, which ended on August 5, was extended to March 31, 2022. The present 60-member council was constituted in August 2019. The apex advisory body of the administration last met in February this year. In its two-year tenure, the council proved inconsequential in the delivery of any crucial decisions or resolving long standing issues of the city.Headed by the UT administrator, it is responsible for advising the administration on development issues and policy matters affecting the city, and gives a platform to the residents to air their views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-administrator-s-advisory-council-meeting-admn-to-present-action-taken-reports-on-october-8-101633459403513.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: East corporation outsources Ambedkar sports complex for five years||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), has given its advance approval for outsourcing the Ambedkar Sports Complex in Trilokpuri for a period of five years. The company to which the complex will be outsourced will be responsible for its maintenance, security, operations and management for the duration and will pay ₹ 55,750 a month to the corporation, the officials said. The EDMC mayor, Shyam Sundar Agrawal, said the sports complex comprises two indoor badminton courts, a football ground, a cricket ground and gym. “The agency will be responsible for infrastructure development and day-to-day operations. If the performance of the outsourced agency will be satisfactory, its contract period may be extended for another five years with the approval of the commissioner and mutual consent of both parties,” he said. Echoing similar views, EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said the company will be responsible for the maintenance, security, water and electricity, parking management, manpower and cleanliness of the premises. “Since the land and the constructed building belong to the EDMC, the outsourced agency will not have any right over the land or building. The agency, however, has been given a free hand to renovate and upgrade the premises of its own accord. But, all renovation and upgrade plans are required to be approved by the competent authority,” he said. Anand further said the agency will have to provide free coaching to children studying in the primary schools of the EDMC. “They’ll also be allowed the use of sports and related equipment available in the sports complex. The agency will have to promote physical education and sports through new programmes and develop the sports complex as an institution of excellence. No social functions will not be allowed in the sports complex,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-east-corporation-outsources-ambedkar-sports-complex-for-five-years-101633459395967.html

The first RRTS corridor, connecting Delhi to Meerut, will have three stations in Delhi, including the terminal station at Sarai Kale Khan.Gahlot reviewed the progress of the RRTS corridor on Monday and directed NCRTC officials to speed up the construction work and ensure timely completion of the corridor. The 82km long, high-speed corridor would have total 25 stations, including three in Delhi at Anand Vihar, New Ashok Nagar and Sarai Kale Khan. The RRTS is anticipated to take off the roads nearly 1 lakh vehicles, thereby decongesting major roads in Delhi, the minister said.“It is a matter of great pride that Delhi is developing as a hub for transport, and in spite of the high density and restricted land availability, we are able to explore and optimise the land usage without compromising the vehicular movement. But to us, pedestrian and passenger safety and convenience are the highest priority and NCRTC has been advised to conduct an independent audit for pedestrian and commuter safety and circulation within and around the stations,” Gahlot said in a statement.The government said that Multi-Modal Integration (MMI) is a major aspect of the RRTS stations, and is crucial in easing traffic flow. It said MMI works on the principle of minimum interchanges, with maximum efficiency in terms of distance a person has to travel, level changes, waiting times, along with adoption of smart and safer technologies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/audit-rrts-plan-to-ensure-seamless-travel-kailash-gahlot-to-ncr-transport-corp-101633459336281.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||Situation in UP similar to Jallianwala Bagh massacre: Sharad Pawar slams BJP govts||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led governments in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the Centre for “misuse of power” over the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri during a farmers’ protest that had left eight people dead on October 3. He demanded a probe into the incident by a Supreme Court (SC) judge and likened the violence to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during India’s freedom movement. Pawar has assured the farmers that they are not alone and that the Opposition is with them. “Our country gives the right to protest. Accordingly, farmers gathered at Lakhimpur Kheri and were holding a silent protest. At that time, people related to those in government – be it UP or at the Centre – tried to suppress their voice and [the protesters] were mowed down by a jeep, which led to the loss of six-eight farmers’ lives. Those in the BJP government at Centre and in UP are responsible for this act.” Pawar’s comments came a day after the UP Police booked Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni and his son Ashish for murder and criminal conspiracy in connection with the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri. The farmers at the spot have alleged that Ashish mowed down four cultivators with his SUV during the protest on Sunday and triggered the violence. Ashish denied the charges and had said that he was not in the car. He blamed the farmers for torching vehicles and thrashing others, including the car’s driver and two BJP workers, to death. A local journalist also died in the violence. Four of the eight victims of the violence, were farmers. It was the bloodiest clash since protests against three Central farm laws erupted last year. Pawar said he has heard that the government is ready to get the incident probed by a retired judge. “But I want the investigation to be conducted by a sitting SC judge and allow the truth to come out.” Pawar said the UP government has created a situation similar to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and it will have to pay its price one day. He added that the attack on farmers protesting silently “shows the intention of the BJP-led Central government”. “I want to tell them [BJP], today you are in the government and are trying to muzzle farmers’ voices by misusing power. But you will not succeed. You will get a befitting response not only from the farmers in UP but from the entire country,” the former Union minister said. As the BJP-led UP government has stopped Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Member of Parliament Deepender Singh Hooda, Punjab and Chhattisgarh chief ministers from entering Lakhimpur Kheri, the veteran leader said such treatment kills the fundamental rights in a democracy. “They can stop people for a day or two but will not be able to succeed for more than that and the people will show them [BJP] their right place,” he said. The former Union agriculture minister termed the BJP governments insensitive. “The governments, be it UP or at the Centre, are insensitive. Even after farmers were killed, they are not ready to express grief. Moreover, they are trying to give a message that they are treating all those protesting against the government with iron fists,” he replied when asked why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not yet expressed grief over the killings of farmers. In response to Pawar’s comments, BJP said they have no objections for probe by a sitting SC judge. However, the party said that before blaming it for the incident, the NCP chief should have considered the fact that four BJP workers had also died in the violence. “He [Pawar] should have taken all the details before making such statements as four people who had died in the incident are BJP workers. I am sure BJP workers didn’t go there for a suicide attack. As far as a probe is concerned, we have no problem in getting it investigated with a sitting SC judge or any of the agencies in the country,” said BJP’s state vice-president Madhav Bhandari. Bhandari also recalled the Gowari stampede incident. Around 114 people from the Gowari community were killed and 500 were injured in a stampede at Nagpur when the police had tried to disperse a huge crowd by using a baton charge. Pawar was the chief minister when the incident took place in 1994. “Before comparing the Lakhimpur Kheri incident [to Jallianwala Bagh massacre], he [Pawar] should also not forget the Gowari stampede case,” he remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/situation-in-up-similar-to-jallianwala-bagh-massacre-sharad-pawar-slams-bjp-govts-101633459280566.html

06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh court frames charges against man who confessed to murder on live TV||A Chandigarh district court has framed charges against Maninder Singh, 32, who was arrested from a news studio in January last year after he, during a live telecast, confessed to having murdered a woman friend at a hotel in the Industrial Area, Phase 2. The court of additional district and sessions judge Narender has framed the charges under Sections 302 (murder), 303 (murder by life-convict), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code. The trial will begin on November 18. According to police, Sarabjit Kaur, 27, a nurse belonging to Sangrur, had checked into a hotel with Maninder on December 30, 2019. She was found murdered in her room on the afternoon of January 1. On January 14, Maninder, who belongs to Chandigarh and was out on bail after being convicted in another murder case, reached the office of a news channel and confessed to Sarabjit’s murder. He also confessed to the previous crime, wherein he had stabbed another woman friend to death, in Karnal in 2010, even as his review petition was pending in the high court. Maninder had alleged that he killed Sarabjit as she was having an affair even as the two were planning to get married. According to police, the two had an altercation, following which he first strangled her and then slit her neck with a knife. After committing the crime, he had been on the move, staying in various places in Punjab. On surfacing at the news channel’s office, he had said that he wanted to surrender as police had allegedly held his parents captive. As soon as they got the information, cops rushed to the channel’s office and arrested Maninder while the programme was still being telecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-court-frames-charges-against-man-who-confessed-to-murder-on-live-tv-101633459275724.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||Won’t make false promises: Maharashtra CM on BJP’s criticism over no relief to farmers||In an apparent jibe at opposition leaders, who are currently touring the flood-affected areas in Maharashtra, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said that he would not make false promises even if he is being criticised. CM’s statement came amid criticism by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, including Devendra Fadnavis, that the state government has not given any relief package to farmers who were affected due to floods in parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha.Speaking at a workshop on understanding the state budget for legislators, Thackeray said that the government has to look at their treasury while making any announcements following a natural disaster. “The disasters hit not just the villages but also the state’s economic situation and we are moving forward by finding a way out of it. Many a times, we feel that these things should be given or done…. But it’s not my nature to make any false promises that I can’t fulfil just to comfort people after the disasters. I will never commit such a sin. I won’t even care if I am being criticised for it,” said Thackeray. He further stated, “Visiting spots and comforting people is one part, the other thing is to take stock of what is in our kitty and then give [relief].”Fadnavis, Pravin Darekar and other BJP leaders are touring the affected areas in central Maharashtra. They have targeted the Thackeray-led government for failing to provide any immediate relief to the farmers who have lost their standing crops and have damaged houses due to the floods last month.Speaking on the budget presentation in the legislature, Thackeray said that couplets and verses of saints are recited during the presentation, but the behaviour of legislators is completely contrast. “Even the saints would not like it [behaviour]. I once talked with Devendra ji [Fadnavis] about it. To what extent can we stoop low and what is happening in the House? The ruling parties will keep changing. But when we express an opinion, we expect a suggestion from you. This is not the wrestling arena. If something small happens, then ruckus is created [in the House]. It is not right,” he added.The CM also spoke on the behaviour of members in the state legislature, remarking that there is more shallowness these days while speaking in the House. Citing the example of Mrinal Gore, who was the opposition leader in 1988-1989, CM said that she verified information she got before speaking in the House. “Now, there is more shallowness which creates a lot of noise... Are we going to look for depth in our thoughts? There should be some meaning to the words that we speak [in the House],” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wont-make-false-promises-maharashtra-cm-on-bjp-s-criticism-over-no-relief-to-farmers-101633459217218.html
06-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Out on bail, bank robber strikes in Maloya||Out on bail in the last year’s Mohali bank robbery case, a 30-year-old man along with a female accomplice looted a Maloya youth at gunpoint after posing as a cop on Monday. He has been arrested while the woman is still at large, Chandigarh Police said on Tuesday. The robber has been identified as Sandeep, alias Khurmi, of Sector 38 West. He along with two men had robbed ₹4.8 lakh from an all-woman branch of Punjab National Bank in Mohali on June 17, 2020. At the time, he was out on parole. After his arrest, he was lodged in the Ropar jail, from where he was recently released on bail.Active in crime since his juvenile years, Sandeep had also escaped from the Amabla jail with help of Lawrence Bishnoi gang members in 2016. He is facing at least 12 cases of robbery, extortion and attempt to murder in Chandigarh and Mohali, said police. Posed as cops, tried to extort youthIn the fresh case, Sandeep along with his female accomplice forcibly entered the house of the complainant, Priyanshu, in Maloya Colony in the wee hours of Monday. The two allegedly introduced themselves as Panchkula police officials, and tried to extort money from Priyanshu after claiming that he had been booked for rape and murder.After Priyanshu, a student who stays with his mother, refused to accompany the suspects or pay any money, the two pointed a pistol at him and made him sign on blank papers. They also robbed him of ₹15,000, a mobile phone, wallet and debit card. Police managed to arrest Sandeep within a day. They recovered an automatic pistol along with four live cartridges, a fake identity card of the defence ministry, miscellaneous documents related to various departments and police uniform along with a belt and pair of brown shoes besides ATM and PAN cards along with ₹7,740 in cash.

06-10-2021||Mumbai||Amid 2nd Covid wave, revenue collection of Maharashtra at 35% in first half of fiscal||The second wave of Covid-19, followed by the lockdown, has hit Maharashtra’s finances badly. The state’s revenue receipts in the first half of the ongoing 2021-22 fiscal has merely been 35% of its budgeted estimates of ₹3.69 lakh crore. Almost all the key contributing sectors, including stamp duty and registration, excise, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and vehicle taxes, have been hit badly, and the situation may lead to the rise in the fiscal deficit and hamper the development outlay this year.Against the estimated revenue of ₹3.69 lakh crore, including grant in aid from the Centre, the state’s collection until September 30 is ₹1.29 lakh crore. Of the estimated revenue, the state’s own tax and non-tax revenues expected in the ongoing fiscal are ₹3.12 lakh crore against which collections by the end of the first half of the fiscal is ₹1.11 lakh crore.Most of the state’s tax revenue comes from GST, sales tax, excise, stamp duty- registration and taxes of vehicles among others. The generation of GST in the first six months has touched ₹41,438 crore against the annual estimated collection of ₹1.18 lakh crore. The collections slightly dropped to ₹7,113 crore in September from ₹8,647 crore in August. The revenue from stamp duty and registration has been consolidated to ₹11,311 crore against the annual estimate of ₹32,000 crore, while excise duty collected in first six months stands at ₹6,618 crore against the estimated annual collection of ₹19,500 crore. The state government expects the revenue generation to improve in the remaining half of the fiscal. “The current fiscal is much better than FY (financial year) 2020-21 as the revenue receipts in till last September were just 28.33% because the collection was ₹98,438 crore against the annual estimates of ₹3.47 lakh crore. The first lockdown was stricter than the lockdown during the second wave from February-March this year. During the pre-Covid years, the revenue collection for the first six months would be around 44%. We expect the revenue to improve in the remaining six months as the third wave, in case it hits, is not expected to be as severe as the earlier two waves. The collection in Q-2 (quarter 2) of the current fiscal improved in comparison to the receipts in first three months,” an official from the finance department said.The state government is wary about the rise in the fiscal deficit and hampering of the development works. The state has estimated a revenue deficit of ₹10,226, which could increase substantially because of the drop in the receipts. The dues of more than ₹38,000 crore towards GST compensation from the Centre may also lead to the reduction in funds for development works. “The spending on the development projects had been less than 50% of the outlay, while this year, too, it is not expected to be more than 70%. This year’s allocation for the development works is around ₹1.30 lakh crore. The ramping up of the health infrastructure in anticipation of the third wave has resulted in huge spending over and above the budgeted allocation for health infrastructure. This will need diversion of funds from other departments,” another official said.State excise commissioner Kantilal Umap said, “The second wave coincided with the beginning of new fiscal, resulting in a major drop in the excise duty in first six months. The situation is not as bad as it was last year as our half-yearly collections from the excise duty is 28% more to the corresponding period of last year. We, however, hope to achieve our target of ₹19,500 crore as traditionally the sale of liquor improves after October. Also, we get around ₹1,100 crore from the licence fee in March.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-2nd-covid-wave-revenue-collection-of-maharashtra-at-35-in-1st-first-half-of-fiscal-101633459097669.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt again sends doorstep ration delivery file to LG||The Delhi government has once again sent the file regarding doorstep delivery of ration scheme to Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal for approval, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said in a statement on Tuesday.The move comes after the Delhi high court on September 27 gave conditional approval to the government to cut food grains supply to those Fixed Price Shops (FPS) where patrons have opted for doorstep delivery of ration, instead of collecting it from the shops.In a note on the file sent to the LG, Kejriwal said he sincerely hoped that Baijal will review his decision to stop implementation of the doorstep delivery scheme, so that the orders of the high court can be implemented and doorstep delivery of ration can be processed for the beneficiaries opting it. “People are asking if pizza, burger, smartphone and clothes can be home delivered then why cannot the poor citizens of Delhi get their share of ration home delivered,” Kejriwal wrote in the note.The chief minister also said that the scheme will help disband the ration mafia in the capital.The LG office did not comment on the matter.Taking note of the government’s submission that “an overwhelming majority has opted for supply of rations at their doorstep”, a high court bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that authorities could supply only such quantities of ration to FPS that are required for those who want to collect it from shops, while the rest can be held back by the government for door-to-door delivery.The Delhi government submitted to the court that beneficiaries of door-to-door scheme will also have the option of reverting to the old scheme of collecting their rations from the shops.The court’s order came on a petition by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh -- a body of the fixed price shop owners -- in which they had challenged the doorstep delivery of ration scheme. The high court will hear the matter now October 27.The Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections— the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi government, on March 24, passed a Cabinet decision to remove the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013.In June, the government sent the file back to LG, contending that its provisions are in accordance with the NFS Act, and that it will simultaneously implement the Centre’s “One Nation, One Ration Card” scheme. However, a decision is pending on the matter.Nearly 7.2 million people in Delhi are eligible for subsidised food. They include 1.7 million ration card holders and nearly 3 million priority households. There are also other food-insecure categories identified by the Delhi government.Free food grains for those without ration cardThe Delhi cabinet on Tuesday approved the extension of its ongoing scheme to offer free food grains to non-ration card holders.“A cabinet meeting was held today at the Delhi secretariat under the chairmanship of Kejriwal. In the meeting, it was proposed to provide free food grains to non-PDS beneficiaries, keeping in mind the needs of migrant workers and economically weaker people, till the continuation of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was approved by the Delhi Cabinet unanimously,” a government spokesperson said.Currently, the distribution of food grains to non-ration card holders is done at 282 schools identified by the education department, three municipal corporations and the NDMC. But in the coming days, schools are likely to open in Delhi because of which an alternative arrangement is being planned.“Registration for ration can be done by visiting the Delhi government’s Ration E-coupon Corona Relief Portal. During the distribution of ration, four civil defence personnel will be deployed at each distribution centre for security and compliance with the Covid-19 protocols. It is estimated that around 100 distribution centres will be required. One centre per circle with the provision of 30 additional centres will be opened in areas where migrant labourers live. These additional 30 centres will be made operational as per the demand of the people,” the government said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-again-sends-doorstep-ration-delivery-file-to-lg-101633459037268.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Four men held in Delhi for stealing cars after exchange of fire||Four men were arrested on Tuesday for stealing two cars from a company’s godown in Mundka on Saturday, the police said.Two of them were arrested after a dramatic chase, following an exchange of fire with police in Mundka area early Tuesday.Police said four men stole two cars from a company’s godown in Mundka on Saturday and choked the security guard when he tried to stop them. On Tuesday, When a policeman tried to chase them, they attempted to kill him by hitting him with a car and injured a few bypassers in the process.Police said that the arrested men were identified as Ravi Dalal and Himanshu. During questioning, they revealed the names of the other two suspects, Vicky and a juvenile, who were also caught on Tuesday.Talking about the incident, police said that on Saturday, they got a PCR call regarding the theft of two new cars from the stockyard of a car company in Mundka.Police said that the security guard at the stockyard, Manoj Kumar Mishra (45), told them that on the intervening night of October 1 and 2, he was on duty from 8pm to 8am.“Around 3am, when I was in the guard-room, I heard a noise. When I stepped out of the room to look around, some people suddenly attacked me. They beat me up brutally and confined me in the guard room. They even robbed me of my phone and other belongings,” the guard said.He added that they strangled him, but when he became unconscious, they left him for dead and fled after stealing the cars.DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh, said that a case was immediately registered under sections 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Mundka police station and teams were formed to investigate the matter. “During the investigation, Section 395 (punishment for dacoity) of the IPC was also added to the case,” said Singh.Police said that during the investigation, they found that new cars are temporarily stored, before being distributed to showrooms, at a stockyard at Hirankudna village in Mundka. Last month, approximately 100 new cars of a well-known company were parked in the stockyard. Due to heavy rain, the godown was waterlogged and five cars were suspected to be damaged.On September 26, these five cars were placed in the middle of the plot and their keys were kept in the security guard’s room, police said. They added that the suspects were after these particular cars.DCP Singh said that over the weekend, the police team checked about 175 CCTV cameras in Delhi and nearby areas in Haryana. The Haryana Police was also informed about the incident.On Tuesday, around 7.30am, the team received information about one of the suspects being spotted at Rohtak road. The team, including ASI Satender, constable Naveen, constable Krishan, and constable Ravi Anand, spotted one of the stolen cars at a petrol pump on main Rohtak road.When the team tried to apprehend the two persons sitting in the car, the driver reversed the car, hit the policemen as well as bystanders, and sped away.ASI Satender fell while constable Krishan tried to hang onto the door on the driver’s side. To shake off the constable, the driver turned the car into the wrong lane and smashed the side of the car against a parked truck. When that failed to dislodge the constable, the men took off running in different directions.The other policemen, in the meantime, chased down one of them in a vacant plot. He then took out a pistol from his pocket and opened fire. In retaliation, Satender also fired three rounds in the air while Krishan and Naveen overpowered him. He was later identified as Himanshu. The other accused, Ravi Dalal, was also nabbed shortly thereafter. A case under relevant sections was then registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-men-held-in-delhi-for-stealing-cars-after-exchange-of-fire-101633459035704.html

Apart from this, exhaustive reports prepared on a monthly basis by the cell will help in the fight against dust pollution more systematically,” the CAQM said.The commission has also formulated a 10-point dust monitoring parameter, which includes measures such as optimum utilisation of road sweeping machines, scientific disposal of dust collected in designated sites and landfills, water sprinkling to suppress dust especially after mechanised sweeping, augmentation of mechanised sweeping and sprinkling capacity, proper management of roads to ensure potholes-free roads, laying or repairing roads in a manner which extensively supports mechanised sweeping and conversion of non-paved roadsides into paved one or into a green area, greening of central verges.Other parameters include, laying cemented roads over bituminous roads especially in industrial areas and identification of hotspots of road dust and target-specific implementation of road dust control measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/air-quality-panel-orders-formation-of-38-dust-control-cells-including-11-in-delhi-101633458975892.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 9 snatchers among 116 anti-social elements arrested during special drive||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they arrested 116 anti-social elements, including nine snatchers, four thieves and an auto-lifter, in the northwest district in a 24-hour special combing and area dominance exercise code-named “Operation Sajag” carried out between Sunday and Monday.Another 912 people were detained for indulging in suspicious activities and later released after verification, police said, adding that a total of 96 unclaimed vehicles, parked at unauthorised places, were also seized.“The one-of-its-kind initiative that we have named ‘Operation Sajag’ was launched to keep a check on criminals and other anti-social elements to establish confidence among the public through higher visibility of police personnel on streets and residential neighbourhoods.

06-10-2021||Delhi||We brought an ordinance to combat pollution in NCR: Bhupender Yadav||With the spectre of air pollution once again haunting the Capital as stubble burning starts in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, the Centre is hoping the situation this year will not be as bad as previous years.In an interview with HT, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said the new agency to curb bad air in NCR, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), will take its remit seriously and also give legal status to the regional airshed (area affected by similar meteorology and topography that restrict the dispersion of pollutants).Edited excerpts:How prepared is the government this year to tackle winter pollution? You have had several meetings with state governments, what is the feedback that you have got and what is your assessment?The most important step that our government has taken is that we have brought in an ordinance to monitor and control air pollution in the national capital region. And the agency that has been created through this ordinance, CAQM, is doing its work effectively. To solve Delhi’s air pollution problem, legal status needed to be given to the (regional) airshed. This happened through the ordinance. Several measures have been taken by the government to manage the primary pollution sources in the region, including vehicles, industries, construction etc. To maintain transparency in pollution data, we have also launched an online portal called PRANA (Portal for Regulation of Air-Pollution in Non-Attainment Cities), which is a platform that provides information on how cities are curbing pollution levels and historical data on air pollution mitigation milestones achieved since 2018. While pollution control is the government’s job, it is also a matter that concerns the public and there needs to be a joint responsibility. We have issued over six advisories and over 40 directions related to air pollution since the commission took over.Will you be able to reduce stubble fires this year?We started working around mitigation measures to control stubble burning in July. The ministries of agriculture and animal husbandry, the Central Pollution Control Board, and our task force have worked together. We also monitored the work that has happened in various states to reduce the incidents of stubble burning, and we saw that state governments also took this matter seriously. Starting July 29, we have held several meetings with all agencies concerned to keep a close watch on the action taken to prevent stubble burning.We are also working on larger, solution-based plans, such as converting the paddy stubble into biofuels and decomposing it. To curb the practice, we have also come up with machinery advancements (under the Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for in-situ management of crop residue). The central government has assigned nearly ₹700 crore, and we have made service centres and hiring centres as well. I believe that the central government and state governments have worked in coordination to tackle this issue, but CAQM is mapping these incidents closely.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have highlighted that unless the government gives them some kind of direct subsidy, the practice of stubble burning is likely to continue. What is being done in this area?I don’t believe that is the case. Whichever farmer unions and pollution control boards I have interacted with, I have got good feedback. We understand that this is an issue that would require collective participation and work is being done based on the feedback that we are getting.Punjab, one of the states where stubble fires are reported, just saw a major political shake-up, and the state is also going into elections next year. Do you think all this will in any way impact the action against stubble burning this year? I don’t think so. These are two separate concerns. Political matters are there, but our duties and responsibilities as governments are separate. It is our collective responsibility and all agencies are serious.The ministry of environment, forest and climate change has also been working on revising air quality standards. By when can we expect some clarity on this?Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already announced our plan for the holistic improvement of air quality in over 100 cities. For this purpose, we have also launched the PRANA portal. We are conducting some studies to assess the current air quality standards and see if they can be revised. Our focus is on air quality monitoring also.Are we on track to achieve the national clean air programme (NCAP) target which aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 concentrations compared to 2017 annual levels in over a hundred cities by 2024?We are working tirelessly to achieve NCAP targets. The best example of this is our work to convert all industries to piped natural gas in NCR. We have also taken out a policy to promote electric vehicles, taken steps to control stubble burning, etc.Last year, there was a lot of confusion over the role of CAQM and CPCB in enforcing the Grap (graded response action plan) measures because of which Delhi saw several spells of ‘severe’ air when no action was called in by any monitoring body. Will things be different this time?CAQM and CPCB are working together. CAQM has come up with a system of regular updates, where the action taken by states and other agencies will be closely monitored. CPCB will also be helping the CAQM in their efforts.Can people flag violations? Yes, people can send in their complaints to CAQM. There is an online portal for this.The Delhi government has said that they have requested the Centre to ban firecrackers in the neighbouring states as well so that a spike in pollution levels during Diwali can be avoided. Are you considering this?We will be closely monitoring the pollution levels, but no decision has been taken on this yet. As and when the situation arises, we will see what measures need to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/we-brought-an-ordinance-to-combat-pollution-in-ncr-bhupender-yadav-101633458678005.html

06-10-2021||Delhi||SC to hear after Diwali break Delhi govt’s plea on who controls bureaucrats||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will hear after Diwali break the Delhi government’s plea on the contentious issue of who should control administrative services and bureaucrats in Delhi.“List this matter after Diwali vacation,” said Chief Justice of India NV Ramana after senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, requested for an early hearing of the case. The top court reopens on November 8 after the Diwali break.Requesting for an early hearing, Mehra said that two judges had in February 2019 differed with each other on the aspect of administrative control of officers in the national capital territory of Delhi, following which the issue was referred to a three-judge bench.“Since the entire administrative control vests currently with the Centre, it is an important issue and impedes on the ability of the Delhi government to govern and implement its policy,” submitted Mehra, requesting the court to list the matter for hearing as early as possible.On February 14, 2019, the two-judge bench of the top court delivered a split verdict on the question of powers of the GNCTD and Union government over services and referred the matter to a three-judge bench.In the split verdict, justice Ashok Bhushan held that the Delhi government has no power at all over administrative services. On the other hand, justice AK Sikri said the transfer or posting of officers in top echelons of the bureaucracy (joint director and above) can only be done by the central government while for other officers, the mandate of the Lieutenant Governor would prevail only in case of a difference of opinion.Governance of the national capital has witnessed a power struggle between the Centre and the Delhi government since the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-to-hear-after-diwali-break-delhi-govt-s-plea-on-who-controls-bureaucrats-101633458616250.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Rahul Gandhi’s tweet on minor deleted: Twitter to Delhi HC||Microblogging platform Twitter on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that it has removed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, revealing the identity of the nine-year-old Dalit girl in the alleged gangrape and murder in Delhi cantonment, and that his account is now operational without the objectionable tweet.However, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, while hearing a plea seeking action against Gandhi for posting the pictures of the minor victim’s parents, issued notice to Twitter and asked them to file an affidavit as the petitioner’s counsel objected to Twitter’s submissions. “We are making it explicitly clear that we are not issuing notice to other respondents (Gandhi and the city police). Notice is being issued only to respondent no. 4 (Twitter),” said the court.The bench was hearing a plea by petitioner Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar, a social activist, who alleged in the petition that by posting the photograph with the parents of the child victim, Gandhi violated the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, which prohibit disclosing the identity of minor victims of sexual offences.The nine-year-old Dalit girl died under mysterious circumstances on August 1, with her parents alleging that she was raped, murdered and cremated by a crematorium’s priest and his accomplices in southwest Delhi’s Old Nangal village. Citing disclosure statements of two accused in the case, the Delhi Police had last month informed the court that the girl died due to “suffocation” during the sexual assault.During the proceedings on Tuesday, senior advocate Sajan Poovaya, representing Twitter, told the court that Gandhi’s tweet with the pictures was in violation of their privacy policy and hence it was deleted.However, this was objected to by advocate Gautam Jha, counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner claimed that Gandhi was trying to gain political mileage.Senior advocate R S Cheema and lawyer Tarannum Cheema appeared for Rahul Gandhi.The plea has sought initiation of appropriate legal action against Gandhi by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The matter will be heard on November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rahul-gandhi-s-tweet-on-minor-deleted-twitter-to-delhi-hc-101633458317327.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Court denies bail to Olympian Sushil Kumar in Chhatrasal stadium murder case||A Delhi court on Tuesday denied bail to wrestler and two-time Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar in connection with the murder of co-wrestler Sagar Dhankad at Chhatrasal stadium on May 4, saying that “when renowned people commit such heinous offence, then the detrimental effects on the society are enormous”.Additional sessions judge Shivaji Anand, while dismissing the bail application, said Kumar was clearly visible on the video footage beating the victims. “Prima facie, the applicant/accused (Kumar) is visible in the video as reflected in the photographs taken out of the same video footage: He is clearly visible and seemed to be causing severe injuries,” the judge said.The court noted that a video was recovered from the phone of the co-accused Prince, where Kumar was seen carrying a stick and beating the victims.The judge also said that the expert from forensic laboratory, Gandhi Nagar, where the phone was sent for examination, has opined that there was no sign of tampering with the footage.Dhankad, a wrestler, Bhagat Singh and Jaibhagwan alias Sonu Mahal were allegedly abducted and beaten by Kumar and his accomplices inside Chhatrasal stadium on the night of May 4. Dhankad succumbed to his injuries, but others survived the assault.The police have filed the charge sheet against Kumar and 12 others for murder, abduction, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence, criminal intimidation, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, house-trespass, rioting and voluntarily causing hurt. Additionally, Kumar has also been booked for robbery, dacoity and dishonestly receiving stolen property. Five suspects are yet to be arrested in the case.Kumar, a Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award winner, was arrested on May 23.The court, in its order, said there are a total of 17 accused and charge sheet has been filed only against 13 of them, while investigation is ongoing with respect to the remaining accused is still going on. It said that given the number of injured persons to be five, a lot of information has to be gathered and hence minor discrepancies in making out the statements cannot be ruled out.“Some discrepancies in the statements may occur but they do not seem to be detrimental to the whole case of the prosecution. This is not an appropriate stage to consider the whole facts in detail; only prima facie cases are to be seen and the minor discrepancies in statements are not sufficient to warrant bail. The victims were lifted from different places at gunpoint.“As per the charge-sheet, it was a daring and awful act of the accused persons that they openly caused such brutal injuries to the victims without having any fear and as per the charge-sheet, they are having firearms as well as other weapons like sticks, dandas etc,” the court said.Kumar’s counsel, Pradeep Rana argued that the police made a false case against his client and presented a “guilty image” of him.Rana said that leaks to the media were allegedly facilitated on an “unprecedented level” and “false information was fed to the media” in order to wrongfully establish a connection between Kumar and gangsters.Additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava opposed the bail plea, saying the accused allegedly hunted 27-year old Sagar Dhankad like wild animals.“They were behaving like wild animals on a hunt. They hunted him (Sagar) like wild pigs. He was flailing on the floor while they mercilessly beat him,” Shrivastava said.The public prosecutor further said there was delay in registration of the FIR as the witnesses were not in a position to give statements.The police, in its charge sheet, have told the court that Kumar was counselled by the experts who said that the former Olympian showed no signs of remorse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-denies-bail-to-olympian-sushil-kumar-in-chhatrasal-stadium-murder-case-101633458315754.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 6 ITIs, Indira Gandhi Technical varsity to get driving schools on campus||In a first, six Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) will have dedicated driving schools inside their campuses as part of a project to ensure the next generation of drivers “learn the skill properly” and “act responsibly” on the roads, said officials from the state transport department on Tuesday. “The idea is to start introducing driving as a life skill and there cannot be a better place to do so than having driving schools inside educational institutions. We have held high-level meetings with several colleges and the government’s education department, and have so far finalised seven institutions, which will have driving schools in the first phase,” said Ashish Kundra, Delhi’s transport commissioner. Officials said three more educational institutions will be roped in for the project, which is likely to be launched by January next year. According to official estimates, every year, around 12,000 students graduate from the seven institutions identified for the project in Delhi. “In the driving course that will be offered at these colleges or universities, a student will have to complete 31 hours of theory and practical classes. At least 21 hours will be theory and 10 hours will be practical. It will be flexible so that a student can attend it post college hours,” said a senior transport official on condition of anonymity. Once a student has completed the driving course, s/he will be eligible to appear for the driving test on the same track and a licence will be issued. Currently, applicants can get a learners’ licence from home by giving an online test.According to the state transport department’s website, Delhi currently has 64 authorised driving schools. However, the actual number of driving schools in the city is much more, said officials adding that many such schools operate without following the set procedure of clocking 31 hours of theory and practical classes.In October 2018, the Delhi government started a project of issuing learners’ driving licences to students of Delhi Technological University and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-6-itis-indira-gandhi-technical-varsity-to-get-driving-schools-on-campus-101633458255883.html

06-10-2021||Noida||Noida doctors perform rare heart surgery on Iraqi patient||Hani Jawad Mohammad (56), an Iraqi patient who was suffering from terminal heart failure in 2018, has got a fresh lease of life. A rare case, Mohammad has fully recovered and his heart is functioning without an artificial pump or left ventricular assist device (LVAD), thanks to the doctors at Noida’s Fortis Hospital who treated him. LVAD is an artificial device designed for patients with end-stage heart failure. It mimics the functions of a natural heart and pumps blood throughout the body in patients whose natural heart is too weak to perform the function itself. In 2018, Hani came to Noida’s Fortis Hospital with terminal heart failure. “He was breathless and could not do routine activities, such as taking a bath, without help. Since no surgical procedure was possible, he was put on the heart transplant list. While waiting for the donor heart, the patient’s condition started deteriorating and he became so critical that he required life-saving machines to keep him alive. It is then that we decided to put him on LVAD or artificial heart,” said Dr Ajay Kaul, chairman of Fortis Heart & Vascular Institute, Noida. The device is placed inside the heart and runs on batteries attached outside the body. A small hole has to be made to connect the machine’s wire with the batteries, said doctors. In 2019, Hani developed a driveline infection around the point on his chest where the wire was connected. “We treated the infection and during a routine checkup, we found that his heart had recovered completely and that was very uncommon. We reduced the speed of the pump. His heart was still functioning at optimum capacity, but we kept the pump running to be on the safe side. We asked him to come again after six months for a follow up. We observed him over the next one year as we wanted to be very sure that the heart is functioning properly without the support of the pump,” said Dr Kaul adding that by November 2020, they had turned off the device. Finally, in August this year, it was decided after due consultation with the patient that the artificial heart would be explanted. “The explantation procedure was carried out at Fortis Hospital, Noida in September. It is a novel surgical procedure which was conducted for the first time in India successfully. The patient was discharged within five days and is doing very well,” said doctors.According to medical experts, the explantation surgery has not been recorded in medical literature so far. “LVAD is considered as the last resort for patients with terminal heart failure and is planted on them who are on the waiting list for heart transplant. Generally, when the patient undergoes a heart transplant, the LVAD is removed. In some cases, as the devices have become technologically more advanced, they can also be used as destination therapy where the patient can continue lifelong with the LVAD in his heart. In cases of terminal heart failure, the heart is so weak that without LVAD, it is unable to function. But in this case, the heart has recovered and is able to function without LVAD. So far in India, no such case has been recorded in medical literature,” said Dr Dheeraj Sharma, associate professor, cardiac surgery, Postgraduate Institute of Child Health, Noida. In the past two years, Hani has become a father of two children and has also named one of his sons after the doctor who treated him. “I owe my life to the team of medical experts at the hospital who treated me. As a mark of gratitude, I named my newborn son after the head doctor Ajay Kaul. When I came for treatment, I was unable to even stand and was on wheelchair but today, I can do everyday activities without any trouble,” said Hani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-doctors-perform-rare-heart-surgery-on-iraqi-patient-101633456815909.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||No imminent threat of third Covid wave, allow physical meeting of civic body: HC to Maha govt||In light of the Covid-19 threat diminishing and lockdown norms being relaxed substantially, the Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the state to reconsider its order asking the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) not to conduct standing committee meeting physically and take a decision on it within five days. The court also directed the chairman of the BMC’s standing committee to permit members to physically attend the standing committee meeting being conducted at 2pm. The order was passed in a public interest litigation filed by two BJP counsellors who claimed that their voices and views were not being considered through the online mode and hence wanted the meeting to be held physically. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice M S Karnik while hearing the PIL filed by Vinod Mishra and Makarand Narwekar, members of the BMC’s SC, was informed by advocates Amogh Singh and Jeet Gandhi that the PIL was filed challenging the December 21, 2020 and June 28, 2021 notifications of the state government which stipulated that SC meeting of the BMC should be held through video conferencing. The advocates referred to the October 20, 2020 order of the HC wherein the bench had expressed that the SC meeting should be held physically and not through VC. It was further submitted that as VC meetings were being conducted to bulldoze agendas involving crores of rupees of public money without deliberations, the PIL sought urgent hearing as the chairman of the SC while issuing the agenda for the October 5 meeting had announced that it would be held through VC. The advocates further submitted that as the lockdown conditions had been relaxed substantially across various sectors the chairman of SC should be directed to allow members to attend the meeting scheduled to be held at 2 pm physically and also sought setting aside of the two state government notifications as the need for VC meetings did not exist anymore. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC however submitted that the VC mode did not disallow any members from placing their say on the issues on the agenda and hence the claims of the petitioners were not maintainable. After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “The prevailing situation in Mumbai does not point to any imminent third wave of the pandemic. Schools and colleges have re-opened, and children are attending the schools and colleges physically. All the courts in the State of Maharashtra are functioning as in the pre-pandemic days…In such a situation, it defies logic as to why only a few of the Standing Committee members including its Chairman would be permitted to attend the meeting physically and the rest required to attend through the virtual platform. If any member of the Standing Committee wishes to participate in the meeting physically, he should be allowed to do so.” The court then directed the department of the state to take an appropriate decision within five days as to why physical meetings could not be conducted by the civic corporation and also directed the decision to be taken before the next SC meetings and disposed of the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-imminent-threat-of-third-covid-wave-allow-physical-meeting-of-civic-body-hc-to-maha-govt-101633455795561.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC audits 31,065 hospital bills, brings down Covid treatment cost by Rs20.81 crore||In the past 15 months, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has audited 31,065 private hospitals bills of Covid-19 patients amounting to ₹522 crore. After auditing, the civic body has managed to reduce an amount of ₹20.81 crore, of which ₹2.73 crore were reduced after inspecting 405 complaints of overcharging in 35 private hospitals . Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, several private hospitals have been accused of overcharging Covid-19 patients. HT in a series of articles has highlighted the plight of patients who were charged ₹1 lakh per day for their treatment in the first wave. After receiving several such complaints, the BMC appointed 70 auditors in June 2020 to audit medical bills. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said between June 2020 and August, almost 4% of the audited amount has been reduced from bills or refunded to patients. “We are auditing bills from 35 private hospitals with each having two auditors. Once the officers review the bills, they instruct the hospitals either to reduce the amount from the current bill amount or refund it to the patients,” said Kakani. In May 2020, the state capped Covid-19 treatment charges. According to a state government order, charges for a Covid-19 patient in the general isolation ward shouldn’t exceed ₹4,000 a day, the maximum charge for an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is capped at ₹7,500 a day, and for ventilators, it is ₹9,000 a day. Despite this, the patients have been complaining of inflated bills. On April 14, Sudhir Mishra, 51, a businessman was admitted to a private hospital in Andheri, after he was detected with Covid-19. When he was discharged on April 26, the hospital handed over a bill of ₹15 lakh. On May 12, he had to get admitted again when he developed mucormycosis also known as black fungus. “The fungus had spread in his mouth so the doctors had to remove his palate to stop it from spreading to his brain which would have killed him. Even after the surgery, he had to stay in the hospital for another 15 days as a precautionary measure. When he was discharged, we were given a bill of ₹22.5 lakh,” said Manisha Sudhir Mishra, 47, his wife. “Cumulatively, we had to pay over ₹37 lakh by selling our ancestral properties in our native town in Uttar Pradesh,” she said. They still have a debt of ₹12 lakh which they had to take from their family members. The auditors revealed they find several types of discrepancies in bills which add to the financial constraints of patients. For instance, when patients are admitted, tablets like aspirin, B-Complex, and paracetamol are included in the package. Despite this, they are again charged separately for the same medicines. Again, for a patient’s treatment, a hospital requires five personal protective equipment (PPE), including N-95 masks. But while billing, hospitals charge the patients extra for the masks. “If a hospital has given one drug to a patient, they are charged for the whole strip. While discharging, they do not even provide the remaining medicines to the patients. Also, a medical staff examines multiple patients wearing the same PPE, but patients are charged individually for the same PPE. Private hospitals use different creative ways to add up to the bills,” said an auditor who is responsible for a hospital in western suburbs. Also, the BMC has received 405 complaints of overcharging in the past 15 months worth ₹19crore. All complaints of patients have been found to be correct, as per the data of the civic body. “People can file a complaint before paying the bills or after it. There are no restrictions on it. Whenever we get any complaint of overcharging, our auditor inspects the bill within 48 hours,” said a senior health officer from BMC. Nearly 75% of Covid-19 patients who were treated at private hospitals in the state were overcharged, despite a price cap by the Maharashtra government, revealed a study conducted by Jan Arogya Abhiyan along with Maharashtra Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti. Talking to HT, Shakuntala Bhalerao of Jan Arogya Abhiyan said last week, “Introducing a price cap was a good step, but it was not implemented. We are calling upon the state to conduct a detailed audit and get the hospitals to return the overcharged amount to patients in one month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-audits-31-065-hospital-bills-brings-down-covid-treatment-cost-by-rs20-81-crore-101633453035472.html
06-10-2021||Patna||LJP factions get new names, symbols; Chirag group happy with ‘Paswan’ tag||Days after barring them from using the name of the Lok Janshakti Party or its symbol “bungalow”, the Election Commission of India (ECI) Tuesday allotted names and poll symbols to the two warring factions of the party, led by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan and union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras, respectively, as an interim measure ahead of the October 30 bypolls for two assembly seats in Bihar.The ECI, following a request from Jamaui MP Chirag Paswan, has given his faction the name of Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and the election symbol “helicopter” while the Paras faction has been allotted the name of Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party and “sewing machine” as its symbol, a statement from the poll panel said. Chirag had moved the ECI for an early settlement of the issue as his faction wanted to contest the bypolls for two assembly seats in Bihar, Tarapur in Munger district and Kusheshwarsthan in Darbhanga districts.The Chirag faction seems more than happy with the addition of his father and LJP founder later Ram Vilas Paswan’s name in the faction led by him. “We welcome the EC decision. It is a vindication of our claim that we are the real holder of Ram Vilas Paswan’s legacy. Some parties wanted to sabotage our election prospects, but truth has finally won,” said LJP (Chirag group) spokesperson Ashraf Ansari.“It’s a blessing in disguise,” said another leader who supports Chirag.Experts also agree. “Late Ram Vilas Paswan was a tall leader of Dalits and he still has a strong following, which was reflected during Chirag’s Aashirvad yatra. Union minister Pashupati Paras could not get the same response,” said Gyanendra Yadav,associate professor of sociology, College of Commerce, Patna.The LJP, which had won six seats in the Lok Sabha in 2019 parliamentary polls, split in June this year after five of the MPs rebelled against Chirag and approached the Lok Sabha Speaker to recognize Paras as LJP’s parliamentary party leader. The Speaker assented to their plea. Later, Paras was inducted in the union cabinet too.The LJP had contested the Bihar assembly election in 2020 alone and fielded candidates against chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party, the Janata Dal (United). Although LJP won just one seat, it’s believed to have caused serious damage to JD (U), which could win only 43 seats, its lowest tally since Kumar came to power in Bihar in 2005.Chirag has once again decided to field candidates from two assembly seats going to bypolls. Both were represented by JD (U).Meanwhile, Paras too welcomed the Election Commission’s decision of allotting his faction of the Lok Janshakti Party the name Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party. “I welcome the Election Commission’s decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ljp-factions-get-new-names-symbols-chirag-group-happy-with-paswan-tag-101633450756935.html
06-10-2021||Mumbai||Higher temperatures, thunderstorm likely this week in Mumbai||With the official southwest monsoon season having ended on September 30, temperatures in the city are on their way up, touching a maximum of 34.5°Celsius (C) for two consecutive days on October 4 and 5. This is two degrees higher than normal, after temperatures remained consistently at normal or below normal in the last week of September, according to the India Meteorological Department’s automatic weather station in Santacruz. The minimum temperature at night, too, remained 2 degrees above normal at 26°C on Tuesday. The city saw heavy thunder and lightning on Tuesday evening, between 7pm and 8pm, along with light to moderate rain in a few locations. IMD officials said the withdrawal of the monsoon over Mumbai and the rest of the Konkan coast is unlikely before October 15, and also warned that intensity of rain may also pick up briefly between October 10 and 11.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, daytime temperatures may rise to as much as 37°C by October 11 and night temperatures are expected to remain between 26-27°C. In October 2020, the city had experienced a maximum temperature of 35°C on the 10th, 28th and 29th of the month. The highest October temperature was recorded at 38.6°C in 2015.A meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai warned the weather is likely to get muggier in the next few days. “The temperature will rise by at least a couple of degrees while the city remains under a cloud cover due to delayed monsoon withdrawal, so the heat will remain trapped closer to the ground and the relative humidity levels will go up. There are chances of moderate thundershowers on Wednesday, and a thunderstorm with more intense rain may occur between Thursday and Friday. There are no signs of monsoon withdrawing from Maharashtra yet as the withdrawal is expected to only start from the northeast October 6 onward,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/higher-temperatures-thunderstorm-likely-this-week-in-mumbai-101633449975151.html
06-10-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC lifts cap on pilgrims to Char Dham shrines||Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday lifted the daily limit on the number of pilgrims who can visit Char Dham yatra following the state government’s plea that the limitation should be lifted as the Covid-19 cases have come down significantly in the state. On September 16, the court had lifted its June 28 stay on Char Dham yatra, paving way for the start of yatra from September 18 to the four revered Himalayan shrines with Covid-19 curbs and capping on the daily pilgrim numbers. The HC had limited the number of daily pilgrims to Char Dhams - 800 for Kedarnath, 1000 for Badrinath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. Dushyant Mainali, one of the petitioners, who is appearing in person in the case, said the counsel of the state government made two pleas before the court. “First that daily limitation on pilgrim influx to Char Dham shrines should be lifted and second is that mandatory registration for e-passes on the Char Dham Board portal should also be done away with. The court agreed on the first plea and lifted the daily limitation on the pilgrim numbers but declined to entertain the second plea, stressing that through registration, the government can keep a tap on the pilgrims,” he said. Mainali said the court also directed the state government to increase healthcare facilities on Char Dham routes and shrines. The case regarding Char Dham yatra is being heard by the HC in a bunch of PILs which have been filed by Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, Anu Pant and Rajendra Arya related to various issues regarding the fight against the Covid-19 epidemic in the state. The matter was heard on Tuesday by a division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Verma. The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board has so far issued over 69,600 e-passes to the devotees of other states as per the SOP. According to the Board officials, till Monday over 41,000 people have visited Char Dham shrines Kedarnath, along with Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. On June 28, the HC had stayed the cabinet decision of the Uttarakhand government to allow Char Dham yatra from July 1 for the locals of the three districts where the four revered Himalayan shrines are located. However, the state government approached the Supreme Court and filed a Special leave petition against the decision, which it later withdrew and again approached the court with a plea that Char Dham yatra should be allowed as Covid-19 cases had come down significantly. On June 20, the state government had announced the opening of Char Dham yatra in two phases- from July 1, for locals from three districts. Earlier on April 29, the state government had postponed Char Dham yatra, which was scheduled to start on May 14. Following the decision, only portals of these shrines were opened for ritual worship by the local priests. Portals of the Yamunotri shrine were opened on May 14 and that of Gangotri on May 15. The portals of the Kedarnath shrine were opened on May 17, while the portals of Badrinath were opened on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hc-lifts-limitation-on-daily-pilgrim-influx-to-char-dham-shrines-101633436055922.html
06-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police bust racket involved in pirating NCERT books||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they have arrested a 38-year-old man and busted his racket that was allegedly involved in printing pirated National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books for classes 6 to 12.“The poor quality pirated books were being supplied in the market at cheaper rates causing huge revenue loss to the NCERT. Such books are directly supplied to sellers for selling them as genuine ones. The sellers were offered a high-profit margin...,” said deputy police commissioner (crime) Rajesh Deo.Police said 5,000 pirated books, nearly 80,000 printed sheets of paper, from which 12,000 pirated books can be prepared, 166 metallic plates used for printing, two latest offset printing machines, and a large number of plain papers containing NCERT watermark were seized.Deo said the NCERT books have been in huge demand as the Union education ministry has made them mandatory for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliated schools. He added the move came amid allegations that schools were allegedly compelling students to purchase costly books of private publishers.“...Schools were allegedly getting hefty monetary benefits from the publishers in lieu of prescribing their books. Consequent to the government’s move, there was a sudden rise in demand for the NCERT books. Unscrupulous elements exploited the situation by getting pirated books printed...”Also Read: Delhi govt again sends file on doorstep delivery of ration to L-G for approvalThe crime branch was tasked to collect information regarding racketeers involved in such illegal practices.

A case of cheating, forgery, and under the Copyright Act was registered and raids were conducted to nab the alleged mastermind of the racket, Manoj Jain.“We arrested Jain on October 4 (Monday) and booked him in the case. He is the owner of the printing press that was raided and also owns a similar setup in East Nathu Colony in Shahdara. The Mandoli unit...suffered losses due to Covid-19.

06-10-2021||World||CIA admits China, Pakistan intelligence services hunting down informants: Report||Top US counterintelligence officials have warned CIA stations around the world about the “troubling” number of informants recruited from foreign countries to spy for America being killed, arrested or most likely compromised, according to a New York Times report citing an “unusual top secret cable”. The report claims that the cable has provided the specific number of informants who were executed by adversarial intelligence agencies in the last few years, highlighting the struggle they are facing in recruiting spies around the world.“In recent years, adversarial intelligence services in countries such as Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan have been hunting down the C.I.A.’s sources and in some cases turning them into double agents,” the NYT said in a report Tuesday.In the last two decades, the Central Intelligence Agency has heavily invested in countries like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan in its war against terrorism. They have also been reportedly focusing on improving intelligence collection in China and Russia and US policymakers demand more insight on adversarial powers. While the loss of informants isn’t a new problem for American intelligence agencies, the cable underscores the gravity of the situation, the report suggests.The use of artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and other sophisticated tools have made it easier for foreign governments to track US intelligence officers operating in their country, according to the report. The monitoring of the intelligence officers could easily lead them to the agents working for the CIA.In 2009, a CIA operation in Afghanistan went wrong when a Jordianian doctor blew himself up at a US military base in Khost, killing seven CIA officers and one Jordanian officer. The triple agent, Humam Khalil al Balawi, had tricked the CIA officers into believing that he would spy for them. The problem of placing “mission over security” by not paying enough attention to the potential counterintelligence risk has been highlighted in the cable, according to the NYT report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-admits-china-pakistan-intelligence-services-hunting-down-informants-report-101633541995519.html
06-10-2021||World||Canada to enforce Covid vaccine mandate for public staff from Oct 30: Justin Trudeau||In its first act after re-election, the new Canadian government headed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a vaccine mandate for public servants starting at the end of this month when it will also enforce a proof of Covid vaccination regimen for those seeking to travel by air, train or ship.These announcements at the first press conference held on Wednesday by Justin Trudeau after his Liberal Party returned to power with another minority mandate in the national elections last month. He was accompanied by deputy PM Chrystia Freeland as they addressed the media in Ottawa.Justin Trudeau said 80% of Canadians who had been vaccinated “don’t deserve to be slowed down in their desire to travel” as his government implements the vaccine passport system beginning on October 30. That will apply to all those planning to travel by plans and boarding will only be permitted with proof of Covid vaccination, and similar measures will be in place for those seeking to travel by trains and on ships for recreational purposes.These new rules will be in place for all those above 12 years of age since only those above that bracket are eligible to be jabbed. There will be some relaxation for those opting to get their vaccinations now and they will have to furnish a negative Covid-19 result but that leeway will expire by the end of November.Justin Trudeau said, “For the vast, vast majority of people, the rules are very simple - to travel, you’ve got to be vaccinated,” and added there will be only “a few extremely narrow exceptions, like a valid medical condition”.At the same time, the core public administration of the federal government, as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), will also be subject to the mandatory vaccine policy, covering 267,000 workers. They will have to provide their Covid vaccination status by the end of October and if they remain unvaccinated by mid-November, could face disciplinary action that could ultimately lead to termination.The Covid vaccine mandate was a major plank for the Liberals during the elections campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-enforce-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-public-staff-from-oct-30-justin-trudeau-101633539835550.html
06-10-2021||World||Whistle-blower fallout: Facebook spotlights tools that detect hate speech||New Delhi: As the fallout of the US Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection hearing following a whistle-blower’s complaints continues to be felt, social media giant Facebook has issued a statement in an attempt to clarify certain issues which former employee Frances Haugen raised in the complaint filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Facebook’s statement seeks to set the record straight on certain points raised in the whistleblower’s complaint, including the handling of hate speech, language classifiers or the lack of them and how hate speech against certain communities or religions continues to be the focus of enforcement as well as content policy updates. “We prohibit hate speech and content that incites violence. Over the years, we‘ve invested significantly in technology that proactively detects hate speech, even before people report it to us,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a statement shared with HT.According to internal documents submitted with Haugen’s complaint, it is believed that only 0.2% of the reported hate speech is taken down by automated checks which are in place to monitor content on the social media platform.Also Read: Facebook knows it is in trouble as Mark Zuckerberg picks his battlesThe latest clarification follows a lengthy statement by Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Executive Officer of Facebook, earlier in the day. In this, Zuckerberg asserted that the claim that the company put profits over safety is “just not true.”The whistle-blower’s complaints also raised the issue of language classifiers, which should be able to check for translations as well.Classifiers are automated systems and algorithms that are designed to detect hate speech in content in social media posts on Facebook. The complaint said Facebook’s internal records show how this problem of lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers meant much of the reported content, particularly the anti-Muslim narrative, was never dealt with or flagged by the systems either. Yet, Facebook insists that Bengali and Hindi are among the 40 languages globally which are compatible as classifiers with systems and algorithms that detect content that violates content guidelines. “We now use this technology to proactively detect violating content in Hindi and Bengali, alongside over 40 languages globally. As a result, we’ve reduced the prevalence of hate speech globally – meaning the amount of the content people actually see - on Facebook by almost 50% in the last three quarters and it’s now down to 0.05% of all content viewed,” said the Facebook spokesperson. The company also said they have a team of content reviewers covering 20 Indian languages, who manually monitor content on Facebook. In the complaint filed with the US SEC, the whistleblower also said: “RSS (Indian nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamswvak Sangh) Users, Groups, and Pages promote fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives targeted pro-Hindu populations with V&I (violence and inciting) intent….”. Facebook denied any laxity in enforcing guidelines to protect any religion or marginalised groups against hate speech.“As hate speech against marginalized groups, including Muslims, continues to be on the rise globally, we continue to make progress on enforcement and are committed to updating our policies as hate speech evolves online,” said Facebook.HT has reached out to the BJP and RSS for their comments. The copy will be updated once they respond.The social media network, however, has not clarified its stance on the whistle-blower complaints about Facebook’s handling of the issue of duplicate accounts. This is internally known as Suma, or Single User Multiple Accounts.Facebook has also not touched upon the revelations that highlight the categorization India gets alongside the US presidential elections as well as the elections in Brazil. In 2020, the “Top 3 Policy Priorities” for Facebook are referenced as, “Tier O includes Brazil, India, United States” while Tier 1 includes Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Italy.

Pakistan is a victim as well, but is going along in the interest of strategic ties with Beijing.“We don’t ask countries to choose between the United States and the PRC (the People’s Republic of China), but we do ask for a level-playing field. We do ask that countries understand that economic coercion is not the way forward to build a strong international economy and a global prosperity and peace and security,” Wendy Sherman said, joining the annual summit of the US-India Business Council, virtually from Delhi.Sherman’s remarks on China came in response to a question about US relationship with India and US relationship with China in the Indo-Pacific.With Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla also on the stage, Wendy Sherman said “democratic values are the bedrock of the US-India relationship”, which enjoys wide bipartisan support in both countries. The relationship is built on an international ruled-based order, as is America’s strong network of Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships. “Our partnership is essential to upholding that as we have a shared interest and we are major defence partners.”About the relationship with China, Wendy Sherman said that the US is “ready to compete and compete vigorously but we want a level-playing field … we’ll compete vigorously with China where we should and will cooperate with China where it’s in our interest to do so. We will challenge China where we must, where it undermines our interests, the interests of our partners and allies or threatens the rules-based international order.”She added: “I think we and India are like minded in that regard.”Wendy Sherman is the senior-most official of the Biden administration to visit China so far. India, on the other hand, has had two visits from top Biden cabinet officials - secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defence Lloyd Austin - and special presidential envoy on climate John Kerry and now Sherman.Shringla said India considers relations with the United States “of paramount importance” and not only for the sake of the two countries but also “in ensuring a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, and a peaceful and prosperous world”.Shringla spoke at length about the ongoing cooperation between the two sides on a whole range of issues and he pointed specifically to recent high-level engagements such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first in-person meeting with President Joe Biden for their first bilateral and then as part of the Quad. The prime minister also met US Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is of Indian descent.Harsh Vardhan Shringla also spoke on cooperation by the two sides on battling the Covid-19 pandemic - vaccine initiative launched by the Quad - and on climate change, stressing India’s determination to abide by its commitments under the Paris Accord and its ambitious agenda of creating 450 gigawatts of renewable sources of energy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-diplomat-wendy-sherman-ticks-off-china-from-india-101633537315547.html
06-10-2021||World||‘Historic day’: WHO recommends broad use of world's first malaria vaccine for children||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday recommended broad use of the world's first malaria vaccine for children, touting it as a breakthrough for “science, child health and malaria control.” The recommendation of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine is based on results from an ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, which began in 2019.Addressing a press briefing on malaria vaccine recommendations, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that tens of thousands of young lives could be saved every year by using the vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria.“This is a powerful new tool, but like Covid-19 vaccines, it’s not the only tool. Vaccination against malaria does not replace or reduce the need for other measures, including bednets, or seeking care for fever,” the WHO chief told the media briefing.Recalling his early career as a malaria researcher, Tedros said that he longed for the day that the world would have an effective vaccine against this "ancient and terrible disease.”"Today is that day; an historic day," he added.Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquito-borne disease causes fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Without prompt treatment, patients may develop severe complications and die. According to the UN health agency, children under the age of 5 are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria.Tedros noted that the world has made an "incredible progress" in the fight against the mosquito-borne disease in the past two decades but globally, the progress has stalled at an “unacceptably high level”, with over 200 million cases and 400,000 deaths every year.“Two-thirds of those deaths are children under five in Africa,” he said.According to a WHO estimate, nearly half of the world's population were at risk of the mosquito-borne disease in 2019, with most of the cases and deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-recommends-broad-use-of-world-s-first-malaria-vaccine-101633535951011.html

Anjum will head the spy agency which was earlier headed by lieutenant general Faiz Hameed. Hameed, who held the ISI chief post since 2019, was appointed as commander of the Peshawar Corps. Recently, his visit to Kabul raised questions over Pakistan's role in the Taliban cabinet.The ISI chief’s post is among the most influential and important posts in the Pakistan army, which is known to be calling the shots regarding the nation’s foreign and defence policies.Anjum belongs to the Punjab regiment of the Pakistan army, also served as commander of the Karachi corps as well as the commandant of the Command and Staff College Quetta.Anjum led several campaigns against elements which were threatening Pakistan in the Balochistan region and is considered a ‘battle-hardened soldier’. He served as the inspector general of the Frontier Corps Balochistan.His subordinates call him a “man with glacier brain but sharp reflexes”, news agency PTI reported. Anjum is known to be a good listener who speaks concisely. According to a news report by Pakistani news media Tribune, Anjum also held command postings in the eastern border of Pakistan i.e. the Line of Control. He graduated from the Royal College of Defense Studies in the UK and also holds a degree from the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies, Honolulu.Outgoing Hameed’s transfer to the Peshawar Corps is being seen as a crucial move following the Taliban takeover of the Afghanistan government. Hameed, before taking on the role of the spy chief, also served ISI as its head of internal security.Hameed was also among the first to conduct an official visit to Afghanistan following its fall to the Taliban. He met the Taliban leaders ahead of them announcing the government and also assured the world that ‘everything will be alright’ in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-lieutenant-general-nadeem-anjum-replacing-faiz-hameed-as-new-isi-chief-101633532138670.html
06-10-2021||World||Tensions flare as Chinese flights near Taiwan intensify||With record numbers of military flights near Taiwan over the last week, China has been showing a new intensity and military sophistication as it steps up its harassment of the island it claims as its own and asserts its territorial ambitions in the region.China's People's Liberation Army flew 56 planes off the southwest coast of Taiwan on Monday, setting a new record and capping four days of sustained pressure involving 149 flights — all in international airspace but prompting Taiwanese defense forces to scramble in response and raising fears that any misstep could provoke an unintended escalation.The sorties came as China, with growing diplomatic and military power, faces greater pushback from countries in the region and an increasing naval presence from the United States and other Western democracies in the Indo-Pacific as Taiwan pleads for more global support and recognition.The US called China's latest actions “risky” and “destabilizing,” while China responded that the US selling weapons to Taiwan and its ships navigating the Taiwan Strait were provocative.At the same time as the flights, the U.S. stepped up naval maneuvers in the Indo-Pacific with its allies, challenging Beijing's territorial claims in critical waterways.Taiwanese Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told legislators Wednesday that the situation “is the most severe in the 40 years since I’ve enlisted.”While most agree that war is not imminent, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen warned that more is at stake if Beijing makes good on past threats to seize the island by force if necessary.“If Taiwan were to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace and the democratic alliance system,” she wrote in an impassioned op-ed in Foreign Affairs magazine published Tuesday. “It would signal that in today’s global contest of values, authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy.”China regularly flies military aircraft into Taiwan's “air defense identification zone,” international airspace that Taiwan counts as a buffer in its defense strategy, although previous flights have usually involved a handful of planes at most.Perhaps more significant than the number of planes was the constitution of the group, with fighters, bombers and airborne early warning aircraft, said Euan Graham, a defense analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore.“That's the level of sophistication — it looks like a strike package, and that's part of the step up in pressure,” he said. “This is not a couple of fighters coming close and then going straight back after putting one wing across the median; this is a much more purposeful maneuver.”Controlling Taiwan and its airspace is key to China's military strategy, with the area where the most recent sorties took place also leading to the west Pacific and the South China Sea.The latest maneuvers bring the total number of flights to more than 815 as of Monday since the Taiwanese government started publicly releasing the numbers a little more than a year ago.China has been rapidly improving and strengthening its military, and the most recent flights demonstrate a greater level of technical expertise and power, said Chen-Yi Tu, a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan.It's a marked contrast from 20, 30 years ago, when Chinese forces couldn't refuel in the air, or fly across the water, said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University and non-resident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.“I think China is trying to remind the U.S. and Taiwan that this is not then, that they have options,” she said. “They can do what they want, that they won’t be deterred.”At the same time, many democracies have been increasingly vocal in their support of Taiwan and have stepped up naval operations in the area.As China was conducting its most recent flights, 17 ships from six navies — the U.S., Britain, Japan, Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand — including three aircraft carriers and a Japanese helicopter carrier — carried out joint maneuvers off the Japanese island of Okinawa, northeast of Taiwan, meant to show their commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”A few days earlier, the British frigate HMS Richmond transited through the Taiwan Strait, announcing its presence on Twitter and angering China, which condemned the move as a “meaningless display of presence with an insidious intention.”The international actions are an attempt to counter China's frequent claim that its own actions are in response to American moves, and demonstrate that democracies intend to defend established maritime laws and norms, Graham said.“When the U.K. sends a ship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time since 2008 and it sailed down the median line, the point that it's making is that they know China knows where that line is,” he said. “In order for the status quo to be meaningful, it has to be upheld and the most emphatic way to do that is to physically demonstrate with a government asset like a warship.”Australia, which also spoke out against China's recent flights, last month announced a deal with the U.S. and Britain to obtain nuclear-powered submarines, which was seen as a strong statement it planned to play a greater role.And Japan, which has long been cautious with its relations with China, a key trading partner, now considers the country a security threat amid Beijing’s increasingly assertive activity in the regional seas and around the Taiwan Strait. New Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said dialogue with China is important but Japan should also team up with like-minded democracies and step up its security alliance with the U.S. and other partners while Tokyo also strengthens its defense capabilities.“We are seeing a slow emergence of some sort of coalition of democracies in the region that are trying to come together to build some sort of mechanism to respond to Chinese behavior in the region,” said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, D.C.Under longstanding policy, the United States provides political and military support for Taiwan, but does not explicitly promise to defend it from a Chinese attack.Still, as the U.S. increases its military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese response has been to increase its own, said Yue Gang, a retired Chinese army colonel and Beijing-based military commentator.“The Biden administration has been increasing military deterrence against China, not only by dispatching many warships and warplanes, but also showcasing its allies,” he said. “One of the possibilities is that the mainland hopes to send a signal it will not be misjudged as weak.”The Chinese flights into the Taiwanese defense buffer zone have forced Taiwan to scramble its own aircraft and anti-aircraft missile batteries, wearing down their readiness and reducing their capabilities, Yue said.“Every time a warplane takes off, the engine life is reduced to some extent,” he said.In addition to keeping Taiwan on edge, the sorties also help the Chinese pilots keep their edge, and could eventually help give them an element of surprise “if the scenario is to eventually use hard power to resolve their unification claim over Taiwan,” Graham said.“It's hard to know if exercise 39 or exercise 57 is the one that isn't an exercise,” he said.For the moment, however, most agree that is not the immediate goal.“It’s more signaling and psychological warfare and a warning to the U.S. to not be so close to Taiwan,” Mastro said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-as-chinese-flights-near-taiwan-intensify-101633524793053.html

The firm’s Henley Passport Index has ranked all passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa. The index, however, doesn’t take into account the temporary travel restrictions imposed by the countries due to Covid-19.Japan and Singapore are at the top of the Henley Passport Index with both countries having a visa-free score of 192, which means holders of passports of these two countries can travel to 192 countries without a prior visa. Passports of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Yemen are among the least powerful. Indian passports are ranked 90, along with Burkina Faso and Tajikistan, as the passport holders of these three countries can access 58 countries without a prior visa.Here’s the top 10 ranking of world’s most powerful passports:1. Japan, Singapore (visa-free score - 192)2. Germany, South Korea (visa-free score - 190)3. Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain (visa-free score - 189)4. Austria, Denmark (visa-free score - 188)5.

06-10-2021||World||EU alarmed as soaring energy prices threaten recovery||The European Union sounded the alarm on the potential of soaring energy prices to undermine the bloc’s economy, and pledged new guidance for member states struggling to contain the crisis.The EU didn’t respond directly to respond to nations’ demands for action, and instead vowed to set out recommendations for member states next week on the measures they can take without undermining EU rules. They will include compensation for the most vulnerable households, tax cuts and state aid for companies, EU energy chief Kadri Simson said Wednesday. “This price shock cannot be underestimated,” Simson told members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg during a debate on the crisis. “It is hurting our citizens and in particular the most vulnerable households, weakening competitiveness and adding to inflationary pressure. If left unchecked, it risks compromising Europe’s recovery as it takes hold.”To boost its resilience to market shocks in the longer term, the EU plans to strengthen rules on gas storage and energy supply security. Gas and power prices are soaring to all-time highs across the 27-nation bloc as rebounding demand coincides with limited gas imports from Russia and Norway. Analysts expect energy costs to keep rising in the coming months as Europe moves into the heating season.The surge in prices comes as the EU started enacting sweeping reform to reduce emissions. Under the Green Deal, the bloc wants to clean up every sector, boosting the price on carbon, banning new combustion-engine cars from 2035 and putting its farming on a more sustainable path. The overarching goal is to reach climate neutrality by 2050.With the crisis raising electricity bills across Europe, the challenge for politicians is to ensure that citizens don’t turn their backs on the green transformation, which carries its own costs. The EU’s planned shift away from dirty fossil fuels to renewables is the only lasting solution to the region’s energy challenge, Simson told lawmakers, adding that soaring prices have little to do with climate policies.Divisions among leaders over how to tackle the energy crunch were on display as they gathered for the second day of a summit on the wooded Brdo estate in Slovenia. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban seized the opportunity of his arrival to express his frustration and slam the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. Orban blamed spiking prices on the EU’s ambitious climate plan, saying it was “indirect taxation” on car and home owners. His Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte said last night that the high energy prices had only a “limited” connection to the energy transition.Coordinated ResponseTo alleviate the impact of the crisis, the EU must respond with coordinated action, leveraging the strength of its single market and boosting future resilience, according to the bloc’s energy chief.  “Providing targeted support to consumers, direct payments to those most at risk of energy poverty, cutting energy taxes, shifting charges to general taxation, are all measures that can be taken very swiftly, under EU rules,” Simson said. “Business and in particular SMEs can be given relief through state aid, or by facilitating longer-term power purchase agreements.”Europe also needs to ensure that its energy markets work in a fair and transparent manner, she told lawmakers, flagging the role of competition authorities and national regulations in surveillance and preventing abuse. Some lawmakers and national governments have called on the Commission to investigate the role of Russian exporter Gazprom PJSC in the price spike, suspecting market manipulation. “We have to make sure that no state or non-state actor, be it Russian Federation, Gazprom, or anyone else manipulates or influences European energy prices,” said Siegfried Muresan, a lawmaker representing the European People’s Party, the biggest political group in the EU Parliament. “If this occurs then we have to take measures, then sanctions are obviously unavoidable against such entities, be it private companies or not.”The crisis was caused by a mix of ingredients, including increased demand, lower supply and weaker renewable energy production in some regions due to less wind, according to the commissioner. Russian Supply“While long-term contracts from Russia are respected, no extra capacity was booked, despite the rising prices, exacerbating the tight balance,” she said.By the end of this year, Simson wants to propose a reform of the gas market, reviewing rules on storage and security of supply. The commission is also analyzing a proposal by member states including Spain and France to create a joint platform for purchasing emergency gas reserves. The underground gas storage level is currently above 75% across Europe, lower than 10-year average but adequate to cover the winter season requirements, according to Simson. The evolution during the cold months will be a key variable to watch closely, she said. “This price shock is an unexpected crisis, at a critical juncture,” she told the lawmakers. “We must respond together and stay the course towards a cleaner, more secure and more affordable energy future.”(Updates with comments from EU leaders in seventh paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-alarmed-as-soaring-energy-prices-threaten-recovery-101633526352266.html

US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman told a small group of reporters after her meetings with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval that a final decision on possible sanctions on the S-400 deal will be made by President Joe Biden and secretary of state Antony Blinken. “We’ve been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest,” she said. “That said, we have a strong partnership with India. We want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems and I hope we will be able to in this instance as well,” Sherman added. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the US side raised the S-400 deal during the discussions on Wednesday and there was a feeling on both sides that there was a need for further talks on the issue to reach some sort of common ground. Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev had said last month that his country is expected to deliver the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion deal by October. There were no issues with the timeline for delivery of the systems, he had said. Indian Air Force chief, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhry, also told reporters on Tuesday that the first batch of S-400 systems is expected to arrive within this year.Sherman’s remarks about resolving differences over the S-400 deal reflected a softening of the US position. The previous Trump administration had threatened to slap sanctions on the deal under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The US has already imposed secondary sanctions under CAATSA on China and Turkey for military deals with Russia. The Indian side has said it is determined to go ahead with the S-400 deal in view of its national security interests and plans to create an air defence shield for key cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/final-call-on-sanctions-on-s-400-deal-to-be-taken-by-prez-biden-blinken-us-dy-secretary-of-state-101633527353878.html

The fatalities were roughly similar to the weekly death toll in the previous week.The WHO also noted that all the regions across the world reported a decline in cases except Europe, where the numbers of cases this week were almost similar to the corresponding previous week.According to the data, the largest decline in cases was in the African region, where the infection fell by about 43%. Middle East and Southeast Asia logged a dip in their Covid-19 cases by about 20%.In the Americas and the Western Pacific there was nearly decline of 12% in the cases of infections.Countries around the world reported a surge in daily Covid-19 cases earlier this year. During the surge, daily cases soared above record levels as the surge was mainly led by the Delta variant of Covid-19, a highly contagious mutation of the virus.In India as well, the infection rate had risen exponentially, bringing the healthcare system to its knees. However, the number has gone down and is declining steadily.On Wednesday, the country registered 18,833 new cases in the last 24 hours. At present, active infections account for less than 1% of total cases and currently stands at 0.73%, the lowest since March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-fall-globally-except-europe-africa-records-largest-decline-who-101633523583628.html

Last year, the prize went to Emmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer A. Doudna of the United States for developing a gene-editing tool that has revolutionized science by providing a way to alter DNA.The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1.14 million). The prize money comes from a bequest left by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895.On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize in physiology or medicine to Americans David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries into how the human body perceives temperature and touch.The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded Tuesday to three scientists whose work found order in seeming disorder, helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature, including expanding our understanding of climate change.Over the coming days prizes will also be awarded for outstanding work in the fields of literature, peace and economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-for-chemistry-2021-benjamin-list-david-macmillan-declared-winners-101633514097815.html

In fact, Sirajuddin Haqqani - a global terrorist - heads Afghanistan's interior ministry.It is widely believed that Mullah Omar, the one-eyed founder of the Taliban, was radicalised in Darul Uloom Haqqania in Pakistan's Khyber-Paktunkhwa province, from which the Haqqani network derives its name.The Haqqani network is a jihad group incorporated in Pakistan with two of its members, Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of Taliban, and Khalil Haqqani, the Taliban emissary, carrying USD 15 million in reward on their head. The group is linked to some of the most brazen attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leader-anas-haqqani-praises-ghaznavi-who-attacked-somnath-temple-101633502816224.html

The Taliban leader was forced to issue an audio statement on September 13 to dispel reports about his death at the hands of Haqqani rivals. Baradar is said to have brought his own security and refused to take official security from the Interior Ministry despite the latter insisting that it was their job to provide personal security to the deputy PM.While Baradar is now understood to be living in Kabul Palace, his backer and defence minister Mullah Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, is still in Kandahar. Sirajuddin Haqqani still stays in shadows and remains off and on in Kabul with his relatives, Anas and Khalil Haqqani, wielding the Haqqani network’s gun power in the regime.According to Kabul watchers, with the arrival of Baradar, co-founder of Taliban, there will be escalation of tension within the government as the Yaqoob faction is a power rival to the ISI backed Haqqani faction with each Taliban leader on a solo political ambition. The same is the case with Afghan opposition to the Taliban with each leader ploughing a lone furrow and not willing to work together.Given the level of mistrust between the Taliban leaders, there is hardly any one for governance in the Sunni Pashtun Islamist set-up. With even pro-Taliban countries like China, Qatar, Pakistan, and Turkey still to recognize the terror regime with umbilical links with al Qaida, the Islamist regime has gone back to its brutal medieval ways by hanging so-called criminals from earth diggers and heavy-duty cranes in Herat province. These practices are like their brutal and repressive tactics during 1996-2001 period when Taliban under Mullah Omar held Kabul to AK-47 with medieval Islamic floggings the rule of the day.While Pakistan is trying to extract its pound of flesh by getting the Taliban to bring its cousin, Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan, on the negotiating table for a ceasefire, the west is embarrassed at its poor assessment of a so called moderate Taliban.India, on its part, is waiting for those involved in the Doha peace process to make the first move or else be held responsible for the frightening human rights situation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mullah-baradar-returns-to-kabul-refuses-official-security-from-haqqani-101633497107195.html

Defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said the situation was “the most serious” in more than 40 years since he joined the military, adding there was a risk of a “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait.“For me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,” Reuters quoted him telling a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.The committee is reviewing a special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for home-made weapons including missiles and warships, Reuters reported.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying blamed the US for the heightened tension, lashing out at US state department spokesperson Ned Price’s statement in which he said that the US was very concerned by China’s provocative military activity near Taiwan.“Taiwan belongs to China and the US is in no position to make irresponsible remarks. The relevant remarks by the US side seriously violate the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiqués and send an extremely wrong and irresponsible signal,” Hua said.“For quite some time, the US has been making negative moves by selling arms to Taiwan and strengthening official and military ties with Taiwan, including the launch of a $750 million arms sale plan to Taiwan, the landing of US military aircraft in Taiwan and frequent sailing of US warships across the Taiwan Strait,” she said.“These provocative moves undermine China-US relations and regional peace and stability. China is firmly opposed to them and has taken necessary countermeasures,” Hua Chunying added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-us-diplomats-to-meet-amid-heightened-tension-over-taiwan-101633496135938.html
06-10-2021||World||In Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, bodies of criminals hanged from excavators: Report||In a fresh set of shocking images that have emerged from Afghanistan, three men were hanged from excavators in the western province of Herat. The images were carried by The Sun, which said in a report that the men were accused of indulging in kidnapping.The tabloid quoted deputy governor Mawlawi Shir Ahmad Muhajir to report that the three men were killed after entering a man's home to rob him.The Sun report also said in its report that locals were seen clicking photos of the bodies hanging by their necks in Obe district of Herat in full public view.In the past week, the Taliban have arrested 85 alleged criminals, some accused of petty crimes, and others of murder, kidnapping and robbery, said Noor Ahmad Rabbani of the group's anti-crime department.On at least two occasions in Kabul, petty thieves were paraded around the streets to shame them, handcuffed, with their faces painted or with stale bread stuffed in their mouths.Since the Taliban takeover, many Afghans fear harsh punishments to return, in accordance with the hardline ideology the group practices. During their last time in power in the late 1990s, the Taliban imposed their harsh interpretation of Islamic law.That included punishments like the hand amputations, executions of murderers with a single bullet to the head, most often by a relative of the murder victim and all carried out in public. Religious police beat men for trimming their beards or for not attending prayers.Gun-toting Taliban have taken up positions at checkpoints across Kabul and gradually some have been made to wear uniforms - the beginnings of a new national security force, reported news agency AP, quoting officials.For many Kabul residents the sight of the fighters is frightening as they roam the streets freely, with their signature long hair, traditional dress and Kalashnikov rifles hanging by their sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-taliban-controlled-afghanistan-bodies-of-criminals-hanged-from-excavators-101633493926824.html
06-10-2021||World||From deputies to commanders, who are the new additions in Taliban all-male cabinet?||The Taliban doubled down on their hard-line trajectory Monday in the third round of Afghanistan government appointments that encompassed a host of men named to deputy positions, a spokesman said. None of the 38 new appointments announced by chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid included women. They were comprised of members drawn entirely from the Taliban with little representation of minority groups. Also included were postings to humanitarian organisations.The appointments are the latest indication the Taliban government has no intention of heeding conditions from the international community that formal recognition of their rule would depend on their treatment of women and minority groups.Still, the Taliban seek international support as they grapple with the daunting challenges of an economy on the brink of collapse, drought, and a growing security threat from the Islamic State group.Among the new appointments was a political deputy for the prime minister, deputy ministers, and deputy head of the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Most of the positions consisted of army and defense ministry commanders and deputies across Afghanistan's provinces including Kabul, Helmand, Herat, and Kandahar.Since the militant group took control of Afghanistan in a blitz campaign in mid-August, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have paused disbursements to Kabul. The US froze billions of dollars in assets held in US accounts by the Afghan Central Bank.Foreign aid previously accounted for nearly 75 per cent of Afghanistan's public expenditure, according to a World Bank report. Without those funds, the Taliban are unable to pay public sector salaries, precipitating a spiraling economic crisis.The Taliban have described their appointments as part of an interim government but have not elaborated on whether there will be elections. In late September, Mujahid had held out the possibility of adding women to the Cabinet at a later time but provided no more details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-deputies-to-commanders-who-are-the-new-additions-in-taliban-cabinet-101633491295519.html

Taiwan's defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng, faced with a lawmaker's question in the country's parliament on Wednesday, said military tensions with China are at their worst in more than 40 years – certainly the “most serious” since he joined the military. He noted that there was an added risk of “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait; and that while China already has the required arsenal to take Taiwan by force, the cost of a “full scale” war for Beijing might be at its lowest by 2025, when a potential invasion seems likely.Also Read | Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-Pacific“For me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,” news agency Reuters quoted the Taiwan defence minister as saying at parliament. “By 2025, China will bring the cost and attrition to its lowest. It has the capacity now, but it will not start a war easily, having to take many other things into consideration.”Chiu Kuo-cheng, the defence minister, was answering a Taiwanese parliamentary committee reviewing special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for homemade weapons including missiles and warships.Taiwan's special military spending over the next five years will go mostly toward naval weapons including anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems. Taiwan is especially concerned by the recent advances made by China over the past several days when record numbers of Chinese military aircraft repeatedly flew over Taiwan's air defence identification zone.Over a four day period beginning last Friday, Taiwan reported close to 150 Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing's continued harassment of the island.Also Read | Taiwan warns against Chinese provocationsChina claims the democratic island of Taiwan as its own territory and says it should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan resists, saying it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy in the face of China's aggression.The United States, Taiwan's main military supplier, has confirmed its “rock-solid” commitment to Taiwan and also criticised China. Beijing blames Washington's policies of supporting Taiwan with arms sales and sending warships through the Taiwan Strait for raising tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-china-could-launch-full-scale-invasion-by-2025-tensions-aggravate-101633488872865.html

A former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen, 37, revealed her identity as she testified before US lawmakers saying that the social media giant fuels division, harms children and needs to be regulated. Zuckerberg’s statement comes a day after the company faced a more than six-hour-long blackout across platforms due to a “faulty configuration change”. Services on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were affected in one of the longest outages the company ever faced."The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical," Zuckerberg posted a note to Facebook employees on his account."I don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. The moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction,” he added.Haugen appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night where she described how Facebook routinely made “disastrous” choices that put their business interests ahead of children, public safety, privacy and even democracy.“I used to work at Facebook. I joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us. But I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy,” Frances Haugen said in her testimony at the hearing of the subcommittee on consumer protection, product safety, and data security.“Facebook over and over again chose to optimise for its own interests like making more money,” she told “60 Minutes”, as quoted by Bloomberg.“When it comes to young people’s health or well-being, every negative experience matters. We have worked for years on industry-leading efforts to help people in these moments and I’m proud of the work we’ve done,” Zuckerberg contested.Last month, Wall Street Journal published internal Facebook research, provided by Haugen, that claimed Instagram made some mental health issues worse for teenagers on the platform. The company, which was developing a version of Instagram for children, has put that project on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-not-true-zuckerberg-denies-claims-of-facebook-prioritising-profit-over-safety-101633487954105.html
06-10-2021||World||US reveals nuclear bomb numbers for 1st time in 4 years after Trump blackout||The US State Department published on Tuesday the number of nuclear warheads the country stockpiles for the first time in four years, after former president Donald Trump placed a blackout on the data.As of September 30, 2020, the US military maintained 3,750 active and inactive nuclear warheads, down by 55 from a year earlier and by 72 from the same date in 2017.The figure was also the lowest level since the US nuclear stockpile peaked at the height of the Cold War with Russia in 1967, when the total was 31,255 warheads.The numbers were released Tuesday amid an effort by the administration of President Joe Biden to restart arms controls talks with Russia after they stalled under Trump."Increasing the transparency of states' nuclear stockpiles is important to nonproliferation and disarmament efforts," the State Department said in a statement.Trump, who pulled the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia, also left another crucial pact, the New Start Treaty on the rocks last year before its scheduled expiration on February 5.New Start caps the number of nuclear warheads held by Washington and Moscow, and letting it expire could have sparked a reversal of warhead reductions on both sides.Trump said he wanted a new deal that includes China, which only has a fraction of the warheads that the United States and Russia have.Biden, who came in to office on January 20, immediately proposed a five-year extension to New Start, which Russian President Vladimir Putin quickly agreed to.The deal caps at 1,550 the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed by Moscow and Washington.Last week Russian and US diplomats held talks behind closed doors in Geneva to begin discussions on a successor to New Start and also controls on conventional weapons.A US official called the talks "productive," but both sides said the mere fact of holding the talks was positive.According to a January 2021 tally by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which includes retired warheads -- not counted in the State Department's numbers -- the United States had 5,550 warheads, compared to 6,255 in Russia, 350 in China, 225 in Britain, and 290 in France.India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea have together around 460 nuclear warheads, according to the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reveals-nuclear-bomb-numbers-for-1st-time-in-4-years-after-trump-blackout-101633482864160.html

Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by China, which views the self-ruled democratic island as its territory to be retaken one day, by force if necessary.Tsai warned a failure to defend Taiwan would be “catastrophic” for both the island and the wider region in an article she wrote for Foreign Affairs published on Tuesday.“They should remember that if Taiwan were to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace and the democratic alliance system,” Tsai said.“It would signal that in today’s global contest of values, authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy.” Taiwan hopes for peaceful coexistence with China, she said, but “if its democracy and way of life are threatened, Taiwan will do whatever it takes to defend itself”.Tsai’s government on Monday urged Beijing to stop “irresponsible provocative actions” after a record 56 Chinese jets including nuclear-capable bombers crossed into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. Taiwan has reported 148 Chinese air force planes in the southern and southwestern part of its air defence zone over a four day period beginning on Friday, the same day China marked a key patriotic holiday, National Day.“Amid almost daily intrusions by the People’s Liberation Army, our position on cross-strait relations remains constant: Taiwan will not bend to pressure,” Tsai added.Premier Su Tseng-chang said in Taipei that, “Taiwan must be on alert. China is more and more over the top,” adding that “The world has also seen China’s repeated violations of regional peace and pressure on Taiwan.”Its defence ministry said Taiwan’s extra military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) over the next five years will go mostly towards naval weapons, including missiles and warships, warning that the threat from China was worse than ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-warns-against-chinese-provocations-101633479915682.html

The movie’s plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by Roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save a cosmonaut.Shkaplerov and two other Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS are said to have cameo roles in the film.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the mission will help showcase Russia’s space prowess. “Such missions that help advertise our achievements and space exploration in general are great for the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-crew-arrive-at-international-space-station-to-shoot-first-film-in-orbit-101633479604265.html

Telegram, which also offers WhatsApp like instant messaging service, said on Tuesday that it gained more than 70 million new users during Monday's Facebook outage."The daily growth rate of Telegram exceeded the norm by an order of magnitude, and we welcomed over 70 million refugees from other platforms in one day," Telegram founder Pavel Durov wrote on his Telegram channel.Users were unable to access the messaging services of Facebook for six hours. Facebook blamed its outage, which impacted 3.5 billion users, to a faulty configuration change. The company added that it had "no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime.""We apologize to all those affected, and we’re working to understand more about what happened today so we can continue to make our infrastructure more resilient," Facebook Vice President Infrastructure Santosh Janardhan said in a statement on Monday.According to The Wall Street Journal, the outage also caused widespread disruptions to Facebook’s internal communication tools, including some voice calls and work apps used for calendar appointments and other functions, according to people familiar with the matter.Telegram had earlier said on Twitter that users of its messenger in some regions, amid large-scale outages on Facebook, may experience problems loading chats and receiving notifications, but the service will work for the majority of the users.Downdetector, a site that monitors reports of outages across the internet, said the Facebook service outage is the largest it has ever seen.The US-led the world in the number of reports for disrupted service of more than 1.7 million, followed by Germany at 1.3 million reports and the Netherlands at 9,15,000 reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/telegram-says-gained-over-70-million-new-users-during-facebook-outage-101633478816879.html

The wave fuelled by the Delta variant is waning in the US, but daily infections are still hovering near 100,000 and more than 1,800 people are dying every day, on average.The US has the world’s highest death count at more than 703,000, of which 351,985 were recorded in 2020, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. The toll for 2021 has crossed 351,000 as of Tuesday morning.More than a 100,000 Americans succumbed to the virus in the last four months - a time when safe and effective vaccines were widely available in the nation.Meanwhile, coronavirus deaths in Russia hit a record for the third time this month on Tuesday, and new infections once again exceeded 25,000 a day. Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 25,110 new confirmed cases on Tuesday and 895 new deaths - the country’s highest daily death toll in the pandemic.This month, records in fatalities came every other day: the previous record, of 890 deaths, was registered on Sunday, and the one before that, of 887 deaths, occurred on Friday.New Zealand said on Tuesday that it will start using vaccine certificates as proof of inoculation at large events and other high-risk settings from next month, as the country battles the spread of the Delta variant.Pfizer effectiveness fallsThe effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in preventing infection by the coronavirus dropped to 47% from 88% six months after the second dose, according to data published on Monday in the Lancet medical journal.The analysis showed that the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing hospitalisation and death remained high at 90% for at least six months.New York State’s largest health care provider, Northwell Health, has fired 1,400 employees who refused to get Covid-19 vaccinations.

06-10-2021||World||Facebook made ‘disastrous’ choices: Whistleblower Frances Haugen to US lawmakers||Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, on Tuesday told US lawmakers that the social media giant has made “disastrous” choices with regards to children, public safety, privacy and democracy and that the company needs “help” as it cannot fix these problems on its own.Asked specifically what needs to be done, Frances Haugen, who was a product manager with Facebook and handled democracy and misinformation issues, and on counterespionage as part of the civic misinformation team, suggested changes in a section of a 1996 law that protects online platforms from liability of their content to make Facebook reveal its decisions on algorithms and setting up a “dedicated oversight body”.“I used to work at Facebook. I joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us. But I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy,” Frances Haugen said in her testimony at a hearing of the subcommittee on consumer protection, product safety, and data security. “The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes as they put their astronomical profits before people.”“Congressional action is needed. They won’t solve this crisis without your help,” she added.In response to a question about her work on counterespionage, Haugen said, “I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today.” Frances Haugen said the company was unable to investigate all the cases they detected because of understaffing.Frances Haugen left the company with thousands of documents on internal research that showed Facebook prioritised profits over safety as it pushed user engagement, by amplifying misinformation and hate-speech. She gave these documents to The Wall Street Journal, US Congress and regulators. In an interview to CBS 60 Minutes, she had said, the social media company prioritised “growth over safety”.“I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are. However, the choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children or our public safety, or our privacy and for our democracy. And that is why we must demand Facebook make changes,” Frances Haugen told lawmakers in her opening remarks.“The documents I have provided to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about its own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages,” she said.When asked what she would want Congress to do, Frances Haugen had two specific suggestions. One, reform Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act of 1996, which grants immunity from liability to online platforms for their content. But, she said, the reform must make Facebook reveal its “decisions about algorithms … Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritise growth, and virality and reactiveness over public safety”. And, two, there needs to be a “dedicated oversight body, because right now the only people in the world who are trained to analyse these experiments to understand what’s happening inside of Facebook are people who, you know, grew up inside of Facebook or Pinterest or another social media company”.There has been bipartisan concern in US Congress over big tech’s growing reach and influence, specially Facebook. The same subcommittee had a Facebook official over for a hearing last week. “Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children. And it’s not just that they made money, again, it’s that they value their profit more than the pain that they cause the children and their families,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, in his opening remarks, while whistleblower Frances Haugen nodded along. “Facebook exploited teens using powerful how algorithms and amplified their insecurities.”Senator Marsha Blackburn, the top Republican on the subcommittee, said, “Having seen the data that you’ve presented and the other studies that Facebook did not publicly share, I feel pretty confident that it is Facebook who has done the misrepresenting.”She added, “Here is what else we know - Facebook is not interested in making significant changes to improve kids’ safety on their platforms, at least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on posts or decreasing their ad revenues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-made-disastrous-choices-whistleblower-frances-haugen-to-us-lawmakers-101633452015500.html
06-10-2021||World||Not Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar could be the first to recognise Taliban cabinet||Pakistan and Qatar are jockeying for influence in Afghanistan and appear to be working towards recognising the Taliban setup in Kabul amid persisting security concerns within the world community, people familiar with developments said.Turkey, which has emerged as a key player in Afghanistan and played an important part in restoring operations at the Kabul airport, however, has linked any larger role in the war-torn country to the formation of an inclusive government by the Taliban.The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan and Qatar could well become the first two countries to recognise the Taliban’s interim cabinet. Both countries sent top leaders to Afghanistan following reports of differences within the Taliban ranks over the division of responsibilities and power-sharing.Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the chief of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, rushed to Afghanistan in early September, shortly after the first reports of differences within the Taliban leadership over the formation of a governing setup. Qatar’s foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani visited Kabul about a week later, and held talks with top Taliban leaders, including Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund.Lt Gen Hameed played a key role in helping put together the interim setup in Kabul, in which most of the important positions were given to hardliners from the Haqqani Network and the Kandahar faction of the Taliban, the people said. The move also led to the sidelining of Taliban leaders perceived as more moderate and outside the scope of Pakistan’s influence, such as Abdul Ghani Baradar.Both Pakistan and Qatar have also been lobbying the world community to engage with the Taliban. In a recent interview with Al-Jazeera, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the international community has to engage with the “new reality” in Kabul and unfreeze Afghanistan’s assets so that country can deal with a humanitarian crisis.Qatar’s emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, during his address to the UN General Assembly last month, too urged world leaders to engage with the Taliban. He stressed the “necessity of continuing dialogue with Taliban because boycott only leads to polarisation and reactions, whereas dialogue could bring in positive results”.A diplomat from a regional country, who declined to be named, said: “These are clear signs that Pakistan and Qatar are pressing others to take steps that will help their efforts to recognise the Taliban regime.”Turkey, which has emerged as a base for many former Afghan ministers and lawmakers following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15, has adopted a more nuanced position. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has linked even the taking over of operations at Kabul airport to the formation of an “inclusive” government in Afghanistan that embraces all factions and women.Also Read: Taliban face shift from war to policing streets“So long as that will be the question we won’t be present in Afghanistan, but if the government shall be more inclusive, we can be there, present, as Turkey,” he said last month.Turkey is also focused on protecting the interests of sizeable Turkic groups that account for a little more 10% of Afghanistan’s population.India has cautioned the world against rushing into recognising the Taliban setup, pointing out that it isn’t inclusive and was formed without negotiations. It is also wary about Pakistan’s role and influence with the Taliban.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it wouldn’t be surprising if Pakistan and Qatar recognise the Taliban setup, though other countries, including China, have adopted a wait-and-watch approach.“Since the formation of the Taliban’s interim cabinet, it has become clear that what Taliban elements in Doha were projecting was a facade. This setup belied the expectations of most countries, which don’t want to recognise a regime that includes UN-proscribed individuals.

06-10-2021||India||Tej Pratap is not in RJD , says party leader Shivanand Tiwary; then backtracks||A statement by RJD’s national vice president Shivanand Tiwary on Wednesday evening claiming that party chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is virtually not in the party has stirred a controversy and given a new twist to the growing sibling rivalry in the RJD’s first family. The controversy emerged when Tiwary during a presser at Hajipur said that there was no question of expelling Tej Pratap as the elder Yadav scion had himself disassociated from the party. He was replying to queries about whether the Hassanpur MLA, who in recent days has been aggressive in his attack against younger brother Tejashwi and the party leadership, could face any disciplinary action or expulsion. “Tej Pratap has made his own outfit and he was also barred from using the lantern symbol when he tried to use it. Tej has himself accepted that he was denied permission to use the lantern symbol for his outfit. So, where is the question of expulsion? Tej Pratap is not in the party as he has himself disassociated from it,” he said. Tiwary, who is considered to be close to the RJD chief, later told the media that his statement had been wrongly interpreted as he was speaking in the context of Tej Pratap’s recent move to form his own outfit. “Who am I to say Tej Pratap is in the party or not. I had called the presser for a different agenda. I spoke about what Tej Pratap has himself acknowledged-- that he was restricted from using the official symbol of the party for his own organization,” the veteran leader said. However, the RJD’s national vice president’s statement has added a fresh twist to the growing rivalry between the two brothers in Lalu Yadav’s family and could give more ammunition to the elder Yadav scion to launch a fresh attack against the party’s top leaders including Tejashwi. Tej Pratap had recently attacked the RJD’s top brass and taken oblique pot-shots at his younger brother by stating that “a handful of people are dreaming of becoming the party’s national president” and had kept the RJD chief ‘hostage’ in New Delhi. However, on Tuesday, Lalu addressed a virtual meeting of party workers, which was seen as an attempt to dispel any misgivings about being kept ‘hostage’ at his elder daughter Misa Bharti’s residence in the national capital. BJP state spokesperson Nikhil Anand too reacted to the controversy over Tiwary’s statement saying it was indicative of how the siblings of Tejashwi were being side-lined before the younger Yadav scion is crowned the party’s president in the coming days. “The way kings used to side-line their siblings before being crowned in ancient days including in the Mughal Empire, in the same way, siblings of Tejashwi-- Tej Pratap and Misa Bharti are being side-lined. Top leaders who could challenge Tejashwi will also meet the same fate and be shown the door. It was bound to happen,” Anand said, adding that the RJD is an undemocratic organisation and promotes family rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tej-pratap-is-not-in-rjd-says-party-leader-shivanand-tiwary-then-backtracks-101633542416052.html

Here’s what’s stopping them to get jabbed||Only 7 per cent of the Indian adult population is currently hesitant towards getting jabbed with a Covid-19 vaccine, a new survey has revealed. This is the lowest vaccine hesitancy against the virus in the country so far since the nationwide vaccination rollout began in January this year.The survey was conducted by an online community platform LocalCircles where responses of as many as 12,810 citizens from across 301 districts across the country were recorded, with 67 per cent being men and 33 per cent being women.In an earlier survey conducted by LocalCircles as well, vaccine hesitancy among Indians stood at 60% when it was first rolled out. It reduced significantly during the dangerous second wave of the Covid-19 between April and May.India has so far vaccinated more than 92 crore eligible beneficiaries, with over 41 lakh shots administered on Wednesday till the time of writing this report. As far as coronavirus cases are concerned, the country recorded 18,833 new infections in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative tally to 3,38,71,881.

As many as 278 people succumbed to the virus on Wednesday, following the death toll now stands at 4,49,538, according to data shared by the Union health ministry’s bulletin.How many Indians are still unsure about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines?In the survey, it was found that 27 per cent of the participants don’t plan to take the vaccine yet since they are not convinced whether the currently available options will offer adequate protection against coronavirus and its future variants, LocalCircles founder Sachin Taparia said.He pointed out that these sceptical individuals may end up getting jabbed with a coronavirus vaccine if more data pertaining to it is made available or if different vaccines come to the market.Taparia further stated that when the 7 per cent of the Indian adult population who are reluctant to be administered the vaccine are applied to the unvaccinated population of 26 crore adults in the country, “it amounts to 7 crore citizens still hesitant” of the needle.How many Indians are willing to be vaccinated against coronavirus?According to the LocalCircles survey, a total of 46 per cent of the respondents who are yet to be jabbed said that they plan to get inoculated with their first dose soon, Taparia said.The data shared by the Union health ministry’s bulletin on Wednesday showed that as many as 70,80,17,908 of Indians, aged between 18 and 59, have either received the first dose or been fully-jabbed with both shots of Covid-19 vaccine.What was the demographic distribution of the respondents?In the survey, participants from tier 1 cities accounted for 42 per cent, while 27 per cent were from tier 2 cities. As many as 31 per cent of the respondents were from tier 3, 4 and rural districts.What was the reason behind the scepticism towards being vaccinated against Covid-19?According to the LocalCircles survey, respondents cited quick clinical trials, hasty vaccine approvals, safety concerns, and side-effects as some of the reasons behind their apprehension towards being jabbed.Furthermore, there were some participants who had medical conditions and pointed out concerns of potential blood-clotting. Some respondents even cited Covid-19 going away as the reason for not getting vaccinated.Besides these, myths and misinformation revolving around the vaccines were restraining the respondents from getting inoculated with the shot.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hesitancy-towards-covid-vaccine-dips-to-7-among-india-s-adult-population-101633540046452.html

06-10-2021||India||Goa MLA spares Congress more embarrassment, says he won’t quit||PANAJI: The Congress has managed to retain its much-depleted strength of four lawmakers in the Goa assembly after it managed to convince Congress legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenço to cross over. Lourenço, who was perceived to be on his way out of the party, announced on Tuesday that he will stay put, “in the interest of the people” and to “unitedly fight the BJP.”Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenço made the announcement at a media conference at his Curtorim residence, flanked by Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar and leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat. Lourenço said he was approached by “many political parties” but that after discussions and consultations, he decided that it was important to “stay united to fight the BJP.”“Lots of parties approached me with a lot of issues and how to go about it. I met a lot of people these days and even voiced my opinion and highlighted differences. I spoke to the party (Congress leadership) about what Goa needs to be done, right up to Rahul Gandhi and (AICC desk in-charge) Dinesh Gundu Rao,” the Congress legislator said.“After discussion, we have come to an opinion on what people want - that we unite to fight the BJP…. I call on the people to also let us unitedly fight the BJP. Let there be no difference of opinion on the fact that we have decided to unitedly fight the BJP,” Lourenço said at the briefing.On Twitter, Lourenço also referred to a phone call that he received from Rahul Gandhi to wish him on his birthday – he turned 52 on Wednesday – and pledged to “work harder” for the people of Goa.Lourenço’s decision to stick to the Congress comes as a huge relief for the party that emerged as the single largest party in the 2017 assembly elections but has since then steadily lost its legislators to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The first one to resign from the Congress was Vishwajit Rane; he dramatically quit the party hours after taking oath as a legislator in March 2017. He was re-elected on a BJP ticket, the state’s ruling party that holds a commanding majority of 27 seats in the 40-member assembly.Reginaldo Lourenço had been feeling alienated within the party and was known to be disappointed that the party leadership didn’t give him a leadership role despite sticking with the party “through thick and thin” especially when he was the only ‘young’ Congress MLA, and the only MLA who was not a former chief minister to stick with the party and not switch over to the BJP in 2019 when 10 other legislators jumped ship.Lately, it had become clear that he and state party president Girish Chodankar did not get along very well. In the recent past, Chodankar had even gone public with his criticism of the three-time lawmaker from South Goa’s Curtorim constituency.At Tuesday’s evening, Girish Chodankar praised him effusively, thanking him for being large-hearted.“He (Reginaldo Lourenço) is a vibrant leader and he is loved across the state, across sections and people have seen that he fights for Goa. We will not be successful without him. Central leaders P Chidambaram, P Gundu Rao, and Rahul Gandhi organizing secretary Venugopal and the entire organization got involved and worked to ensure that Reginaldo should be on board with us,” Chodankar said.“There were some issues he wanted to be discussed -- one is about due respect, then about issues within his constituency and there was no difference of opinion that the issues within the constituency need to be resolved. We agreed that these issues need to be resolved. Reginaldo was also concerned about protecting Goa and how it needs to be protected and we have agreed that there cannot be a compromise on the core issues of Goa,” Chodankar said.“There is no harm in having a difference of opinion, but we sat together and resolved them. And all his issues were nothing personal -- it was either of the constituency or in the larger interest of Goa. Whatever due respect is due to Reginaldo, it will be given whether from Goa or from Delhi leadership also,” the Goa Congress chief said.Digambar Kamat described Reginaldo Lourenço as “a matured leader” who had worked hard when the Congress was weak. “It was important to clear whatever was in his mind. Nobody can deny his contribution to the party, for the development of Goa,” the leader of opposition in the Goa assembly said.Congress leaders said the outreach came after the party leadership was made aware of ‘advanced talks’ between Lourenço and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders.Reginaldo was first elected to the assembly on the ticket of the Save Goa Front in 2007. The party later merged with the Congress and he was elected on a Congress ticket twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-mla-spares-congress-a-huge-embarrassment-says-he-won-t-quit-101633536475332.html

The minister claimed that the car lost balance after it was attacked by stone pelters and as it flipped some protesters came under the car. He alleged that his driver was lynched and the car was set on fire. His son was not involved in this at all. Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka reach Lakhimpur Kheri, meet family members | 10 pointsSenior Congress leader and lawyer Kapil Sibal on Wednesday tweeted on how the top court used to act at a time when there were no social media and implied that it is not doing the same when a video of a car crushing the protesting farmers is available on social media."Supreme Court.

On Wednesday, an AAP delegation met the families of the victims while the Congress delegation reached the district at night. "There used to be democracy here, but there is a dictatorship in India now. Politicians cannot go to Uttar Pradesh.

06-10-2021||India||Cruise rave party: Who took the selfie with Aryan Khan? What did NCB say?||The cruise rave party in connection with which Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan has been arrested and is in NCB custody took a new twist with the Nationalist Congress Party alleging that the NCB allowed outsiders during the raid. In fact, the photo of Aryan Khan which went viral was taken by KP Gosavi, who himself is a fraud, NCP leader Nawab Malik alleged on Wednesday.Here is what we know about this so farWhich photo did Nawab Malik refer to?A photo of Aryan Khan went viral on Sunday after he was detained by the NCB for interrogation. Later he was arrested and is still in NCB custody. In that viral photo, Aryan Khan was seen with a person, who is not a staff of the NCB, the agency clarified on that day.Who is KP Gosavi?Reports said KP Gosavi is a private detective and was accused of job fraud. He used to run the KPG Dream Solutions and reportedly duped many youngsters with job promises.NCB refutes Nawab Malik's charges over SRK son case, says ‘probable prejudice’It is, however, not clear what Gosavi was doing with the NCB at the time of Aryan Khan's arrest, if at all the photo was taken at that time. The NCB earlier did not say anything about when the photo was taken. The agency just said the man in the photo was not an NCB officer. It did not admit or deny whether the photo was taken after Aryan Khan was detained for questioning or was an old photo.Who is Manish Bhanushali?Nawab Malik has also taken the name of Manish Bhanushali who was seen with Aryan Khan's friend Arbaaz Merchant. Nawab Malik said Manish Bhanushali is a BJP worker and according to his Facebook profile, he holds the post of vice president in the party. Malik said Bhanushali also has photos with PM Modi, JP Nadda and other senior leaders of the BJP.A report quoted Bhanushali admitting that he is a BJP leader and was present during the raid as he had the information of the rave party. He also said that he helped the NCB with information regarding the rave party and that's why was present. He also said that he was not holding Arbaaz Merchant's hand as it may have seen in one of the photos. He was just standing there.What did NCB say?The NCB dismissed all allegations and said the agency did not do anything wrong. The NCP can go to the court if it wants, the agency said. It, however, did not say anything on who KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali are and how they are associated with the case. In a statement, the agency on Wednesday said, "Some allegations levelled against the organisation are baseless and seem to have been with malice and probable prejudice that may have been harboured in retaliation against earlier legal action carried out by NCB."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cruise-rave-party-who-took-the-selfie-with-aryan-khan-what-did-ncb-say-101633535669294.html
06-10-2021||India||NIA takes over ₹21,000 crore Mundra drugs haul case as narco-terror link emerges||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday took over probe into the recovery of around 3,000 kg Afghan heroin worth ₹21,000 crore in the international market with clear international narco-terrorism linkages emerging in the seizure, people familiar with the matter said.The consignment was intercepted by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) on September 14 and 15 on the basis of specific intelligence that high quality heroin was being smuggled from Afghanistan to Gujarat’s Mundra port via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port. It is being described as the single-largest heroin haul by federal agencies in the country.The two containers had 1,999.58 kg and 988.64 kg heroin packed respectively, layered between talcum powder to avoid detection by security and customs officials. HT exclusively reported the seizure on September 20. At least eight persons, including a Chennai couple - Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and her husband Machavaram Sudhakar, who imported the heroin concealed in the semi-processed talc stones through their Vijaywada registered firm – Aashi Trading Company - from a Kandahar based company; four Afghan nationals, an Uzbek woman and others have been arrested by the DRI so far. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) decided to transfer the probe to NIA as there is a clear terror link in the smuggling, which agencies are probing from the Taliban-Pakistan angle, according to an official, who requested anonymity. Vaishali and Sudhakar are said to be small players and got only ₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh commission for allowing the traffickers to use their talc stones containers for smuggling heroin. A larger network of Afghan nationals is suspected to be behind the consignment, said this officer. Investigation has revealed that Vaishali and Sudhakar were taking instructions from some persons based in Afghanistan and Iran. “Their role in smuggling drugs previously in the garb of imports is being investigated,” said a second officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-takes-over-rs-21-000-crore-mundra-drugs-haul-case-as-narco-terror-link-emerges-101633534794889.html

The 2021 examination, due in November will now be held in January 2022 under the old pattern being followed by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) since 2018.This was informed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday which is examining a challenge by 41 post graduate doctors who have raised a constitutional challenge against the revised examination pattern introduced from academic year 2021-22.Appearing for the Centre, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati gave a statement that “having regard to the interest of the body of students who would have commenced preparations for the ensuing NEET - SS examination before the change in the pattern was notified, a decision has been taken by the Union government in consultation with the National Medical Commission (NMC) and the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to give effect to the modified pattern only from the academic year 2022-2023.”Since this was the limited relief that the petitioner doctors had urged for, the bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna said, “Since the Union government and the expert bodies have taken a decision to hold the ensuing NEET – SS examinations for 2021-2022 on the basis of the pattern which held the field until academic year 2020-2021, it is not necessary for this Court to adjudicate upon the validity of the modified pattern proposed for 2022-2023… In the circumstances, the petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution are disposed of.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan appearing in a fresh petition filed by a group of doctors preparing for the NEET-SS 2021told the Court that the issues of challenge against the revised pattern should be kept open as the same would be enforced from next year. The bench agreed to the suggestion and stated in its order, “That issue (with regard to modified examination pattern for 2022-23) is kept open.”The dramatic turnaround by the Centre came a day after the Court made caustic remarks against the Centre and NBE for hurrying with the new examination pattern without giving sufficient time for doctors to prepare. The revised scheme of NEET-SS tested candidates on questions from just one broad specialty course in General Medicine. Under the old scheme, only 40% questions came from General Medicine while the bulk of questions tested the candidates on their knowledge about the super specialty course that they applied for.The petitioners before the Court had submitted that since clinical practice was required under the old scheme prevailing since 2018, most doctors had spent years to acquire knowledge in their specialization and get admission into the respective stream offered under Doctorate of Medicine (DM), Master of Surgery (MCh) and Doctorate of National Board (DrNB). More than 4200 seats in these three categories are filled up each year through NEET-SS.The Centre argued that the change in NEET-SS pattern was done with a view to reduce wastage of SS seats in private and government medical colleges. On Tuesday, the top court said that the efforts of the Centre seems to be to fill vacant seats, hinting that regulation of medical education too had become a business to help private medical colleges fill up their seats. The Court even called for breakup of how many seats remain unfilled in government and private colleges.ASG Bhati informed the Court on Wednesday that out of 805 vacant super specialty seats reported in 2020, 561 were in private colleges. There are 414 colleges offering the super specialty course of which 296 are private-owned and 118 are run by government. She further informed the Court that the Centre will require two months to conduct the examination as the whole process has to be reworked.In an affidavit filed on October 1, the Centre had indicated that the stakeholders – Centre, NBE and NMC had agreed to defer the November 13-14 examination by two months to January 10-11 but with the modified pattern in place. The bench had given a day’s time for the Centre to put its house in order and consider revising its decision warning that if no decision is taken, the “hands of the law are very long”, hinting at the possibility of a stay order by the Court on the new pattern for this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-closes-petitions-on-neet-ss-after-centre-postpones-new-exam-pattern-for-202223-101633530234354.html

Hitting out at Congress' Rahul Gandhi, Sambit Patra, BJP's national spokesperson, said that he is trying to fan unrest over the violence-hit district. He also claimed that the party is trying to "use the tragedy to draw political mileage" amid its infighting, news agency PTI reported.Speaking on Uttar Pradesh government's earlier order to restrict political leaders from arriving in Lakhimpur Kheri, Patra said "maintaining peace was the top priority," as per the report.The Uttar Pradesh government came under major criticism over the Lakhimpur violence incident after it prohibited several senior leaders including general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav from visiting the district. However, the government revoked the order earlier in the day and allowed all political parties to meet the kin of the victims.The local administration also detained Priyanka Gandhi on Monday morning. She was released on Wednesday after the revised government order. The sibling is currently on its way to the district.The deceased in the violence includes four farmers, a journalist and three others.Following this, Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the ruling-BJP and said that dictatorship is prevailing in the country and "there is no democracy." Responding to the allegations, Patra said, "There is democracy in the country" which is why "you are holding the press conference," according to the report.He also took a swipe at the Congress party and said he had never faced protests from BJP workers for his press conferences, while Congress members threw tomatoes and agitated outside their leader Kapil Sibal's residence for his critical comments about the party's functioning.The senior BJP leader also urged people to refrain from giving irresponsible statements that may obstruct justice and noted that the local administration is coordinating to carry out an impartial probe into the incident.He further alleged that the Gandhi family had nothing to do with either farmers or any other section of society "They are not even concerned about the Congress. All they want is that their fortunes should not be scuttled," Patra said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-slams-rahul-gandhi-over-lakhimpur-kheri-says-trying-to-fan-unrest-for-political-mileage-101633528631756.html

The agency said that the allegation seems to be malicious and stems from probable prejudice, in an oblique reference to NCB action against Nawab Malik's son-in-law in another drug case. NCP leader Nawab Malik said that the photo of Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan which went viral after being arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau was actually taken by KP Gosavi who is a private detective and who himself has fraud cases against him. The NCB on that very day issued a statement saying that the man has no connection with the agency but did not comment on who the person is."Some allegations levelled against the organisation are baseless and seem to have been with malice and probable prejudice that may have been harboured in retaliation against earlier legal action carried out by NCB," the agency said in a statement issued after Nawab Malik's allegations. #WATCH | Some allegations levelled against the organisation are baseless and seem to have been with malice & probable prejudice that may have been harboured in retaliation against earlier legal action carried out by NCB: NCB Deputy DG Gyaneshwar Singh in Mumbai pic.twitter.com/zeb7uQ3nUmNCB deputy DG Gyaneshwar Singh said the procedure of the agency has been and will continue to be unbiased and professionally, legally transparent."If they (NCP) want to go the court, they can go and seek justice. We will reply there. We have done everything as per law," the NCB said.Though the agency did not mention the case against Nawab Malik's son-in-law, it referred to that by "probable prejudice that may have been harboured in retaliation against earlier legal action carried out by NCB".Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Shabbir Khan was arrested by the NCB in a drug-related case early this year and is now on bail. Apart from the Bollywood bigwigs who have been summoned to the NCB office for questioning, Nawab Malik's son-in-law was a big-ticket arrest made by the NCB in past one year. Not only Gosavi; Nawab Malik alleged that there is another outsider involved in the case, who has a BJP link, he said. He said the person who was seen bringing Arbaaz Merchant to the NCB office in Manush Bhanushali, not an NCB officer. "According to the Bhanushali's Facebook, he is a BJP vice president and has pictures with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amir Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda and other senior leaders including those from Maharashtra such as Devendra Fadnavis and Ashish Shelar," Malik told reporters on Wednesday, reiterating that the arrest of SRK's son was aforgery. “For the last one month, the information was being circulated to crime reporters that the next target is actor Shah Rukh Khan,” Nawab Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-refutes-nawab-malik-s-charges-over-srk-son-case-says-probable-prejudice-101633525309749.html

The central anti-terror probe agency had taken over an investigation earlier this year against six Sri Lankan nationals following seizure of five AK47 rifles, thousands of 9 mm ammunition along with 300 kgs of heroin after a fishing vessel - Ravihansi - was intercepted by the Coast Guard of the coast of Minicoy in Lakshwadeep on March 18. The NIA probe has so far revealed that Sabesan had arranged conspiracy meetings of sympathisers of LTTE in India. “He had played a crucial role in routing the proceeds of drugs trafficking to former LTTE cadres in Sri Lanka for the revival of LTTE,” the agency said in a statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-former-member-of-ltte-intelligence-wing-from-chennai-101633523814338.html

06-10-2021||India||Pak PM Imran Khan requests Bill Gates for financial support for Afghans||Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday requested billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates to extend humanitarian aid to people of Afghanistan. While speaking with the founder of Microsoft, the Pakistan prime minister said that half of Afghanistan’s population was living below the poverty line, news agency PTI reported citing a statement from the Pakistan prime minister’s office.Khan apprised Bill Gates, who is the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), regarding Pakistan’s and Afghanistan’s efforts to eradicate polio. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), which spearheads the global war against the debilitating disease, says that both these nations are the only countries where the disease is still endemic. Pakistan reported 1 case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) this year and its neighbour Afghanistan also reported 1 case this year. Both countries have however reported circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases, Pakistan reported eight such cases while Afghanistan reported 43 such cases. cVDPV2 happens when immunization rates are low in communities.According to the US Centers for Disease Control, polio is caused by the poliovirus and is a disabling and life-threatening disease. It is highly contagious and spreads through person-to-person contact.Khan told Gates that positive WPV environmental samples have decreased substantially while expressing his government’s commitment to ending all forms of polio in the country. He also thanked the BMGF for its continued support in Pakistan’s fight against polio.In Pakistan and Afghanistan, vaccinating children against polio saw hindrances from terrorists who oppose the drives, claiming that the polio drops cause infertility.Khan also reiterated the need for providing financial support to Afghans. “The prime minister highlighted that more than half of the population in Afghanistan was living below the poverty line and in dire need of financial assistance. He requested Mr. Gates to consider providing humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-requests-bill-gates-for-financial-support-for-afghans-101633522778823.html
06-10-2021||India||India's security concerns ‘first and foremost’, says US deputy state secretary||US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman on Wednesday said that the United States appreciates India’s concerns about the spillover of terrorism from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of the war-torn region. Sherman, who is on a three-day visit to India, met foreign secretary Harsh Shringla in New Delhi to review the bilateral agenda of the two countries. The senior US diplomat said after the meeting that India and the United States have "one mind and one approach" on Afghanistan. The visit comes in the backdrop of Taliban’s government formation in Afghanistan and its attempt to get recognition from the international community. India as well as the United States have not recognised the Taliban government and opted for a wait-and-watch policy as the situation unfolds in Afghanistan.Sherman underlined that the both countries have laid out similar conditions on the way forward in Afghanistan, including the formation of an inclusive government that represents all communities and preventing Afghan soil from becoming a safe haven for terrorists. Other conditions include respect for human rights, and providing safe and orderly travel for those who want to leave Afghanistan.During the Taliban's previous rule in Afghanistan, the group was notorious for enforcing its harsh interpretation of Sharia law, which included banning women from workplaces. In the final days of US troops' withdrawal, the Sunni Pashtun militants assured that they will respect human rights and give more freedom to women and girls, however, added that it will be in line with “genuine Islamic system”.“Taliban must act, and not just speak words,” the American diplomat said after meeting with Shringla and national security advisor Ajit Doval. “No country is in a rush on recognising or giving legitimacy to Taliban.”The Taliban's return has also raised concerns about Afghanistan becoming a safe haven for terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda, impacting the regional security.Sherman said that the United States is putting together a robust programme for ‘over-the-horizon’ capabilities for counter terrorism capabilities in Afghanistan from far longer range. India's security concerns will be "first and foremost" and "front and centre" for the US, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-security-concerns-first-and-foremost-says-us-deputy-state-secretary-101633522504262.html

06-10-2021||India||Corbett Tiger Reserve likely to be renamed Ramganga National Park||The Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change has asked Corbett Tiger Reserve officials to rename the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) as Ramganga National Park (RNP). The Rāmgangā river flows from the Corbett Tiger Reserve and is known as the lifeline of the reserve.Ashwini Kumar Choubey, minister of state for environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC) has asked the CTR director to initiate the renaming process of the reserve during his visit to CTR on Sunday, a forest official said.“The minister during his visit to the reserve had said Ramganga national park is a good name instead of CTR so initiate the renaming process of CTR. If the forest ministry instructs us to prepare a proposal of this sort, we will act accordingly,” said Rahul, director CTR on Wednesday.Choubey had visited CTR on Sunday to conclude the tiger safari organised for the protection of tigers held under Amrit Mahotsav. Speaking on the occasion at Dhangarhi museum, he told forest authorities that CTR should be renamed as RNP as it is a good name and related to Indian nature and landscape, an official said.He not only instructed officials to initiate the renaming process but also mentioned Ramganga national park under his message and the signature in the visitors’ book, an official said.The Corbett reserve was established in 1936 and named Haily National Park after Malcolm Haily, the former governor of the then UP province. After Independence, it was renamed as Ramganga National Park in 1954-55. Next year, it was again renamed as Corbett Tiger Reserve after the name of hunter and writer Jim Corbett.“CTR’s name was Ramganga national park earlier also but it was renamed as Corbett tiger reserve in 1955-56. MOEFCC itself may initiate the renaming process or can instruct us to prepare a proposal. But, it is too early to say anything at this juncture,” said Rahul.CTR is spread over 520 km and is rich in flora and fauna, it is known for tigers, leopards, elephants, deer, bear and several species of other wild animals, reptiles and birds. Lakhs of tourists visit the national park every year.CTR earns around ₹10-crore from tourists, Rahul added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corbett-tiger-reserve-likely-to-be-renamed-ramganga-national-park-101633519179705.html

"The RSS is the patriot organisation that is safeguarding the country. India is safe under the RSS. Indian people nowhere need to be scared for any country or forces," he further said.His remarks came in response to the comments made by Janata Dal-Secular (JDS) leader and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, who had alleged that the RSS-trained 4,000 civil servants in the country are now part of the Indian bureaucracy.Chauhan then went on to take a jibe at the JDS, saying everybody knows how the party ran the country and its contribution. "JDS and Kumarswamy must understand that they don't have any credibility to speak about RSS," he added.Previously, senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah had alleged that "BJP are "Talibanis" and claimed that it's actually the RSS which is running the administration in Karnataka. He was speaking at an event held to distribute ration kits to poor families that lost someone due to Covid-19 in Bengaluru."BJP has a factory of lies with them, they only produce and market lies. We can relate it to Goebbels theory that was under Hitler rule. Hitler had a Minister called Goebbels (Paul Joseph Goebbels) for spreading false propaganda," PTI had reported him saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-reason-why-india-not-becoming-another-pakistan-karnataka-minister-101633516347743.html
06-10-2021||India||Respond to Sachin Vaze’s plea for house arrest: HC to NIA||Dismissed police officer Sachin Vaze, who was arrested in March for his alleged role in planting explosives in a car parked outside businessman Mukesh Ambani’s house in February, has moved the Bombay high court against a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court’s September 29 order rejecting his plea for house arrest after his heart surgery. The high court asked the NIA to file its response and file its reply within a week. It scheduled the next hearing in the matter next week.Vaze’s lawyer, Sudeep Pasbola, told a division bench of justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal that his client was operated upon on September 13 and was discharged from a Mumbai hospital on September 28. He added the surgery was complex involving five grafts and Vaze was shifted back to Taloja Central Prison Hospital after the surgery. The special NIA court rejected his plea for house arrest and directed the prison authorities to keep Vaze in the prison hospital for a month for post-surgery recovery.In his petition in the high court, Vaze cited a high likelihood of contracting an infection in a non-sterile environment such as a jail. He added there was a higher rate of tuberculosis and skin infection due to unhygienic conditions among jail inmates. He feared for his well-being and hence sought house arrest.Also Read: NIA court rejects Sachin Vaze’s plea for house arrest post cardiac surgery“The petitioner states that the incision made for the surgery on his chest is still fresh and wet and as such the pus and blood is oozing from the same,” the petition said. “The petitioner states that the conditions at the said hospital are very poor and that there is a high risk of contracting other infections such as tuberculosis etc. The petitioner states that his health would be jeopardized if he has taken back to Taloja Central Prison.”Vaze said the room where he intends to stay at his residence in the event the court permits him to be placed under house arrest has separate access and as such, complete seclusion could be maintained to enforce the rules as per the prison manual.While opposing Vaze’s plea in the special court, the NIA argued his judicial custody cannot be converted into a house arrest since the investigation against him was complete and the charge sheet has been filed. It argued the hospitals attached to Taloja jail were modern and capable of handling Vaze’s condition. The prosecution said it feared Vaze would abscond if house arrest was granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respond-to-sachin-vaze-s-plea-for-house-arrest-hc-to-nia-101633519059459.html

Heli-borne geophysical mapping technique will provide high-resolution 3D image for sub-surface up to a depth of 500 meters below the ground level and map potential groundwater sources.This latest technology is being employed by CSIR to map groundwater sources in arid regions and utilise groundwater for drinking purposes, he said. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with CSIR-NGRI for executing the project named High Resolution Aquifer Mapping & Management in Arid Regions of North Western India to target key water challenges in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana.Jitendra Singh said that the water technologies of CSIR, from source finding to water treatment, will benefit millions of people across the country and will contribute to PM Modi’s “Har Ghar Nal Se Jal” (drinking water supply to every household) as well as “doubling farmers income” goals. He noted that the technological expertise of CSIR will be a great asset for the Jal Shakti ministry’s programs and that the association could help address key water challenges of the country.

06-10-2021||India||Bihar looking at ways to reach out to differently-abled for Covid-19 jabs||The Bihar health department has instructed districts to inoculate on a priority basis those who are bed-ridden, differently-abled and the old and infirm, especially those having restricted mobility, in an effort to saturate the state with vaccination against coronavirus. Bihar has 23.31 lakh people categorised under “disabled” in a population of 10.40 crore, as per Census 2011, shared by the social welfare department. Of these, 14.70 lakh have been issued disability certificates and are entitled to various benefits, including pension, under government schemes. Disabled are entitled to a monthly pension of ₹400 in Bihar. Since the available data on differently-abled is based on Census 2011, the state health society, Bihar (SHSB), on Tuesday, instructed district magistrates (DMs) and civil surgeons to prepare a line-list of all such people in their respective district, and chalk out an action plan to vaccinate them. The SHSB also advised the DMs and civil surgeons to use mobile vaccination vans and press into service outreach workers like accredited social health activists (AHSA) to tap and vaccinate all such people as close as possible to their residences. Bihar had deployed around 725 “Teeka Express”, which are mobile vaccination vans, to reach out to people for Covid-19 jabs in rural areas. “We are approaching first-dose vaccination saturation in the state. Since the number of eligible population for vaccination has come down, we have to reach out to the population, which is still unvaccinated. The most important in this category is the differently abled and the old and the infirm, having restricted mobility, as they are unable to come to our vaccination centres. We have to now reach out to them through our outreach workers,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, and also the state nodal officer for vaccination. Bihar’s first dose vaccine coverage is around 63% of the eligible adult population of 7.22 crore and 27% second dose of those who have taken the first jab. “We had asked our polio supervisors during the recent pulse polio drive (September 26 to October 1) to find out people who have been left out of Covid vaccination. They have marked all households where people due for their second dose have not taken the shot or those completely left out. We will try and persuade all such people to take the Covid-19 vaccine,” added Singh. The share of males with multiple disabilities in Bihar was 1.9% and females at 1.3%, according to the National Statistical Office (NSO) of the ministry of statistics and programme Implementation (MOSPI), mainly responsible for laying down standards for statistical analysis, data collection, and implementation. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had in June given his officials the task to administer 6 crore vaccine doses in six months by December this year. Bihar has administered over 5.80 crore doses so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-looking-at-ways-to-reach-out-to-differently-abled-for-covid-19-jabs-101633517619287.html

The mortal remains of the three other farmers were cremated at their native places on Tuesday. Gurvinder Singh was cremated on Wednesday after a second autopsy was conducted on him as demanded by his family.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has also announced an ex-gratia of ₹50 lakh. Both Punjab and Chhattisgarh are ruled by the Congress.Uttar Pradesh drew backlash over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people died after a jeep ran over farmers who were protesting against the Centre's farm laws. Following the incident, the local administrator turned the district into a fortress by deploying a heavy security to the area and restricted politicians from visiting the site.On Monday, it also detained Congress' general secretary Priyank Gandhi Vadra in Sitapuri while she was en route to meet the families of the victims.Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of several farmer unions, has alleged that Ashish Mishra Teni, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni arrived with three vehicles around the time that farmers were dispersing from their protest at the helipad and mowed down farmers. The group also alleges that Ashish Mishra also tried to attack SKM leader Tajinder Singh Virk directly, by trying to run a vehicle over him.However, the minister and his son have refuted the allegations, saying he was not present at the spot where the incident took place.Meanwhile, the police are investigating the matter and a case has been registered against Ajay Mishra's son, but no arrest has been made so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-announces-ex-gratia-for-kin-of-farmers-journalist-killed-101633515339102.html

Check details||A day after the Uttarakhand high court lifted the daily limit on the number of devotees on Char Dham yatra, the state government issued a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for the pilgrims. Under the new guidelines, registration on the Char Dham Board portal will be mandatory for ‘darshan’ in the four dhams. However, yatra e-Pass from the portal is no longer required to visit the shrines.The devotees should either be fully vaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) or have to produce a negative Covid report not older than 72 hours. The relaxation comes in the wake of significant decline in daily Covid-19 cases in the state.On Tuesday, a division bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma lifted the cap on pilgrims following the state government’s plea but added that every pilgrim will have to bring a negative Covid-19 test report or a vaccination certificate.“As per Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand order dated 05/10/2021 regarding the Chardham Yatra, upper ceiling on number of pilgrims visiting the dham temples has been removed. However all the pilgrims visiting Uttarakhand have to register themselves only on the portal http://smartcitydehradun.uk.gov.in and follow the Uttarakhand State Covid-19 SOP,” says Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board on its website.The court stayed the Char Dham yatra in June owing to the disastrous second wave of Covid-19 pandemic as hundreds of thousands lost their lives. Later in September, the court lifted the stay but limited the number of daily pilgrims to the four revered Himalayan shrines - 800 for Kedarnath, 1000 for Badrinath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. It had also banned bathing in any reservoir or spring located around the shrines.In its latest order, the court has directed the state government to increase the healthcare facilities on Char Dham routes and shines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-issues-sop-for-char-dham-yatra-after-court-lifts-daily-pilgrim-limit-check-details-101633515489481.html

This was the second flood to hit West Bengal since July-August. Banerjee called both the floods man-made and blamed the corporation, a central governmental agency operating power stations in Jharkhand and West Bengal for the floods. She alleged that water was discharged after midnight from the Panchet and Maithon dams and the Sikatiya barrage without informing West Bengal.The DVC has said a representative of the state government is in the committee which decides when and how much water would be released from the dams it operates. It insisted the information was passed on to both the state government and the district authorities.Also Read: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to inaugurate Durga puja pandalsBanerjee has written earlier as well to Modi over the recurring floods in West Bengal triggered by heavy rain and subsequent discharge of water from dams.“I am sorry to say that my earlier letter to you has not yet been responded to by the Union government.

What was he doing then? If he cannot perform, discharge him,” said Ghosh.Banerjee also attacked the DVC for not dredging its reservoirs, which could increase their water holding capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-seeks-pm-s-intervention-to-prevent-man-made-floods-in-bengal-101633515879023.html

06-10-2021||India||Entry into UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri triggers political slugfest between TMC, Congress||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) scaled up its criticism of the Congress on Wednesday, calling the national party a “loser”, shortly after Rahul Gandhi said in Lucknow that leaders from his party were prevented by the Uttar Pradesh government from travelling to Lakhimpur Kheri while TMC and Bhim Army teams reached the spot a day earlier. Lakhimpur Kheri has become the destination for all anti-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forces since the alleged killing of farmers on Sunday. Focusing his attack on the Congress leader, TMC state general secretary and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh tweeted, “Rahul Gandhi should not try to confuse people by distorting facts. TMC will not accept any loose non-political comment from any part-time politician who has failed to combat BJP. We respect INC. We are in favour of non BJP unity. We are on the roads, not on Twitter only.” Ghosh did not spare the Congress as well. “Rahul Gandhi should know: @AITCofficial MPs are in Lakhimpur after a long fight. In Tripura, BJP imposed 144 throughout Agartala only to prevent @abhishekaitc. INC is a loser in their traditional UP including Amethi. But TMC defeated BJP in Bengal. INC made Punjab a mess.” The Bengal Congress countered Ghosh and his party with an equally sharp criticism. “It is evident to people of this country that Congress has stood by farmers and emerged as the face of the anti-BJP force. It never compromised. The fact that TMC leaders were given a safe passage to Lakhimpur Kheri exposes the tacit understanding the party has with the BJP. This is how the BJP wants to weaken the opposition unity,” said Bengal Congress spokesperson Soumya Aich Roy. TMC Lok Sabha member Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, one of the leaders who visited Lakhimpur Kheri, told reporters that the team could make it because its members avoided attention from the moment they arrived in Lucknow on Monday. “There was not a single person to receive us at the Lucknow airport. We moved like common people from the very beginning. Policemen stopped our car when it was heading for Lakhimpur. I admit that we lied to them and said we were going to the Dudhwa National Park,” said Ghosh Dastidar. Bengal’s ruling party started targeting the Congress after Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and the party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee announced on June 8 that the TMC would expand its base in other states and take the BJP head on in the upcoming assembly elections. Since then, TMC has inducted Congress leaders and workers in Tripura and Goa. Former chief minister of Goa, Luizinho Faleiro, and several former office-bearers of the Congress’ Goa unit, joined TMC in the presence of Abhishek Banerjee in Kolkata on September 29. “Where is the Congress? On the ground, it is TMC that is facing the BJP and defeating it,” Abhishek Banerjee said recently, setting the tone of the rhetoric against the party that Mamata Banerjee left in 1998 to form the Trinamool Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entry-into-up-s-lakhimpur-kheri-triggers-slugfest-between-tmc-congress-101633515459120.html

06-10-2021||India||Monsoon withdrawal from northwest India begins, says IMD||The withdrawal of monsoon from northwest India commenced on Wednesday while it has withdrawn from parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. An anti-cyclonic circulation has established in the lower tropospheric levels over western parts of northwest India and there is a substantial reduction in moisture content and rainfall, which indicates the monsoon has started withdrawing.Conditions were becoming favourable for further withdrawal of the monsoon from more parts of Gujarat, entire Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Madhya Pradesh during three to four days.The withdrawal this year is likely to be the second most delayed since 1960, according to IMD. In 2019, monsoon withdrawal was the most delayed commencing only on October 9. The monsoon commenced withdrawal on September 28 last year.“Rain has stopped in many parts of northwest India. There is still some rain over the Ganganagar region in Rajasthan. Water vapour has also reduced significantly, and an anticyclone is getting established leading to a change in wind direction to north-westerly. All these conditions favour gradual monsoon withdrawal and establishment of dry conditions with marginal fall in temperature,” said K Sathi Devi, who heads the National Weather Forecasting Centre, on Tuesday.Also Read: Partly cloudy sky in Delhi with air quality in ‘moderate’ categoryA low-pressure area was very likely to form over the north Andaman Sea around October 10 and was likely to become more marked and move west-north-westwards towards south Odisha and north Coastal Andhra Pradesh during subsequent four to five days.Very heavy rain was likely in Kerala and coastal Karnataka till October 10 and Tamil Nadu and interior Karnataka and Rayalaseema till October 8.

The Congress leader sat in a dharna along with Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel as they were briefly stopped from coming out of the airport, Rahul Gandhi alleged. After being stopped at the airport briefly, Rahul Gandhi was finally allowed to travel in his own vehicle, though the Uttar Pradesh Police initially insisted that the Congress delegation will have to travel accompanied by the UP Police. भाजपा सरकार की ‘अनुमति’!इतना डर किस बात का? #IndiaDemandsJustice pic.twitter.com/n5Y0dCfvHN "This is what UP government's permission looks like.

06-10-2021||India||Posters accusing Gandhis of ‘fake sympathy’ surface in Lucknow||Posters condemning Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who have been spearheading the party’s offensive, seeking dismissal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Taini’ and arrest of his son Ashish Mishra in connection with Lakhimpur Kheri violence, came up in Lucknow on Wednesday. The posters that read ‘nahi chahiye farzi sahanubhooti’ meaning we don’t want fake sympathy’ came up even as the Congress scaled up the protests with Rahul Gandhi, along with Congress chief ministers of Punjab Charanjit Channi and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s scheduled arrival in the state capital on Wednesday. Priyanka Gandhi has been arrested and kept in a guesthouse in Sitapur following her refusal to leave till she is allowed to meet the families of farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence. On Tuesday Baghel was forced to return from Lucknow airport after staging a sit-in there following denial of permission to meet Priyanka Gandhi at Sitapur. The anti-Gandhi posters also raised the issue of 1984 anti-Sikh riots that took place in the aftermath of the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh security guard, saying that those who are trying to show sympathy to Sikh farmer families in Lakhimpur have their hands soiled in blood. Later in the day, UP minister and government spokesman Sidharth Nath Singh too reminded the Congress of 1984 Sikh riots and emergency and asked why Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were adamant on visiting Lakhimpur in violation of prohibitory orders. Also Read: Rahul Gandhi trying to misrepresent situation in Lakhimpur Kheri: BJP“Rahul Gandhi must have been very young when in independent India’s history, mass killings of Sikhs took place with a Congress government at the helm.

But currently investigation is underway. They should wait for a few days and then go and meet,” he added. Commenting on a picture of Priyanka Gandhi sweeping the floor of her guest house room where she has been kept in Sitapur, the UP minister said it was good to see her join Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachhta campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/posters-accusing-gandhis-of-fake-sympathy-surface-in-lucknow-101633511918929.html

06-10-2021||India||Facebook knows it is in trouble as Mark Zuckerberg picks his battles||When Senator Edward Markey on Tuesday called Frances Haugen “a 21st-century American hero,” it underlined the trouble Facebook finds itself in. Haugen, a former Facebook employee who appeared before a US Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, has blown the lid off what the social media company would have hoped remained a secret. She has highlighted how Facebook prioritised profits. It did not help with the optics that Facebook chose Antigone Davis, its global head of safety, and vice president (global affairs and communications) Nick Clegg to contest Haugen’s claims. The outage of all Facebook services this week added to the company’s woes.“Rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, (Facebook chief executive) Mr. (Mark) Zuckerberg is going sailing,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal in his opening remarks at the Senate hearing on the matter. Blumenthal’s appeared to be referring to a 38-second clip Zuckerberg posted online on Sunday featuring him and his wife sailing.Facebook is defending allegations that the company has long ignored teenage safety on its platforms, particularly Instagram, resolving conflicts in favour of profits. Facebook has been accused of hiding internal research about how Instagram’s algorithms were negatively impacting young users’ mental health and other important information.Zuckerberg stayed away from the hearing but attempted to set the record straight. In a Facebook post, he insisted the company ‘deeply cares” about issues such as safety, well-being, and mental health. He insisted there has been no attempt to hide any research and called allegations that the company focused on profits over people as “illogical”.Also Read: FB whistle-blower’s complaint details importance of Indian polls, hate speechZuckerberg has not commented on issues that Haugen has raised in her complaint submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) along with internal documents. These include the interest in elections in countries such as India, how Facebook’s content detection mechanism is quite limited in scope and volume, the problem of duplicate accounts as well as hate speech.“It’s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives,” said Zuckerberg. “At the most basic level, I think most of us just don’t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.” Zuckerberg seemed to indicate that it is the coverage that is the problem, not the company and its policies. “I know it’s frustrating to see the good work we do get mischaracterized, especially for those of you who are making important contributions across safety, integrity, research, and product.”Zuckerberg said he was particularly focused on the questions raised about their work with kids. “I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on the kinds of experiences I want my kids and others to have online, and it’s very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids.”Haugen’s complaint suggests that Facebook hid internal research on the scale of the negative impact that Instagram was having on young users. She has accused the company of repeatedly misleading users about claims of prioritising “meaningful social interactions” on its platforms, rather than the time spent metric.There are specific concerns about Instagram’s mental health impacts on its youngest users, something Facebook’s internal research has flagged. In her testimony, Haugen said Facebook choose to mislead and misdirect. While the internal research indicates otherwise, the public position Instagram took on the matter seemed quite cheerful, perhaps because of selective data. “The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced.” Last month, Instagram paused the development of its app meant for children below 13. The company justified the app saying kids are already online and were misrepresenting their age to download apps meant for older users. “While we’re pausing our development of ‘Instagram Kids’, we’ll continue our work to allow parents to oversee their children’s accounts by expanding these tools to teen accounts (aged 13 and over) on Instagram,” the company said in a statement.This adds strength to the argument about Facebook’s inability to prioritise the safety of young users.Zuckerberg said Facebook will do more research on the effects of social media on young people and make the results publicly available. He insisted the company did not push for profits ahead of user safety, privacy and well-being. “For example, one move that has been called into question is when we introduced the Meaningful Social Interactions change to News Feed. This change showed fewer viral videos and more content from friends and family -- which we did knowing it would mean people spent less time on Facebook, but that research suggested it was the right thing for people’s well-being.”In her complaint, Haugen said Facebook consistently resolved those conflicts in favour of its own profits. “The result has been a system that amplifies division, extremism, and polarization — and undermining societies around the world.”Zuckerberg did not respond to issues Haugen has cited regarding how Facebook has shown more interest in elections in certain countries. He did not also address the issues related to hate speech systems taking down 0.2% or so of the reported posts, etc.Haugen highlighted how Bengali as a language is still not available as a classifier for content moderation even though Facebook claimed so in 2019. She cited how certain groups were allowed to post dehumanising content, incite violence, and run duplicate accounts to amplify their messaging. A lot of these issues raised in the complaint have a direct and significant impact on India and over 340 million Facebook users in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-senate-hearing-zuckerberg-draws-flak-for-lack-of-leadership-101633510058581.html

Both sides addressed the country and said a probe will be conducted,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. He added Gandhi made reckless comments about the violence. “It is not a time for making reckless statements, but he has done that. Irresponsibility has become the second name of Rahul Gandhi.”Also Read: ‘Entire country awaiting justice in Lakhimpur Kheri violence’: Arvind KejriwalPatra criticised Gandhi for being selective in condemning attacks against farmers. He referred to the alleged police action against farmers in Congress-ruled Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh when they were demanding procurement of rice on the minimum support price (MSP). “What is this selective politics? In Hanumangarh farmers were attacked. Have he asked (chief minister) Ashok Gehlot about the incident?”Patra accused previous the Congress-led government of carrying out “systemic attacks on farmers” by not implementing the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Committee on MSP for eight years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-trying-to-misrepresent-situation-in-lakhimpur-kheri-bjp-101633508498067.html

After this, Congress general secretary KC Venugopal sent a letter to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the state's chief secretary saying many politicians have visited the area and only they are being denied the permission.He asked the state government to shed "obstructive and unconstitutional posturing" and allow Congress delegation to meet the families of the deceased farmers.The UP government, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that the opposition has adopted a “negative” attitude in the “sensitive” incident and warned that no one will be allowed to vitiate the atmosphere. Government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that the state government will go deep into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.Referring to Rahul Gandhi's visit, he said that "yuvraj" of a party has decided to go for political tourism as his sister is already there.

The police registered a case against her and 11 others for trying to distub peace in the area.Violence broke out in Tikunia, about 70 koilometres from Lakhimpur district centre, after a car ran over a group of protesters.

Four farmers were killed in the incident, and according to the police, four others died after being thrashed by the farmers.The Union minister has denied all the allegations and claimed his son was not present at the site.

Your state doesn't permit…': Gaming apps as Karnataka bans online games||Sequoia Capital-funded Mobile Premier League (MPL) was among the first few gaming startups that began blocking access to users in the Indian state of Karnataka on Wednesday following a ban on online gaming.The law, which came into effect late on Tuesday, bans online games involving betting and wagering, and "any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill".The latest ban has intensified concerns that growing state regulations could hit the nascent but booming gaming sector in India, where foreign investors have pumped in millions of dollars in recent months.On Wednesday morning, MPL's gaming app showed messages to users in Karnataka that said: "Sorry! The law in your state does not permit you to play Fantasy sports", "Fantasy games are locked" and "cash games are locked".The gaming app offers fantasy cricket and football games and allows real-money wagering on them.Dream11, one of India's most popular gaming apps backed by Tiger Global, was still operational, but Paytm First Games was not.Dream11 declined to comment, while MPL and Paytm did not immediately respond.Karnataka, home to some of the world's biggest tech companies and India's tech capital Bengaluru, is the latest Indian state that has banned such online games after Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu had also imposed such bans, but its bill was struck down by its high court.An industry source had told Reuters earlier that these states were important for the gaming business and account for roughly 20% of the total business for companies.Roland Landers, the chief executive of the All India Gaming Federation, said "the industry will challenge this in court and seek legal recourse".Two other industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday that gamers and some companies were planning to file court challenges against the new Karnataka law.The law imposes hefty fines and prison terms on violaters and has been implemented amid growing concerns that online gaming platforms, like gambling, are addictive and can cause financial harm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sorry-your-state-doesn-t-permit-gaming-apps-as-karnataka-bans-online-games-101633506112021.html

He also claimed that the government was trying to shield the killers.आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री जी, लखीमपुर घटना को लेकर आज सारा देश न्याय की उम्मीद कर रहा है | Delhi CM Shri @ArvindKejriwal Addressing an Important Press Conference | LIVE #JusticeForLakhimpur https://t.co/JlyCQ0SwTC“Why have the accused who ran over the farmers have not been arrested? Why are they being shielded from punishment? The entire nation watched on television how the violence unfolded, how the farmers were run over. It appears as if the entire system is engaged in saving those who are behind the incident despite murdering people in broad daylight and in front of so many people. We have seen such things only in Hindi movies,” Kejriwal said.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella of farmers' unions, alleged that one of the deceased farmers was shot dead by the minister’s son while the rest were allegedly run over by the vehicles of his convoy. The minister and his son, however, denied the claims even as an FIR has been registered against Ashish.On Tuesday, the Union minister refuted SKM's allegations by saying that his son was not present at the spot, adding he had evidence to prove that Ashish was innocent. The Union minister also said that his son will be ready to face any investigation from the agencies. ALSO READ | What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri: Sequence of events according to both sidesA 29-second video of Sunday’s violence surfaced in which an SUV could be seen ploughing through protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. The SUV reportedly belonged to the convoy of Ajay Kumar Mishra who was travelling to receive Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.While four farmers died after the convoy allegedly mowed down protesters opposing the deputy chief minister’s visit,  the other four people, reportedly BJP members, were allegedly thrashed to death. The farmer leaders claim that Ashish Mishra was in one of the cars which knocked down some protesters.Taking a dig at the government on this, Kejriwal said, “Today, people of this system are saying the vehicle involved in the violence did not have the minister’s son in it. After a week, this system will say there was no car in the incident and another week after that, they will say there were no farmers at the spot! The truth is that we do not have justice here. Today every citizen is demanding justice.”The BJP on Monday claimed that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party are “doing politics” under the pretence of farmers' protest.

More than 600 of them have died while protesting so far. Now, vehicles belonging to BJP ministers are running over them and crushing them to death. Why do you have so much hatred towards the farmers?

The development comes ahead of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s attempt to visit Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the kin of eight people, including four protesting farmers, who died after being run over by an SUV on Sunday.Earlier today, Congress claimed internet services have been suspended in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh where Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been detained.“The terrified UP govt has switched off the internet in Sitapur, where Smt. @priyankagandhi has been illegally held for over 48 hours. The dictatorial BJP rule in the Centre & state is trying to crush the voice of the Opposition. They will not succeed. We will not deter,” the party had tweeted.Meanwhile, in a press conference, Rahul Gandhi said that he will visit the Lakhimpur Kheri today with two chief ministers — Charanjit Singh Channi and Bhupesh Bhagel — to take stock of the incident and to meet the kin of the deceased. However, Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur had informed that Gandhi did not have the permission to visit the area.“If Gandhi arrives in Lucknow, we’ll request him at the airport not to visit Lakhimpur Kheri and Sitapur. The SP and DM of the two towns have urged us to stop him from coming in the wake of the law and order situation,” Thakur told reporters.According to reports, internet services were also shut in Bahraich for a few hours on Wednesday morning when the last of the deceased farmers was being cremated but was restored later.

The Prime Minister greeted his fellow countrymen on the auspicious occasion and sought Goddess Durga's blessings for the “well-being of our planet and the welfare of our citizens.” May everyone be happy as well as healthy in the times to come, Modi wished.“Shubho Mahalaya! We bow to Maa Durga and seek her blessings for the well-being of our planet and the welfare of our citizens. May everyone be happy as well as healthy in the times to come,” posted Prime Minister Modi from his official Twitter handle on Wednesday.The auspicious occasion of Mahalaya is also believed to be an invitation to Goddess Durga to descend upon the Earth. It is believed that ‘Maa Durga’ came to her devotees on Mahalaya, which is celebrated with much fervour and zeal.The dawn of Mahalaya holds a special significance to the millions of Bengalis in India, Bangladesh, and beyond. At 4am sharp, households tune in to their FM radios, where the All India Radio (AIR) continues to broadcast editions of the Mahishasura Mardini programme every year. Although the radio may now have been replaced by its more modern, easily accessible alternatives – the age-old tradition continues in several homes with its peculiar mix of nostalgia and hope as if to defy the passage of time.The Sanskrit recitations – Chandi Path – by Birendra Krishna Bhadra describes the epic battle of goddess Durga with the demon king Mahishashura; the script for the show was written by Bani Kumar, while the music was directed by Pankaj Kumar Mallik. It is believed that mantras called 'Mahisasura Mardini' invoke the Goddess; the most famous one being ‘Jago Tumi Jago.’The fervour and festivity surrounding Durga Pooja and Navaratri start with Mahalaya. Idols of Goddess Durga are transported to various pandals from this day, with the onset of the last round of preparation for the grand festival. Mahalaya brings with it a feeling of positivity, festivity, and warmth ahead of the start of the most anticipated festival. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shubho-mahalaya-pm-modi-extends-his-greetings-seeks-maa-durga-s-blessings-101633494160787.html
06-10-2021||India||Drugs seizure case like novels of Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie: NCB||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), probing the seizure of banned drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast, on Tuesday told a court here that the matter has become like the novels of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes with "new twists and turns every moment". The NCB has so far arrested 16 people, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan (23), in the drug seizure case. Earlier on Tuesday, additional chief metropolitan magistrate R M Nerlikar remanded Abdul Qadir Sheikh (30), Shreyas Nair (23), Manish Rajgariya (26) and Avin Sahu (30) to the NCB custody till October 11. The court on Monday remanded Aryan Khan and seven others to the NCB custody till Thursday. Before making his submissions for the remand of the four accused, special public prosecutor (SPP) Advait Sethna on Tuesday told the court that this case has become "like Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes novels as there is a new twist and turn at every moment". Remanding the four in the NCB custody till October 11, additional chief metropolitan magistrate R M Nerlikar said that considering the nature of the offence, a detailed investigation was necessary to go to the root of the case. Sethna then moved an application seeking to conduct the remand proceedings of Sheikh in the presence of limited people. To this, the judge said, "It means you want in-camera proceedings". The SPP's response was affirmative. The NCB said, "it was forced to take this step (seeking proceedings in the presence of a limited number of people) as today's remand is already in (media) coverage". The anti-drugs agency said it wanted to find out how it (remand) was leaked. It further submitted that a request has been made to minimise the exposure of the accused. However, the magistrate asked how Sheikh's identity could be protected when his name is already mentioned in the remand application. On the NCB's regarding the presence of media persons, the court said it cannot restrain media and rejected the application. Seeking custody, Sethna told the court that Sheikh was arrested from suburban Jogeshwari in Mumbai around 6 PM on Monday and a commercial quantity (of a drug) was seized from him. The NCB said it had seized 2.5 gm Ecstacy and 54.3 gm Mephedrone from Sheikh. He was arrested based on the information revealed during the custodial interrogation of other arrested accused Mohak Jaswal, the NCB said. The agency further submitted that 2 gm Charas was recovered from Nair. According to the NCB, both Sheikh and Nair are (drug) suppliers. The two other arrested accused (Rajgariya and Sahu) were guests on the cruise ship. In view of the seizures, "a nexus, links, role and involvement of all these persons required further corroboration," the NCB said. Sheikh, Nair, Rajgariya and Sahu were booked under sections 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell or purchase of drugs) and 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotics or drugs) and 27 A ( punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS). Advocate Apoorv Srivastava, appearing for Sheikh, said his client was made a "scapegoat to hide big faces". Srivastava contended that Sheikh didn't know Jaswal. The advocate said he didn't understand why Jaswal took Sheikh's name. He further said that Sheikh was arrested a day after the seizure of drugs which means it was a "premeditated case". The advocate, however, said Sheikh may be sent to custody for investigation for a brief period. Advocates of other accused objected to the remand application of the NCB, saying either a small number of drugs was seized from their clients or no seizure was made at all. The anti-drugs agency has so far arrested 16 people, including Aryan Khan, after raiding the Goa-bound ship on Saturday. The court on Monday had remanded Aryan Khan (23) and seven other accused to the NCB custody till Thursday. The NCB had told the court that "shocking and incriminating" material recovered in WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan and two others arrested in connection with the case showed international drug trafficking. The NCB had also claimed that in the WhatsApp chats, Aryan Khan is discussing modes of payment to be done for procurement (of drugs) and that several code names are being used. Aryan Khan's lawyer had claimed drugs were not recovered from the possession of his client. The NCB on Sunday said they had seized 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of Ecstasy and ₹1.33 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-seizure-case-like-novels-of-sherlock-holmes-and-agatha-christie-ncb-101633495878299.html

Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Gandhi said he will try to visit Lakhimpur Kheri along with two chief ministers to meet the families of those farmers who were killed on Sunday.The Uttar Pradesh government has already denied permission to Congress delegation for the visit citing imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144. Police barricades have been erected on the road to Lakhimpur Kheri since Tuesday night to prevent political leaders from entering the district.Also Read: TMC leaders ‘dodge’ cops, meet victims’ kin"The rights of the farmers are being systematically robbed.

If we didn't do this, nothing would have happened in Hathras too," said the Congress leader. He also criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for stopping Chhattisgarh chief minister and Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel at Lucknow airport, saying Section 144 deals with gathering of four or more people, but Baghel was alone.Gandhi is expected to land at Lucknow airport at 12.30pm, from where he will try to head to Lakhimpur Kheri.Among them was Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who claimed on Tuesday that he was going to meet Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Sitapur where she was detained but was not being allowed to leave the Lucknow airport.Also Read: Locals say video evidence proves gruesome episodeThe Uttar Pradesh Police has registered an FIR against Priyanka Gandhi and 11 others for "disturbing the peace" in the state.

Transgender persons would not be discriminated in terms of any position, training, promotion, transfer posting level. Any employee who violates the policy, or in any manner discriminates with any transgender persons, or harasses them would be dealt with as prescribed in the service rules,” a senior government official said, adding that department will provide equal employment opportunities without any discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, sexual orientation, colour, disability, marital status, nationality, race and religion.Also Read: Ex-Koraput MP seeks Union Territory status for erstwhile Dandakaranya regionIn June this year, Odisha police allowed transgenders to apply for the post of sub-inspectors while revenue and disaster management department opened its doors to transgenders for the post of revenue inspectors. So far 26 transgender persons have applied for the post of sub-inspector in Odisha police while around 20 applied for the post of revenue inspector. Around 40 transgenders are working in urban development department in the state.According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census (2011) in Odisha, there are 4,316 transgender households in rural areas and 463 transgender persons in urban areas. However, their present numbers would be much higher as they now have the courage to express their transgender identity with the Supreme Court of India granting legal recognition to a person‘s self-identified gender as either male, female or the third gender.Leading transgender activist Meera Parida said the equal opportunity policy was a welcome step in mainstreaming the transgenders. “For long we have been marginalised. Around 14.5% of the respondents in a statewide online Transgender Survey conducted by a government department in 2017 found that transgenders have no income and were living in poverty. We hope the Odisha would reserve 1% of government jobs for transgenders like Karnataka has done,” said Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-brings-policy-to-ensure-equal-opportunity-to-transgenders-101633494095700.html
06-10-2021||India||Key changes proposed in Forest Conservation Act 1980||The Union environment ministry has come out with a consultation paper on amending the Forest Conservation Act 1980 to bring significant changes to forest governance in India including facilitating private plantations for harvesting and exploration or extraction of oil and natural gas deep beneath forest land by drilling holes from outside the forest areas.Here are the highlights of the environment ministry’s proposal:Forests on private landUntil December 1996, provisions of the Forest Conservation Act only applied to the forests notified under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 or any other local law, and to those managed by the forest department. But after the Supreme Court judgement dated December 12, 1996 in TN Godavarman Thirumulpad versus Union of India and Others case, all areas that conformed to the ‘dictionary’ meaning of ‘forest’ were ordered to be also considered as forests.“Identification of such land is subjective and arbitrary to some extent. This leads to ambiguity and has been observed to have resulted into a lot of resentment and resistance particularly from private individuals and organisations. Considering any private area as forest, would restrict the right of an individual to use his/her own land for any non-forestry activity,” the ministry has said in its consultation paper.Even when diversion of such areas is allowed, the owner has to provide equivalent area of non-forest land and other compensatory levies to use his own land for intended non-forestry purpose. “This has further led to the tendency to keep most of the private lands devoid of vegetation even if there’s scope for planting activities. In view of this, it is felt extremely necessary to define the scope of application of the act in an objective manner,” it added.Achieving India’s climate targetOne of India’s nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement is to create a carbon sink expansion of additional (cumulative) 2.5–3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. “We also want to reduce the flow from foreign exchange for import of wood and wood derivatives to the tune of approximately ₹45 thousand crore. We had a thriving market for timber and wood products which disappeared. It has to be revived now,” a senior environment ministry official said.Also Read:We brought an ordinance to combat pollution in NCR: Bhupender YadavThe paper says that to achieve the NDC extensive plantations in all possible available lands outside the government forests was necessary. “But to ensure this, there is a need to dispel the apprehension among tree growers that vegetation or tree plantation raised on their private/ non forest lands will attract the provisions of the Act,” the paper states.Keeping some forests intactThe environment ministry is considering introducing a provision in the forest conservation act to keep certain pristine forests “showcasing rich ecological values” intact for a specific period.Go ahead to strategic projectsThe paper asks whether use of forest land for strategic and security projects of national importance should be exempted from the need to obtain prior approval from the Central government. Doling this will allow states to permit diversion of forest land for strategic and security projects that are to be completed in a given time frame.Oil and natural gas extractionThe paper proposes to facilitate new technologies such as extended reach drilling (ERD) for extraction of oil and natural gas found deep beneath the forest land by drilling holes from outside the forest areas. The paper suggests that this will not impact the soil or aquifer that supports the forest. “Ministry considers use of such technology is quite environment-friendly and as such should be kept outside the purview of FC Act,” it adds.Building in forestsTo ease the grievances of the individuals whose land fall in state specific private forests act or within the purview of dictionary meaning of forest, the ministry has proposed to allow them the right to construct structures for bonafide purposes including forest protection measures and residential units up to an area of 250 sq mtr as one time relaxation.According to the ministry, the amendment has been proposed to recognise the considerable changes in the ecological, social and environmental regimes in the country in the last 40 years. State governments have been asked to send their comments within 15 days."With these amendments the environment ministry looks to unlock land for infrastructure development and plantations, both of which are high on economic priorities. The 1996 Supreme Court order had banned the use of domestic timber for wood-based industries, including saw mills. This hugely increased raw material imports as a trade-off to conserve plantations and important forest areas. So, the underlying presumption is that private land, once released from the requirement of prior forest clearances will incentivize plantation-based carbon sinks. In reality, these lands will become market commodities and tradable assets both for private parties to sell, and government to acquire on behalf of private parties," said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research."On the infrastructure side, the environment ministry has prioritized the requirements of government agencies like NHAI and railways. It assumes that land once acquired by these agencies should be allowed for unencumbered use. However, this does not explicitly take into account that these acquisitions themselves may be based on unresolved land rights or may have created new livelihood base for people brought in to raise, maintain and sell the plantations on government land." she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-changes-proposed-in-forest-conservation-act-1980-101633492055682.html

In this case, the police have been able to defend the accused's attempt to seek anticipatory bail in court. The accused was arrested by the police on September 25 on the basis of clear evidence. The accused is still in police custody," Vijayan said while replying to Congress MLA PT Thomas.He also denied the opposition's allegation that the government supported those who tried to deceive the people by fabricating chempola (old engraving) regarding the rituals at Sabarimala.Leader of the opposition VD Satheesan claimed that the intelligence wing of the state police had red-flagged Mavunkal as a fraudster in May 2019 and submitted a detailed enquiry report in January 2020. "For two years no action was taken and now a probe is carried out when top cops who visited the house are still holding the position of power," said Satheesan before staging a walkout.The opposition noise in the Assembly came on a day when Kerala high court asked the state police chief whether he trusts the police under his command to carry out a proper investigation into the complaints against Mavunkal.“Allegations are flying thick and high against police officers of several ranks in the state. In such a situation, can the Crime Branch conduct a proper investigation (into complaints against Mavunkal),” was one of the queries posed to DGP Anil Kant by Justice Devan Ramachandran.The court said while the allegations against the police officers may not be correct, but since the force provided protection to the antique dealer despite being aware about the kind of items he had in his possession, it wants an answer from the police chief.For close to a decade, Mavunkal, 52, used a mixture of deceit, charm, and carefully cultivated influence to make the implausible possible. He sold a walking cane as the staff of Moses, small earthen pots as Lord Krishna's favourite “dahi handi” and paintings by someone in Kochi as Pablo Picasso's art.He was arrested by the crime branch, which kept the local police in the dark.There are 14 FIRs registered against Mavunkal in various police stations across the state, with the sections ranging from 450 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (impersonation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) to 471 (using forged documents) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monson-mavunkal-kerala-opposition-stages-walkout-from-assembly-attacks-cm-101633489919264.html

The only way to resolve the issues is to accord Union Territory status to these areas for which I have formed the Dandakaranya Parbatmala Vikash Parishad,” Pangi said.Koraput district was part of the Dandakaranya settlement project that began in September 1958 to rehabilitate those East Bengal migrants who could not be accommodated in West Bengal. Spread over an area of 80,000 square miles, the Dandakaranya Project also aimed to develop the tribal areas through construction of all-weather roads and railways, irrigation, agriculture and establishment of industries based on mineral and forest resources of the area. The first phase of the project was confined to the districts of Bastar in Chhatisgarh, undivided Koraput and Kalahandi districts of Odisha.Also Read: Father of Odisha’s forest officer seeks CBI probe in son’s death“The tribals of the undivided Koraput district living near the border areas of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are yet to see any development. Among other issues, these villages do not have road communication. Though I have raised their problems with the state government several times, I am told that I am doing it since I am a member of an opposition party. If this is the case, why should I remain in politics?” Pangi said.Pangi’s demand for Union Territory status to the hilly region is being seen as an attempt to be politically relevant. He, however said he will seek support from all parties towards his new found cause.A four-time MLA of Pottangi, Pangi was elected to the Parliament from Koraput Lok Sabha seat as a Biju Janata Dal candidate in the 2009 elections. However, after he was suspended, he quit the BJD in May 2017 and joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-koraput-mp-seeks-union-territory-status-for-erstwhile-dandakaranya-region-101633489835142.html

Resumption of in person learning in schools at these 61 villages has not been allowed. Rajendra Bhosale, district collector, said it was a precautionary step . “The daily cases are more concerning for us even though it has become stable. As a precautionary step, I decided to impose a ten-day lockdown in the villages from where most of the cases were coming,” he said. Bhosale, however, said that expansion of testing was also behind high number of daily cases registered in the district. “We are taking all precautionary measures and have stepped up the daily testing and the number of daily cases is high. We are conducting around 20,000 tests a day and are looking to increase it even further,” he added.

We are very aggressively looking at any new variant coming up in Ahmednagar district.” From Monday, schools in urban areas were reopened for class 8 to 12.

The party had sought permission from UP government for Gandhi-led five-member delegation to to visit Lakhimpur Kheri as leaders from Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) were allowed to visit the district on Tuesday.2. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday gave a week’s ultimatum to the Uttar Pradesh government for arresting Teni's son. “We have given a week to the government to arrest the son of the Union MoS (Home). We all will gather here again on the day of ‘bhog’ (a ritual during the 13-day post-death mourning period) and then will discuss and decide the future strategy,” Tikait told media.3. A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the Lakhimpuri Kheri violence. The petitioners have sought FIR against the ministers involved in the incident.4. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday met Union home minister Amit Shah at his residence and discussed the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Channi said such barbaric acts would not be tolerated. Besides, he also condemned the manner in which Congress leaders were arrested, who were on their way to meet the victim families.

06-10-2021||India||Central team in Mizoram to assess Covid-19 situation amid spike in infections||A four-member central team, led by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) consultant-epidemiologist Dr Vinita Gupta, arrived in Aizawl on Tuesday to assess the Covid-19 situation, amid the spurt in infections in Mizoram, an official statement here said. Shortly after the team's arrival in the state capital on Tuesday, its members held a meeting with officials of State Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), chief medical officers (CMOs) of Aizawl East and Aizawl West and discussed ways to combat the situation. The team will hold another virtual meeting with chief medical officers of various districts on Wednesday to review the measures being taken to control the spread of the disease across the state, the statement said. The members of the central team will also visit Covid-19 care facilities in Aizawl West during the day. Mizoram continues to register a spike in coronavirus cases with 1,681 new infections reported on Tuesday, which pushed the state's tally to 99,856, a health department official said. The death toll rose to 331 as five more people succumbed to the infection, he said. The single-day positivity rate stood at 18 per cent as the fresh cases were detected from 9,331 sample tests. At least 322 children were among the newly infected people, he said. Meanwhile, a state-level expert team on Covid-19 management, which was formed in September, underlined that more attention has to be paid to symptomatic patients, high-risk groups such as pregnant women and the elderly with comorbid conditions. The team convener, Dr F Lallianhlira, who is also principal director of state health department, told a press meet on Tuesday that a report has been submitted to the state government, seeking revision of standard operating procedurew (SOP) for Covid-19 test and home isolation, among other suggestions. The expert team has also recommended strengthening of Covid-19 care facilities in the state and establishment of a dedicated wing in all district hospitals, he said. Mizoram currently has just one Covid-19 hospital, the Zoram Medical College (ZMC), with 341 beds including 34 in ICU, and around 18 dedicated health centres (DCHCs). A ten-day campaign to sensitise people about the importance of using face mask and sanitiser is likely to be organised from October 11, Lallianhlira added. Opposition Congress, during the day, staged a demonstration in Aizawl, blaming the state government for the Covid-19 situation in Mizoram. The protesters sought setting up of a Covid-19 designated hospital in all the districts, and arrangement of relief for the poor amid the pandemic. They also demanded health minister Dr R Lalthangliana's resignation. Addressing an event, Congress Legislature Party leader Zodintluanga Ralte alleged that the ruling Mizo National Front government, headed by Chief Minister Zoramthanga, has "completely failed to control the rising Covid-19 cases" in the state. He held Lalthangliana and health and family welfare board senior member Dr Z R Thiamsanga, who is also chairman of medical operational team of Covid-19, responsible for the current state of affairs in Mizoram. "I deeply regret the fact that over 300 people lost their lives due to Covid-19. Several residents are facing livelihood crisis due to the inefficiency of the health minister and medical operational team chairman," Ralte added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-in-mizoram-to-assess-covid-19-situation-amid-spike-in-infections-101633482732573.html
06-10-2021||India||Mahalaya: Birendra Krishna Bhadra heralds the arrival of Durga Puja; here's why an age-old tradition still inspires hope||Durga Puja, for the festival-loving Bengalis, is practically here already; with the land waking up as usual in the dawn of Mahalaya to an age-old tradition – tuned in to the enchanting melody of Birendra Krishna Bhadra's voice on ‘Mahishasura Mardini’, a set of Sanskrit recitations on India's oldest radio show aired by the All India Radio Calcutta (now Kolkata) for the first time in the 1930s. According to the scriptures, it is on Mahalaya that the ‘Pitru Paksha’, or the 16-day lunar day period when Hindus pay homage to their ancestors (Pitrs), ends – thereby beginning the ‘Devi Paksha’ (“the era of the goddess”) which the arrival of Goddess Durga, and the festival centered around her worship – Durga Puja – heralds.Also Read | Mahalaya 2021: All you need to know about the history, significance and dateThe dawn of Mahalaya holds a special significance to the millions of Bengalis in India, Bangladesh, and beyond. At 4am sharp, households tune in to their FM radios, where the All India Radio (AIR) continues to broadcast editions of the Mahishasura Mardini programme every year. Although the radio may now have been replaced by its more modern, easily accessible alternatives – the age-old tradition continues in several homes with its peculiar mix of nostalgia and hope as if to defy the passage of time.Birendra Krishna Bhadra, the late radio broadcaster, playwright, actor, narrator, and theatre actor from Kolkata, is undoubtedly still the star of the show. His legacy – the Sanskrit ‘Chandi Path’ recitation – has been described as “bewitching”, and without it, the occasion of Mahalaya remains incomplete for many Bengalis. They wait for the riveting chant to begin at the onset of the day, eyeing the arrival of Durga Puja with as much enthusiasm.Also Read | ‘Ban on carnival, cultural programmes…’: Bengal govt issues Covid-19 guidelines ahead of Durga PujaMahishashura Mardini, the two-hour programme, describes the epic battle of goddess Durga with the demon king Mahishashura; the script for the show was written by Bani Kumar, while the music was directed by Pankaj Kumar Mallik. The rendition recorded by Birendra Krishna Bhadra eventually went on to become so popular that even Uttam Kumar, the late Bengali actor of fame, did not receive a favourable reception when he was employed to recite the programme back in 1976. It was later shifted back to Bhadra's original version of the recitations; his daughter Sujata Bhadra received accreditations from Saregama India Ltd on Mahalaya day in 2006 in recognition of the legacy and royalty of work.Did you miss listening to Mahishasur Mardini that was aired this morning by All India Radio on the auspicious occasion of Mahalaya?Listen to Mahishasur Mardini from here!Hindi, Sanskrit - https://t.co/Kxnv46JIx5Bengali - https://t.co/l6CHH31uI7#Navratri #MahalayaA 90-minute-long Mahishasura Mardini was first composed in 1931 under the supervision of Pankaj Kumar Mallik. A live performance of the recitations was aired by the radio every year hence, featuring notable artists like Manabendra Mukhopadhyay and Arati Mukhopadhyay. The show was first recorded in 1966, following which the All India Radio continued to air the recorded version each year at the dawn of Mahalaya. The broadcaster also attempted to “re-record” the programme multiple times with several different artists, but those never received popular appreciation among the nostalgic Bengalis, who believe no one else could neither emulate nor succeed Bhadra's riveting melody. Birendra Krishna's tour de force remains his enduring legacy for the millions in this land and beyond; one that is not unending, but everlasting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahalaya-birendra-krishna-bhadra-heralds-the-arrival-of-durga-puja-here-s-why-an-age-old-tradition-still-inspires-hope-101633478469579.html

06-10-2021||India||Pakistan court gives India more time to appoint lawyer for Kulbhushan Jadhav||The Islamabad high court on Tuesday allowed India more time to appoint a lawyer to represent Kulbhushan Jadhav to hear a review of his conviction and sentencing by a military court. Jadhav has been sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying.Attorney General for Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan reminded the court that it had passed an order on May 5 asking the authorities to make one more effort to contact India for the appointment of a counsel.He informed the court that the message was conveyed to India but there has been no response so far. The court then adjourned the hearing of the case for an indefinite period.Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was arrested in March 2016 in Pakistan’s Balochistan province on charges of spying and sentenced to death by a military court the following year. India has rejected the charges levelled against him and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.India approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.After hearing both sides, the Hague-based ICJ issued a verdict in July, 2019, asking Pakistan to give India consular access to Jadhav and also ensure review of his conviction.No progress has been made on the review issue as India refused to appoint a local lawyer while demanding Pakistan to let an Indian lawyer represent Jadhav in the court.Pakistan has said that India is engaging in a campaign to obfuscate the issue of appointing a lawyer to represent Jadhav. Pakistan’s Foreign Office said paragraph 118 of the ICJ’s judgement requires India to “act in good faith, and arrange legal representation” for Jadhav.The statement came after India asked Pakistan to address the "shortcomings" in a bill brought out to facilitate reviewing the case of Jadhav, saying the proposed law does not create a mechanism to reconsider it as mandated by the ICJ.India said the bill passed by Pakistan's National Assembly in June has several shortcomings and does not “create a machinery to facilitate effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case, as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-court-gives-india-more-time-to-appoint-lawyer-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-101633479589830.html

06-10-2021||India||Lawrence School marks 174th Founder’s Day||The three-day celebrations of the 174th Founder’s Day at Lawrence School, Sanawar, ended on Monday, with participation of over 300 on-campus students and others who joined online, said a statement from the school.The school in Himachal Pradesh’s Sanawar was established in 1847. Headmaster Himmat Singh Dhillon paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and said, “Students should lead a life that values character and integrity.” He reminded the students about the belief firmly held by the father of the nation: “Be the change you wish to see. Only changing oneself can lead to a sustainable change in the world.”While the school’s head boy, Nihal Singh Sidhu, spoke about many aspects of the virtuous life of Gandhi, the head girl, Pavya Singh, called upon everyone to shun all kinds of destructive weapons and fortify “oneself with the power of truth and non-violence.”The school also remembered the struggle of the freedom fighters including its alumni, Arun Khetarpal, who was awarded Param Vir Chakra for his supreme sacrifice in the 1971 Indo-Pak war.A special chapel service was organised to felicitate old students of the school who had graduated 25 years ago, 50 years ago and 60 years ago, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawrence-school-marks-174th-founder-s-day-101633474263819.html

We, however, managed to dodge the cops and took a different route, and even walked through paddy fields as police had blocked almost all the roads,” Dastidar told HT.Following her interaction with families of the deceased and villagers, the TMC lawmaker claimed that the “people are furious and want a fresh post mortem of the dead bodies in Delhi, as they don’t trust the post mortem conducted at the local level”.The TMC MPs were continuously in touch with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who instructed them to camp in that area and interact with villagers, the people cited above said.“Beyond appalling how the @BJP4UP government is treating our farmers! Every day is turning out to be a new disaster while Mr. @narendramodi remains silent! Shameful state of affairs!” Dastidar tweeted.The local administration, however, refuted claims of MPs of ‘dodging the police’. “It is not that the district is completely sealed... And these are not the first ones who managed to reach. Some others also managed--for instance the Chandra Shekhar Azad (Bhim Army) or some leaders of RLD. If people if are not in large motorcades or if they are not big leaders, not conspicuous, they can. Aren’t you people (journalist) going there easily, without any hassle”, said a senior state government officer requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leaders-dodge-cops-meet-victims-kin-101633473326839.html

He represents the Surma constituency.The TMC is trying to make inroads in Tripura and its leaders, including national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, have been lately visiting the state. The young TMC Lok Sabha MP has announced that his party will oust the BJP government in the 2023 assembly polls. In Kolkata, Ashish Das told reporters that he, like many others back in Tripura, had put his faith in the BJP to end the “misrule of the Left Front government” led by Manik Sarkar. But it was a mistake, he said.“I will keep my head shaved till the BJP government is ousted in 2023. Today, I took a dip in the Ganga and offered prayers at the Kalighat temple because joining the BJP was a crime,” said Das. He shaved his head and performed puja after taking a dip in the Adi Ganga, an old distributary of the Hooghly river. “The problem in Tripura arises not because of Biplab Deb alone. BJP’s national leaders keep visiting states in the north-east but they have done nothing to solve problems people face in this region,” Das added. Das had a meeting with Abhishek Banerjee on Tuesday afternoon and he is likely to join the TMC on Wednesday, TMC leaders in Kolkata said.Tripura TMC leader Ashish Lal Singh said Ashish Das would join the TMC on Wednesday. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh promptly took a dig at Ashish Das. “We will see how he goes through his penance in the TMC,” he said.Like Dakshineswar, the Kalighat temple is among the most famous temples of Kali and top BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, offered prayers there before the March-April assembly polls. Shah’s wife visited Kalighat as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-mla-ashish-das-shaves-head-in-kolkata-says-it-s-act-of-penance-before-joining-tmc-101633465636257.html
06-10-2021||India||Ex-Odisha MP Jayaram Pangi says he will quit BJP, focus on UT demand for Koraput||BHUBANESWAR: Former Koraput lawmaker Jayaram Pangi on Tuesday announced his decision to quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and start a campaign to seek Union Territory status for undivided Koraput district and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.Pangi, once considered a tribal heavyweight who defeated Congress veteran and nine-time MP Giridhar Gamang in the 2009 Lok Sabha election on a Biju Janata Dal (BJD) ticket, hopped across to the BJP in May 2017. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from tribal-dominated Koraput seat on a BJP ticket, lost to Congress’ Saptagiri Ulaka and subsequently found himself sidelined by the party.The four-time Pottangi legislator said he was quitting the BJP because he wants to do something for his native place and the people of the undivided Koraput district.“I have been doing party politics for the last 44 years but in the dusk of life, I want to dedicate my time towards the greater development of undivided Koraput which I have been unable to do so far,” the 66-year-old politician said.“The only way to resolve the issues is to accord Union Territory status to these areas for which I have formed the Dandakaranya Parbatmala Vikash Parishad. As it is very difficult for a person to shoulder two major responsibilities at a time, I have decided to quit the BJP,” Pangi said.Koraput district was part of the Dandakaranya settlement project that began in September 1958 to rehabilitate East Bengali migrants who could not be accommodated in West Bengal. Spread over an area of 80,000 square miles, the aim of project was not just to rehabilitate the migrants but also develop infrastructure for the resident tribals through construction of all-weather roads and railways, irrigation, agriculture and establishment of industries based on mineral and forest resources of the area.The first phase of the project was confined to the districts of Bastar in Chhattisgarh, undivided Koraput and Kalahandi districts of Odisha.“Tribals of the undivided Koraput district living near the border areas of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are yet to see any development. Among other issues, these villages do not have road linkages. Though I have raised their problems with the state government several times, I am told that I am doing it since I am a member of an opposition party. If this is the case, why should I remain in politics?” Pangi said.He, however, said he will seek the support of all parties to raise the demand for UT status to the Dandakaranya Parbatmala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exodisha-mp-jayaram-pangi-says-he-will-quit-bjp-focus-on-ut-demand-for-koraput-101633464376094.html
06-10-2021||India||Need guidelines on putting banners: Madras HC to Tamil Nadu govt||Expressing concerns over the practice of erecting banners and cut-outs of politicians, the Madras high court on Tuesday directed the Tamil Nadu government to draw up guidelines to be issued and indicate measures to stop the practice as it cause difficulties to the common man. The first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and P D Audikesavalu was hearing a Public Interest Litigation filed by a Villupuram-based advocate E R Manoharan. The matter pertains to footpaths and pathways along highways and also parts of carriageways in arterial roads and highways being blocked with posters, festoons, buntings and cut-outs of political leaders being put up for minor functions, and the plea sought directions to initiate action against politicians who do so. It brought up death in the Villupuram district earlier in August of a 13-year-old boy due to electrocution while helping the ruling party cadre of the DMK to tie flags on poles. The court directed the state to file counter-affidavits within the next six weeks for when the matter is posted to next. “A comprehensive set of guidelines need to be issued, and the State should indicate the appropriate measures necessary to discourage and completely stop this practice which impedes pedestrian and vehicular movement,” the court said in its orders. “It would be best if the State could suggest some disincentive or penalty if such temporary constructions are put up at any public space.”“It is especially dangerous when temporary constructions are put up at intersections in the form of welcome arches or gates to invite political leaders,” the court said. Tamil Nadu Advocate-General R Shunmugasundaram submitted to the court that the chief minister M K Stalin had instructed the party cadre against putting up banners, flex boards and cut-outs. “Though learned Advocate-General submits that the present government has prohibited such practice for the political party which is in power, the temporary constructions are seen to come up all over the place and remain long after the event is over,” the court observed. Several activists have rallied against erecting illegal poles and banners, which is a widespread culture across the state by all political parties.In Villupuram earlier this year, the deceased boy, Dinesh of class 9 was helping party workers decorate a road to welcome higher education minister K Ponmudy for a marriage function in Villupuram. The minister has announced a compensation of ₹1.5 lakhs to the boy’s family. This led to a political furore in the state with the AIADMK and BJP asking Stalin to take action against those responsible. Two years ago, a 23-year-old woman Subashshree died after an AIADMK banner fell on her in Chennai, which triggered a massive outrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-guidelines-on-putting-banners-madras-hc-to-tamil-nadu-govt-101633461675961.html
06-10-2021||India||Ex-Bahrain cop held for drug trafficking from Kerala||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday arrested a 50-year-old man from Kerala, who was allegedly trafficking hashish to the Gulf countries with bases in metro cities across the country. According to NCB, the accused, a former police officer in Bahrain, procured the drugs from Manali and took them to Kochi via Bengaluru before smuggling them to Gulf counties. “Based on specific intelligence, the officers of the NCB, Cochin sub zone, seized 3.5 kgs of hashish oil from a courier consignment at Ernakulam on September 12. The said consignment was destined for Bahrain. In a swift follow-up action, the sender of the consignment was apprehended by officers of NCB, at Bengaluru on September 29, and his associate was also apprehended at Kasargod on October 4, by the Kochi team,” read a statement from the NCB. According to NCB officials, the interrogation of the man arrested on September 12, revealed that the operation was masterminded by the former cop. He was on the run since and had eventually come to Bengaluru. Based on a tipoff, the NCB team led by Amit Ghawate, zonal director, tracked the train he had boarded while returning from Manali after meeting his contacts. He was arrested and booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. “The accused had packed the drug consignments into boxes as a ‘prasad’ and also as Ayurveda medicines. He is also responsible for managing the international contacts and coordinating the supply of the drugs,” said a senior NCB official. According to officials, he has been running the operation for the past three years. “He served as a police officer in Bahrain for 20 years. He retired and settled down in Kerala in 2014. With the contacts he made during this time in the police he began supplying drugs,” said the officials. The Kerala NCB sleuths came to know about the drug cartel run by the accused and managed to intercept courier consignment being sent to Bahrain from Kerala.The NCB further added that based on another specific intelligence, officers of Cochin sub zone seized 11.6 kg of Pseudoephedrine, a controlled substance from a courier consignment at Ernakulam on September 22. The said consignment was destined for Australia. In a similar operation, the officers of NCB, Chennai zonal unit seized around 8 kgs of Pseudoephedrine from two consignments at Air Cargo, Chennai International Airport, on September 26.“The said parcels were booked at a courier franchisee office at Karaikal. In a swift follow-up action, the consignor of the consignment was arrested in Chennai on September 29. Further, it is pertinent to mention that the details of another consignment send by the same consignor were ascertained during the investigation and the same was shared with Australian authorities, which resulted in the seizure of 4 kgs of Pseudoephedrine from the parcel in Australia,” read an NCB statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exbahrain-cop-held-for-drug-trafficking-from-kerala-101633461566272.html
06-10-2021||India||Karnataka to set up sub-panel to look into Datta Peeta issue||The Karnataka Cabinet on Tuesday decided to set up a sub-committee to look into the Datta Peeta issue, a cave shrine in Chikmagalur district’s Baba Budangiri mountains, in which the high court had directed the state government to appoint a Hindu priest for the temple.JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs on Tuesday said that the sub-committee under his chairmanship would look at the next course of action in the issue.“What decision the high court has given, the pros and cons and how to proceed in the matter will be discussed in this sub-committee,” Madhuswamy said on Tuesday in Bengaluru.Revenue Minister R Ashoka, energy minister V Sunil Kumar and Minister for Muzarai, Haj & Wakf Shashikala Jolle will be the members of the sub-committee, he added.The shrine has been the centre of Hindutva movements in the district with pro-saffron outfits demanding that a Hindu priest be appointed and correct the wrongs done by the Siddaramaiah-led state government between 2013-18.BJP’s national general secretary and legislator from Chickmagalur, CT Ravi, last week, lauded the HC’s order and accused Siddaramaiah of weaving a web of lies to instate a Muslim maulvi as the priest of the shrine that dates back several centuries with conflicting accounts of its history. The shrine is on the Chandra Drona Range, some of the highest between the Himalayas and the Nilgiris, and history has it that it was a sufi Saint Baba Budan who first brought coffee seeds from Yemen that were introduced in these mountain ranges for the first time.The controversy is around the Peetha which, according to court documents, was a major Muzarai temple under the Mysore Religious and Charitable Institutions Act, 1927 but was taken over by the state Wakf board on April 6 1973, just before Emergency was imposed in the country. This was contested in 1978.The order stated that the Endowment commissioner’s report had rightly recorded that Shri Dattatreya is well known as son of Sage Athri by his virtuous wife Anasuya and embodiment of Hindu trinity, the Gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.The Endowment commissioners report was submitted on March 10 2010 before the Supreme Court, suggesting that a Hindu Archak or priest be appointed by the management committee of the shrine.The issue had gained traction in the run up to the 2018 assembly elections in Karnataka with the BJP accusing Siddaramaiah of pandering to the minorities vote bank.The Karnataka HC said that the order by the state government was unsustainable in law because it was contrary to the Supreme Court’s order that the state cabinet would take a decision in this regard considering the pros and cons of the matter but instead delegated it to a high level committee.The HC also listed five other reasons which included that the high level committee was not free from bias.In its sixth reason, the HC said that the 2018 order “infringes the right of both communities guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution by preventing Hindus from performing pooja as per their faith and compelling the Mujawar to offer puja contrary to his faith.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-to-set-up-sub-panel-to-look-into-datta-peeta-issue-101633461497144.html
06-10-2021||India||23-yr-old woman set ablaze for resisting rape in Yadgir, Karnataka, dies; 1 held||A 23-year-old married woman died after she was allegedly set on fire for resisting a rape attempt by a man at a village near Shahapur town in Karnataka’s Yadgir district, police said on Tuesday, adding that a case has been registered against the accused, who has surrendered. Superintendent of police, Yadgir, CB Vedamurthy, told the reporters that the accused entered the victim’s house post-midnight on October 3 when her husband was away. “Around 2 am, the accused barged into the home of the victim and tried to rape her. When the woman resisted his advances, the man left the house. He came back later carrying petrol he took from his motorcycle and set her on fire,” said the SP. Soon after the incident, the victim’s neighbours rushed to the spot and extinguished the flames. The woman was rushed to Surapura taluk hospital on October 4 morning and later shifted to Kalaburagi district hospital after her condition worsened. She succumbed to her injuries on Monday evening, police said. Surapura police have registered the case after recording the statement of the victim in the hospital before she succumbed. Police said the accused, identified as Gangeppa, a resident of Chowdeshwarihala village, has surrendered. “The police department has taken the case very seriously. Surapura police have registered a suo motu case and the matter will be investigated and a charge sheet will be filed at the earliest,” Vedamurthy said.Meanwhile, Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra on Tuesday told reporters that severe punishment will be handed out to the accused. “An unfortunate and inhumane incident has taken place at a village in Yadgir district. The accused has surrendered at Surapura police station. Police are investigating the case. Severe punishment will be awarded to the accused,” he said. Last month, another such incident rocked Yadgir district after a video showed four men stripping, sexually abusing, and assaulting a Dalit woman on the Yadgir-Shahapur state highway. The purported video, reportedly filmed a year ago, also showed the miscreants clicking selfies with the victim during the assault. Police have so far arrested nine people in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23yrold-woman-set-ablaze-for-resisting-rape-in-yadgir-dies-1-held-101633461440729.html
06-10-2021||India||Karnataka govt plans ‘technology schools’, aim to build talent pool in other parts of state||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday emphasised the need for ‘technology schools’ at the high school level to spread out its prowess in the sector to other parts of the state.The initiative is part of “Beyond Bengaluru ‘’ where the state government will look to create a talent pool in other cities of the state, enabling them to attract investments away from its capital, leading to equitable growth of Karnataka.“There was a technology school in Hubli way back in 1960 which was closed later. But, technology schools need to be started considering the fact that perception ability will be more during childhood”, Bommai said on Tuesday.The chief minister added that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee’ tinkering labs should be upgraded and artificial intelligence must be included at that level at least to some extent. He also said that Polytechnics institutes need to be upgraded as well.A significant number of the world’s biggest corporations have a presence in Bengaluru and the administration has been trying to get some of these investors to consider expanding operations to other parts of the state to stem mass migrations into a city that already is home to almost a quarter of the state’s 70 million population.Dr.C.N.Ashwath Narayan, the minister for IT/BT and S&T said, a center of excellence (CoE) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Date Engineering will be set up soon in Hubballi.Karnataka is trying to be the first in the country to implement the National Education Policy (NEP) which, the minister said, aspires to ready the students as per the global technological developments and coding will be taught for students at the school level itself..“The government has brought in effective policies to promote innovative technologies and the duration of the internship has risen from 3 weeks to 30 weeks. Students will also be given the opportunity to undergo internship in foreign countries,” Narayan said.The gap in learning--and teaching--is getting wider as government schools in the state, especially in rural areas, have not been able to compete with private educational institutions, adding to the problem of unemployment in states like Karnataka and other regions of the country.The Karnataka government was forced to restart physical classes for school children after most of them lost a year without access to the internet or other devices to benefit from online education.Data shared by the Karnataka government on July 1 shows that of the 9.3 million who have been accounted for, only 5,859,907 have smartphones/tablets and around 3,127,524 without any access to such devices. Further, there are just 5,134,386 students who have access to the internet while 3,779,965 students do not have access to the internet, rendering the exercise of online classes as a redundant practice for these children, mostly from rural and backward regions of the state.In Bengaluru (rural, south and north), there are 178,612 students who have been accounted for out of the total 1,992,100.

06-10-2021||India||Dashboard launched to monitor projects in Bengaluru||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday launched the dashboard that allows real-time monitoring of major projects in Bengaluru to avoid delays and speedy implementation.The dashboard, according to the chief minister’s office (CMO), would provide accurate and up-to-date information on all major projects in the city that has become synonymous for its crumbling infrastructure as much as its prowess in Information Technology, startups and science.“Officers should pay equal importance to planning as well as implementation. Senior officers must ensure that the officials at grassroot levels deliver the facility to the last man in the society. Effective implementation will bring people closer to the system and they feel that someone is there for them. We need to strive to achieve this,” Bommai said on Tuesday.The chief minister had announced plans to bring out a dashboard on August 28 to monitor all mega projects in the city to help avoid delays and timely implementation.Bengaluru, home to almost a quarter of Karnataka’s total population, is a city that aspires to be recognized as a global hub but has been struggling to cope with its own rapid and unplanned growth.Many mega projects like the Metro, Outer Ring Road, flyovers and several other public works have led to huge challenges for the residents and the 9.4 million vehicles that ply on its poor quality roads.The chief minister had even admitted in the recently concluded monsoon session of the state legislature that around ₹20,000 crore has been spent on fixing roads in Bengaluru over the past five years.Bengaluru has 13,847 kms of arterial and sub-arterial roads, of which only 295 kms are said to be in good condition and another 246 kms have now been ridden of potholes, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)Potholes and bad roads have even taken lives in the city as hapless citizens tread on dug-up streets, open manholes and other life-threatening conditions.The poor planning of drains, encroachments and unplanned nature of construction often leads to water clogging in Bengaluru. Rain water also gushes into basements of apartments and other buildings, causing crores of losses to residents who end up bearing the brunt of civic apathy.Most of Bengaluru’s roads are in tatters after being dug up on account of projects like “smart city” or any other developmental work, adding to the nightmare of the city’s over 12 million residents and 9.4 million vehicles.The rains in Bengaluru have made matters worse in the city as it poses a danger and a hurdle to pedestrians and motorists alike.But money spent, or claimed to have been spent, on infrastructure like roads, drains and other basic amenities have fallen short of meeting expectations.The Karnataka government on September 30 had said that all roads in Bengaluru will be pothole-free in 30 days, setting another deadline, after many missed ones, to provide one of the most basic amenities to the city’s over 12 million residents.The assurance on road repair comes ahead of the BBMP elections that are expected to be held early next year.Bommai had earlier said that he would dedicate his first working hour each day to monitor ongoing projects in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dashboard-launched-to-monitor-projects-in-bengaluru-101633461382847.html

Makarabbi village where the tragedy took place has a population of more than 2,000 people. Talking to the media, taluk health inspector Vinod said that 9 cases of vomiting and loose motion were reported first on August 26, and they were admitted to a nearby hospital. “They responded to the treatment and recovered. A team of officers visited the village and collected three samples of water. Among these, 2 samples report showed that the water is unfit to be used for drinking,” he said. Later, on September 23, cases of vomiting and loose motion were reported again.

The Centre had told the high court that Twitter has complied with the Information Technology Rules, 2021 and has appointed three-tier grievance redressal officers as their “employee” and not as a “contingent worker”.“I submit that Twitter has appointed the personnel in compliance to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 hereinafter referred as IT Rules, 2021,” Centre’s response in the high court said.It said that Twitter has provided the names of the personnel appointed along with their respective positions, date of employment and contracts.Taking note of the submissions, Justice Palli disposed of the plea. Twitter, in its affidavit, said it had appointed a permanent Resident Grievance Officer (RGO), Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Nodal Contact officer (NCO) in compliance to the new Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021 on August 4.The affidavit was filed on September 22, in a petition by lawyer Amit Acharya who had contended that IT Rules came into effect from February 25 and the Centre had given three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply with them.However, even after the lapse of three-month period on May 25, till date no resident grievance officer was appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform, due which, he could not take action against two alleged offensive tweets by TMC MP Mohua Moitra and journalist Swati Chaturvedi.Twitter had later disposed of his plea saying that the tweets in question were not offensive according to its policies.On August 6, Twitter, through an affidavit, had told the court that it had appointed Vinay Prakash, an Indian resident, as the RGO and CCO on August 4. It further added that Shahin Komath has been employed as the NCO.However, the Centre had said that the position was “yet to be verified” and had sought time to recheck the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-disposes-of-plea-against-twitter-says-satisfied-with-it-rules-compliance-101633461137063.html

06-10-2021||India||Kerala HC raps police over Mavunkal probe||The Kerala high court on Tuesday asked the State Police chief whether he trusts the police under his command to carry out a proper investigation into the complaints against controversial antiques dealer Monson Mavunkal when allegations are “flying thick and high” against police officers of various ranks in the state.“Allegations are flying thick and high against police officers of several ranks in the state. In such a situation, can the Crime Branch conduct a proper investigation (into complaints against Mavunkal),” was one of the queries posed to DGP Anil Kant by Justice Devan Ramachandran.The court said that while the allegations against the police officers may not be correct, but since the force provided protection to the antique, dealer despite being aware about the kind of items -- including elephant tusks -- which he had in his possession, instead of taking him into custody, “can Kerala Police be trusted”?”I don’t know. Let the State Police Chief (SPC) tell me,” Justice Ramachandran said.“The DGP has to tell me whether he trusts the police under his command to carry out a proper investigation. The SPC has to inform the court whether an investigation would be apposite by an agency in Kerala when allegations have been made against police officers of several ranks,” the court said.It said that it was indicating its prima facie view as it was interested in ensuring a proper probe.The court directed that the SPC has to file a detailed counter affidavit touching all the points raised by the court and the investigation carried out so far on complaints against Mavunkal.The court’s searching queries assume significance as Mavunkal has been a source of embarrassment and concern for the state government and the police due to his alleged links to senior officials of both.On Tuesday, the opposition UDF tried to corner the Left government and its police force in the Kerala Assembly over the high profile cheating cases involving the self-styled antique dealer even as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan rejected their charges saying the investigation in the case was progressing in the right direction.The UDF also accused former DGP Loknath Behera, a close confidant of Vijayan, for having connections with Mavunkal.The photos of the retired police chief, sitting on the “throne of Tipu Sultan” along with senior IPS officer and ADGP Manoj Abraham holding an “antique” sword at the accused’s house, were widely circulated on social media platforms and in news reports which also claimed that the former DGP granted police protection to the fake antique dealer despite an intelligence report against him.Referring to news reports on the police protection, the court asked how such a decision was taken “Instead of taking him into custody”.“How did the police and the intelligence not see what he was up to? How was he allowed to operate? How no suspicions were raised regarding him,” were the other queries posed by the court.It further said that when someone is given police protection, he acquires a certain status and credibility in society and people tend to trust such persons as a result.The court was hearing a plea by the antique dealer’s former driver-cum-mechanic alleging harassment by his former employer and some police officers close to him after he made certain disclosures to police in connection with a cheating case against Mavunkal.In his petition, filed through advocates Philip T Varghese and Thomas T Varghese, the driver -- Ajith E V -- has alleged that Mavunkal has also threatened to implicate him in criminal cases and get him put behind bars.The court on September 30 had ordered police protection for Ajith.Ajith, who was Mavunkal’s driver-cum-mechanic from 2009 till January this year, has alleged that after he made the disclosures in the criminal case, the Circle Inspector of Cherthala and the Station House Officer of Ernakulam Town North Police Station both summoned him to their offices the same day and threatened him with dire consequences if he failed to appear before them.He has claimed, in his petition, that he had informed the District Police Chief of Alappuzha and the Commissioner of Police, Ernakulam about the alleged harassment, but no action was taken against the two officers.He has said that the disclosures he made to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch, Alappuzha, were in connection with a cheating complaint made against Mavunkal by Rajendran Pillai of Sreevalsam Group of Companies alleging that the dealer had cheated him of ₹6 crore.Soon after he gave his statement, Mavunkal came to know about it and called him up and threatened him with dire consequences, the petition has said.The petitioner has also alleged in his plea that Mavunkal has made false representations about himself and his business to various persons and collected money from them.Cherthala native Mavunkal, who claims to be in possession of rare and historic antiques, was arrested by the district Crime Branch which has been probing complaints against the dealer of having swindled ₹10 crore from several people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-raps-police-over-mavunkal-probe-101633461078220.html
06-10-2021||India||Home Minister Amit Shah likely to visit J&K this month||New Delhi: In his first visit to Jammu and Kashmir since article 370, which somewhat gave special status, was scrapped on August 5, 2019, union home minister is set to travel to the erstwhile state as part of Centre’s mega-outreach programme and to review the development schemes, people familiar with the development said. He is likely to be on a three-day tour between October 23 and 25, but the dates can change as well, said the officials cited above. During the tour, Shah is expected to interact with various stakeholders, review certain projects and also take stock of law and order situation. Several members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s council of ministers have travelled to the newly carved union territory in last four-five weeks as part of the public outreach programme. These include Narendra Singh Tomar, G Kishan Reddy, and John Barla among others. During his trip, Shah will visit remote areas of the Kashmir valley and the Jammu region during which he is also likely to interact with public. On August 5, 2019, the Centre effectively revoked Article 370, which bestowed special status to the erstwhile state, and Article 35A, which barred non-locals from buying or owning immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir, settling there permanently, or availing benefits of state-sponsored scholarship schemes. The constitutional provision acknowledged the special status of the (then) state of Jammu and Kashmir in terms of autonomy and its ability to formulate laws for the state’s permanent residents. Shah visited the erstwhile state in June 2019, immediately after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by PM Modi swept to power for the second term. Last month, he held a top-level review meeting on J&K with the Lt Governor Manoj Sinha and senior security officials including the National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval. He also reviewed various development initiatives being implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, including the ₹80,000 crore package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015. The home minister has said in the past that all-round development and welfare of the people of the Union Territory are on top priority list of the government. In June this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited J&K leaders including Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti at his residence in Delhi, during which they demanded restoration of special status of J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-minister-amit-shah-likely-to-visit-j-k-this-month-101633461077030.html
06-10-2021||India||Another Kerala Congress leader resigns, alleges disfunction||The Congress suffered another setback in Kerala’s Wayanad, which is also a VIP Lok Sabha seat represented by Rahul Gandhi, with former DCC president P V Balachandran quitting the party on Tuesday, alleging that the grand old party has failed to check the growth of the BJP in the country.Ending his 52-year-long association with the party, Balachandran, a member of the KPCC executive committee, said both majority and minority communities are moving away from the Congress and the people would not stand with a party which has lost its direction.He also slammed the style of functioning of the Congress state leadership, alleging that they were not able to take a clear political stand on the issues affecting the people.Announcing the decision at a press conference here, Balachandran said his decision to quit the party was based on the realization that it will not be able to function anymore in accordance with the spirit of the Congress workers.Balachandran’s is the latest in the series of resignations happening in the Congress in Wayanad.Former MLA K C Rosakutty, KPCC secretary M S Vishwanathan, and DCC general secretary Anil Kumar had quit the party before the Assembly polls held in the state in April this year.Balachandran’s decision to quit the party has also come as a setback for the current leadership of the Congress, which is rattled by the resignation of prominent leaders like K P Anil Kumar and P S Prasanth in protest against the style of functioning KPCC Chief K Sudhakaran and Leader of Opposition in the assembly V D Satheesan.Meanwhile, after coming a cropper in the recent state Assembly polls, the BJP in Kerala on Tuesday announced a major organisational revamp, changing five of its district presidents and inducting some fresh faces as office bearers with an eye on a strong comeback.Though there were widespread rumours that K Surendran would be removed as the party’s state chief in the wake of the drubbing of the party, there seemed to be no change in the top post as per the new list.Senior leaders A N Radhakrishnan and Shobha Surendran would continue as the vice presidents, while another senior leader and party spokesperson K Gopalakrishnan was also elevated to the same post, according to the list released by the state president.E Krishnadas would be the new treasurer of the state BJP, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-kerala-congress-leader-resigns-alleges-disfunction-101633461075921.html
06-10-2021||India||Madras high court asks Tamil Nadu forest dept to capture Nilgiris’ tiger alive||The search and hunt for the “problematic tiger”, which has become “dangerous to human life in the area” in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district reached the Madras high court on Tuesday.A bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu heard public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a Chennai-based animal rights group, People for Cattle in India, seeking directions that the tiger identified as MDT-23 is captured alive and not killed. Tamil Nadu chief wildlife warden Shekar Kumar Niraj had last Friday issued an order to hunt the tiger since they received reports of the animal killing two human beings and livestock. Appearing for the Principal Chief Conservator, government learner P Muthukumar, informed the court that there is no plan to kill the animal or maim it. “Efforts are on in the Mudumalai area to capture the animal alive and study its psychology and behaviour to assess what future course of treatment may be adopted,” he told the court. From Saturday onwards, efforts have been strengthened to capture the male tiger that is said to be about 13-years-old. The tiger has remained elusive. The tiger belonging to the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve has been active in the human habitation of Gudalur and has been preying on livestock since July 2021. The court took the note from newspapers that there is huge bandobast in the area to capture the animal so the bench directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to “use his best discretion” to ensure that the least number of persons intrude into any forest since the natural habitat gets destroyed the moment a large posse of humans enters any forest. “However, the respondents are left free to deal with the relevant animal for its treatment and for ascertaining its conduct and behaviour,” the court said in its orders. “All that can be said at the moment is that the other animals in the area should not be disturbed to the extent avoidable to track down this animal, though some discrete measures may be used for such purpose with the object of ultimately treating the animal and respecting its right to remain wild and free to roam in the forest.” The court has asked for a status report to be filed when the matter appears immediately after the reopening of the court following the ensuing pooja holidays. More than 75 forest officials are on the ground to capture the tiger alive without harming him by using tranquillizer darts. Five cages have been placed in vital locations. Special teams, including forest veterinarians, have been formed under the supervision of the Conservator of Forests. The field director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and officers from Kerala’s forest division in Wayanad district have also been brought in. Drones, sniffer dogs are also part of the search operations, and two kumki elephants are on stand-by.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-asks-tamil-nadu-forest-dept-to-capture-nilgiris-tiger-alive-101633461021390.html

The Central government must realise that complete repeal of the three farm laws alone will lead to normalcy and total peace,” Stalin said. A local journalist was among the eight people killed in the violence that erupted during a farmers’ protest at Lakhimpur Kheri. Four of the dead were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers, travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. The others were two BJP workers and a driver, who were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by protestors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complete-repeal-of-farm-laws-alone-will-lead-to-normalcy-peace-stalin-101633460960540.html
06-10-2021||India||Telangana CM KCR demands increase in SC quota||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday demanded that the Centre increase the percentage of reservations for Scheduled Castes in tune with their growing population in the country and conduct a caste census.“The Centre has fixed a 15 per cent reservation for the SCs in education and employment at the national level as well as in the states. Over the years, the population of SCs has gone up considerably all over the country. Therefore, the Centre should also consider increasing the quota of the SCs,” KCR, as the chief minister is known, said while replying to a short discussion on his government’s flagship programme, Dalit Bandhu, in the state assembly.He said a Comprehensive Household Survey conducted in Telangana six years ago had revealed that there were 10.03 million families in the state, of which 1.82 million families belong to the Scheduled Castes, accounting for 17.53% of the total families.At least nine out of 33 districts in the state have more than 20% SC population. Mancherial district has the highest Dalit population of 25.64%, while Hyderabad has the lowest percentage of Dalit population, 11.71%. The average population of SCs in the state, thus, stands at 17.53%, he said.“Since the figures were six years old, the Dalit population in the state might have gone up substantially. Therefore, there is a need to increase the reservations for SCs in tune with the increase in their population,” KCR said.The chief minister also demanded that the Centre take up enumeration of castes while taking up the nation-wide census. “I don’t understand why the Centre is refusing to take up the enumeration of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the country. It even submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court in this regard,” he pointed out.He announced that the state assembly would pass a resolution demanding that the Centre take up caste-based Census, so that justice could be done to all the backward classes. “We shall send the resolution to the Centre for necessary action,” he said.The chief minister explained in detail about the Dalit Bandhu scheme, whose pilot project was launched in Huzurabad assembly constituency in Karimnagar district on August 16. Under the scheme, each eligible Dalit family would be provided with a financial assistance of ₹10 lakh through direct benefit transfer, so that it would help the beneficiary to take up any business of their choice.Claiming that it was the first of its kind scheme for empowerment of Dalits in the country, KCR said though successive governments at the Centre and the state had taken up programmes for the uplift of Dalits, there was no significant improvement in their condition.“Even after 75 years of Independence, Dalits continue to face discrimination and lack empowerment and financial independence. We have made a humble beginning by taking up Dalit Bandhu scheme,” he said.Stating that his government would implement the Dalit Bandhu scheme with more vigour if the Centre comes forward to help the state, KCR said in the coming years, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi might play a role at the Centre.“We might even be part of the government at the Centre to implement our agenda. Anything might happen in politics,” he said.The chief minister announced that in the next year’s annual budget, his government would allocate ₹20,000 crore for Dalit Bandhu scheme. “We shall provide financial assistance to an average of 2,000 Dalit families in each constituency. This is a constant exercise till all the Dalit families are covered under the scheme,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cm-kcr-demands-increase-in-scquota-101633460958979.html

Sherman and Shringla will also participate in a special session of the India-Ideas Summit organised by the US India Business Council later in the day.On Thursday, Sherman will travel to Mumbai for engagements with the business community and civil society.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the situation in Afghanistan, especially the way forward in the war-torn country following the Taliban takeover in Kabul, and cooperation to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific against the backdrop of China’s increasing assertiveness across the region are expected to be a key part of discussions during Sherman’s meetings with Indian interlocutors.The Indian side is also expected to raise its security-relations concerns on Afghanistan, including the risk of Afghan soil being used for terror attacks, during the visit.The discussions are also expected to prepare the grounds for the first India-US 2+2 foreign and defence ministers’ dialogue under the Biden administration in November.Sherman’s visit will be a “useful opportunity to continue the regular dialogue and further strengthen the India-US comprehensive global strategic partnership”, the external affairs ministry said.From India, Sherman will travel to Pakistan for the final leg of her four-nation trip that began on September 29. She first travelled to Geneva in Switzerland to lead a US interagency delegation for a strategic stability dialogue with Russia on September 30.The strategic stability dialogue was the outcome of a commitment made by US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during their meeting in Geneva in June to have a robust dialogue to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures.Sherman then went to Bern to inaugurate the first US-Swiss strategic partnership dialogue, before travelling to Uzbekistan to meet senior officials and civil society on Monday.CIA chief William Burns had visited India and Pakistan last month for discussions on the situation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-bilateral-ties-focus-of-us-deputy-secretary-s-visit-to-india-101633460955923.html
06-10-2021||India||Phase 1 of rural local body polls in 9 new Tamil Nadu distts begins today||Chennai: The first phase of the two-phase rural local body polls in Tamil Nadu’s nine newly carved districts will begin on Wednesday, the first elections after the DMK came to power in the state in May. Though political experts say that the trend indicates that the ruling party has an advantage in local polls, DMK leaders are taking all caution, considering the elections as a referendum for the five-month-old government under chief minister M K Stalin. They are banking on the first-time chief minister’s popularity and several welfare schemes rolled out by the party. The principal opposition, the AIADMK jointly led by Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam, hopes their losing streak doesn’t continue, banking on the legacy of their two-leaves party symbol and their past leaders MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa. In a statement released on October 4, the dual leadership said, “Only the AIADMK can give good governance in the local bodies.”The elections will be held for 27,003 posts, including panchayat presidents and ward councillors, in Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi. According to the state election commission, 7,659,720 voters are eligible to vote across the two phases. The second phase will be held on October 9. All political parties and local leaders campaigned until the last day on Monday evening. Stalin hasn’t campaigned in these districts which have been tasked to his ministers, legislators and MPs. The alliance partners of both the DMK and AIADMK bargained for better share of posts. Congress leaders negotiated with the DMK until the last minute when nominations were closing in September. The Left parties of CPM and CPI are contesting alone in certain districts. But the AIADMK had it tougher. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) which has been a part of the AIADMK-led NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu announced that they would go it alone, but clarified that they will remain in the alliance. PMK is a caste-based party with its core vote bank being the backward but influential Vanniyar community that is dominant in the northern and western districts of Tamil Nadu. PMK has a stronghold in seven out of the nine districts that are going to polls. The PMK justified its decision by saying that there wasn’t enough time to negotiate for posts and candidates with the AIADMK. The BJP which is contesting along with the AIADMK in most districts has decided to go it alone in Kallakurichi district. In the southern districts, such as in Tirunelveli, the elections are being conducted in the shadow of caste-based revenge murders. Four beheadings -- two in Tirunelveli and two in Dindigul -- happened within a span of 10 days in September. “The law and order is back to normal now,” said a senior police officer on election duty in Tirunelveli. The voting patterns in these regions are usually based on the caste factor.More than 15,000 police officers have been deployed across the nine districts for the first phase, according to officials. The results will be announced on October 12.Political experts say that the trend is for the ruling party to win the rural polls. “The DMK as a ruling party has an upper hand but they are adopting abundant caution,” says political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “Congress and other allies of the DMK have no bargaining power but in the case of AIADMK, their allies, PMK and BJP, are playing power politics. I see the PMK and NTK (Naam Tamizhar Katchi) fighting for third place in not just rural body polls but also the urban body polls (which will be conducted later).” NTK emerged as the third largest party in the assembly elections held in April. Actor Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam is also contesting in the local polls.Candidates with disabilitiesAs many as 43 people with disabilities who belong to an NGO, December 3 Movement, are contesting as independent candidates in the rural local body elections. “This is the first time that a disability rights association has fielded candidates in an organised manner,” said TMN Deepak, founder of December 3 Movement. “Local governance is the first point of contact for people, so grassroots representation and empowerment is important for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phase-1-of-rural-local-body-polls-in-9-new-tamil-nadu-distts-begins-today-101633460897052.html

Taliban commanders had visited the gurdwara soon after the takeover of the country and assured Sikh leaders about the safety of members of the community.Nearly 240 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were, however, barred from entering Kabul airport to board the last military evacuation flight from the Afghan capital.The Indian government has said it will take all steps to facilitate the evacuation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who want to leave Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspected-taliban-fighters-attack-gurdwara-in-kabul-101633460845712.html

The petition said the role and negligence by police, from Lakhimpur Kheri to Lucknow, be made part of the probe.“Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees citizens right to life and personal liberty. State machinery has failed to secure lives of eight persons who died in a dreadful manner,” the petition stated.It further contended that the “law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh” was in “great danger” and there could be “consequences if preventive action is not taken by the state at [the] earliest”.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three farm laws enacted last year. The farmers were allegedly run over by vehicles driven by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers travelling to welcome deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to the area. The remaining deceased – two BJP workers, a journalist and a driver – were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by angry protesters.Uttar Pradesh police on Monday booked Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra, also known as Teni, his son Ashish Mishra, and others for murder and other charges based on a complaint lodged by farmers. Lakhimpur Kheri superintendent of police Vijay Dhull said the first information report was filed under Indian Penal Code sections 302 for murder, 120-B for criminal conspiracy and 147 for rioting at Tikunia police station.Meanwhile, the petition by the NGO further prayed that a suo motu public interest litigation should be registered based on the letter and cognizance should be taken against the respondent state authorities in the matter.The plea also sought suspension of Director General of Police and other concerned officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-allahabad-hc-seeks-cbi-probe-says-law-and-order-in-great-danger-101633460357517.html
06-10-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee, two TMC MLAs to take oath on October 7: Governor||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday said he will administer on October 7, the oath to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and two Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislators as members of state legislative assembly. The governor also asserted that he will not delegate the responsibility to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, whose power to administer the oath of office to members of the state legislature was withdrawn by Raj Bhawan before the bypolls. As per convention, it is the speaker who administers the oath to legislators while the governor administers the oath of office to ministers. Besides Banerjee, newly-elected TMC legistors Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam from Jangipur and Samsergang constituencies, respectively, in Murshidabad district will also take oath in the assembly on Thursday.“Under Article 188 (of the Constitution), oath or affirmation is to be ‘before the governor, or some person appointed in that behalf by him.’ However, prior to this, in terms of Section 67 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 ‘the appropriate authority shall cause to be published in the official gazette and declarations containing the names of the elected candidates’,” a statement released by Raj Bhawan said. “In view of the above, invoking powers vested in me under Article 188 of the Constitution, I direct that oath/affirmation to the elected members of the WBLA viz Mamata Banerjee (Bhawanipore), Jakir Hossain (Jangipur) and Amirul Islam (Samserganj) shall be administered by the undersigned at the premises of the West Bengal legislative assembly on October 7…at 2 pm..,” it added. Banerjee won the September 30-Bhabanipur bypoll with a record margin of 58,835 votes on October 3. She needed to win the election to retain the chief minister’s chair, after losing the May assembly elections from Nandigram seat to her former protege and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari. Banerjee, who took oath as chief minister on May 5, needs to be sworn in as a member of the state assembly within six months, i.e, by November 4. In a letter to Dhankhar on October 1, the state government requested him to authorise the speaker to conduct the ceremony. However, the governor sought a gazette notification on the Bhabanipur bypoll results, due to which, the government could not carry out its original plan of holding the ceremony on October 4.“We have formally requested the governor to administer the oath before noon on October 7. We hope that once the notification is issued, he will come to the assembly house and administer the oath of office to the chief minister and the two legislators,” parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee told reporters on Monday. Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee expressed his anguish. “I do not know why the governor has to come to the assembly to administer oath of office to legislators. Such a thing has never happened anywhere. I will take this up later,” he said. Chatterjee made it clear that although unhappy with the governor, the TMC will not create a controversy. “We do not know why he (Dhankhar) took this decision. Let the programme take place peacefully. I am not going to say anything controversial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-two-others-to-take-oath-on-october-7-governor-101633460356346.html
06-10-2021||India||Supreme Court raps Centre over NEET-SS date change||The Supreme Court on Tuesday described the Union government’s offer to defer the National Eligibility Entrance Test for super speciality courses (NEET-SS) from November to January as a “sop”, wondering why the government couldn’t have waited a year to introduce changes to the pattern of the entrance exam. The court also underlined that the changes, introduced by the government at the last minute, appeared to have been taken to help private medical colleges where super specialty course seats go vacant every year.“We have read your affidavit and it prima facie appears that the entire haste shown by you (government) is for filling the vacant seats. The seats that go vacant are never in government colleges. This gives a strong impression that regulation of medical education has become a business. We will hear this matter. Please put your house in order otherwise the hands of the law are very long,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna said on two petitions by over 41 post graduate doctors.The doctors complained that the examination was notified on July 23, but on August 31, the National Board of Examinations (NBE), which conducts NEET-SS, announced a change in the exam pattern for NEET-SS for admission to over 4,200 seats for DM (Doctorate of Medicine), M.Ch (Master of Surgery) and DrNB (Doctorate of National Board). The exam was to be held on November 13 and 14.The doctors said they had prepared for the exam based on the older pattern used since 2018.In its affidavit filed on October 1, the Centre and NBE declined to modify the examination pattern but said it was open to defer the examination by two months to January 10-11, 2022 to let the doctors prepare.The court wasn’t satisfied. “You have held up some sop to the court when your fundamental process of holding the exam is under question. Deferring the examination for two months will do no good,” the court told the government at Tuesday’s hearing.The bench told Centre, NBE and National Medical Commission “to apply wisdom in its decision-making process”. It will continue hearing the case on Wednesday.The post graduate doctors who filed the petition said that the existing exam pattern tested the candidate on their knowledge of the super specialty stream that they wished to pursue. The examination asked 60% questions from the super specialty of the candidate’s choice while the remaining 40% tested the candidate on a mix of broad specialty courses of which one was general medicine.Under the new pattern, 100% questions were to come from the broad specialty course of general medicineAdditional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, told the court that every year, seats in the super specialty courses ended up vacant due to the exam pattern. Last year, 805 out of 4,286 seats remained vacant while in 2019, the vacant seats totalled 545.“Heavens would not have fallen if you would have introduced the changes from next year,” the bench said, adding, “Seats falling vacant is the concern of the management of medical colleges. Tell us how many seats go vacant in government colleges. You can give us the breakup between government and private colleges where seats fall vacant.”Senior advocate Maninder Singh Singh, who appeared for NBE, said the old examination scheme tested the candidate on a subject that he was supposed to join. The new pattern allows all candidates to be tested on the same footing, he said, asserting that the board will “prove to the court that the change in pattern has not been done to fill the vacancies”.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that clinical practice was an important component for admission into super specialty courses. Due to this, many doctors practised in the super specialty stream to get admission into the course of their choice. Some even left their jobs and prepared for the examination for over a year.“This is the tragedy of our medical education,” the court said. “See how botched up our education system is. You first make them study for this super specialty course and after they have prepared for the examination of which 60% questions would come from their choice of discipline, you are privileging candidates who did general medicine at the cost of other super specialties. Have some concern for these doctors.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared in a fresh petition filed by post graduate doctors specializing in Oncology, said the largest number of seats going vacant were in private colleges. He also stressed that there was no consultation on changing the examination pattern before July 23. He further added that before 2018, when the existing pattern was introduced, 100% questions in NEET-SS test came from the specialty course opted for by the candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-raps-centre-over-neet-ss-date-change-101633460236494.html
06-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur violence: Families cremate bodies, seek probe, proper aid||Three of the farmers killed in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday were cremated on Tuesday, after the families initially refused to carry out funerals unless the administration met their demands for a quick investigation and adequate compensation. Family members gathered in shock as senior police officers kept guard nearby. The cremations came as tensions persisted, especially after new videos showed some who were part of a protest gathering being mowed down by a car approaching from behind. Four other men died of injuries after the protesters caught hold of them -- who are believed to have been in the car that ran over the victims – and assaulted them. The youngest of the farmers cremated on Tuesday was of 18-year-old Lovepreet Singh. Singh’s father Satnam Singh lit his pyre on a path on a paddy field that villagers cleared to cremate the body. Senior police officials were at the site. A few kilometres away in Dhaurara area of Lakhimpur Kheri, more than 200 Sikh men assembled on a field where, Nachhatar Singh, 50, was cremated. One of his two sons, Mandeep Singh, a jawan in the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSSB) performed the last rites. “We never imagined this kind of an end to my father’s life. He was killed for speaking for the cause of farmers and we will remember this,” said Mandeep. On Monday, family members of the deceased refused to cremate the bodies and held a protest. They relented after the government announced ₹45 lakh compensation to the families, jobs, and the promise of a swift investigation into the violence. Family members of Lovepreet Singh and Nachhatar Singh initially refused to perform the last rites, alleging that the administration may tamper with the post-mortem reports after cremation. Senior police officials were rushed to the spot and the families agreed after assurances. Cheques of the compensation amount were handed over to the family members of Lovepreet and Nacchatar Singh by the evening and a team under the additional SP was formed to investigate the case. In the adjoining Bahraich district, Daljeet Singh was cremated by his 14-year-old son. ASP (rural) Ashok Kumar and other local officers were present during the cremation. Singh’s wife and 20-year-old daughter also attended the funeral from a distance. Family members of the fourth victim, 18-year-old Gurvinder Singh, of Mohraniya village in Bahraich, refused to cremate his body alleging he was shot dead and the autopsy hid that fact. Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait reached the spot to speak to the family members. The local administration agreed for a second post-mortem by experts. ASP (rural), Bahraich, Ashok Kumar said a panel of doctors had been deputed for the second post-mortem examination of the body. Apart from casualties of four farmers, the incident at Lakhimpur Kheri’s Tikonia on Sunday claimed the lives of four others: MoS for home, Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni’s driver Hari Om (35), BJP workers Shyam Sundar (40) and Shubham Mishra (30), and a local journalist Raman Kashyap (28).All four were attacked by the mob after the farmers were run over and were rushed to Kheri district hospital where they succumbed to their injuries.Nighasan scribe Raman Kashyap remained unidentified for several hours till his father Ram Dulare identified him. The post-mortem examination of all the four was carried out late on Sunday night and their bodies were handed to their family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-families-cremate-bodies-seek-probe-proper-aid-101633460176434.html
06-10-2021||India||Modi in Lucknow: World is looking at India’s success||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday targeted the previous Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh by saying it had no interest in constructing houses for the poor, a remark that came during his visit to the poll-bound state to inaugurate a three-day event to commemorate 75 years of Independence.Modi inaugurated the “Azadi@75 – New Urban India: Transforming Urban Landscape” conference-cum-expo in Lucknow under Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsava, an initiative of the Union government. He digitally handed over keys of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana—Urban (PMAY-U) houses to 75,000 beneficiaries in 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh and also interacted virtually with beneficiaries of the scheme.The Prime Minister accused the previous government of causing hurdles in the implementation of the central housing scheme, adding that the people in the state will not forget such acts. Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls early next year.He said that before 2017, “18,000 houses were approved for Uttar Pradesh for construction under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana but not even 18 houses were built by the previous government”. “There was money, there was sanction but those who were running the government were creating hindrance as they did not want to construct houses,” the PM said.On the other hand, the Yogi Adityanath-led government has “completed nine lakh houses under the scheme and 14 lakh are under construction”, Modi said.The Prime Minister said his government has made 30 million poor families “lakhpati” under the scheme by providing them houses. He said the previous governments used power as a tool of politics, as electricity was supplied to areas visited by their leaders. He said all the parts of the state were getting electricity now.The Prime Minister inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of 75 urban development projects of Uttar Pradesh under the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT; flagged off 75 buses under FAME-II for seven cities including Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Jhansi and Ghaziabad; and released a coffee table book on 75 projects implemented under various flagship missions of ministry of housing and urban affairs. He also announced the setting up of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Chair in Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU), Lucknow.While digitally handing over keys of houses under the PM Awas Yojana, Modi spoke to some of the beneficiaries and said they will celebrate Diwali, Dussehra, Chhath and other festivals in their new houses.Modi said Vajpayee brought the Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and visualised the Golden Quadrilateral, a network of national highways. “When Atal visualised this connect with four metropolitan towns, some people did not believe this. Similarly, when I talked about toilets and houses, rapid rail, piped gas supply and optical fibre, then too some thought how this would be possible. But the world is looking at India’s success in these campaigns. India is building more PM Awas Yojana houses than the population of some countries,” he said.He said his claim on “lakhpatis” was based on an assessment about the price of the houses given to 30 million people.Modi emphasised that the government has made a serious effort to overcome the problems and challenges of the urban middle class and the law establishing the Real Estate Regulatory Authority was a major step.“RERA has helped in getting the entire housing sector out of the mistrust and fraud and has helped and empowered all stakeholders,” he said.The PM said urban bodies are also saving about ₹1,000 crore every year by installing LED street lights. “Now this amount is being used for other development works. Use of LEDs has also greatly reduced the electricity bill of the people living in cities,” he said.Mentioning the state government’s plan to light 750,000 “diyas” in Ayodhya on this Diwali, Modi asked the Yogi Adityanath government to ensure two such lamps are lit in each of the 900,000 houses already given to the beneficiaries under the PM Awas Yojana in the state on that day.Samajwadi Party leader Juhie Singh said: “The Prime Minister should do a fact check to compare the works of the SP government between 2012 and 2017 and by the Yogi Adityanath-led government in the past four-and-a-half-years.” Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University, said: “The accusations and counter accusations being made on various issues indicated that the political parties were in poll mode now.”Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee spokesman Ashok Singh said the Prime Minister did not mention farmers, rising inflation and rising unemployment in his speech, and this reflected his concerns over such issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-in-lucknow-world-is-looking-at-india-s-success-101633460117476.html
06-10-2021||India||Working conditions of teachers in northeast, aspirational districts poor: Report||Teachers battle poor working conditions in India’s northeast and in so-called aspirational districts, and there are disparities in basic amenities like toilets between urban and rural schools, a Unesco report said on Tuesday.“Most of the aspirational districts have a higher percentage of single-teacher schools compared to the state. This is indicative of the challenges that the districts probably face with regard to staffing,” said the report released on World Teachers’ Day. “The proportion of women teachers in the selected aspirational districts is far lower than the state and in comparison with the all-India figure of 50%.”India defines aspirational districts as those that are poor in socioeconomic and human development indicators, and are in need of focussed efforts to improve overall conditions.The report – 2021 State of the Education Report for India: No Teachers, No Class – had selected seven aspirational districts, including Firozpur in Punjab, Nandurbar in Maharashtra, Raichur in Karnataka, Gumla in Jharkhand, Udalguri in Assam, Dantewada in Chhattisgarh and Ri-Bhoi in Meghalaya.Although in terms of accessibility, schools in the aspirational districts compared well with overall accessibility of schools in their respective states, with the exception of Gumla, they fare poorly while providing for separate and working toilets for girls and boys. Access to electricity is also lower in rural schools.“Special attention needs to be paid to rural areas, districts with high scheduled caste and tribe populations, and all across India’s north-east, where the ratio of teachers to students needs to improve and be rationalized. Working conditions in these ‘difficult to staff’ regions also need to be improved, including basic amenities, better provisioning of libraries, and access to information and communications technology,” the Unesco report said. “More state support for teacher education programmes is desirable in these regions.”Highlighting that there is a deficit of one million teachers in the country, the report said there is a need to strengthen recruitment. “In about 15 years, 27% of the current workforce will need to be replaced. The workforce has a deficit of over 1 million teachers (at current student strength), and is likely to grow overall,” the report said.The third edition of the state of education report, an annual flagship report of the Unesco, analysed data from the Unified District Information System for Education 2018-19 and the periodic labour force survey 2018-19.It revealed that teaching has just “average status” in India, but it is a career of choice for women and youth, particularly in rural areas.Calling it an overall gender-balanced profession, the report said some sectors like early childhood, special education and private unaided schools show a preponderance of woman teachers. “This may have to do with lower salaries, rendering teaching jobs as second incomes to be taken up by women. It is noticed that states high in postgraduate institutions are also states with a high proportion of women teachers,” it said.The report recommended more “professional autonomy” for teachers. “Teacher autonomy is essential for ensuring a learning environment that addresses the diverse needs of children,” the report said. ”Currently, the system of administrative hierarchies and control, examinations, and centralized planning for curriculum reform, constrain the autonomy of the headmaster and teacher.”It also advocated recognising teachers as front line workers amid the Covid-19 pandemic and highlighted prevailing job security concerns among private schools and contractual teachers.“It is time for the world to recognize the exceptional role teachers play in the life of children,” said Sridhar Srivastava, director, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). “NCERT is committed to empower them with training, professional development and academic support.”“We need to invest our efforts in their capacity building and professional development, so that educators can enrich their practice to adapt to diverse learners’ needs,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-conditions-of-teachers-in-northeast-aspirational-districts-poor-unesco-report-101633460058686.html

Around a dozen of people including three policemen sustained minor injuries in the violence. “Curfew has been imposed in the evening after the violence. We are registering FIRs and till now 40 people have been booked,” Kabirdham superintendent of police (SP) Mohit Garg said. Police said tension started on Sunday evening when people from two communities brawled over removal of religious flags from Lohara Chowk area. Restrictions under section 144 were imposed the same day to cool tempers on both sides.On Monday, Garg said the police arrested six people and two FIRs were been registered against people from both communities. Police also called a peace committee meeting where people were asked to remove religious flags from Lohara Chowk in view of upcoming festivals and to maintain peace and harmony.“On Tuesday, a protest was called by a right-wing organization turned violent when the protesters entered the areas dominated by the other community. The situation is under control and curfew has been imposed. A few people including some police personnel sustained minor injuries but they are stable,” said Director General of Police DM Awasthi. “On Tuesday, a group of people from a community entered areas of other community and violence started…Bikes were torched and some houses of other communities were also ransacked… Later, police lathi-charged at some places and strict curfew has been imposed in the town,” said a senior police official, adding that the internet services have been suspended for nowThe official added that around 15 people have been detained.“Stones were pelted on police, due to which, three policemen were injured. An inspector, Pradeep Sori, has been admitted to government hospital while the rest sustained minor injuries,” said the officer. Kawardha is home town of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) former chief minister Raman Singh. Forest minister Mohammad Akbar is also from the district.Raman Singh blamed the local administration. “The administration and police were unable to solve a minor issue between the two communities, which led to violence and clash…The administration failed. Now the town is peaceful but what happened was unfortunate,” said Singh, who is also BJP vice-president.Chhattisgarh’s forest minister Mohammad Akbar said the situation was under control.“Kawardha is a peaceful town and such an incident has never taken place in the past.

06-10-2021||India||Monsoon withdrawal to begin from north-west India today: IMD||The southwest monsoon will begin withdrawing from many parts of northwest India from Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, pointing out that it will likely be the second most delayed withdrawal since 1960.“Rain has stopped in many parts of northwest India. There is still some rain over Ganganagar region in Rajasthan. Water vapour has also reduced significantly, and an anti-cyclone is getting established, leading to change in wind direction to northwesterly. All these conditions favour gradual monsoon withdrawal and establishment of dry conditions with marginal fall in temperature,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Delhi, however, saw localised thunderstorms on Tuesday. “The thunderstorm activity over some parts of Delhi is mainly due to high day temperatures and moisture. There is also a western disturbance, which is impacting the region,” Devi said.The withdrawal of the June-September monsoon means a gradual fall in temperature and humidity as dry winds blow in from the northwest. The most delayed monsoon withdrawal was observed in 2019, the Met department said, when it started withdrawing on October 9. Last year, monsoon began withdrawing on September 28, while in 1961, it started withdrawing on October 1.“There are still some clouds over Rajasthan, but by tomorrow (October 6) it will clear up and there will be very fast withdrawal of monsoon this time,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology at private forecaster Skymet Weather. “As per our analysis, monsoon will withdraw from Punjab, Haryana, Western Himalayas, Gujarat, northern parts of Madhya Pradesh, even parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh by October 10. Northwesterly winds will penetrate the entire region. There will be a slight drop in temperatures in the morning and evening and winds will be dry.”Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.Meanwhile, harvesting has started in Punjab and Haryana. “The weather has not cleared up completely. Harvesting has started, but will pick up properly around October 10. Some isolated stubble fires have started. Until the government plans to give farmers a direct subsidy, most farmers will choose to burn stubble,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, Punjab.The air quality in Delhi is likely to worsen on October 6 and 7, according to the ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system. Air quality turns hazardous every year around this time in the national capital region, partly due to the burning of farm residue as farmers prepare their fields for the winter crop.Weather satellites have already observed burning fire points over Punjab and adjoining areas in Pakistan, the warning system said.IMD in its Tuesday bulletin said: “Isolated heavy rain is very likely over Tamil Nadu and Kerala on October 5 and 6 and over Karnataka during October 5 and 7. Isolated very heavy rain is also very likely over south interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and over coastal Karnataka on Wednesday. A cyclonic circulation is lying over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and neighbourhood. Under its influence, isolated heavy rain is very likely over south Assam and Tripura on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-withdrawal-to-begin-from-north-west-india-today-imd-101633459875891.html

While the family members of the girl claimed she died by suicide, police said the postmortem report confirmed she was brutally beaten up before her death, pointing towards homicide. Jabalpur superintendent of police Siddharth Bahuguna said, “The father of the girl came to the police station on Monday night claiming their 21-year-old neighbour raped his daughter in their house by threatening to defame her in the locality. He further claimed that the girl’s mother saw the incident and shouted for help, but the accused hit her and fled.” The SP added, “The father came to the police station two hours after the incident. When police reached the victim’s house to register her statement, she was found dead. The family members, who were present at home, said the girl died by suicide by strangulating herself.” During investigation, it was found that the girl was beaten up before death, the SP said, adding prima facie it was a case of homicide. On Tuesday, police registered a case against an unidentified person under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act. Police said they are questioning the girl’s father, adding that further investigation was on.

06-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur violence: Opposition keeps up heat; case against 11 leaders||The Opposition continued to take potshots at the government on Tuesday over the deaths of eight people in Uttar Pradesh with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleging she was illegally detained and leaders from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Trinamool Congress (TMC) attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Hours after the incident on Sunday, the UP government clamped prohibitory orders, denied orders for flights to land and deployed police to stop Opposition leaders from travelling to Lakhimpur Kheri.On Tuesday, state police prevented Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel from leaving the Lucknow airport, prompting the Congress leader to stage a dharna at the terminal. Baghel’s flight had been denied permission to land on Monday.“The truth of Lakhimpur will come to light one day, it cannot be kept hidden forever,” Baghel told reporters at the airport.Priyanka Gandhi, who was detained on Monday and allegedly roughed up by police, used a 29-second clip showing a car mowing down protesters at Lakhimpur Kheri to target the BJP.“Modiji Namaskar, have you seen this video that shows son of a minister of your government crushing farmers under his vehicle….Why is this man free?” she asked in a video message filmed at a makeshift detention centre in Sitapur, where she has been since Monday.The source and the veracity of the video in question need to be ascertained but they are in sync with the version of the protesting farmers, who say that four protesters were knocked down by cars owned by Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra Teni. The identity of the individuals in the vehicles is unclear but farmers say that the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, was in the car and later fired shots.While the minister’s version is that the vehicles came under attack and lost control, nothing of that sort can be seen in the video. The lead vehicle appears to deliberately run over the farmers — and from behind. To be sure, the video is only 29 seconds long and is only a blurry video shot at the time of the incident.In all, eight people were killed – four farmers, two BJP workers, a driver and a journalist. Mishra says that protesters lynched the BJP workers and the driver.Later in the day, Priyanka Gandhi alleged that police used illegal force, didn’t allow her to meet her lawyer and didn’t share a copy of the FIR. “I have not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer,” she said in a statement.The Congress leader said she was “verbally informed” by police officials that she was arrested under section 151 of the CrPC -- on Monday. She also said that she didn’t violate section 144, which bars the assembly or movement of four or more people.Police in Sitapur said Priyanka Gandhi and 10 others were named in an FIR for attempting to disturb peace, but refuted reports that she was arrested.“The detention of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is done as precautionary measures under section 144 CrPC as she was adamant on going to Lakhimpur Kheri. He said the visit of political leaders to Lakhimpur Kheri has been prohibited following which she has been stopped in Sitapur,” said Sitapur district magistrate Vishal Bhardwaj and superintendent of police RP Singh.The charges will be removed once they are assured that there will not be any breach of peace, Sitapur sub-divisional magistrate Pyare Lal Maurya added.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is keen to go to Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday and at least five senior leaders are likely to accompany him, said people aware of developments. Five Trinamool Congress MPs reached the hamlet on Tuesday and spoke to the family members of the victims.“Heartbreaking to meet the family of the young farmer who was crushed to death in Lakhimpur Kheri,” said TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev.RLD chief Jayant Chaudhury, one of the few leaders to reach Lakhimpur, demanded President’s Rule in UP.“There needs to be a separation between the state and the party which is not there in UP… from the district magistrate to state-level officials, police, it seems everyone has taken membership of the BJP,” Chaudhary said in a phone interview to PTI.CB Pandey, former adviser to the Uttar Pradesh governor, said section 151 of the CrPC empowered a police officer to arrest any person without a warrant. He said a person can be arrested and under sections 107, 116 of CrPC on apprehension of breach of peace and a magistrate was empowered to release such person on a person bond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-opposition-keeps-up-heat-case-against-11-leaders-101633459459821.html
06-10-2021||India||Re-registration of vehicles older than 15 years to get costlier from April 2022||Renewing registration certificates of vehicles that are older than 15 years will cost up to eight times more from April 2022, the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highway (MoRTH) said on Tuesday after it issued a notification finalising the revised rates for re-registering old vehicles and re-issuance of fitness certificates.The new rates will be a part of the central government’s vehicle scrapping policy which aims to incentivise the practice of purchasing new vehicles against scrapping old ones. The policy, once it comes into effect from next year, will disincentivise vehicles that are older than 15 years by charging heavily on the renewal of their registration and fitness certificates. It is meant to encourage people to scrap their old vehicles instead of running them, which contributes to air pollution.As per the latest notification issued by the MoRTH on Monday night, the renewal of registration of a 15-year-old car will cost ₹5,000 against the current rate of ₹600. Re-registration of two-wheelers that are older than 15 years will cost ₹1,000 from April next year, compared to the current fee of ₹300. For imported cars, the cost will be ₹40,000 against the existing fee of ₹15,000. A delay in renewing registrations for private vehicles will cost ₹300 a month and the penalty for commercial vehicles will be ₹500 per month. As per the rules, a private vehicle, once it attains 15 years, will have to be renewed every five years since then.“As an incentive, there will be a waiver of the fee for issue of registration certificate for a new vehicle, purchased against the authority of the Certificate of Deposit (CoD) issued by a registered vehicle scrapping facility for a vehicle being scrapped,” the MoRTH said in a statement.Coming to the renewal of fitness certificates which is required for transport and commercial vehicles, the cost for cabs will go up from ₹1,000 at present to ₹7,000 from next year. For heavy good vehicles, such as buses and trucks, the fitness fee will be ₹12,500 against the current rate of ₹1,500. A fitness certificate is mandatory for commercial vehicles once they cross 8 years.To be sure, these rates will not be applicable in Delhi-NCR unless there are specific orders from the Supreme Court or the national green tribunal (NGT) but will apply across all states, other than Delhi.Any registered diesel vehicle more than 10 years old, and petrol vehicles over 15 years old, cannot operate in NCR. Such vehicles cannot even be parked in public spaces. These rules have been laid down in various orders issued by the National Green Tribunal (2015) and the Supreme Court (2018).Unlike in Delhi-NCR, the Centre’s scrapping policy is based on the principle of vehicle fitness and not driven by age of the vehicle. Every state will have to notify this policy and only after that, it will get implemented. As of now, the Centre is seeking comments from various state governments to make the policy more inclusive. It will come into force from next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reregistration-of-vehicles-older-than-15-years-to-get-costlier-from-april-2022-101633459399685.html

Experts from WHO, and a group of independent experts, are going through data, and are expected to carry out the risk-benefit assessment before arriving at a conclusion.“WHO & an independent group of experts are scheduled to meet next week to carry out the risk/benefit assessment and come to a final decision whether to grant Emergency Use Listing to Covaxin,” said the UN health body in a tweet.It was not immediately clear whether the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) meeting on Covaxin on the agenda for Tuesday took place or not.On July 12, Bharat Biotech announced that it had submitted all relevant documents to set in motion the EUL proceedings to WHO. At least 105, 984,630 doses of Covaxin have been delivered to people in India.WHO began a rolling review of Covaxin on July 6, 2021.In another tweet, WHO also confirmed that the company submitted all necessary documents, including the additional information that was sought towards the end of last month.“Covaxin manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, has been submitting data to WHO on a rolling basis & submitted additional info at WHO’s request on 27 September. WHO experts are currently reviewing this info & if it addresses all questions raised, WHO assessment will be finalized next week,” read the tweet.It also said that the emergency use listing was a thorough exercise undertaken by WHO and the technical advisory group of independent experts to determine if a manufactured product, in this case Covaxin, is quality-assured, safe and effective or not.As part of the analysis, experts will be looking at the presentation of clinical data on Covaxin from phase 1, 2, 3 and post marketing studies on safety, immunogenicity, efficacy and effectiveness.Bharat Biotech also attended a pre-submission meeting scheduled with representatives of WHO on June 23. A day earlier, on June 22, the subject expert committee (SEC) of the central drugs standards control organisation (CDSCO) assessed Bharat Biotech’s phase 3 clinical trials data of Covaxin and found it to be 77.8% efficacious.While the Indian regulator has approved six coronavirus vaccines for emergency use, Covaxin and Serum Institute of India-manufactured Covishield are the mainstay of the country’s inoculation campaign. Covishield was granted EUL in February this year; and with grant of EUL, Covaxin will be eligible for use in low and middle income countries under the COVAX facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-to-take-final-decision-on-covaxin-nod-next-week-101633459284248.html

The troops from an Indian battalion, who were deployed at Malakal in Upper Nile state, recently completed their tour of duty. India is the second largest troop contributor to the 18,300-strong peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, having provided nearly 2,400 soldiers. The civilian, police and military personnel from 73 countries serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) are responsible for protecting civilians, creating conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian aid, supporting the implementation of a revitalised peace agreement, and monitoring and investigating human rights. UNMISS force commander, Lt Gen Shailesh Tinaikar of the Indian Army, lauded the Indian battalion for successfully completing its tour of duty. “When all of you arrived in Upper Nile state, it was a time of great flux,” he said at the event where the troops were awarded the medal. “You had to assume operational responsibility immediately with the threat of imminent inter-communal clashes looming over you. Your presence and patrolling acted as a much-needed deterrent at the time, enabling civilians to go about their daily lives without fear,” he said. Tinaikar also lauded the Indian peacekeepers for rescuing and sheltering 32 humanitarian colleagues at Renk and ensuring their safe evacuation to the country’s capital, Juba. Vishnu Sharma, India’s ambassador to South Sudan, was the guest of honour at the medal parade. “Your courage, commitment and sacrifice to the cause of durable peace in South Sudan is a beacon of hope for the communities you are on the ground to serve. You have done the United Nations and your country very proud,” he said. Sharma noted the contributions of Indian veterinarians who treated thousands of animals and built capacities among livestock owners on animal management, boosting their economic stability. Christian Mikala, the acting head of the UNMISS field office in Malakal, acknowledged the peacekeepers’ engagements with local communities. “You have been instrumental in extensive patrolling in your area of responsibilities and have built a relationship of trust and confidence with communities across Upper Nile,” he said. Col Neeraj Tiwari, the commander of the Indian battalion, said the troops had gone the extra mile for the communities they were serving. “We wish the South Sudanese the very best as they progress in building a sustainable peace from the grassroots to the very highest levels of society,” he added. Tinaikar was appointed the force commander of UNMISS by UN Secretary-General António Guterres in May 2019. Tinaikar earlier served as commandant of the Infantry School since July 2018, and as the additional director general of military operations at Army Headquarters during 2017-18. He also served in the UN Angola Verification Mission III during 1996-97and in the UN Mission in Sudan during 2008-09.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-800-indian-army-troops-in-sudan-get-united-nations-medal-101633459218351.html
06-10-2021||India||EC assigns new party names, symbols to warring LJP factions||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday allotted new symbols and party names to the warring factions of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) led by Lok Sabha MP Chirag Paswan and Pashupati Kumar Paras, Union minister of food processing industries.The ECI’s move came three days after it froze the ‘bungalow’ symbol for the party, barring both factions from using it in the bypolls on October 30.Following requests from Paswan, the lawmaker from Jamui in Bihar, the poll panel said his faction will be recognised as Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), while Paras’ team will be acknowledged as Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party.The Paswan and Paras-led factions were assigned the ‘helicopter’ and ‘sewing machine’ symbols, respectively, by the poll panel.“Having considered the request, the Commission has allotted the name Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) for your group and has allotted the Symbol ‘Helicopter’ as the symbol to be allotted to the candidate set up, if any, by your group in the current by-election,” a directive issued by ECI to Paswan said.In the order issued to Hajipur MP Paras, the ECI said: “Having considered your request, the Commission has allotted the name Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party for your group and has allotted the Symbol ‘Sewing Machine’ as the symbol to be allotted to the candidate set up, if any, by your group in the current by-election.”In June, the two warring factions had approached the ECI over the right on the party symbol.On October 1, Paswan moved the poll panel, seeking an early settlement on the issue ahead of bypolls to two assembly seats in Bihar – Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan – at the end of the month. The seats were earlier represented by the ruling Janata Dal (United), which will also be contesting the constituencies.“We welcome the EC’s decision. It is a vindication of our claim that we are the real holders of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s legacy. Some parties wanted to sabotage our election prospects, but truth has finally won,” LJP (Ram Vilas) spokesperson Ashraf Ansari said.LJP (Ram Vilas) leaders believe that the addition of Ram Vilas Paswan’s name would help the party secure Dalit votes. “It’s a blessing in disguise,” a leader belonging to this group said, requesting anonymity.Speaking on similar lines, Gyanendra Yadav, associate professor of sociology, College of Commerce in Patna, said: “Late Ram Vilas Paswan was a tall Dalit leader and he still has a strong following, which was proved during Chirag’s Aashirvad Yatra in July. Union minister Pashupati Paras could not get the same response.”Chirag Paswan had embarked on a state-wide rally on July 5 this year on the birth anniversary of his father Ram Vilas Paswan. Paras also welcomed the poll panel’s decision. “I welcome the EC’s decision. I have been allotted the name Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party and the ‘Sewing Machine’ as the party symbol,” he said. The LJP has been in a crisis since June, when a faction headed by Paras removed his estranged nephew Paswan as party chief, prompting the latter’s loyalists to respond by stripping five rebel parliamentarians of the party’s primary membership.The party, which has six MPs but no MLAs, split after five lawmakers rebelled against Paswan’s leadership and chose Paras as the new leader of their parliamentary party. The MPs consequently met Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, and the Lok Sabha secretariat recognised Paras as the parliamentary party chief hours later.Paswan has shown his willingness to take up a legal battle to regain control of the party.The LJP was founded by former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan in 2000. Paswan, a heavyweight Dalit leader in Bihar politics, died in October last year.The LJP during the 2020 Bihar assembly polls had damaged the JD(U)’s prospects in at least 30-35 seats. The JD(U) managed to secure only 43 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-assigns-new-party-names-symbols-to-warring-ljp-factions-101633458977010.html
06-10-2021||India||Committed to tri-service integration to maximise combat capability: IAF chief||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari on Tuesday said that the air force was fully committed to tri-service integration to maximise the country’s combat capability, its concerns about the theaterisation model have been factored into the planning process, and hoped that the new structures will cater for joint planning of operations at all levels.“The strength of each service needs to be taken into account and synchronised to increase the net combat capability of the nation,” Chaudhari said during his customary press briefing ahead of the 89th anniversary of the IAF on October 8.“The doctrines of each service also need to be kept in mind while redesigning our structures.”He said each service has its own strength and the rationale behind theatre commands is to capitalise on those strengths. “IAF is very keen on integration among the armed forces. Joint planning and execution of operations by the three services will result in maximum increase in our net combat capability, which is the need of the hour,” said Chaudhari, who took over as IAF chief on September 30 after Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria retired.The new IAF chief’s comments on jointmanship are significant as they come against the backdrop of some concerns flagged by his predecessor about the theaterisation model a few months ago.In July, Bhadauria argued that it was critical to first get the joint structures right, even as chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat gave out details of the theaterisation plan to achieve jointness and brushed aside the reservations revolving around asset split, leadership, and dilution of the powers of the service chiefs.IAF is fully committed to integration and jointmanship, and the points articulated by his predecessor basically focused on the fact that the structures and the processes have to cater for future warfare, Chaudhari said.“That is the key element of restructuring [the armed forces] into theatres… All our concerns have been taken into account, and deliberations and discussions are underway on this subject. We are hopeful that the ultimate structures that emerge will cater for joint planning and execution of operations,” IAF chief said.The current theaterisation model, a long-awaited military reform with the full backing of the government, seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations --- two land-centric theatres, the Air Defence Command and the National Maritime Theatre Command.Bhadauria had earlier differed with Rawat’s assessment that IAF was “a support arm,” and countered the CDS’s statement, saying air power has “a huge role to play” in any integrated battle area.Responding to a question on the perception that IAF was a support arm, Chaudhari said air power had multiple roles to play in any conflict, ranging from offensive strikes to air transportation and support to the army and maritime forces.“If you examine any global conflict carefully, air power has played multiple roles. There are various roles for every air force, and it is true for IAF too. Our capability, training and equipment cater for executing multiple roles simultaneously,” he said.Chaudhari said no service could succeed in battle without the support of the other two services. “To be able to go singularly into any battle is not possible. We need the support of the other two services. It is true for all services. It is not that just IAF is a support arm, the army also at times has to support IAF in air operations.”The creation of theatre commands could take two to three years, with senior officers from the three services being assigned key responsibilities to finalise the joint structures.Defence minister Rajnath Singh recently said that discussions on the creation of joint commands and their implementation were progressing well and fast, indicating that differences between stakeholders on the theaterisation model were being addressed, and India was on course to set up theatre commands.Responding to a question on the border row with China in the Ladakh sector, Chaudhari said IAF was aware of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s (PLAAF) deployment at three airbases across eastern Ladakh. He said China had scaled up infrastructure across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) but it would not affect air operations and IAF was fully prepared for any eventuality.He said that China had developed airfields in the Tibet Autonomous Region along with hardened shelters for aircraft but “they have a huge penalty of high altitude.” “Their (PLAAF’s) capability to launch missions from high altitude airfields will remain a weak area,” he said.IAF chief said there was nothing to fear about Pakistan-China collusion, with the only concern being dissemination of information of western tactics and western technology from Pakistan to China. “The two-front threat always remains in focus for us. We are prepared in terms of training and equipment to handle a two-front contingency,” Chaudhari said.The count of IAF’s fighter squadrons has reduced to around 30 compared to an optimum strength of 42 units. He said it was unlikely that IAF would be able to deploy 42 fighter squadrons in the next 10 to 15 years. He said the induction of new fighters and the phasing out of older ones would result in IAF achieving 35 fighter squadrons in the next decade.IAF is looking at buttressing its force levels in the coming 10 to 15 years with 83 LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A fighters, 114 multi-role fighter aircraft to be made in India and 120 advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA - India’s homegrown fifth-generation fighter programme), he said.Chaudhari said IAF was likely to induct by the year-end the first unit of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems ordered from Russia for ₹39,000 crore in October 2018. India is buying five S-400 missile systems capable of destroying a variety of aerial threats, including enemy fighter jets and missiles, at a range of 400km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-says-committed-to-tri-service-integration-to-maximise-india-s-combat-capability-101633458795883.html

The polling for all seats was held on Sunday.The GMC win is particularly significant as it is BJP’s first in the elections to Gandhinagar, the seat of power in the state.The win comes around 14 months ahead of assembly elections in the state, which are due by December 2022, and, with usual caveats of local body elections not being exactly representative of state polls, can be seen as the current state of play in Gujarat, where the Congress is hoping to repeat its heroics of 2017, when it ran the BJP close, and the AAP is hoping to make a successful debut. GMC came into being in 2010 and in its first election in 2011, the Congress won 18 seats against the BJP’s 14. Four councillors led by mayor Mahendrasinh Rana, defected to usher in the BJP. In the 2016 elections, the BJP and the Congress won 16 seats each, but the former snatched power after a defection by a Congress councillor. Out of the three municipalities (peri-urban bodies), the BJP retained Okha in Devbhoomi Dwarka in Saurashtra region and Thara in North Gujarat’s Banaskantha district, while the Congress sprang a surprise by snatching away Bhanvad municipality in Devbhoomi Dwarka district from the BJP.These elections were the first after a new chief minister, Bhupendra Patel, a lawmaker from Ahmedabad city, and a fresh Cabinet took office less than a month ago.Reacting to the results, the newly inducted chief minister and Gujarat BJP president CR Paatil taunted the AAP for making a huge noise but winning little, while they simply ignored any mention of the Congress party. “This is the reward for the BJP’s people-friendly policies,” they claimed, adding they were not surprised by the result. Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “The Gandhinagar results have demonstrated that the AAP is indeed a B-team of the BJP, which we have been stating right from the day one. In 2016, we had 46.93% of the vote share in GMC against BJP’s 44.76%. Now, the anti-BJP vote has split between the AAP and the Congress -- we got 27% and AAP got around 20%, while BJP got 51%.”He pointed out that in Bhanvad Municipality, the Congress won in a straight fight , with 16 out of 24 seats; the rest went to the BJP.Political scientist Ghanshyam Shah said he was not surprised by the results. “It is clear the BJP, which burnt its fingers in 2017 and earlier in 2015 local body elections, is focussing on the peri-urban and rural areas ahead of the assembly polls next year,” Shah said. He agreed that the AAP has split the anti-BJP vote, but pointed out, “The Congress can’t take solace in calling the AAP a B-team of the BJP. The Congress is in total disarray.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-retains-control-over-gujarat-civic-body-congress-wins-2-seats-101633458736260.html
06-10-2021||India||Why give quota once limit is breached: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday called it “disturbing” that the Union government did not discontinue reservation in promotion for people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) even after their numbers exceeded the upper ceiling of 15% and 7.5% respectively, of positions in some classes of central government jobs.Observing that “there should be some justifications to continue with reservation in promotion”, a bench headed by justice L Nageswara Rao also put the Union government in the dock over lack of data on how it determined inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs, as laid down in two previous judgments by a Constitution bench of the top court, even as it kept promoting them on the basis of a 1997 memorandum. Attorney general KK Venugopal, appearing for the Union government, sought to explain it away by claiming that over-representation of SCs and STs in Group C and D posts should not worry the top court since there are “no takers” for these and that “general category candidates do not want these jobs”.But the bench, which also comprised justices Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai, was having none of this. “The data given by the attorney general is disturbing. The moment you (government) saw that representation of SCs and STs was beyond 15% and 7.5% respectively, a decision had to be taken that we won’t continue with the promotion. But the government did not do anything of that sort. The office memorandum of 1997 continued in a blanket manner,” it said. “The central government should have applied its mind. What is meant by adequacy? It may not mean exact 15% and 7.5% but there has to be some application of mind. Whether you are justified in providing reservation in promotion in such circumstances is the question before us,” said the court, adding that it would examine validity and legality of the government’s action between 2006 and 2017. In 2006, the top court delivered its ruling in the M Nagaraj case, making it incumbent upon the state to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of a section of people in public employment in addition to maintaining overall administrative efficiency. The aspect of quantifiable data was endorsed by another Constitution bench in 2018. Citing the Nagaraj judgment, the Delhi high court in 2017 quashed the 1997 memorandum after noting the Union government had not collected data on inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs.While hearing a clutch of petitions raising various legal issues on the subject, the bench on Tuesday sought to know from the Union government whether it even carried out the exercise of collecting data to ascertain adequacy or inadequacy of SCs and STs before promoting them. On his part, Venugopal adduced some statistics relating to the Northern Railway where this exercise was done after the Delhi high court judgment. But the bench underscored two issues: first, there was no such data being shown for a period before the HC quashed the 1997 memorandum, and second, the data given showed that SCs and STs occupied more than 15% and 7.5% in Group B, C and D posts. “The data given by you is after 2017. It is clear that this data has been prepared only for the purpose of filing the special leave petition. Nagaraj (judgment) asked you in 2006 for collection of data on inadequacy but the Union clearly did not do anything for 10 years...You say in group A there are less than 15% and 7.5% while in groups B, C and D, they are more than this. We want to know if you stopped any promotion between 2006 and 2017 where the promotional posts had gone beyond 15% and 7.5%?” the court asked the A-G. Venugopal replied that the Union government was pressing for reservation in promotion proportionate to the population of SCs and STs as per a 1995 judgment by the top court in the RK Sabharwal case and that it should be left open to the Union government and states to decide on promotional avenues for SCs and STs. To this, the court retorted that it is not questioning the method finding favour with the Centre but that the government must satisfy itself that there is inadequate representation. “What method you follow could be left to you...vacancy-based or cadre-based, etc, can be seen later. But where is that exercise? What is the exercise done by the government to collect the quantifiable data? We are not disputing any method of collecting data but there has to be something exercise. Where is that exercise?” it asked.The bench reiterated that the statistics adduced by the A-G demonstrated that there were more than required percentage of reserved category candidates in public jobs in the Northern Railway and therefore, the government should come clear on any exercise ever conducted to ascertain the number of SCs and STs in central government jobs. Venugopal responded: “You will see more than required percentage mostly in Group C and D posts. There are no takers of these jobs. General category candidates do not want these jobs. This court should not be bothered about these posts in any case.” The top law officer added that the yardstick to determine reservation in promotion should be based on the proportion worked out in relation to the populations of backward classes. The court, however, asked the A-G to place the data before it on Wednesday to justify its decision to continue with reservation in promotion in all identified posts. During the last hearing on the matter on September 14, the bench clarified that Union and state governments’ policies on reservation in promotion for the SCs and STs will have to meet all the conditions laid down in two previous Constitution bench judgments in M Nagaraj case and Jarnail Singh case (2018). The two judgments mandate the Centre and the states to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of SC/STs at different levels of public employment, assess the impact of reservation on overall administrative efficiency, and exclude the “creamy layer” before providing for reservation in promotions. Until the top court’s 2018 verdict, the concept of creamy layer applied only to Other Backwards Classes (OBCs). State governments complain that this policy is complicated and hard to implement, and creates backlog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-give-quota-once-limit-is-breached-sc-101633458616737.html
06-10-2021||India||‘Crushed from behind’: Video fuels UP tension||A 29-second video showing a vehicle plough through protesters from behind ratcheted up tensions in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday, with farm groups and Opposition leaders blaming junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and his son Ashish Mishra for the violence that killed eight people in the district two days ago.Three farmers were cremated on Tuesday but the family of a fourth demanded a second post-mortem examination, reopening an issue that appeared to have been settled on Monday with the government promising ₹45 lakh compensation and a judicial enquiry into the killings.“An agreement in Lakhimpur Kheri is not the end of the movement. The government has to dismiss the minister, arrest his son and fulfil its promises timely,” said farm leader Rakesh Tikait, who led the negotiations with the administration on Monday. Internet services were restored in the area on Tuesday evening.Farm groups say the car, a Mahindra Thar owned by Mishra, knocked down protesters in Tikunia hamlet on Sunday afternoon and sparked the violence but the minister and his son denied the charge, and blamed the cultivators of killing three people, including two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and a driver. A local journalist was also killed.“It all happened in front of me…my father was knocked down by the vehicle from behind. I tried to hold him but couldn’t do anything,” said 14-year-old Rajdeep Singh, whose father Daljeet, 35, was cremated on Tuesday. All four farmers killed were Sikhs and residents of the state’s Terai belt.The source and the veracity of the video need to be ascertained but they are in sync with the version of the protesting farmers. The identity of the individuals in the vehicles is unclear.While the minister’s version of the incident is that the vehicles came under attack and lost control, nothing of that sort can be seen in the video. The lead vehicle appears to deliberately run over the farmers — and from behind. To be sure, the video is only 29 seconds long and is only a blurry video shot at the time of the incident.The exact spot in the video appears to be of Tikunia road leading towards Lakhimpur and around 100 meters away from the playground where the farmers were staging the protest on the day of the incident. If authentic, the video is likely to inflame sentiments against Ajay Mishra and his son Ashish.Hardeep Singh, 38, a farmer from Tikunia who was at the spot at the time of the incident and who has seen this video said, “The video confirms what we have been saying all along. And we say that Ashish Mishra was present in one of the vehicles and is responsible for the killing of the innocent farmers”.Police said it will probe the videos. “All the videos and photographs of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident that have surfaced and surfacing will be authenticated and included in the investigation,” said Prashant Kumar, additional director general (ADG), law and order.Post-mortem reports of the farmers killed showed that there were no bullet injuries on any of the bodies, and that all four died due to shock, excessive bleeding and haemorrhage , said SN Sabat, officiating additional director general of police (Lucknow Zone).HT has not seen a copy of the post-mortem reports.The findings, experts say, are consistent with deaths arising from injuries, such as those caused in an automobile accident, although it isn’t known whether the reports themselves point to the farmers being run over by a vehicle, as indicated in the unauthenticated video that has emerged.Ashish Mishra and 20 others were booked by the police for murder and criminal conspiracy on Monday. The complainant, a local farmer, alleged in the first information report (FIR) that Ashish Mishra was in the car that mowed down protesters, and that he fired shots at the farmers, killing one.“The cars were at high speed, lost control and overturned… Ashish Mishra escaped into the sugarcane fields while firing shots,” read the FIR, accessed by HT. The document also mentioned three cars and the make and registration numbers of two of them.Ashish Mishra, however, said farmers pelted stones at the convoy, which made the driver lose control; farmers then set fire to two cars, pulled out two BJP workers and the driver and lynched them.“How can the allegations be proven when we were not at the spot?” Ajay Mishra asked reporters.The minister, and some of his colleagues in the BJP, speculated about the presence of external “anti-national elements” among the protesting farmers in interviews and comments. “From Indira Gandhi to Priyanka Vadra, nothing has changed for anti-national Congress.It was and is dependent on Khalistanis to grab power at the cost of Bharata Mata,” tweeted BJP general secretary CT Ravi.The Opposition continued to keep the pressure up on the government, citing the viral video. “Modiji Namaskar, have you seen this video that shows son of a minister of your government crushing farmers under his vehicle?” asked Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was detained on Monday on her way to Lakhimpur.Officials said that the family of one of the dead farmers – Gurvinder Singh -- was not satisfied with the autopsy report and that a re-examination of the body was in progress.Gurvinder Singh’s family insisted that he died by gunfire. Senior district administration officials confirmed to PTI that his second post-mortem will be conducted at the district hospital. “We don’t want to conduct his last rites after a false post-mortem report,” a relative said.The bodies of the other four deceased -- Ajay Kumar Mishra’s driver, Hari Om, BJP workers Shyam Sundar and Shubham Mishra, and local journalist Raman Kashyap – were handed over to their families after post-mortem examinations at the district hospital late on Sunday night.The farmers had gathered on Sunday to protest UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and laid siege to the helipad, leading to cancellation of the meeting. As farmers returned from the protest site, a speeding convoy of three ripped through the crowd around 2.30pm, protesters said. It had a Mahindra Thar in the lead, a Fortuner, and a smaller car.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crushed-from-behind-video-fuels-up-tension-101633458555169.html
06-10-2021||India||Kashmiri Pandit among 3 killed by terrorists in J&K||Three persons were killed by terrorists in three separate incidents in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, police said. The Resistance Force (TRF), an outfit affiliated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for two of the attacks, they added. The deceased included Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and the owner of one of the most popular medical stores in Srinagar.Police said Bindoo was shot at by the terrorists around 7 pm while he was attending customers at his shop in Srinagar’s Iqbal Park area. The 68-year-old suffered multiple injuries and was declared brought dead, doctors at SMHS hospital said. “Terrorists fired upon owner of Bindroo Medicate namely Shri Makhan Lal Bindroo near Iqbal Park Srinagar. He was shifted to hospital where he succumbed to injuries. Area cordoned off and search to nab the terrorists is going on,” a police spokesperson said.Bindroo was among the few Kashmiri Pandits who did not migrate out at the onset of militancy in 1990.Within an hour, a street vendor was shot dead by terrorists near Madina Chowk in Lalbazar, police said. The vendor was identified as Virender Paswan, a resident of Bihar’s Bhagalpur.The TRF, police said, claimed responsibility for the attacks on Bindoo and Paswan. Later, a civilian was shot at by terrorists at Naidkhai in Bandipora district, police said. Mohammad Shafi Lone, the head of a local taxi stand, was rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to injuries. Bindroo’s killing was widely condemned by political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Altaf Thakur seeking punishment for the accused. “Those behind the killing of Bindroo have no religion as the killing of unarmed persons is never justified in any religion. I express my solidarity with the family members of Bindroo and urge police to expose and punish his killers, sooner than better,” Thakur said.Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti tweeted: “Condemn the killing of Shri M L Bindroo who chose to stay back in Kashmir even during peak insurgency. Such acts of violence have no place in our society. May his family find the strength to deal with this loss.” National Conference leader Omar Abdullah tweeted: “What terrible news! He was a very kind man. I’ve been told he never left during the height of militancy and remained with his shop open. I condemn this killing in the strongest possible terms & convey my heartfelt condolences to his family. God bless his soul.” People’s Conference chief Sajjad Lone also condemned the attack. “The fatal attack against the owner of Bindroo Medicates is outrageous and unacceptable. I knew the gentleman personally. He never left the valley. And terrorists made him pay for that. May he live in peace,” he posted on Twitter. CPI (M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said he had no words to condemn such a heinous and shameful act. “His unfortunate death has sent shockwaves. No words to condemn such a heinous andc shameful act. This is indeed an irreparable loss for the whole society,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmiri-pandit-among-3-killed-by-terrorists-in-jk-101633458376288.html

It added security gadgets, installed at court premises, are outdated and should be updated or replaced with equipment such as high-resolution CCTV cameras and monitors.“District Courts may be directed to provide these security gadgets & logistics at the earliest to the Security Unit at each court,” the affidavit said. It added parking areas in the city courts were insufficient for lawyers and thus vehicles are parked inside and also all along boundary walls imposing a great security risk.“Similarly, clients/litigants are not having earmarked parking at all in any court. They are parking vehicles on the roads and traffic gets slow and jammed. This is a matter of concern day to day which also contributes towards increasing pollution. Thus, new infrastructure needs to be developed in nearby places with multilevel parking facilities for advocates and clients, etc,” the affidavit said.The affidavit came after the high court took up the matter following the shootout at Rohini court. The high court earlier asked the city police and all the other stakeholders, including bar associations, to give suggestions to improve the situation.Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/specialised-unit-has-taken-over-security-of-delhi-courts-in-shooting-aftermath-police-to-hc-101633457477268.html
06-10-2021||India||Goa seafarer dies at sea; family alleges ship denied him medical assistance||The Goa Seamen Association of India (GSAI), a collective of seafarers, has called for a ‘fair inquiry’ into the death of Beejoy Sequeira, a local lad who worked as a chef on board Ship MV Jabal Alkawar on September 17. His family has accused the shipping company of neglecting his health and denying him emergency medical evacuation, which they say, resulted in his death. Sequeira, 37, was believed to have contracted Covid-19 with symptoms developing while he was at sea and. His family has alleged that he was denied medical attention despite his symptoms taking a turn for the worse. According to the family, he was not allowed to disembark, neither was he hospitalized. He is survived by his wife and two young daughters aged six and four. Sequeira was employed as a chief cook on board MV JABAL AL KHAWR, bulk carrier, registered in Marshall Islands, ship owned and operated by Oman Shipping Company. “He was sick since 5th September when the vessel was in port in Malaysia, his condition deteriorated and there was no initiative taken by the master and the company to medi-evac him or divert the ship to the nearest port. The company has not replied as to what events led to his death, the company only called to inform that he expired on 17th September 2021,” president of the GSAI, Frank Viegas, said. His family is now running from pillar to post to try and get his body from Mauritius where it presently lies after the ship made a late decision to divert to Mauritius en route from Malaysia to South Africa. Beejoy joined the ship in March this year well before the vaccination drive began in India and was unvaccinated. On September 7, Beejoy informed his brother Eldon that he was experiencing a high fever with Covid-19 symptoms for the last two days and that another crew member was also displaying similar symptoms.“At this point, the ship was in port in Malaysia discharging cargo. His condition appeared to improve with his fever subsiding but he continued to experience cough and body ache. By this time, the ship had left port and the next port of call was Cape Town, South Africa. On 11 September he again informed me that his health was deteriorating and that he was not able to move around and was coughing constantly and that three other crew members were kept in isolation by the master,” Eldon said. Eldon asked him to request the shipmaster to divert the ship and disembark him as his health was deteriorating rapidly. “The master also agreed that his health was certainly worsening and that he would request the company to get him off the ship after diverting to the nearest port. Instead, on 12 September, the master informed him that medical aid was being arranged at Cape Town, South Africa, where they were scheduled to reach by 26-27 September,” Eldon said. This would mean a further period of 15 days before any medical attention could be administered. Increasingly desperate, his family back home urged him to continue to “somehow convince the master to divert the ship” while simultaneously calling the crewing agency ‘V-Ships Mumbai and requested them to arrange for his emergency relief. However, they were curtly told that he was ‘stable’ and his condition was being monitored. On 17 September he sent voice messages that he was too weak to even stand up and was having difficulty in breathing. The same day, the company called up the family to inform them that he was no more.“It is clearly evident that the complete negligence on the part of the master, DPA, the owners of the Oman Shipping Company and the V-ships management is the cause of my brother’s death. The master should have carried out the RT-PCR test while the vessel was still in port. He also provided false information to Malaysia port control regarding Covid-19 clearance protocol before departure knowing that some of his crew members were sick with Covid symptoms, later, he also failed to divert the ship and request Emergency Medical Evacuation even after my brother’s health condition worsened,” Eldon said. “I personally feel that he decided to ignore the facts and carry on with the voyage at the behest of the owners and management, keeping in mind the cost involved if the ship is quarantined,” he added. The GSAI has demanded an inquiry to establish the facts and hold those responsible accountable. “It was utter negligence on the part of the master for not diverting the ship when he was advised by the shore medical team. There is always lots of commercial pressure from the owners/managers. Ultimately, it’s the responsibility of the master to make the right decision. Today, a life was lost due to sheer negligence,” Viegas said. “Due to the casual approach of all stakeholders, precious time and opportunities were lost, whereby medical attention could have been administered, which would have saved his life, instead of allowing his health to deteriorate over a period of ten days since he first displayed symptoms,” Viegas added. “I have notified all the concerned authorities including Port state control of Mauritius (where the ship is anchored to disembark my brother’s mortal remains) Flag state of Marshall Islands, ITF, IMO, DG Shipping India, Ministry of Shipping and Request them to take strong action against the above-mentioned parties involved. But sadly there’s no reply from any of the Authorities,” Eldon said.The shipping company has offered a similar version of events but said it took the best course of action available.“Bejoy Ressel Sequeira first reported feeling unwell on September 9 and was immediately isolated in his cabin as per Master’s instructions, who then immediately contacted the managers and the International Radio Medical centre (CIRM) for advice and treatment. The company reviewed options for diverting the vessel to obtain further medical support, but as the vessel was through the Sunda Strait and into the Indian Ocean, the best option was identified as Mauritius. Tragically, the chief cook passed away on September 17 and the vessel anchored in Port Louis on September 20th,” Pat Adamson, representing Oman Ship Management Company, said.“An autopsy carried out in Mauritius on September 30 showed that the chief cook passed away as a result of pulmonary embolism, the body being free of infection or any contagious diseases,” he added.“Managers and crew managers, offer their heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of Bejoy Sequeira at this tragic time, with support and information to families being provided via V.Ships India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-seafarer-dies-at-sea-family-alleges-ship-denied-him-medical-assistance-101633443195497.html
06-10-2021||India||Two-finger test not done on woman officer, claims IAF chief||No illegal two-finger test was conducted on a woman air force officer to confirm rape after she accused a flight lieutenant of the crime in Coimbatore, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari claimed on Tuesday.“Let me assure you that the IAF is very strict when it comes to such incidents. We have no latitude for any misconduct or moral turpitude cases. The two-finger test is misreported. In actual fact, this has not been done,” Chaudhari said in response to a question on the Coimbatore rape case.Chaudhari’s comments came during the air force chief’s customary media interaction ahead of the 89th anniversary of IAF on October 8. He said action will be taken in the case according to law.“We are well aware of the rules. And all disciplinary action that will come out from this inquiry(into the case) will be taken,” the IAF chief said. He took over as air chief on September 30 after Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria retired.Coimbatore-based advocate R Mohanakrishnan, who was present in court during the hearing and handing over of the accused flight lieutenant from judicial custody to the IAF, said that since the magistrate court did not have any power in this case, the court had not recorded statements and evidence given by the victim.“Now, the medical officers will not go against the Air Chief Marshall. The victim can only come out and say they have conducted the finger test. The only material evidence now is an entry in a register kept in the Medical Inspection room in the Air Force where any person going for a medical check has to register their name, rank and service number,” he added.According to people aware of the developments, the victim has not engaged a personal lawyer. “As per the Air Force Act, the victim cannot keep a lawyer. The enquiry officer will be there on the side of the victim,” said Mohanakrishnan who was in service in the Air Force until the early 1990s.According to the first information report (FIR) filed by Tamil Nadu police on September 20, which was seen by HT, the 28-year-old woman officer said she was raped on campus at the Air Force Administrative College in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district.In the FIR, the woman officer accused IAF doctors of subjecting her to an illegal two-finger test to confirm rape, of adopting a hostile attitude towards her during the inquiry, and of tampering with the evidence, as previously reported by HT.She reached out to the police after losing confidence in how the Air Force Administrative College was conducting the investigation, but a Coimbatore court went by the book and accepted the accused’s plea that he could only be court martialled, not tried in a civilian court.The case comes at a time when women are being given more opportunities in the armed forces to realise their potential.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the past six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace. As of February 2021, there were 9,118 women serving in the army, navy and air force.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when IAF decided to induct them as fighter pilots. Earlier this year, the Indian Navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years. But tanks and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones for women.The Union Public Service Commission on September 24 opened an application window for women candidates to apply for the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination, 2021.This came after the Supreme Court stressed on September 22 that it “cannot belie the aspirations of young girls” as it rejected the Union government’s request to delay the first-ever examination for women candidates for their entry into NDA, and directed that they be allowed to sit for the exam on November 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twofinger-test-not-done-on-woman-officer-says-iaf-chief-101633428493849.html
06-10-2021||Today's||Don’t just blame big-ticket projects for the destruction of the Himalayas||This year’s monsoon season has been hard on Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. Both states witnessed intense rainfall in short durations (a tell-tale sign of the climate crisis), flash floods, and landslides. The result: Loss of lives and livelihoods, the ruin of expensive and hard-to-build infrastructure, and long-term ecological damage of the disaster-affected regions, which is sure to have wider ramifications.
