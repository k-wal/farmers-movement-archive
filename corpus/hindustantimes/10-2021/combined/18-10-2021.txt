While the demand for a public holiday on Chhath and arrangements at the ghats have been at the centre of the political tussle in the past, this time, it’s the ban on its celebrations by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).

18-10-2021||Delhi||Politics intensifies as Delhi civic bodies begin Chhath Puja preparations||New Delhi: Politics over the ban on Chhath Puja in Delhi this year in the light of Covid 19 pandemic intensified on Monday with the BJP-ruled municipal corporations announcing that they have begun preparations for the annual festival. The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already announced that it will celebrate the festival, albeit with Covid protocols. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) banned Chhath Puja on September 30 -- the second consecutive year that the authorities prohibited the celebrations. Mukesh Suryan, the mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said directions have been issued to the officials to start preparations at sites where Chhath Puja will be held. “I have recently inspected on Chhath Puja ghat in Vasant Vihar. We will be holding the community festival on 148 Chhath ghats. The festival will be held and there are no doubts in our minds that permission will be obtained,” Suryan said. Leader of the house in SDMC Inderjeet Sehrawat said the Chhath festival will be held “like every year”. “We have decided to keep the preparations ready from our side. The permission will be secured,” he added.However, the BJP has been blaming the Delhi government for the ban on the festival, and urging the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) dispensation to get the nod so that festivities could go on. Last Thursday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who is the DDMA chairperson, to allow the festival with Covid protocols. On October 12, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, urging the Centre to issue guidelines for the Chhath festival as soon as possible following consultation with health experts.Chhath Puja, a three-day festival, will be celebrated between November 8-10 this year. It is most popular in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and parts of Madhya Pradesh.With 4 million constituents, of the total 14.7 million registered voters in Delhi, poorvanchalis have emerged as a major cultural and political block in the city during the last decade, and the observance of Chhath festival-- which is observed six days after Diwali-- in public places has also grown proportionally. From just 72 ghats in 2015, the number of Chhath sites in Delhi has grown to 1,108 in 2019.BJP MP from Northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari, one of the most prominent Poorvanchali BJP leader, launched a yatra in his constituency on October 9 against the DDMA ban.Chhail Bihari Goswami, the leader of the house in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said they are going ahead with the Chhath ghat preparations, disinfection and fogging of the designated sites. “We have earmarked at least one to two sites in each of the 104 municipal wards under our jurisdiction. Preparations will be made in anticipation of permission being granted,” he added. Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, the mayor of the east DMC said majority of Chhath ghat sites in densely populated east Delhi areas are located along the Yamuna between Wazirabad and Noida border. “I have held review meetings with senior officials. Cleaning of sites along the river will be initiated on mission mode so that devotees don’t face any problem. Besides deploying sanitation staff, mobile toilets and fogging machines we will also carry out repair work of approach roads on major ghats,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/politics-intensifies-as-delhi-civic-bodies-begin-chhath-puja-preparations-101634581610079.html

18-10-2021||Pune||Decision to increase gap between 2 Covid doses not political or due to shortage: Dr Bharti Pawar||PUNE: The decision to increase or decrease the gap between two doses is based purely on scientific evidence and not political considerations or shortage of vaccines, said Dr Bharti Pawar, minister of state in the ministry of health and family welfare. She was addressing a press conference at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Monday. Earlier, Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of the Serum Institute of India (SII), said that the government had increased the gap between two doses from one month to three months due to shortage of vaccines.Interacting with the media about the work carried out by the PMC during both waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pawar said, “The decision to increase the gap between two doses was based on evidence and studies undertaken by the ICMR, the central health ministry and various other experts. It was not a political decision and neither was it due to shortage of vaccines. We also have a medical task force which works on this and so, political statements do not matter.”On August 13, Poonawalla said that a gap of two months between two doses of Covishield is ideal however the current gap of three months and the earlier gap of just one month are both wrong. “A two months’ gap is ideal. Also it is true that the number of antibodies would decrease after six months however memory cells are present in the body. It is advisable to get a third dose or booster shot six months after the second dose. Unless the virus has reduced nominally across the world, we might need to take vaccines,” Poonawalla said. SII is the largest manufacturer of Covid-19 vaccines and is supplying over 90% of the required vaccines in the country.Dr Pawar said that the decision regarding the booster dose and allowing people who have got only one shot of the vaccine to travel would also depend on expert opinion and not political statements. On Sunday, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government is contemplating whether or not to allow people who have got only one dose of the vaccine to travel by train or visit malls – activities that are currently reserved only for those who have taken both shots of the vaccine.However, task force member, Dr Sanjay Oak, said, “According to the ICMR, the ideal gap between two doses is 82 days which is currently applicable. Also, the task force has recommended to the government that though we cannot remain in a state of lockdown perpetually, this unlock cannot be a substitute for Covid-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing a mask or following basic respiratory hygiene. Also, it is not advisable to allow people who have got only one shot to travel freely as both doses are essential and immunity levels after one dose are not enough.”Pawar also lauded the work carried out by the Pune Platform for Covid-19 response, a volunteer and citizen group formed during the pandemic and invited the team to Delhi to explain their model so that the same could be replicated in other cities as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/decision-to-increase-gap-between-2-covid-doses-not-political-or-due-to-shortage-dr-bharti-pawar-101634581596322.html

The incident happened at around 11 PM.The people cited above said four cadres of the NSCN (K) Niki Sumi group were in the area reportedly to pick up some of their cadres who were allegedly being held by the NSCN (U) in their camp at Khehoi. Upon nearing the camp area, NSCN (U) men allegedly stopped the vehicle carrying the NSCN (K) Niki group cadres which ensued in an exchange of gunshots.People familiar with the matter also informed that one NSCN (K) Niki group cadre was shot dead during the encounter while one was “apprehended” by the NSCN (U), another was caught by the police and one ran away.It was learnt that since both groups are currently in a ceasefire agreement with the government of India, they are tied to the Ceasefire Ground Rules, which were apparently violated by both sides.Chairman of Ceasefire Monitoring Group (CFMG Nagaland) Lt. Gen. (retired) AS Bedi is said to have rushed to the spot on Monday to take stock of the situation and held meetings with both groups. The situation is stated to be under control but tense.Meanwhile, the NSCN (K) Niki group, in a statement, questioned the motive of the Naga national political groups (NNPGs), of which the NSCN (U) is a part, behind the killing of their “additional secretary” Atoka Kinimi at a juncture when all Nagas are yearning for peace. The statement said that fratricidal acts amongst Naga groups will not benefit the ongoing Naga political talks in any way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1-killed-in-gunfight-between-two-nscn-factions-in-nagaland-101634581594870.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Two killed, 1 injured in three separate cases; at least 2 minors apprehended||New Delhi: Two persons were killed and another was injured in three separate crimes that took place reportedly over minor issues in south and central Delhi areas between Friday night and early Sunday morning. At least one of the crimes was committed allegedly by minor boys.In one of the murder cases that took place on Sunday evening in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar, an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death allegedly by his neighbour following an altercation. The entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera installed in the lane where the murder took place.The victim, identified by his first name Imran, worked as a painter and police said that the initial enquiry has revealed that the two allegedly had some enmity over a girl. Imran’s relative, Ayesha, said that he was having food at home when the neighbour called him outside around 7 pm. In the video footage, Imran is puportedly seen resisting attempts by three boys to pull him to an adjacent lane when one of them allegedly attacks him and stabs him in the abdomen. The video further shows the two boys accompanying the attacker attempting to further attacks even as the latter kicks Imran twice, following which he falls on the ground.The suspect is purportedly seen stabbing him further and then leaves the crime scene as a few others, who gather around the spot, are seen helping the injured man.A case of murder was registered and several teams were formed to nab the suspect, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker.The second murder took place on Friday night in Anand Parbat’s Nehru Nagar, where a man was stabbed to death allegedly by a man, identifed as Vivek (18), over ₹500 that he sought for buying marijuana. A case of murder was registered at the Anand Parbat police station and the suspect was arrested on Monday. DCP (central) Shweta Chauhan said that Vivek was consuming liquor near a Ramlila park when he was approached by the victim who allegedly sought money to buy the drug and snatched ₹500 from his pocket. “In a subsequent altercation, the suspect stabbed him to death and fled the spot,” said the DCP.In the third case, a tea seller, Ram Kishan (26), was shot in the leg allegedly by four juveniles following an altercation over a delay in serving refreshment at his stall near Safdarjung hospital in south Delhi in the early hours of Sunday.

The PMC has appointed six paediatricians full time, and is preparing to appoint additional paediatricians on a contract basis. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief medical officer at the PMC health department said, “Despite Covid-19 wave receding, we are still preparing for the third wave which was anticipated to affect children the most. We have appointed six full time paediatricians at our hospitals and have also processed the appointment of additional paediatricians in case there is a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. We have paediatricians that will cater to the paediatric requirements in civic hospitals.” PMC data reveals that in the first and second Covid waves, the number of children with Covid-19 fell from 11.15% to 9.94%. Although the absolute number of Covid-19 patients aged under the age of 18 was more in the second wave than the first, in terms of a percentage of overall cases, the number is lower in the second wave. As per PMC data, the first Covid-19 wave which lasted from May 2020 to October 2020 saw 200,00 patients of which 22,792 were aged below 18 year. This accounts for 11.15% of the patient population. Of these 22,000 patients, 31 died and 22,761 recovered. However in the second wave, between March and October 2021, 298,000 patients were reported, of which 29,661 were below the age of 18, which is 9.94% of the patient population. In the second wave, deaths due to the infection among children was also lower, 26. The case fatality rate in the first wave was 0.14% and in the second wave it was 0.09%.

18-10-2021||Delhi||MPD-2041: Public hearing focuses on housing for urban poor, ownership rights||On Day One of the public hearing on the Master Plan of Delhi-2041 (MPD-2041) on Monday, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) held consultations with the public on issues concerning migrant workers and the urban poor living in the national capital. A total of 8,781 people were invited to attend the public hearing, DDA officials said.The consultations were divided into six slots and issues discussed included affordable housing for migrant workers, facilities for street vendors, provision for ownership rights to people living in resettlement colonies, provisions for day care centres or crèches, and recognition of unauthorised residential colonies that have come up on Zone O (Yamuna floodplains).The draft MPD-2041 is the vision document for the city’s growth over the next two decades, and proposes to make Delhi a 24X7 city with night-time economy, affordable housing, mixed development and transit-oriented development.Following the row over the limited time given by the DDA for public hearings, the land-owning agency has put out a detailed schedule for public hearings that will be held between October 18 and November 10.While the DDA has invited a total of 17,162 people to participate in the two-day session beginning October 18, it will hold chapter-wise hearings from October 25, officials said. The DDA has received over 1,200 objections/suggestions to MPD-2041 related to environment, economy, transport and mobility, and shelter, among others. Nearly 10,000 comments were received for the land use plan proposed under the draft master plan, while another 2,900 comments were received on development control norms. A senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “There were a lot of people who discussed very local issues related to sanitation and lack of toilets. There were some who spoke about the need for housing.”DDA officials said they have got suggestions regarding affordable housing for the urban poor. The demand is that at least 10% of the land for housing be reserved for low-cost or affordable housing and provision be made to protect existing slum clusters.With municipal corporations carrying out surveys to identify street vendors in various markets, DDA officials said they received suggestions from people that vending zones in markets be clearly demarcated. Residents of Savda Ghevra, a resettlement colony which came up 15 years ago, submitted objections over the delay in getting ownership rights. Residents demanded that provision be made in the MPD-2041 to provide them ownership rights and essential civic infrastructure such as public transport, markets and community centres, and that development be planned in such a manner as to aid them in getting more employment.While the Centre announced the PM-UDAY scheme in 2019 to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, there are around 80 such colonies which are unable to avail of the benefit as their area falls in Zone O of the MPD-2021— the land planning zone which encompasses the Yamuna floodplains, where the National Green Tribunal has decreed a status quo.Anil Sharma, a resident of Jaitpur, said, “I raised the matter in the public hearing on Monday. I requested DDA to exclude 52 colonies in and around Badarpur assembly constituency from Zone O. In the new master plan, the DDA has divided Zone O in two parts. But we want the DDA to remove our colonies completely from Zone O so that development work can take place and we can get ownership rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mpd2041-public-hearing-focuses-on-housing-for-urban-poor-ownership-rights-101634581238963.html

18-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Man arrested for kidnapping traffic cop during checking drive||A 29-year-old man was arrested on Monday evening for allegedly kidnapping a traffic constable during a checking drive in Surajpur on Sunday. The police identified the suspect as Sachin Rawal, a resident of Ghodi Bacheda village in Greater Noida. The traffic constable, Virendra Singh, 38, said he had received information that the suspect was moving in a stolen vehicle. “I stopped the suspect’s Maruti Swift Dzire in Surajpur around 9.45am and asked to produce vehicle’s registration paper. The suspect asked me to sit inside the car, saying that he would show the vehicle’s papers on a mobile phone,” Singh said. “As soon as I entered the car, the suspect locked the doors and drove away the vehicle for around 8km. I was shocked as he was not slowing down the vehicle despite repeated requests,” the constable said. Singh dialled 112 and alerted the police. A police team started tracing the suspect’s car. Then the suspect dumped the constable near Ajaibpur police check post and fled with the car, the police said. Sohanveer Singh, sub-inspector at Surajpur police station, said the police launched a search and arrested the suspect from Ghodi Bacheda village on Monday evening. “We have also seized the car. Initial investigations showed that the suspect had stolen the car from a showroom in Gurugram two years ago on the pretext of a test drive,” he said. A case has been registered against the suspect under sections 364 (kidnapping), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person) of the Indian Penal Code. “The suspect will be produced in court on Tuesday,” said the sub-inspector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-man-arrested-for-kidnapping-traffic-cop-during-checking-drive-101634581063572.html

In the state capital, 354 centres conducted Covid vaccination.In state, 1,71,9969 doses were administered till 8pm at 15,778 vaccination centres. “Focus will be more upon rural pockets that lag behind urban areas in vaccination coverage,” said Dr Agrawal.UP crosses 12-cr Covid vaccination mark
18-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt revives plan to rationalise bus routes in the city||New Delhi: The Delhi government is reviving its plan to rationalise bus routes in the city with the introduction of electric buses on smaller routes and increasing the frequency of buses on major trunk routes, senior officials privy to the development said on Monday.In 2018, the Delhi Integrated Multi-modal Transit System (DIMTS) Limited had prepared a fresh report -- “Route rationalisation and last mile connectivity” -- on the direction of the city administration but its implementation was put on hold due to the northeast Delhi riots, assembly elections, and then the Covid-19 pandemic. “Now, the transport minister (Kailash Gahlot) has directed all officials to take up the matter again and revisit the bus route rationalisation plan of Delhi and include electric buses, as well as non-motorised public vehicles, for last mile connectivity,” said a senior transport official on condition of anonymity.The first phase of the project aims to provide bus service to everyone within 500 metres of walking distance for residents. As part of the plan, trunk routes -- connecting large towns and mostly running on arterial roads -- will connect all zonal hubs in Delhi with a frequency of 5-10 minutes. The trunk routes will be fed by primary routes at a frequency of 10 to 20 minutes. These in turn will be connected via village connectivity or feeder services, running at a frequency of 20 to 45 minutes. This will be achieved by increasing the number of buses and reorganising the bus routes, an official said, adding that at present, many routes are obsolete. Officials said that currently, buses operating on the trunk routes have a frequency ranging from 10 minutes to 1.5 hours. The other routes also see similarly large frequency gaps.Officials said the three-tier routing pattern will be superimposed by commercial business districts (CBD) circulatory routes to connect the major commercial hubs in Delhi. Officials said the idea is to optimise the existing bus fleet for better service to customers.With Delhi planning to induct electric buses, Gahlot has directed officials and stakeholders to include it in the route rationalisation plan. A total of 300 e-buses are being procured by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), a first in the national capital. Of these 300 e-buses, 200 are to be provided by JBM while the remaining will be manufactured by Tata Motors. Additionally, the Delhi government gave its go-ahead for procurement of another 465 e-buses under the cluster scheme last month.“The first prototype, of the electric buses the government is bringing to the city, will be pressed into service in a week or two. Initial reports suggest that e-buses run fewer kilometres compared to the existing CNG buses in the city. Therefore, initially, the e-buses will be rolled out on smaller routes. Later, depending on their performance, charging time and feedback from passengers, they will be put on longer routes,” said a second transport official. Experts said that currently, the frequency of DTC or cluster buses in Delhi is highly unpredictable. “This is because of the presence of a large number of routes and limited number of buses for these routes. Therefore, some stops may have buses at every five minutes, some at every 30 minutes or more. Therefore, the overall system becomes unreliable. In a trunk and feeder based system, the trunk corridor, which has the maximum number of buses, gets highly reliable service as buses are not stuck in neighbourhood traffic. Thus, the waiting period for the next bus is far lower and the service is much more predictable, leading to a more reliable service,” said Amit Bhatt, executive director at World Resources Institute, India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-revives-plan-to-rationalise-bus-routes-in-the-city-101634580692665.html

The Trust has already set a deadline to enthrone Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) in the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram temple in Ayodhya by December 2023 to allow devotees to worship the deity.Lord Ram’s birthday is celebrated on Ram Navami, which falls in March or April. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken up with space scientists the issue of the Sun’s rays illuminating Lord Ram’s idol every Ram Navami for a few minutes at noon,” Rai said to the media after a two-day meeting of the Ram temple construction committee began in Ayodhya on Monday.“Scientists are making efforts and they are hopeful of a positive outcome,” added Rai.The Sun’s rays reach inside the Sun temple at Konark in Odisha and a team of scientists, astronomers, architects and technical experts are planning to design the Ram temple’s sanctum sanctorum (also) in such a way, said a Trust member. Committee chairman Nripendra Misra discussed with experts the technical issues related to the ongoing construction work of Ram temple. For his part, Rai said: “At present casting of the raft above the temple’s foundation is going on.” “A maximum temperature of 22-23 degrees centigrade is required at the time of casting. For this, work (casting) is being done during the night. Ice in large quantity is also being used to maintain the temperature,” said Rai. “At present, the night temperature is around 25 degrees centigrade. So, ice is being used to maintain temperature,” he added.According to the Trust, a 1.5-metre thick raft is being placed above the foundation. The plinth will be constructed using Mirzapur stone granite above this raft. After that, placement of stones for the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram temple will start.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ram-temple-experts-tasked-with-getting-sunlight-to-illuminate-idol-every-ram-navami-says-champat-rai-101634580452666.html

Sunil Pradhan, BKU-Tikait media in-charge, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the farmers’ union organised a massive protest on Monday. “We have several demands, including employment for farmers’ children, education, healthcare facilities, increased compensation, developed plots to farmers whose land was acquired, etc. We have organised protests in the past too, but the officials just give us assurances and do not find a concrete solution,” he said.Farmers are disgruntled with the Noida, Greater Noida and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development authorities, which have acquired around 80,000 hectares of land from farmers for developmental purposes since 1976. Noida, established in 1976, acquired around 20,000 ha, Greater Noida, set up in 1992, acquired 38,000 ha and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), established in 2002, acquired around 20,000 ha for various projects, including the airport at Jewar. The three authorities still need to acquire more land for developmental works such as basic infrastructure, industrial usage and residential usage. Meanwhile, farmers have been protesting against the Noida authority for the past 47 days, alleging that their needs have been ignored during the development of the industrial towns. On Monday, farmers from Yamuna authority villages also joined the protest and blocked traffic in Sector 6 and other parts of the district. “We demand 10% of residential land for our families against the total land acquired by the authorities , 64% more money than what we have got so far, old abadi settlements in villages, unregulated construction in villages and corruption-free work in government offices,” said Sukhbir Yadav, a farmer leader who has been protesting for the last 47 days.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic) Gautam Budh Nagar, said that traffic was diverted to the service lane of the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway due to the protest. “The farmers later reached Chilla border and protested for 15 minutes. We diverted Delhi-bound traffic to the DND Flyway,” he said. He said the farmers left the spot at 5pm and went to the Noida Authority office. Pranjal Kumar, a commuter, said that he was caught in a traffic jam on the expressway for half-an-hour in the afternoon. “The traffic police should have alerted the commuters in advance about such a protest,” he said.The farmers’ protest exacerbated the problem caused by rain, construction work on the underpass, and some potholes on the expressway near Sector 150, the DCP said, adding that traffic on the expressway had been slow since the morning. “The Noida Authority is developing an underpass at Sector 150. The construction work had made the road rough. Vehicles were moving slowly at the spot,” the DCP said.A senior manager of Noida Authority, who requested not to be named, said due to construction work one carriageway of the expressway was blocked. “Due to rain, the road on the other carriageway had become rough. We repaired the road and vehicular movement resumed at 9.30am,” he said.Later in the day, a farmers’ group also reached Dankaur railway station and claimed to have halted a Delhi-Howrah train. However, Arvind Pathak, station house officer, Dankaur police station, said the train had halted as it did not get a green signal. “The farmers reached there and captured some photos. The police soon asked them to leave,” he said.Top officials of the Noida, Greater Noida authorities and Yeida met with the farmers around 7pm at the Noida Authority’s main administrative building in Sector 6 and discussed their issues. Farmers said they have demanded written assurances from the officials.“We are discussing all their issues and taking appropriate action so that their issues can be addressed as per the law,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty of the Noida authority and in-charge of farmers’ issues.Later at night, farmers said the talks failed to yield results. Farmers continued to sit at the authority office late into the night and said they will continue the agitation till their demands are accepted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/disgruntled-farmers-block-traffic-occupy-expressways-across-gautam-budh-nagar-101634580411318.html
18-10-2021||Noida||Environmentalists allege GMC’s laxity for waste dumping near Hindon floodplains||City-based environmentalists on Monday hit out at the Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC), alleging that the civic body has been lagging behind in controlling dumping of garbage in the floodplains along the Hindon River and the forest area behind Mahamaya Stadium in the city.Activist Vikrant Sharma, who recently filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for the alleged dumping of solid waste at different places near Raj Nagar Extension on a daily basis, said, “Dumping of garbage and solid waste continued near the floodplains of the river even after I filed the petition. Such an activity is not allowed. The tribunal had also directed to stop dumping these there in connection with a petition filed in 2015. I shot pictures and videos of the garbage scattered at the floodplains, and also apprised district administration officials regarding this,” Sharma said.“Such activities have also been witnessed behind the Nandi Park area and on the floodplain side of the Hindon elevated road in the past as well,” he added.Echoing similar views, environmentalist Akash Vashishtha said that he appraised the GMC officials after witnessing dumping activities near the floodplains of the Hindon River. “The river stretches and floodplains need to be cleared and any such dumping activities should be stopped with an immediate effect. I have also complained to the district administration officials about this issue. If such activities continue, the river ecology and the habitat around it will be disturbed even more,” he said.“Similar dumps can also be witnessed near the city forest area behind the Mahamaya Stadium, though there is an order of status quo and other measures for restoration, as directed by the Allahabad high court in October 2012,” Vashishtha added.The area behind the Mahamaya Stadium, which once had a dense tree cover, is a designated ‘city forest’ under the Master Plan 2021, and is located close to the Hindon River.Councillor Rajendra Tyagi had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) after hundreds of trees in the city forest were damaged following garbage dumping and overflowing of sewage. When contacted, GMC commissioner MS Tanwar said that he will direct the officials concerned to take care of the dumping issues immediately.City health officer Mithilesh Kumar, meanwhile, said that after the sites at Raj Nagar Extension were abandoned, the GMC has been ensuring the people that daily solid waste is being picked up from major road stretches and localities with the help of door-to-door garbage collection vehicles. “The GMC is not involved in dumping any solid waste -- either at the city forest or at the floodplains of the Hindon River. It is likely that some unidentified persons are dumping garbage at the city forest... and we have seized the vehicle or equipment used to dump solid waste from the Khoda locality,” Kumar said.Ghaziabad is estimated to generate nearly 1,200 metric tonnes of daily solid waste, but officials say that there is a deficit of 300-400 metric tonnes on a daily basis. “The capacity is being enhanced to plug the gap. The solid waste is going to our garbage factories in Sihani, and the remaining waste is getting processed at the Indirapuram and Pratap Vihar sites. One more factory will be opened at Ret mandi. We will take up the processing of garbage at the Galand site shortly, where setting up of a waste to energy plant has been proposed,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/environmentalists-allege-gmc-s-laxity-for-waste-dumping-near-hindon-floodplains-101634580402969.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Govt launches Red light on, Gaadi off||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday started a month-long ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign across 100 traffic crossings to reduce vehicular emissions.As the campaign began on Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to people to “contribute” in the fight against pollution and make the campaign successful.“Please do contribute in this fight against pollution. Whenever you stop at the red light, please turn off your car’s engine. This will save fuel and also help reduce pollution. We all Delhiites will together reduce pollution in Delhi,” Kejriwal tweeted on Monday. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai visited the ITO crossing in the morning and gave roses to commuters, appealing them to turn off their car’s engines at red signals as well as extend their support to make this fight against pollution a success. “To reduce vehicular pollution, the Delhi government has started a ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign from today (Monday). Data by the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) shows that if people follow the exercise of switching off engines at traffic signals, pollution can be cut down by 13-20%,” Rai said.“This is a public campaign. We all will have to fight together to beat pollution. I appeal to the public to follow the campaign,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-govt-launches-red-light-on-gaadi-off-101634580401630.html
18-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Rain brings pollution down, air quality improves||Noida’s air quality improved on Monday as heavy to moderate rainfall in the region brought the mercury and pollution levels down. Air quality in the city has been oscillating between the “very poor” and “poor” categories for past the three days. However, authorities said, following heavy to moderate rainfall in the region over the past 24 hours, the effect of stubble burning (that takes place in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana) in Noida lessened, and dust suspended in the air settled, leading to improvement in air quality.An air quality index (AQI) reading between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, between 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, between 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and between 401 and 500 ‘severe’.According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI reading for Noida on Monday was 45 against 288 a day earlier. Ghaziabad’s AQI reading also saw a marked improvement on Monday--45 against 310 on Sunday. Greater Noida’s AQI reading was 38 against 224 a day earlier.Officials at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that while the amount of rainfall could not be recorded for Noida on Monday (a day earlier it was recorded at 22mm) because of technical issues, the Safdarjung observatory in neighbouring Delhi (considered representative for the national Capital region) recorded an average rainfall of 87.9mm over the past 24 hours.The rainfall also bought the region’s mercury down by over seven degrees Celsius over the past 24 hours. According to the IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida on Monday were recorded at 23.1 degrees Celsius and 20 degrees Celsius against 30.9 degrees Celsius and 25 degrees Celsius a day earlier. At Delhi’s Safdarjung, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 23.9 degrees Celsius, nine degrees below the season’s average, and 20.1 degrees Celsius, two degrees above the season’s average.“Maximum temperatures may spike, and hover around 29 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature may be recorded at 21 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. There will be mist in the morning while the day will be cloudy,” said an official from IMD.According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the AQI reading will be good for the next 24 hours as well.“Local land surfaces are wet and so dust re-suspension is minimum, which will lead to low PM10. Presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over north India, leading to low biomass burning. This condition improved AQI with low PM2.5. Fire counts reduced to 170... Moist surfaces inhibit re-suspension of dust which will keep AQI in ‘good’ category for next 24 hours,” said a statement by Safar on Monday.Particulater matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 are considered the main pollutants in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-rain-brings-pollution-down-air-quality-improves-101634580394018.html
18-10-2021||Noida||GB Nagar admin starts land acquisition process for Delhi-Mumbai e-way stretches||The land acquisition process for the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway stretches, which falls under the Gautam Budh Nagar region, has started after the issues were recently resolved, officials said on Monday. The expressway will be connected with the Noida international airport being developed at Jewar through this 8.1-kilometre stretch.“We have issued a notification to start the land acquisition process in Jewar tehsil. The farmers have been given a time period of 21 days to file their objections, if any, in this regard. We have got the details of farmers, whose land falls into the alignment of this stretch... The Haryana government wants to acquire the land at the earliest so that the work can be put on fast track,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.After the deadline of 21 days, the administration will start surveying and measuring the land.In a notification, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on October 12 this year asked the Gautam Budh Nagar administration to begin the process so that the agricultural land of farmers can be acquired for the construction of the stretch. Similarly, the NHAI has also asked the administration in Haryana to acquire the land in its region, so that the entire stretch can be built connecting the airport with the expressway.In Jewar tehsil, only agricultural fields and barren lands are coming under the project site, and there are no permanent structures on it, thereby making it easy to acquire, said officials.The stretch will be elevated, and will pass over the Yamuna River that divides Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Of the 31.2-kilometre- long stretch between the airport and the expressway, the 8.1-kilometre- long area falls under the Jewar tehsil. Five revenue villages, including Dayanatpur, Falaida Bangar, Karauli Bangar and Rampur Bangar, will also come under the project. Initial estimate shows that 69.36 hectares of agricultural land will be required for the project in Jewar.In 2019-end, the Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, had directed the NHAI to explore options to connect Jewar with the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabgarh to provide additional link to the new airport with the rest of the Delhi-NCR, according to the NIAL officials.The Jewar to Ballabgarh link road will be ready much before the airport project, which is likely to be operational by 2024.The link is crucial because passengers travelling from Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi, or the Jewar airport would not have to depend only on Yamuna Expressway and Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, said Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) officials.“As the dry port logistics hub is coming up in the Dadri region of Greater Noida, a direct link to the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will be of immense benefit. The Jewar airport will witness an influx of passengers with this direct connectivity, and it will also be of help in further development of this region,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Yeida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-admin-starts-land-acquisition-process-for-delhi-mumbai-e-way-stretches-101634580392798.html
18-10-2021||Noida||Dengue cases in Ghaziabad at 645, highest in seven years||With the dengue case count in Ghaziabad touching 645 on Monday, the district is seeing its worst outbreak of the vector-borne disease since 2014, when 928 cases were reported in the district with two fatalities, health officials said on Monday. Officials said the district is seeing an average of 17 new cases daily and the cases will decline only by end-October, as was the case in the previous years. Of the 645 cases reported till Monday, 333 have been recorded in the month of October while the rest were reported in the month of September. As per records, the daily average of dengue cases in September was 10.4 cases, which sharply increased to 17.33 in October. “From Tuesday, we will be starting a one-month special drive for communicable diseases. Our focus will be to trace people having symptoms of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria, while simultaneously continuing with fogging and anti-larvae drives. We have also identified eight high risk zones in rural areas while eight have been identified in urban pockets,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. The eight localities identified in urban centres include Sewa Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Police Line, Kavi Nagar, Loha Mandi, Surya Enclave, Mahindra Enclave and Shastri Nagar. Health officials said a majority of dengue patients were turning to private hospitals for treatment while those with viral fever etc, were reaching government facilities for treatment. “The cases of dengue have not shown a decline so far. Patients are mostly turning to private hospitals for treatment and many of these hospitals are full. The rain over the past two days has again caused water-logging in many areas and this may aid spread of dengue. It has been a pattern over the past several years that dengue cases decline only by end-October, when the temperature starts to drop,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, said his hospital has treated about 15 cases of dengue so far. “Twelve of them were admitted to the hospital while three were treated as out-patients. We still have about 150 patients with fever coming to our OPD (out-patient department) daily and we take up investigation of about 100-125 samples daily. We do not have dengue or malaria cases, but viral fever. Patients are taking five to six days to recover,” Dr Teotia said. The first case in the district was reported on September 1, officials said. Health department records further indicate that the district registered the first 100 cases of dengue on September 15, within span of 15 days. The tally of 200 cases came in nine days, on September 24 and 300 in the next six days on September 30. The tally further climbed to 400 in another six days on October 6, and to 500 cases in the next five days, on October 11. The last 100 cases to reach 600 came in a span of five days on October 16. Till Sunday, 381 of 624 dengue patients required hospitalisation. The dengue positivity rate is also high with a rate of 29.79% of the 2,094 samples tested, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-cases-in-ghaziabad-at-645-highest-in-seven-years-101634580340976.html

18-10-2021||Noida||Noida falls short of target in mega vaccination drive||Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday vaccinated only 18,450 people against its target of 30,000 during the mega vaccination drive against Covid-19. However, health officials said that falling short of target is “not a cause of worry”.Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the district has achieved more than 100% first dose coverage among its population. “The district has an estimated population of 1.589 million who are eligible for Covid-19 vaccine, and we have already vaccinated 1.76 million people with the first dose. However, there is still a floating population in the district which is turning up to get first dose vaccine. Monday’s vaccination figures are satisfactory and not a cause of worry,” said Dr Tyagi. Of 18,450 doses administered on Monday, 10,655 people got their first dose while 7,795 got their second dose, the officials said.Dr Tyagi also said that October so far has seen more number of second dose beneficiaries than the first. “Since October 1, the number of beneficiaries for first dose has been lesser than those for second dose by almost 50% on a daily basis. In October so far, over 50,000 people have got the first jab while over 95,000 received the second dose,” he said. As many as 107 Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) carried out the vaccinations on Monday, of which 46 CVCs were in Bisrakh block, 18 each in Dankaur and Jewar blocks, and 25 in Dadri.“Of these, 30 CVCs are regular ones that run on a daily basis, while the rest were created in community halls, schools and government offices across the district,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. According to the Co-WIN portal, Gautam Budh Nagar has administered a total of 2,653,862 jabs, of which 1,760,075 are first doses and 893,787 are second doses. Meanwhile, the district health department is also continuing to focus on administering first dose vaccines among 45+ age group. “In a survey conducted in September, there were over 50,000 people from 45+ age group who were yet to get their first jab. With special CVCs for the target group and mobilisation by local health workers, we have managed to get most of them vaccinated. Now, only about 12,000 people from this age group are left without their first dose,” said Dr Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-falls-short-of-target-in-mega-vaccination-drive-101634580336846.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt floats tender for new version of its jobs portal, Rojgar Bazaar 2.0||The Delhi government has issued tenders for developing a portal, Rojgar Bazaar 2.0, to act as a facilitator for providing employment related services to the youth of the national capital. The site will use artificial intelligence to draw up the best job matches and will offer end-to-end employment related information to those on the lookout for jobs in the city, the government said in a statement on Monday. “Tenders were floated by the Delhi government’s employment department on October 14. The Rojgar Bazaar 2.0 will be a gateway to access skill training, career guidance and skill credentialing and a mobile app will also be made available,” the statement issued by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office read. Sisodia said the launch of Rojgar Bazaar 1.0 in August last year, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, turned out to be “a lifeline for the unemployed youth as well as small businesses of Delhi”. “Over 1.4 million job seekers and 1 million jobs have already been advertised on the current Rojgar Bazaar portal and no other job matching platform by any state government has been so successful,” he said. “But we don’t want to stop there. The Rojgar Bazaar 2.0 portal will bring together all services related to skill training, career guidance and job matching on a first-of-its-kind digital platform in India. In addition to AI based smart-matching and employer verification, the platform will also provide a range of other critical services. This will range from skilling, career guidance, skill credentialing and automated analytics services, all of which will help in enhancing the job seekers’ ability to gain meaningful livelihood,” Sisodia said. While services such as skilling and career guidance will help the job seeker to pursue an aspirational career, a strong analytics platform will provide the government with rich insights to frame policies and drive on ground positive impact, the minister further said. As a substantial number of unorganised workers cannot access the digital platform, the Delhi government will also put in place centres from where they can access the Rozgar Bazaar platform and to also drive synergy with other ongoing social sector programmes, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-floats-tender-for-new-version-of-its-jobs-portal-rojgar-bazaar-20-101634580275828.html
18-10-2021||Noida||With 13 fresh cases, dengue tally in GB Nagar climbs to a 10 year high of 223||With 13 new cases on Sunday, the dengue tally in Gautam Budh Nagar has touched 223, the highest the district has seen in the past 10 years. There has been no death from the vector-borne disease in the district so far this year, health officials said. The daily dengue tally is compiled a day late in the district; hence Monday’s count will only be known on Tuesday, officials said. According to official data, the district saw 14 cases in 2012, 69 in 2013, 0 in 2014, 176 in 2015, 17 in 2016, 13 in 2017, 28 in 2018, 40 in 2019 and 28 in 2020. “A total of 223 cases have been reported in Gautam Budh Nagar since January this year. The district currently has 24 active cases of dengue and patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district. At present, dengue testing is being done in the district Hospital, the Post Graduate Institute of Child Health (Child PGI), and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.When asked, district malaria officer Rajesh Sharma said the spurt in dengue cases is due to the prolonged rainfall this year. “This year, we have seen rainfall for a longer period of time than in previous years. Because of that, water kept accumulating in areas and in artificial spaces, making them an ideal environment for mosquito breeding. As a result, transmission of the virus increased,” Sharma said.To make matters worse, the district health department is on alert following a fresh spell of rain over the past two days. A total of 365 teams of officials have been constituted to undertake preventive measures to contain the spread of the vector-borne disease, health officials said. “These teams are tasked with destroying mosquito breeding sites under their jurisdiction and to ensure intensive fogging and spraying of anti-larvae medicine. A total of 175 teams are under the Noida authority, 75 are under Greater Noida authority, 20 are under Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority, 18 are under nagar panchayats, and 74 teams are under district panchayat raj officer. Apart from these, three teams are under the DMO,” said Sharma.The District Hospital in Sector 30, has been declared as the district-level sentinel lab by the state health department, informed Sharma. “All samples that are declared positive for dengue by private hospitals and health centres are first verified at the sentinel lab and only then included in the official tally. The district health department has been instructed to verify only those samples which have been declared positive by the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test. The positive cases from the district hospital, Child PGI, and GIMS are already being tested on ELISA and are directly included in the official tally,” said Sharma. He further said five rapid response teams (RRTs) have been formed at the district and block level to immediately inform and act on any case of viral fever in their areas. Meanwhile, a two-week ‘Dastak’ programme, or door-to-door campaign, for the identification and treatment of patients affected by various diseases such as dengue and malaria will start from Tuesday, said Sharma. Under the Dastak programme, ASHAs (accredited social health activists) and health workers from anganwadis will go door to door to educate residents on measures to be taken to prevent vector-borne and communicable diseases.“Under the programme, the 743 ASHAs in Gautam Budh Nagar have been targeted to reach 200 households each. In total, the district health department aims to reach at least 148,600 households,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-13-fresh-cases-dengue-tally-in-gb-nagar-climbs-to-a-10-year-high-of-223-101634580274425.html

Also present will be Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Lord Buddha is said to have broken his fast by consuming kheer made of the rice on the banks of River Haryanvati and also gave it to his disciples. The Buddha is also said to have given the grains of this rice to farmers of the region and asked them to cultivate it.The GI (geographical indication)-tagged kala namak rice is famous for its rich aroma, taste and health benefits. The rice finds mention in the work of the first Chinese traveller and Buddhist monk Fa-Hien who visited India in the early 5th Century in search of holy Buddhist scripture.Now, when Kushinagar is set to host a global event with the arrival of international dignitaries and Buddhist monks, the authorities have come up with a plan to gift kala namak rice to guests in attractive, bright red bags with the quote ‘Lord Buddha, before his parinirvana from this holy place of Kushinagar, had given Buddhism to the world. He had also given his prasad, kala namak, to the farmers of this region in India. May his blessings be showered on the receiver of this gift’. “The day of the inauguration (October 20) is also Buddh Purnima, which is a special and an auspicious day for Buddhists. As such, the prasad of Lord Gautam Buddha in the form of kala namak will be of great importance,” an official said.In 2017, kala namak was listed for promotion under the ODOP (one district one product scheme) of Siddhartha Nagar, the place associated with the birth of Lord Buddha. ODOP along with other promotional efforts of the government paid off when Kala Namak variety, on the verge of extinction, saw a major jump in production from 10,000 hectares (in 2010) to 50,000 hectares (this year).Meanwhile, the state government is making all efforts to make this global event a grand success and CM Yogi Adityanath is personally monitoring preparations for the event.On Monday, local MPs, MLAs and leaders held meetings to make the programme successful while authorities were also seen racing against time to complete preparations.The airport will have direct flights from Buddhist countries including Japan, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Korea, China and other nations with significant Buddhist following.- Abdul Jadid||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kushinagar-international-airport-opening-kala-namak-rice-to-be-given-to-world-guests-as-buddha-s-prasad-101634580272865.html

18-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Firing in busy Kishangarh market leaves SUV driver critically injured||In an incident of shooting on Monday afternoon, at least four unidentified men opened fire at a Fortuner SUV in the busy market of Kishangarh, south Delhi, critically injuring its 26-year-old driver and triggering panic among residents and shopkeepers. Police suspect that the attempted killing was the fallout of a 17-year long rivalry between two local families.According to police, there were three occupants in the car when the firing took place around 1pm — Somraj alias Dhami Pehalwan was seated in the front passenger seat, while Shafiq alias Lucky drove the vehicle. Dhami’s personal security officer Krishan was seated in the rear, police said. While Dhami and his PSO escaped unhurt, Shafiq suffered gunshot wounds to the head and hand. He was admitted to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj, where his condition is stated to be critical, police said.The three were returning from the Patiala House courts after attending a hearing related to a murder that took place last year, in which Dhami and his brothers were the accused. “Dhami in his statement said one Harender Maan and his relatives are behind the attack. Harender is the brother of Ashok Maan, whose murder Dhami and his brothers stand accused of. A case of attempt to murder and firing has been registered at the Kishangarh police station. We are probing all angles,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Gaurav Sharma.A majority of shops in Shani Bazaar Road in Kishangarh were open at the time of the shooting, police said. Dhami’s white Fortuner was barely 70-80 metres from his house, when the four men who were lying in wait for him opened fire, said a police officer, quoting statements of local residents and shopkeepers.“As the bullet hit the SUV driver, he lost control of the vehicle and it crashed into a shop nearby. The attackers fled in the ensuing chaos,” the officer said, asking not to be named.The officer said Dhami’s family had a rivalry with Maan’s family spanning nearly 17 years and it started over the business of running Blue Line buses, which were phased out in 2012. “Both families live near each other in Kishangarh. In 2004, Ashok Maan acquired some Blue Line buses and entered the transport business, impacting the transport business of Dharamveer and his brothers Devender Pehalwan and Dhami. That triggered the enmity. After the phasing out of Blue Line buses, both families got into the real estate business and continued their enmity. Their rivalry worsened in 2019, when a member of Dharamveer’s family was shot at and they suspected the role of Maans,” the officer said.On February 11, 2020, Ashok, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteer, was shot dead and his brother Harender was injured after a few assailants opened fire during the victory procession of elected AAP legislator Naresh Yadav in Kishangarh. The Maans accused Dharamveer and his brothers and they were arrested for murder, the police said.“Prime facie, we are not ruling out the longstanding rivalry angle behind Monday’s firing,” added the officer quoted above.Of late, the city has witnessed a rash of gang war related killings. Last month, gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi was shot dead in a courtroom at the Rohini courts by two assailants dressed as lawyers, before they were gunned down by the police. Gogi’s arch rival and jailed gangster, Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya, is among the five suspects arrested in that case so far.Within a week after Gogi’s murder, a member of jailed gangster Manjeet Mahal’s gang was shot dead in Najafgarh, allegedly by four hitmen of the rival gang led by Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, who is currently operating from abroad, according to police sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifiring-in-busy-kishangarh-market-leaves-suv-driver-critically-injured-101634580032447.html

18-10-2021||Delhi||GRAP measures for ‘moderate to poor’ called in ‘with immediate effect’ in Delhi||New Delhi: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday called in the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) -- the emergency action plan for winters, when pollution levels spike in the Capital -- and said that the measures listed under the “moderate to poor” category will kick in with “immediate effect” in Delhi.In an order on Monday, the CPCB further said that agencies need to “be ready” to implement the measures under the ‘very poor’ category. Among the measures launched from Monday are stringent action against open garbage burning in landfills and other spaces; enforcement of all pollution control measures in industries and power plants; ensuring that all brick kilns remain closed in Delhi-NCR; regular mechanised sweeping and water sprinkling on roads with high dust; strict vigilance to control any visible pollution; strict enforcement of pollution under control (PUC) norms; strict action against dust pollution in construction sites; deployment of traffic police personnel to ensure smooth movement of traffic, especially in vulnerable stretches; ensuring non-destined trucks do not enter Delhi; and strict enforcement of the Supreme Court ban on firecrackers. The Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM) had in two separate meetings last week recommended the implementation of all Grap measures listed under the ‘poor’ category and some measures under the ‘very poor’ category from October 15. The measures, however, were not called in immediately as the CAQM’s sub-committee was looking at reviewing the measures that need to be in place. In its order on Monday, the CPCB said the air quality was expected to be in the ‘satisfactory’ category till October 20 and then start deteriorating from October 21, under the impact of northwesterly winds blowing from Punjab and Haryana. It asked the agencies to be prepared to implement measures listed under the ‘very poor’ category as the pollution levels rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/grapmeasures-for-moderate-to-poor-called-in-with-immediate-effect-in-delhi-101634579852775.html

On Monday, the city reported an air quality index of 36, a sharp improvement from 332 (very poor) recorded on Sunday. Neighbouring cities of Delhi (AQI 46), Noida (AQI 45), Greater Noida (AQI 38), Ghaziabad (AQI 45) in the National Capital Region (NCR) also reported good air quality, except for Faridabad, where the air quality was recorded to be satisfactory (AQI 55). The city received 42mm of rainfall from 8.30am on Sunday to 8.30am on Monday, according to records of the India Meteorological Department. On Monday, the city saw strong surface winds throughout the day after it stopped raining early in the morning. Officials of the CPCB on Monday said that the air quality is likely to remain in the moderate category over the next few days before it starts deteriorating to the poor category again.The CPCB also held a meeting for operationalisation of the anti-pollution measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures in the NCR, and decided that “actions under ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category should be rigorously implemented with immediate effect in Delhi-NCR.” The implementing agencies in the NCR states were also instructed to be ready to implement actions under the very poor category, as and when the air quality starts deteriorating. Over the next few days, between October 21 and 24, air quality is likely to fluctuate between the moderate and poor category, after which light rain is likely in NCR. On Sunday, HT had reported that although Gurugram had very poor air on the CPCB’s AQI bulletin, the air quality started improving due to rainfall, as 10 of the 12 local air quality monitors recorded satisfactory AQI, while two recorded a moderate AQI reading.S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “There are predictions of air quality deteriorating in the coming days, so we will take action accordingly and implement action suggested under Grap measures for poor quality of air. Measures for very poor air quality will be implemented if the situation worsens.” Under the plan for the poor category, measures that are implemented usually pertain to stopping garbage burning in landfills and other places, imposing heavy fines on persons responsible, stringently enforcing all pollution control regulations in industries and thermal power plants, ensuring that all brick kilns remain closed in Delhi-NCR as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), ensuring periodic mechanised sweeping or sprinkling of water on roads with heavy traffic and dust generation potential. Under the very poor category, measures taken up under Grap include stopping the use of diesel generator sets, implementing a surge in parking fee by three to four times, stopping use of coal or firewood in eateries and urging people with respiratory or cardiac problems to stay indoors.On Monday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 31.8 degrees Celsius (°C), two degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 19.8°C, which was four degrees above the normal. The humidity level was recorded at 92% at the end of the day.

18-10-2021||Gurugram||3rd sero survey: Over 69% of children in Gurugram show immunity against Covid-19||Over 69% of children aged 6-17 years in Gurugram district were exposed to Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, showed results of the third serological survey released by the health department on Monday. According to the results, antibodies were found in 68.4% of children between the age group of 6 and 9 years, while antibodies were found in 70.4% of the children aged 10-17 years. Gurugram reported overall seropositivity of 78.3%, higher than the overall seropositivity in Haryana of 76.3%.In urban areas of Gurugram, antibodies were found in 80.3% of the surveyed population and in rural areas, antibodies were found in 77% of the population. Around 3,000 samples were collected from Gurugram, including those of 1,200 children. In the second statewide serological survey, held in October 2020, 16,512 samples, including 800 from Gurugram, were tested, following which a seropositivity rate of 14.8% was recorded, with the urban population showing a seropositivity rate of 25.9% and rural population 10.1%A serological survey finds the level of antibodies that may have been developed either after an infection or being vaccinated. The results will help the department plan strategies and assess their preparedness for the third wave of Covid-19. In the third sero survey, children were included for the first time to assess the level of immunity in this vulnerable and unexposed cohort.State health minister Anil Vij, while releasing the report on Monday, said, “The survey was conducted in all districts of Haryana by health department in collaboration with department of community medicine, PGIMS, Rohtak. In this round of sero survey, sample size was increased up to 36,520 as compared to previous sero surveys conducted in the state where it was 18,700 (seroprevalence- 8%) in first round and 15,840 (seroprevalence -14.8%) in second round. As per the analysis done, the seropositivity in third round was found to be 76.3% (urban 78.1% and rural 75.1%).” Explaining the results, Rajeev Arora, the additional chief secretary for health, said that such results are an impact of the aggressive Covid-19 vaccination programme that supplemented a higher seroprevalence in the community. “Although, the results of this round of sero survey are somewhat near to the level of achieving herd immunity, large proportion of population is still vulnerable. Therefore, enforcing Covid-19 appropriate behaviours is still our utmost priority to safeguard our population of Haryana,” Arora said. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “The seropositivity is according to what had been predicted by the experts, we now also know what percentage of children were exposed to Covid-19. But, as cases are still being reported, the main focus should be on following all safety protocols. Along with that, people should get themselves vaccinated for better precaution.” In Haryana, the highest seropositivity was observed in Kurukshetra (85%) and lowest was observed in Faridabad (64.2%).Dr Rajesh Kumar, a former head of the department of community medicine and school of public health at PGIMER, said, “These results show that a high percentage of children in Gurugram were exposed to Covid-19 during the pandemic whether it was symptomatic or asymptomatic along with the general population and have developed antibodies. We also have to see the transmissibility factor of the virus, the Delta variant was highly transmissible, but if there is a mutation again then seroprevalence can be higher too. But, still a large part of the population has not developed antibodies, so Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is a must.”In the first statewide serological survey, held in August 2020, 18,905 samples, including 844 from Gurugram, were tested, following which a seropositivity rate of 8% was recorded, with the urban population showing a seropositivity rate of 18.5% and the rural population 5.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/3rd-sero-survey-over-69-of-children-in-gurugram-show-immunity-against-covid19-101634579013707.html
18-10-2021||Gurugram||U-turn underpass near Ambience Mall a major relief: Residents||Residents heaved a sigh of relief as the U-turn underpass near the Ambience Mall opened on Sunday, as it will not only help reduce travel time due to reduced distance, but also help them avoid getting penalised for violating the rules of road rationing scheme in Delhi during winter months.The facility opened on Sunday on a trial basis. Commuters in Gurugram heading towards Ambience Island, DLF Phase 3 and Sector 24 said they have started saving at least 20-25 minutes of travel time during peak hours. “Earlier, I had to cross the MCD toll in Delhi, drive through the service lanes of the expressway and then take a U-turn below the Rajokri flyover to head back towards Gurugram. This meant driving through the heavily congested Sirhaul toll, which could, at times, take over 40 minutes to cross during peak traffic hours,” Devendra Trivedi, a resident of Sector 24, said.Trivedi said that the same journey took him around five minutes to cover on Sunday.Several residents also highlighted that the opening of the underpass will end wrong-side driving violation, a common sight on the stretch between DLF Phase-3 and Ambience Mall on the service lanes of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.Commuters said that the opening of the underpass will also prevent wrong-side driving by those seeking to avoid going to Delhi to take a U-turn when the odd-even vehicle numbering rule is in place to curb pollution.“Back in November 2019, when the odd-even scheme was in implementation in Delhi, I was fined ₹4,000 at the border just for taking a U-turn to head towards Ambience Mall. With the opening of the underpass, entering Delhi is no longer needed and will help hundreds of Gurugram residents who were inadvertently fined in the odd-even scheme,” Harshit Shukla, a resident of Sector 70, said.Sanjeev Gulati, a resident of DLF Phase-3, said, “At any given time of the day, vehicles can be seen driving on the wrong side along this 900-metre stretch. These are mostly e-rickshaws, autorickshaws, and cabs that drop off their fares near the mall, all avoiding crossing the MCD toll and paying commercial tax. With the underpass now opening, this should no longer be an issue.”The deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Ravinder Singh Tomar, said that the underpass will help reduce traffic congestion at the Sirhaul toll plaza and assist police with managing vehicle movement.“We are anticipating a drop of 25-30% in traffic volume at the Sirhaul toll plaza once the underpass is fully functional. After the trial period is over, we will depute marshals near the facility for at least one week to understand the traffic pattern and recommend changes if required. We are closely monitoring the situation,” Tomar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/uturn-underpass-near-ambience-mall-a-major-relief-residents-101634579012563.html
18-10-2021||Gurugram||U-turn underpass near Ambience Mall opens for trials after several delays||After missing several deadlines, a U-turn underpass near the Ambience Mall, located just before the Sirhaul toll plaza, opened for traffic movement on a trial basis. The facility helps reduces travel time by around 20-25 minutes during peak traffic hours as it cuts the distance for taking a U-turn by around five kilometres.The 377-metre underpass provides passage to commuters coming from the direction of Shankar Chowk to head directly towards DLF Phase-3 and Ambience Island instead of crossing into Delhi, amid the heavily congested traffic at the toll, and then taking a U-turn below the Rajokri flyover to head back towards Gurugram.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that the underpass opened early Sunday on a trial basis. Saurabh Singhal, the NHAI consultant for the project, said, “During the trial, NHAI officials will be carrying out a safety audit of the underpass to check if safety measures such as signage and reflectors are properly placed, whether speed-calming measures need to be installed to check speeding inside the facility, spot blind turns or sharp bends, lighting is adequate, among other such features. Depending on the outcome of the audit, NHAI will take a further call on continuing with the trial or permanently opening it,” Singhal said.In the past, NHAI officials had opened underpasses even before the projects were completed. The Medanta and Iffco Chowk underpasses were opened in August 2017 and March 2019, respectively, even though the Medanta underpass did not have a direct electricity supply while the drainage outlet at Iffco Chowk underpass was not completed, both of which inconvenienced commuters.A senior NHAI official privy to the matter, who did not wish to be named, said that the trial is being carried out to avoid such mistakes and it is likely to be in place till Diwali. The official said that unless major defects are found, the facility will be opened permanently.The official, however, said that during the trial period, the use of the underpass will be regulated. “As and when we discover defects or any issues that need to be addressed, we will be closing the underpass for short periods. The idea of the trial is to find out issues and fix them before opening it full time,” the official said.On Monday afternoon, the underpass was closed for a few hours due to electrical works.Work on the underpass started on March 5, 2019, with a deadline of September 2020. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, and lack of manpower, the work got delayed and various deadlines were set in July 2021, August 2021, and the latest one on October 15, which was announced by the union transport minister Nitin Gadkari while visiting the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway last month.“We had aimed to finish the project by October 15. However, some electrical work and road work could not be completed in time. We had aimed at opening the facility a few days before Diwali on a full-time basis, however, it was later decided to carry out a trial in the interim, instead,” the NHAI official cited above said.The access road leading towards the underpass is 559 metres long and the service road is seven metres wide. The speed limit inside the facility is 40kmph, and the underpass is 14 metres wide with a 5.5-metre vertical tunnel clearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/uturn-underpass-near-ambience-mall-opens-for-trials-after-several-delays-101634578952502.html

18-10-2021||Pune||Trees in Fatima nagar housing society illegally cut: PCB||PUNE Residents of KP Tower 1 co-operative housing society in Fatima nagar have alleged that the sub-contractors appointed by the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) to prune trees in the area, have illegally chopped down whole branches of at least four trees, in violation of the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. The PCB tree department said that no permission was given to prune or cut any trees in the area in which Esha Towers Society and KP Tower 1 are located. Jayant Kangane PCB’s garden incharge said, “No permission was taken for cutting or pruning the trees. We have received a complaint and accordingly a notice is being issued to the society. Later, a penalty can be levied on the violator.” The society’s managing committee has sent a letter to the PCB stating: “Trees have been chopped off without cogent and plausible reason leaving only the stub. We have been given to understand that permission has been granted from your end. One such tree in the society parking space is also chopped off without informing us. If no permission has been given, then law must move in.” Society chairperson Patty Ferrao said, “The intention of the contractors was to cut off the entire tree, but they halted their axing after we raised a strong objection. We are against chopping of trees and want more trees to be planted in the society.” Another resident Naymussari Mandil said, “There was a complaint from the neighbouring society that a snake had scaled the wall. Instead of minor pruning, the contractor brutally chopped off the branches in such a way that only the stub remains. Those who chopped the trees had not obtained permission for the work.” Hemanshu Shah, chairman, Esha Society said, “Nobody from our society came seeking permission to prune tree branches. It was done by those faced with problems like mice entering their houses from the overgrown tree branches. The tree branches have been cut in such a way that fresh leaves have started growing again. The trees have not been cut from the trunk and the pruning was done at a height of above ten feet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/trees-in-fatima-nagar-housing-society-illegally-cut-pcb-101634578353167.html

It also said that it will not require any infrastructure upgrade for the rollout of vaccination for children.Meanwhile, BMC also issued a notification permitting the reopening of colleges in the city from October 20. All the guidelines issued by the University of Mumbai (MU), including staggered timing for lectures, social distancing and vaccination, will have to be followed by the colleges.

Our first-of-its-kind initiative would allow them to utilise their time effectively while they comfortably watch a movie. With this installation, we have fulfilled our responsibility towards the enhancement of EV charging infrastructure. Owners of electric vehicles can now charge their vehicle at a high speed speed of 1.5 km/min, on payment, while the company providing the charging stations will also provide normal speed charge options free of cost,” said Rajeev Patni, COO, INOX Leisure.“Since the usage of electric vehicles is growing in India, we would also like to offer maximum convenience to our patrons. Therefore, we are planning to set up more such charging stations at locations which are appropriate and feasible,” he added. A charging station has been installed at the Deshpande restaurant on the Pune-Solapur Highway near Indapur. It is a restaurant on the highway and hundreds of vehicles stop here for breakfast, lunch or dinner. “Looking at the new technology and demand from our customers, we decided to install a charging station in our restaurant’s parking area. It is a paid service for the customers, but people can charge their vehicle and enjoy food at our restaurant,” said Vaibhav Deshpande owner of the restaurant. On other hand residential housing societies have also geared up for installing the infrastructure in their society premises. Vipul Alekar resident of New Avenue Park housing society in Hadapsar area said, “Currently there are five electric cars in our society and more people are interested in buying these cars in future. As we live in a housing society it is not possible to have individual charging units, so we are in talks with a couple of companies that are going to install the charging points in our parking spaces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cinemas-restaurants-charging-stations-for-e-vehicles-mushrooming-in-pune-city-101634576192466.html

During peak hours, morning and evening, passengers crowd the bus stations and as the automatic doors are always open. The risk of someone falling onto the road is high, as happened at the Padmavati bus station on Sunday. “I was waiting for the bus to go to Swargate and as there was crowd and my leg slipped. Luckily no bus was coming. This needs to be changed and PMC should make proper safety arrangements for passengers,” said Sagar Abnawe, the commuter who slipped and fell. This 5.5 km stretch was revamped recently and there are seven bus stations on this route, which traverses residential areas. PMPML traffic manager Dattatray Zende said, “The safety arrangements at all the bus stations have been made from our side and its the duty of PMC to see if these doors need repairing.

Lucknow deputy commissioner of police (east) Sanjiv Suman said Hamza alias Abul of Khulna district of Bangladesh died after a police encounter near Dayal crossing under Gomtinagar police station limits in the early hours of Monday. Abul and members of his gang opened fire at the police team that intercepted them near the railway lines near the crossing, the officer said, adding that the other gang members managed to flee. Hamza was injured in the encounter and taken to the civil hospital where doctors declared him “brought dead”. Police arrested three other alleged members of the gang — Sheikh Rubel, 26, Alam, 27, and Rabiul, 23 —last week for their involvement in several incidents of robbery and loot at houses along the railway lines in Lucknow and other cities. The arrested men had told the police during interrogation that they were members of a gang that entered West Bengal in India from Bangladesh, the police said. They first used to conduct a recce along railway tracks and then committed the crimes, the police added. Once a house was marked, they reached the spot via train, committed loot and fled by jumping onto passing trains. “The gang used the networks of trains and rail tracks to conduct recce, reach the marked location and then escape from the spot after committing the crime,” said the officer. After robbery, the accused used to share the loot and travel back to West Bengal from where they smuggled the looted items to their families in Bangladesh. In case the looted amount ran into several lakh rupees, the accused returned to Bangladesh and lay low for some time before coming back to India to commit another loot, according to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/alleged-bangladesh-criminal-killed-in-lucknow-encounter-101634574392127.html

Guidelines for extending the hours of restaurants and shops across the state will be out soon. Amusement parks can be operated except water rides,” the statement said on Monday. The NCP had made a formal request with the chief minister about extending the operational timings of the shops and restaurants given the upcoming festival season.While allowing further restrictions, Thackeray said that the threat of the third wave has not passed yet and people must not remain lax in following all precautions. The statement added, “Although the second wave has subsided, the danger of the third wave is still there and it is important to wear a regular mask, keep a safe distance and keep your hands clean. There needs to be an awareness campaign about it so that people do not get lax about it.”Thackeray also directed officials of the public health department to remain in touch with the Centre on the vaccines for children. He further directed the department to make the necessary preparations for vaccinating children once the Centre takes a decision.Another statement also said that the theatres and cinema halls, which will reopen in the state from October 22, should start with proper fire and structural safety checks. During a meeting with office-bearers of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association, he said an appropriate solution would be worked out in coordination with the finance department to address the woes of single-screen cinema halls that are facing financial difficulties. In the meeting with the delegation of the Maharashtra State Truck, Tempo, Tankers and Bus Transport Federation, Thackeray said that the state finance, urban development, and transport departments will be given directions to find suitable solutions to the various issues raised by the transporters. The delegation sought exemption on annual motor vehicle tax, provision for parking spaces for buses and vehicles across the state. They also sought to lift the ban on heavy vehicles to enter cities limits during certain hours, and cancellation of expired transport cases.Thackeray said that the UD department would plan adequate parking spaces for trucks and buses in the cities. “A proper solution will be worked out immediately in the case of transporters in the state who are facing financial crisis due to Covid-19,” a statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-extends-shop-restaurant-timings-records-1-485-new-covid-19-cases-101634574272701.html

The council also demanded ₹50 lakh compensation and a government job for the kin of the deceased. Prashant Singh ‘Atal’, member-secretary, Bar Council of UP, demanded that the government must take note of all such incidents of attack on lawyers across the state. “Lawyers will abstain from work on Wednesday in protest against the incident,” he said. Singh demanded proper checking at entry points in all district courts to prevent entry of unwarranted elements. The Bar Council also urged the state government to implement Advocate Protection Act so that lawyers could discharge their legal duties without fear. Condemning the incident, Paresh Mishra, member, Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, demanded adequate security measures on all court premises in UP. “The existing security measures in district courts, including in the state capital, are just a show piece,” he said. “High court like security measures must be enforced in all district courts of UP,” added Mishra. ‘DFMD a showpiece at dist court’ The Door Frame Metal Detector (DFMD) installed at the entrance of the Lucknow district court (gate number three) is just a showpiece, said lawyers. “Cops deployed at gate number three at district court never check anyone. Now, there will be checking just for a few days after the Shahjahanpur incident. As the issue subsides, security personnel will again become careless,” said Rohit Kant, lawyer, district court. UP Special Security Force?The Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force (UPSSF), a dedicated unit for security at district courts across the state, is yet to be constituted. This proposal was passed after the sensational killing of a double murder accused in a courtroom in Bijnor district before the chief judicial magistrate on December 17, 2019. June 12, 2019 Murder of first-ever woman president of UP Bar Council, Darvesh Yadav, took place inside the district court campus, Agra.

Reacting to the claims by the NCB officials that agency’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede had a counselling session with Aryan Khan, Malik demanded that the NCB should release the video of the counselling session. He said that the NCB officials should stop planting stories for cheap publicity and if they have had a session with the accused, they should come out with the video evidence. “The officers who talk about electronic evidence should come out with the video on counseling Aryan Khan to clarify about when did they do the counselling, did they actually go inside jail,” Malik said. According to the media reports Wankhede held a counselling session with Khan and other seven accused in the cruise drugs seizure case, two days ago. The accused are currently lodged in the Arthur Road prison. BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye alleged, “NCP leader and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik has been repeatedly targeting NCB, which has been taking strict action against drug peddling. All the parties should support the drive by the central agencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-attacks-ncb-over-counselling-session-for-aryan-khan-101634573612358.html

PU has proposed to construct new academic and administrative blocks to accommodate rising number of students and improve its managerial work.Earlier on October 1, PU’s vice chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary proposed education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary for construction of new buildings and renovation of Wheeler Senate House during the foundation day event of the varsity. Following the discussion with the minister, PU submitted elaborate proposal for the department’s approval.Anil Kumar, media in-charge of PU said, “We have pitched the plan for constructing multi-storey new academic block at cost of ₹82.83 crore and administrative block at ₹54.50 crore. The proposed constructions will be done on 4.50 acre land available between Krishna Ghat and VC’s residence. We have submitted the estimated budget and proposed architecture blueprint to the education for their approval.”Kumar said students are facing difficulty in attending classes due to inadequate infrastructure availability. He added, “With rising number of students in post-graduation courses, infrastructure available at Darbhanga House is running short for conducting classes properly. The class arrangement at Darbhanga House was made when the number of students pursuing post-graduation courses were much less than present. Besides, the education department has also increased seats in several courses in recent years. Consequently, the classrooms available at Darbhanga House is not sufficient to accommodate students. Several PG departments are running classes in two shifts to admit all students.” “We plan to shift PG departments of humanities and social science to the proposed academic block and allot the vacated space at Darbhanga House to Vanijya Mahavidyalaya which is conducting classes in four shifts in a small portion allotted at Patna College to ease commerce students”, he added.Darbhanga House is a unit of PU used for hosting around 40 post-graduation courses.PU officials said that the campus redevelopment will create better teaching and learning environment at the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patna-university-submits-proposal-for-campus-redevelopment-101634573072069.html

18-10-2021||Mumbai||Raj Thackeray gets into Hindutva mode, meets Hindu seers from UP||In the backdrop of the municipal elections scheduled next year, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has gotten into Hindutva mode. On Monday, Hindu seers from Uttar Pradesh met MNS chief Raj Thackeray at his residence seeking his support for establishing a Hindu nation.The two seers from Uttar Pradesh who go by the name of Guru Ma Kanchan Giriji and Jagatguru Suryacharaji met Raj Thackeray for an hour after criticising Chief Minister and his estranged cousin Uddhav Thackeray for abandoning Hindutva. “Raj Thackeray supports Hindutva ideology and the best thing about him is he does what he says,” said Guru Ma Kanchan Giriji. “Since both BJP and Raj Thackeray’s ideology are similar on Hindutva, they should come together,” she added.She even went to the extent saying that she was ready to be a bridge to bring them together. She said that Raj Thackeray would be visiting Ayodhya in December and the saints will welcome him in a grand manner. With regards to the opposition of Raj Thackeray towards North Indians, she insisted that Raj Thackeray loved them and they had no reason to fear him.After a series of defeats in successive elections, Raj Thackeray in January 2020 reinvented his party by shifting towards Hindutva. He unveiled a new saffron flag with a rajmudra (seal) of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, with the party’s name below it. Last week, during Dussehra, the MNS put ‘Proud to be Hindu’ banners in many places across the city.MNS leader Bal Nandgaonkar said Raj Thackeray has inherited Hindutva ideology from his ancestors. “The MNS will continue to pursue our Hindutva agenda,” said Nandgaonkar. Political analyst Hemant Desai said it was the BJP’s plan to project ‘Raj Thackeray as a Hindutva icon’ in view of the upcoming BMC polls. “As Uddhav Thackeray is again talking of Hindutva, the BJP wants someone to counter him,” said Desai. After the breakup of the alliance by the Shiv Sena after the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP has been keen to have an alliance with the MNS to split the Sena’s votes. However, Raj Thackeray’s anti-North Indian agenda has played a spoilsport. BJP Maharashtra Chief Chandrakant Patil who met Raj Thackeray in August told him to shed this agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raj-thackeray-gets-into-hindutva-mode-meets-hindu-seers-from-up-101634572772275.html

Besides, another cyclonic circulation has formed over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha. Under the influence, easterly winds will continue to blow in the state. Light to moderate rain at most places and heavy rain at several places accompanied with thunderstorm activities is likely in the state till October 20.”As per the daily bulletin issued, Parsa and Amnaur in Saran district received 37.2mm rain followed by Jandaha in Vaishali 27.2mm, Tarari in Bhojpur 26.4mm, Chandan in Banka 22.8mm, Bahadurganj in Kishanganj 21mm, Triveniganj in Supaul 18.4mm during the past 24 hours.Patna Meteorological Centre has also issued an orange colour warning for Supaul district forecasting heavy to very heavy rain on Tuesday while a yellow-colour alert has been issued for six districts including Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Kishanganj, Araria and Purnea. As per India Meteorological Department (Hydromet division), Bihar recorded 110.6mm actual rain against the normal rain of 53.1 mm between October 1 to October 18 which is 108% excess.Anil Kumar Jha, the agriculture expert, said, “The untimely rain in the state will have a negative impact on crops. The excess rain that occurred this month has resulted in an abundance of moisture in the soil. Consequently, farmers will face difficulty in harvesting ready Kharif crops due to moisture while sowing for rabi crops including lentils, oilseeds and grams will be delayed.

As soon as the information came, we talked among ourselves (ministers) and to the officials in Kashmir also. The government is worried about the Biharis being killed there,” he said. “I spoke to Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Manoj Sinha on phone and said it seems people from outside the state working there are being targeted. This time, people from Bihar have been killed. This is a matter of concern for us. He assured us that the administration was monitoring the situation and promised to provide security to them,” said the CM.“Any citizen is free to work in any part of the country. Nobody has the right to give ultimatum to anybody. Country is one and J&K is also part of the country,” he said and promised all possible help to families of the deceased. “State officials are in touch with their counterparts in Jammu and Kashmir and their bodies will be brought to their respective villages,” he said. Bihar police chief also spoke to J&K’s chief secretary and director general of police and made a request to ensure deployment of police teams and patrolling in the areas where people of Bihar reside and work in J&K, a tweet by ANI said. Bihar’s deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, whose party BJP is part of the ruling alliance in the state, demanded cancellation of Indo-Pak T20 World Cup match. “I think such things (India vs Pak match in upcoming ICC T20 World Cup) should be halted so that Pakistan gets a message that if they keep supporting terrorism, India will not stand by them on any matter,” he said.Earlier, union minister Giriraj Singh, who is from Bihar, said, “The match between India and Pakistan in the coming days needs to be given another thought in the wake of the attacks happening on Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir. The relations are not good right now.”Leader of opposition in the state, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, targeted Nitish Kumar’s government over the compensation amount announced earlier. “Bihar government gives ₹4 lakh for death due to snakebite but just ₹2 lakh to Bihari workers who have gone out for livelihood and were killed by terrorists.

Over the last two weeks, four migrant workers from Bihar — Raja Rishidev and Yogendra Rishidev from Araria, one Birendra Paswan from Bhagalpur and Arvind Kumar Sah of Banka — have been shot dead in Kashmir, A fifth one, Chunchun Rishidev from Araria, is battling for life at a hospital in Kashmir after sustaining bullet injuries. Chunchun’s father Teju Rishidev, 70, a resident of Mirzapur in Araria, is a worried man. “My two sons are in Kashmir and I have come to know that one of them, Chunchun, was shot. I want both my sons, Chunchun and Brahma, to come back as early as possible,” he says.Nunu Devi, mother of Yogendra Rishidev who was shot dead in Anantnag, says, “My son had gone to Kashmir four months back. He is survived by three children and a widow. The government should help us.”“Hundreds of people from Raniganj block alone are in Kashmir, besides several hundreds from other blocks of Araria. The government should arrange for their safe return,” says Ashish Kumar Bhagat, a local activist.Bihar’s Seemanchal region, comprising four districts of Purnia, Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj, is regarded as a hub of migrant labourers, who work mainly in Punjab, Delhi, Mumbai and of late Kashmir.Meanwhile, in Lakhpura Parghari village of Banka district, the mood is of overwhelming gloom and fear. Its resident Arvind Kumar Sah, 23, one the four killed in the valley, was to get married in two months.“We want our Army to kill all those involved in such attacks,” says Mantu Kumar Sah, his younger brother. Father Devendra Sah demanded to call off the forthcoming India-Pakistan of T-20 world cup match. Pankaj Mahto (40) and Bhagirath Mandal (35), who returned from Kashmir to Banka on Monday, said, “We were working in building construction. Some ran their own businesses. We had gone there about four months back and were happy but suddenly attacks came and we were forced to flee.”Locals say that after the dilution of Article 370 stripped Kashmir of its special status, the state became an addition to destinations for migrant workers. “Earlier, most of the migrant workers who used to go there were Muslims. Over the last few months, Hindus too made a beeline in search of work,” says Ramvilas Rishidev, a resident of Mirzapur village in Araria district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-migrants-start-returning-from-kashmir-101634572171914.html
18-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai saw 99.9% increase in built-up area in 27 years, reveals study||A recent study, published in the peer-reviewed Springer Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, found that Mumbai lost 58.17% of its open spaces, 40% of its green cover and about 25.30% of water bodies between 1991 and 2018. During these 27 years, the city saw a corresponding increase of 99.9% in its built-up area. The study also demonstrates correlation between increase in built-up area and a rise in micro-climactic “urban heat island’ phenomena. Over 27 years, researchers have noted, Mumbai’s average temperature has increased by a worrying two degrees celsius.The study (’Urban Heat Island Dynamics in Response to Land-Use/Land-Cover Change in the Coastal City of Mumbai’) was conducted by researchers from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Delh’s Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, Osmania University in Hyderabad, and Aligarh Muslim University, Uttar Pradesh.Researchers used NASA landsat datasets and imagery to study changes in land-use, land-cover and land surface temperatures over 603 sq kms of Mumbai city and suburbs.Shahfahad, a senior research fellow at JMU and lead author of the study, said, “We found that rapid uncontrolled urbanisation over the past five-six decades attracted a large population by providing better economic opportunities. As a result, natural land use patterns such as vegetation cover, scrublands, wetlands, and open lands have all been transformed on a large scale into built form.”The area of open land fell by more than half from 80.57 sq. km in 1991 to 33.7 sq. km in 2018. Mumbai also saw reduction in water bodies from 27.19 sq. km to 20.31 sq. km during the same period. Conversely — due to conversion of open lands, green cover and water bodies — the extent of built-up area nearly doubled from 173.09 sq km in 1991 to 346.02 sq. km in 2018.These transformations were found to radically alter land surface temperature dynamics, leading to more intense urban heat island formation. “We observed that the average temperature in 1991 was 34.08 degrees Celsius. It rose to 36.28 degree Celsius in 2018 (a 2.2-degree Celsius increase) under the heat island zones (vulnerable areas), thus exposing people to higher heat risk,” said Shahfahad.Roshni Udyavar Yehuda, president, Institute of Environmental Architecture and Research, who was not involved with the study, said, “The urban heat island effect is caused due to increase in hardscapes such as building materials including concrete, steel and glass, both on the buildings and on streetscapes or open spaces.” “Curtailment of wind flow which often occurs in urban areas due to closely built vertical structures is also a problem,” she explained, emphasising that such micro-climactic changes must be clearly reflected (and prepared for) in Mumbai’s official development plan.Other experts, too, expressed concern over these findings, which disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities. “The urban heat island effect and population density have a strong association. In Dharavi, the urban poor suffer the most since they can’t afford houses or air conditioners. Those living in high rises or gated communities, on the other hand, may not be as badly affected as they have access to air conditioners and means to reduce heat exposure,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist with the University of Reading, UK.Deoras also clarified that the worst affected are those who must commute long distances to work (as is common in Mumbai) as well as those working outdoors.The associated impact on urban heat owing to an increase in built-up area, he explained, may not even affect residents of the area but labourers, small-shop owners, and domestic help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-saw-66-increase-in-built-up-area-in-27-years-reveals-study-101634570491580.html

He also accused the CM of double-speak on the issue.“Channi is speaking with a forked tongue on the extension of BSF deployment in Punjab. On the one hand he says, there is no need to spread panic while on the other he offers an all-party meet,” Sukhbir, who was in Abohar on Monday, said. He added that the very purpose of calling an all-party meeting as proposed by him had been defeated by this assertion that there was no need to worry. Sukhbir said Channi should also explain why he was objecting to the move if he thought the SAD was unnecessarily worried.“Channi is only making a show of a protest after a public backlash. It seems the CM is trying to spread the Centre’s narrative that the move is not a major violation of the state’s autonomy. He should explain why he agreed to the proposal in the first place when he met Union home minister Amit Shah on October 5. He should also explain, why he has not held any concrete protest on this issue till now.”Sukhbir added that the SAD has taken a principled stand on this issue as it would weaken the cause of federalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cm-should-explain-double-speak-on-extension-of-bsf-jurisdiction-sukhbir-101634570372091.html

Cops arrested a lawyer, Surendra Kumar Gupta, for the alleged murder of Singh who had a long standing property dispute with him.“Surendra has confessed his crime before the police,” said S Anand, SP (Shahjahanpur). Singh had filed two dozen cases against Gupta. Upset over this, Gupta allegedly killed him, said cops.An FIR of murder (Section 302 of the IPC) and criminal conspiracy (Section 120B of the IPC) was lodged against Gupta at Sadar Bazar police station of Shahjahanpur. Taking strong exception to a serious crime like murder on the court premises, four police personnel, including an inspector, were placed under suspension, said ASP (City) Sanjay Kumar.People in the nearby offices said they rushed to the record room after hearing a gunshot and found Singh dead. Singh had an injury on the side of his head and his clothes were soaked in blood, said the SP. “A country-made .315 bore pistol was also found near the body. We have sent the body for a post-mortem examination and formed a team to investigate into the case,” he said.The SP, along with Shahjahanpur DM Indra Vikram Singh and other senior officials, reached the spot minutes after the incident. A forensic field unit was also called in to collect evidence from the site.Advocates in the district, launched an indefinite strike, demanding the killer’s immediate arrest.The incident raised questions over the security arrangements on court premises. Opposition party leaders condemned the incident and took pot shots over the law and order situation in the state. “The judicial fraternity is an integral pillar of our democracy. The brutal murder of an advocate on court premises in broad daylight is another chilling reminder that no one is safe in today’s UP - not women, not farmers and now not advocates,” tweeted Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Former UP chief minister and president of Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav took a jibe at the government and tweeted, “The public murder of the lawyer in the court complex in Shahjahanpur has exposed the truth behind the false propaganda of the ‘encounter sarkar’. Under the BJP government, UP has become ‘number one in ease of doing crime’.”Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati tweeted, “The murder of a lawyer on the court premises of Shahjahanpur is very sad and shameful, which exposes the law and order situation under the BJP government here and their claims in this regard. Now, finally the question arises that who is safe in UP? The government should pay proper attention to this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lawyer-shot-dead-inside-shahjahanpur-court-complex-another-lawyer-arrested-101634569831576.html

18-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP nominee Nitin Agarwal elected deputy speaker of Uttar Pradesh assembly||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominee Nitin Agarwal, who is technically still a Samajwadi Party MLA, was elected deputy speaker of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly, defeating the SP’s official nominee Narendra Verma by a margin of 244 votes here on Monday.Agarwal, who served as a minister of state in the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government and later joined the BJP in 2018 with his father Naresh Agarwal, secured 304 votes while Verma got 60 votes. Out of the 368 votes polled, four were declared invalid in counting after nearly three-hour long polling by secret ballot. The outcome of the election for deputy speaker indicated apparent cross-voting in favour of candidates of both the parties.“I congratulate Nitin Agarwal, a young and experienced leader, for his victory with a heavy margin. The Samajwadi Party failed to mobilise even the opposition’s votes for its nominee Narendra Verma. This election is a reflection on the outcome of 2022 assembly polls,” said chief minister Yogi Adityanath soon after assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit declared Agarwal elected.The Uttar Pradesh assembly has a sanctioned strength of 404 members, including one nominated member. It has seven vacancies and the nominated member does not have voting rights in the deputy speaker’s election, thereby bringing down the current voting strength in the House to 396 members. The BJP has the support of at least 316 members. They include 304 of the BJP, nine of the Apna Dal (S) members and three independents. Questions are being raised about 28 abstentions and also about how the BJP member got only 304 votes against the support of at least 316 and how SP nominee Narendra Verma secured 60 votes against the SP’s effective strength of 46 against 49 listed party members in the House. Three SP members Shivpal Singh Yadav, Hariom Yadav and Nitin Agarwal do not identify themselves with the Samajwadi Party. While the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) staged a walk-out before the voting and the Congress officially stayed away from the election, their rebels were seen taking part in Monday’s voting. The BSP has 16 listed members and two unattached members. The Congress has seven listed members, including two rebels. Yogi, in his congratulatory address, also said the BJP has considered UP as a family while the SP was not able to rise above the family considerations. He said his government has always engaged in dialogue with the opposition, while the SP has followed the policy of opposing and it failed to give the name of any SP leader for election as deputy speaker in the past four- and-a-half years. He said his government has followed the tradition of giving the deputy speaker’s post to the main opposition party as Agarwal is technically an SP member. He accused the SP of betraying its candidate by not mobilising support for Verma even among the opposition parties. He said the SP leader has called election unfair though poll was held by secret ballot and not by using EVMs (electronic voting machines). Minister for parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna said viewing the opposition’s strength in the House, the SP nominee should have got 78 and not just 60 votes.Leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary (SP), while congratulating Agarwal, countered Yogi’s observations and said the SP fielded Verma despite being aware of the outcome. He said in the 2022 assembly elections, the SP would be voted to power and the BJP would go to the opposition benches. He also said the SP did not seek any support from the Congress or the BSP and yet his party’s candidate got 60 votes.He said the BJP candidate secured only 304 votes, indicating whom the people would vote for in the 2022 assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-nominee-nitin-agarwal-elected-deputy-speaker-of-uttar-pradesh-assembly-101634569171692.html

18-10-2021||Mumbai||Amit Shah must tell the nation about situation in Kashmir, demands Sena||Shiv Sena on Monday sought a response from Union home minister Amit Shah over the situation in Kashmir that has witnessed a spate of terror attacks, killing 18 people in the last 11 days. Sena, which had backed the Centre over revoking the special status to Jammu and Kashmir by abrogating Article 370, said that the responsibility of the death of the people in the valley lies with the home ministry. It said talk on cancelling cricket matches between India and Pakistan was an attempt to divert attention Sanjay Raut, chief spokesperson of the Sena, said the current developments in Kashmir are concerning as “terrorism has resurfaced there”. “Recently, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said despite removing Article 370 there was no change in the situation of Kashmir and this is the truth. Today, the terrorists are creating havoc by killing Sikhs, Kashmiri Pandits and Bihari labourers. The responsibility lies with the home ministry... The situation in Kashmir has gone out of hand... We must get to know what is the government doing [over the issue] and therefore, the home minister must tell the nation about the situation in Kashmir,” Raut said.In an apparent response to Union minister Giriraj Singh, who said the India-Pakistan T20 match in Dubai should be reconsidered, Raut said it was a move to divert attention. Without naming PM Narendra Modi, the Sena leader mentioned an unscheduled stop to celebrate the birthday of the then Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif. “I am speaking about the situation in Kashmir, you speak about that and not the India-Pakistan match to distract people. The issue in Jammu and Kashmir will not be resolved by playing or not playing a cricket match. Shiv Sena’s stand has always been that there shouldn’t be any ties with Pakistan — no cricket, no trade or no cultural ties. You only go there and cut cakes. Here people are dying, and you are speaking about a cricket match,” Raut said, referring to Modi’s stopover at Lahore in December 2015 to wish his counterpart on his birthday.He further said merely using threatening language against Pakistan and saying surgical strikes will be conducted will not help. A tough stand must be taken by the prime minister, defence minister and home ministry, he said. “The decision on [relations with Pakistan] are made as per your convenience and political calculations, and innocent people in Kashmir are dying; this will not work.”The Sena leader said it cannot be said that the situation in Kashmir had improved in the two years after the abrogation of the special status. “The news emanating from the valley was stopped as the internet was shut there, there were curbs on the media there, many leaders were not allowed to move around, some of the key leaders were under house arrest. Many incidents have not come out after Article 370 was removed.”Pravin Darekar, leader of opposition in the legislative council, said, “You need not worry about the country’s security. The nations’ home minister Amit Bhai [Shah] is capable of tackling it. Instead of that, I request Raut saheb to look at the issues in Maharashtra, including the safety of women.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amit-shah-must-tell-the-nation-about-situation-in-kashmir-demands-sena-101634569052277.html

The BJP responded saying none of their corporators would be joining the Sena. Jadhav said, “Some corporators of the BJP in the BMC are fed up with their leadership. Their suggestions or views are not given any value by the leadership. A bunch of these corporators want to join the Sena. We are thinking about the same and will take a decision by December.” The 2017 civic elections saw a close contest between Sena and BJP with the former managing to retain power, even though it failed to win a simple majority in the house of 227. The Sena won 84 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came a close second with 82 seats. The two parties were running the state together because of which the BJP did not make an attempt to wrest power. In 2018, 7 MNS corporators joined the Sena increasing its tally. Currently, the Sena has 97 corporators, including independents and nominated corporators. The BJP has 83 seats, Congress 29, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 8, Samajwadi Party (SP) six, AIMIM two and MNS has one seat. The two former allies have now locked horns again to win power in the Mumbai civic body in the civic polls scheduled to be held in February next year. A bitter tussle is on between the two parties ahead of the elections. Jadhav’s remarks made on Monday are coming out of the same tussle. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP corporator and BJP’s Group leader in BMC, said, “The Sena should stop dreaming as they will not be successful in getting our corporators. Not even one BJP corporator will leave the party.” In a statement, BJP’s corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat, who is also the spokesperson, said, “We gave confidence that not a single BJP corporator will even look at the Shiv Sena which has left Hindutva.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjps-15-bmc-corporators-in-touch-with-us-says-shiv-sena-leader-101634568091476.html

Worse still, one of the female security guards working at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch suffered a heart attack on Monday and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is now blaming the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the sorry state of affairs.The real reason the security guards have not been paid is that the security agency was changed midway and neither the old nor the new agency ended up paying them.

Routine life was thrown out of gear and temperature fell drastically across the region. Many houses collapsed and extensive damage was caused to crops in the field by heavy rainfall. “An alert was issued about the extensive rain in this part of the state but there was little the farmers could do. Rains are untimely these days and have caused extensive damage to millet crops. Rainwater filled the fields where harvested millet crop was lying,” said farm scientist Dr RS Chauhan. “This is season for cultivation of wheat which will be delayed as fields are water logged and it will take time to dry up. This would further delay the sowing of wheat crop disturbing the cycle. The potato crop sown will have improper germination while the mustard crop sown is finished. Besides this, there is extensive damage to crop of green vegetables due to untimely rain,” added Dr Chauhan.Agra alone received 44 mm rainfall by 8am on Monday and there was additional 50 mm rain on Monday. This 94 mm rain on Sunday and Monday brought maximum temperature as low as 29.9 degrees celsius in Agra which is 4 degrees celsius below the normal. Life was also affected in Etah district which got scanty rain on Sunday till afternoon followed by heavy rain till Monday evening. Water logging was common complaint witnessed in city area. Rain on second consecutive day brought tough times for denizens in Firozabad. Labourers were found managing their way to glass factories as Monday began with extensive rain.

The farmers protested briefly at some places of the state. There was heavy police deployment in and around railway stations, but trains stopped briefly at a few stations, railway officials said.The farmers’ body had given the call for the nationwide rail roko agitation to demand the dismissal and arrest of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni to ensure justice in the Lakhimpur Kheri case.Ashish Mishra, son of Ajay Mishra, was arrested in connection with the case on October 9.Peace prevailed in Lakhimpur Kheri, the site of the October 3 violence. The railways had suspended train movement in the region, with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) also withdrawing its agitation there.Elsewhere, groups of farmers staged sit-ins at railways stations and tracks in Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Hapur and Bijnor, affecting the plying of over a dozen trains in the region. Trains were halted in Greater Noida’s Dankaur station by the protesters, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said. In Ghaziabad’s Modinagar, they agitated in front of a goods train which had already reached its destination.In Muzaffarnagar, BKU workers halted the Amritsar-Delhi and the Jalandhar Express trains by staging a dharna on rail tracks.The BKU workers also staged a token demonstration at the Raya station in Mathura, officials said, adding that they later vacated the railway tracks.Braving heavy rain, farmers blocked the movement of trains on the Lucknow-Bijnor-Najibabad route at the Maujpur junction near Najibabad, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) youth wing’s former state president Digamber Singh said. “It affected the plying of the Chandigarh Express and other trains,” he said, adding that the six-hour blockade continued till 4pm. Singh also said the farmers’ dharna (sit-in) on railway tracks and platforms in Hapur, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur disrupted the movement of trains on the Delhi-Saharanpur and Dehradun routes.In Meerut, the protesting farmers squatted on tracks at Kankerlhera, Sakauti and Partapur. Former BKU district president Manoj Tyagi claimed that protest affected the plying of trains on the Delhi-Punjab route. Heavy force, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel, were deployed at railways stations and tracks to ensure that protest remained peaceful. Additional director general of police (Meerut zone) Rajeev Sabbharwal said force was deployed at different locations. “No confrontation occurred anywhere and the protest remained peaceful,” he said. The protest caused inconvenience to some passengers who faced a delay in reaching their destinations. In Lakhimpur Kheri, Amandeep Singh Sandhu, BKU (Tikait) district president, said, “In view of the prevailing situation in Kheri, the SKM had cancelled the ‘rail roko’ agitation in the district”.“Also, the untimely rains and heavy winds had hit the paddy crops in the district and farmers are busy managing the crop… the railways have also suspended the movement of trains in Kheri, hence, it (agitation) was of no use there,” he said.Sandhu had circulated his video message to this effect on Sunday evening.Despite SKM leaders withdrawing the rail roko agitation in Lakhimpur Kheri, elaborate security arrangements were put in place at all railway stations and tracks in the district.Apart from police officials, Railway Protection Force, railway police and other security personnel remained on alert.Elsewhere, Shivam Sharma, PRO, North Central Railway (NCR) said farmers stopped the Gomti Express for two to three minutes at the Khurja railway station. The protesters, however, left after being persuaded by the police.In Jhansi, the farmers demonstrated for around 10 minutes at the Dabra station and between Gohad and Malanpur stations. They later left after being asked by the police, he said.Similarly, at two places between Mathura-Palwal of Agra division, the farmers demonstrated at the railway gate and also near the Rundhi station.Sharma said there was no loss of railway property.“In Lucknow, police were deployed in large numbers at Utrathia and Alamnagar railway stations. The security personnel prevented the farmers from entering the stations,” Lucknow commissioner of police D K Thakur said.He said elaborate security arrangements were made outside all railway stations of the state capital, and farmers were stopped before reaching the stations.Kanpur commissioner of police Aseem Arun said there was no impact of the farmers’ agitation in Kanpur as tight security arrangements were maintained as a precautionary measure.Eight people, including four farmers, died in the violence on October 3.

18-10-2021||Lucknow||Rail roko: Farmers stage protest on rail tracks in western Uttar Pradesh||Farmers squatted on rail tracks and staged sit-ins on platforms at several places in western Uttar Pradesh on Monday as part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s rail roko protest over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, died on October 3. During the rail roko agitation, the protesters demanded the removal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra ‘Teni’, whose son has been arrested in the Lakhimpur Kheri case. Groups of farmers staged sit-ins at railways stations and tracks in Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Hapur and Bijnor districts of western Uttar Pradesh, affecting the plying of over a dozen trains in the region. Braving heavy rain, farmers blocked the movement of trains on the Lucknow-Bijnor-Najibabad route at the Maujpur junction near Najibabad, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) youth wing’s former state president Digamber Singh said. “It affected the plying of the Chandigarh Express and other trains,” he said, adding that the six-hour blockade continued till 4pm. Singh also said the farmers’ dharna (sit-in) on railway tracks and platforms in Hapur, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur disrupted the movement of trains on the Delhi-Saharanpur and Dehradun routes. Farmers also protested at Khatauli and Mansoorpur stations in Muzaffarnagar district, demanding the removal of the minister for a fair investigation. In Meerut, the protesting farmers changed their strategy and squatted on tracks at Kankerlhera, Sakauti and Partapur, instead of the city and cantonment railway stations. Former BKU district president Manoj Tyagi claimed that protest affected the plying of trains on the Delhi-Punjab route. Heavy force, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel, were deployed at railways stations and tracks to ensure that protest remained peaceful. Additional director general of police (Meerut zone) Rajeev Sabbharwal said force was deployed at different locations. “No confrontation occurred anywhere and the protest remained peaceful,” he said. The rail roko agitation caused inconvenience to some passengers who faced a delay in reaching their destinations. Four of the eight people who died in the violence on October 3 were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver, besides a journalist. Farmers have claimed that the minister’s son Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and Ajay Mishra who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time. Ashish Mishra was arrested in the case on October 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rail-roko-farmers-stage-protest-on-rail-tracks-in-western-uttar-pradesh-101634565513304.html
18-10-2021||Mumbai||Sena MP Sanjay Raut: Don’t just sit on minister’s chair, defend MVA too||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi ministers must launch a counterattack on allegations and accusations levelled at the government or the ministers by the political opponents in the state. The Sena leader said it is also the responsibility of ministers to respond to allegations and criticism to keep the image of the government intact. The Sena chief spokesperson asked for how long would chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar defend the MVA. He added that it is also the responsibility of those “occupying” ministerial berths. “MVA ministers shouldn’t merely sit on their ministerial chair, they must respond to attacks and taunts. Will only [Sharad] Pawar Saheb or Supriya Sule ji or the chief minister or I respond to attacks? What are you doing? It is the responsibility of all ministers. Whoever has a pie of power will have to speak up to keep the image of the government,” Raut said. He added that once MVA ministers start counterattacks and respond to allegations, the BJP will cease its attack. The MVA has been under attack from the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders for several months now. The leaders and ministers of the three-party MVA government have been facing several allegations for the past year-and-a-half. Two ministers, including Anil Deshmukh and Sanjay Rathod, have resigned over allegations related to corruption and crime against a woman. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have also alleged money laundering by NCP minister Hasan Mushrif. The BJP has also levelled allegations of seeking money for transfers in jobs against Sena minister Anil Parab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-mp-sanjay-raut-don-t-just-sit-on-minister-s-chair-defend-mva-too-101634565511083.html
18-10-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC restrains state-appointed panel from taking charge of Saibaba Sansthan||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has restrained the Maharashtra government-appointed new managing committee from taking charge of the affairs of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan in Shirdi and directed the ad-hoc committee appointed by HC in 2019 to continue until further orders. The restraining order was passed last week on two public interest litigations, filed by Uttamrao Shelke and Nikhil Dorle, questioning the composition of the new committee constituted by the state government last month. HC observed that the requisite categories of persons, as required under the Sansthan Act and Rules, were not included in the new committee. The bench observed that once the defects in the new committee were cured, it would consider handing over charge to the new committee, provided it conformed to the Act and Rules. The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice SG Mehare was on October 14 informed by the petitioners’ lawyers that the new committee did not have a proper representation of women, socially and economically backward persons and persons having specialised knowledge and hence, it should not be allowed to take charge of the affairs. As per the Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Trust (Shirdi) Act, 2004, and the Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Trust (Appointment of Members of Management Committee and Forms of Declarations) Rules, 2013, the committee had to have at least one woman member as well as one from the socially and economically weaker section, eight members possessing professional or specialised knowledge and seven members from the general category. The special counsel for the state government submitted that though there were defects, the committee had 12 members that were as per the Rules and hence, they should be allowed to take charge of the affairs of the trust from Tuesday. “We would be failing in our duty if we permit an incomplete/deficiently constituted committee to take charge of the Sansthan when we are aware of the frequent litigation over almost eight to 10 years in relation to the said Sansthan and this court having quashed the appointment of the management committee on at least one occasion and having appointed an ad-hoc management committee under the chairmanship of the learned PDJ (principal district judge) Ahmednagar on two occasions,” said the bench, while rejecting the special counsel’s contention. The court then directed the ad-hoc committee to continue to handle affairs of the Sansthan till the PILs were decided. The bench clarified that it would “consider the handing over of the charge of management of the Sansthan to such (state-appointed) committee, except in the face of any legal impediment,” if the defects are cured. The PILs are posted for further hearing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-restrains-state-appointed-panel-from-taking-charge-of-saibaba-sansthan-101634565331331.html

On October 6, the body of the victim, Sukhchain Dass, was found on the road after he was returning from work. Initially, it appeared that the case would remain unsolved and was a ‘blind murder’. Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) in-charge Shaminder Singh said the accused were arrested after raids based on a tip-off. The accused are Mehnga Singh, 24; Kamalpreet Singh, 24; Ravinder Singh, 22; Jagsir Singh, 26; Angrej Singh, 25, and Manpreet Bawa, 19, of Nabha sub-division.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harcharan Singh Bhullar said three of the accused, Mehnga, Kamalpreet and Ravinder, looted the victim of his Royal Enfield motorcycle and other belongings before fleeing away from the site, before assaulting him. “Later, some passersby took him to hospital, where he was declared brought dead. He had been attacked with sharp-edged weapons and had multiple injuries in his stomach. The accused are involved in multiple cases of robberies and multiple FIRs have been registered against them,” he said.Police have recovered two country-made pistols and two Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycles and other sharp-edged weapons from their possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/six-held-for-murder-in-nabha-village-gang-of-robbers-busted-101634565211553.html
18-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai : 17 days on, 56-yr-old gets 3 years’ jail term for flashing woman in garden||Concluding the trial in just two days, the Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court recently convicted a 56-year-old city resident for flashing a woman in a south Mumbai garden and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment. The court order came 17 days after the incident took place. Metropolitan magistrate Yashshree Marulkar also imposed fines worth ₹1,000 each on him under the charges of outraging the modesty of a woman and stalking, and ₹500 for sexual harassment. “Sexual violence, apart from being a dehumanising act, is an unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a female (sic),” said the court, while sentencing the convict. “It is a serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity. It degrades and humiliates the victim. It leaves behind a traumatic experience. The accused not only causes physical injuries but more indelibly leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a woman i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation and not the least her chastity (sic),” the court added. The incident took place in the evening of September 18 when the woman was attending an online lecture on her laptop in a south Mumbai garden. The accused waited near her and when the woman went to another part of the garden, followed her and flashed her. The woman immediately ran towards the exit gate and took the help of two persons, who nabbed the accused. Tandel was arrested and a charge-sheet was filed against him. On October 4, the charges were framed against him under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Accordingly, the prosecution examined five witnesses on October 4 and 5, including the complainant, and on the second day of the trial itself, the court declared him guilty and sentenced him to three years imprisonment. The accused claimed that as it was dark in the garden, the complainant could not have seen him and therefore, it would not be appropriate to convict him only on the basis of her testimony. The court, however, observed that there was no reason for the complainant to lie, as she did not know the accused and had not even seen him before the incident. The court also relied on the two independent witnesses to corroborate her testimony. “It is now a well-settled law that conviction in sexual offences can be safely recorded solely on the basis of the victim’s testimony, provided her evidence does not suffer from any basic infirmity (sic),” observed the court. Tandel was earlier convicted for similar offences in Cuffe Parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-17-days-on-56-yr-old-gets-3-years-jail-term-for-flashing-woman-in-garden-101634565151122.html
18-10-2021||Mumbai||With largest oxygen backup, Mumbai’s Kanjurmarg Covid jumbo centre ready for 3rd wave||With two medical oxygen tanks of 40 and 13 kilolitres each and seven oxygen generation plants that will use the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology to produce 1,500 litres of oxygen per minute, the jumbo Covid-19 centre at Kanjurmarg will have the largest oxygen back among such facilities in Mumbai. Located near Kanjurmarg railway station, the jumbo centre has a capacity of 1,692 beds, including 1,112 oxygenated beds and 200 intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Mumbai civic body will activate the facility only if the need arises. “We have kept the facility ready assuming the worst-case scenario. We will activate the beds in phases as and when the need arises,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The Kanjurmarg centre has been planned to cater to the large areas of eastern suburbs which had only one jumbo facility in Mulund till now. The facility has made special provisions for paediatric beds and a mother’s lounge for children who are feared to be more affected in the third wave. Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases have been steady in the past few weeks, hovering between 400 and 500. Despite the low demand, the civic body has prepared three additional jumbo facilities in anticipation of the third wave. While the Kanjurmarg facility is fully ready, another facility has been kept available in Malad and the third one is coming up at Somaiya Ground in Sion. “We have also finalised the agency that will take care of the manpower including doctors, nurses, ward boys etc. But we will issue the work order only when it is required,” said Kakani. The existing jumbo facilities in the city in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Goregaon and Dahisar, among others, have liquid medical oxygen tanks of 13 and 11 kilolitres capacity. “The 40 kilolitre tank at Kanjurmarg is the largest in the city,” said Dr Harish Pathak, who heads the jumbo centre. “Seven oxygen generation plants will be up in another two weeks. In case we have to activate the beds in an emergency, we have kept a small civic medical team of doctors and nurses as a backup to cater to the incoming patients,” he said. At the moment, the biggest concern of the civic body is an anticipated post-Diwali spike. As the majority of lockdown restrictions have been lifted, markets and other shopping areas are crowded due to the upcoming festivities. Members of the state’s Covid-19 task force anticipate that the third wave is likely to hit between December and January. Some predict that the number of cases will be fewer than what the city experienced in the second wave. But all this is likely to be true only if a newer, stubborn variant of the Sars-Cov-2 does not arise. Medical experts also point that it’s important to examine the number of reinfections and breakthrough infections to understand how they will contribute in the future spurts. “Our biggest worry is people letting their guards down and not following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Kakani. “All of us should exercise caution to keep the cases under control,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-largest-oxygen-backup-mumbai-s-kanjurmarg-covid-jumbo-centre-ready-for-3rd-wave-101634563770949.html
18-10-2021||Chandigarh||Heady encounter with an international wine shop||Our nation is a magnificent mosaic of multicultural, multilingual and varied geographical diversities which, according to a popular saying, changes its hues every 5km. Thanks to the Election Commission, civil servants get an opportunity to explore uncharted territories in different states that generally fall outside the clichéd tourist circuits. The recent skirmishes in Meghalaya, the abode of clouds, unplugged the memories of my four-week stay in one of the small subdivisions of West Jaintia Hills district many years ago. The place is endowed with lush meadows, unending streams, waterfalls, and forest tracks. Also, it has a culturally rich society that believes in gender parity, matriarchal structures and a matrilineal society. The place has a distinct cultural aroma of its own. The air reverberates with energy, music, fun and frolic. The capital city is home to more than 300 music bands that excel in churning out both Bollywood and Hollywood numbers with equal ease. Of special interest is the repetitive tik tik sound of the hand-held cutters for cracking open the beetle nut. The fermented fragrance of these nuts creates a heady concoction of sorts. In the countryside, I came across beautifully decorated wooden churches constructed by missionaries almost a century ago. After the Sunday prayers, the day was open to celebrations with loud music blaring from the car stereos and people enjoying sumptuous meals accompanied with the locally brewed drinks. The markets were closed, and the convoy of cars came to a grinding halt. The lively music gelled well with the salubrious climes of the hills and forests to create a picture postcard like site. While travelling in the area, a visit to a small border outpost in the evening still remains vividly etched in memory. The international border was often misused for smuggling cattle and indulging in trade of coal. Despite our guards on vigil, this trade was an easy source of money for these nefarious elements. Travelling all day had made us thirsty after having consumed all the water bottles in our possession. The elixir of life is what we yearned for. After walking a considerable distance, we spotted a small shop on the Indian side in the middle of an absolutely uninhabited place. The signboard read: International Wine Shop. To our surprise, a middle-aged lady greeted us warmly and politely offered us beer bottles instead of water. She seemed to have run out of water bottles to our dismay. The temptation was difficult to resist but call of duty prevented us from indulging in the tempting offer of barley water. Seeing our hapless plight, she muttered something in the local language and yelled at the top of her voice, at which a boy came running across the border with two bottles of packaged cold drinking water manufactured in Bangladesh, a classic case of Indo-Bangla ties! On our query regarding her source of revenue in that place with no visible habitation in the vicinity, she simply smiled and told us that the “drink of the Gods has devotees all around the world”. Without further ado and having satiated our appetite for water, we left for the next village pondering on the philosophy of international brotherhood and cooperation exhibited in totality by this innocuous international wine shop. rarabhandari@gmail.com The writer is a Punjab-cadre IAS officer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heady-encounter-with-an-international-wine-shop-101634563591014.html

18-10-2021||Lucknow||Cultural, entertainment progs to mark Diwali fair in Lucknow from Oct 28||LUCKNOW: The district administration will organise a Diwali fair at the Jhulelal Park from October 28 to November 5. The event, on the lines of Lucknow Mahotsav, is set to be a fun-filled affair with a series of cultural and entertainment programmes. The fair would showcase indigenous art and craft work from other districts also. This would be in addition to the district administration’s plan to invite renowned cultural artistes to perform during entertainment programmes, said officials. “Preparations are on for the Diwali fair starting from October 28. It will be a grand affair,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate. The other attractions of the Diwali fair would be talent shows, painting competitions, magic shows, slogan competition, musical band show, musical night, mushaira and others. The venue would have a grand multi cuisine food court. “We are trying to tie up with various eateries, famous brands and restaurants in order to set up outlets at the food court that is going to be another major attraction at the fair,” added the DM. A dedicated section highlighting several government schemes and programmes would also be a part of the fair. Besides, traditional activities like kite flying, vintage car rally, theatre fest, youth fest and other functions would be organised. Sufi night, Bhojpuri night, Punjabi night, ghazal night, comedy night, Bollywood night and theatre night will be among other attractions at the Diwali fair. However, the administration is yet to prepare the list of artistes who would be performing here. …but no buzz about Lucknow Mahotsav The district administration is yet to take a call on the city’s annual 10-day extravaganza — the Lucknow Mahotsav, which is suspended for the last two years. If the administration calls it off, it would be the third consecutive year when the iconic fest would be shelved. “The traditional date for the Mahotsav is November 25. However, its preparations begin much earlier. This time there is no buzz while no meeting on Mahotsav has taken place so far. I think the event is not on the priority list, as all are occupied in handling pandemic situation, which tops our priority list,” said a senior administrative official. Some officials, however, said that the fest may be postponed to January or February. In November 2019, the administration had announced that the fest would be organised from January 17, 2020 to 23, 2020 at Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan. But in January, Mahotsav Samiti issued a three line statement saying—“Due to unavoidable reasons, the proposed Mahotsav 2019—2020, scheduled to be held from January 17 to 23, 2020 has been postponed till further orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cultural-entertainment-progs-to-mark-diwali-fair-in-lucknow-from-oct-28-101634561310801.html

Mithun Ghosh, 32, died while he was being rushed to Raiganj Medical College and Hospital. While the state BJP leadership alleged that Ghosh was killed by criminals backed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the district police arrested Santosh Mahato, an acquaintance of Ghosh. The police are on the lookout for Sukumar Ghosh, another acquaintance of the victim. Quoting Ajit Ghosh, a cousin of the deceased, Mohammed Sana Akhtar, superintendent of police, North Dinajpur district said, “Before his death, Mithun talked to his cousin and mentioned Sukumar Ghosh and Santosh Mahato.” “Investigation has revealed that on Sunday night Mithun went out to have dinner with the two men at a hotel. After returning home around 10 pm, he took out two firearms from his room to show those to Ghosh and Mahato who were waiting outside the house. Ghosh accidentally fired a weapon and the bullet hit Mithun. Only one round was fired. Mahato was arrested on Monday morning while Ghosh is still at large. This incident is not related to politics in any way,” said Akhtar. While he was being taken to court, Mahato told the media that he was present when Ghosh was shot. “Sukumar Ghosh fired the gun,” he told reporters. Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the state assembly, alleged that Mithun Ghosh was killed by criminals backed by the TMC. The state BJP declared an eight-hour bandh in North Dinajpur district on Tuesday. The victim’s sister, Pompi Mitra, also accused the ruling party.“Local TMC leaders had been threatening my brother for a long time. They wanted him to leave the BJP,” she said. Kanchana Ghosh, the victim’s mother, said, “My son’s life was in danger. He had many enemies. TMC workers had been threatening him.” Pradip Sarkar, a senior BJP district leader, said, “This was not the first attempt on Mithun’s life. He was shot in the leg before the assembly polls.

The four others convicted in the case are Jasbir Singh, a follower; Krishan Lal, a dera manager; Sabdil, gunman of the dera head; and Avtar Singh, a dera functionary. “All five convicts, including Ram Rahim, have been awarded life sentence,” CBI special public prosecutor HPS Verma said. CBI sought death penalty; Ram Rahim pleaded for mercy Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra. “We are satisfied (with the punishment). It has been a long battle for my family. We have lived in fear all these years but have fought to get justice,” Jagseer Singh, the son of Ranjit Singh, said after Monday’s verdict. The CBI had sought death sentence for Ram Rahim, who in turn pleaded for mercy. The special CBI court convicted the dera head and four others on October 8.Murdered for revealing sexual abuse at dera According to the CBI, Ranjit Singh was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter that revealed the sexual exploitation of woman followers at the dera. In June 2002, Ranjit Singh was summoned to the dera and threatened with dire consequences, but he refused to seek pardon, saying he had done nothing wrong. The dera head is serving a 20-year jail term for raping two followers and has been sentenced to life for the murder of a journalist in 2002. Ram Rahim appeared through video-conferencing from Sunaria jail of Rohtak, while the four others were present in the court at the time of the sentencing. The hearing was conducted amid tight security at the Panchkula district court complex. Prohibitory orders were in place against the assembly of five and more people in Panchkula district. Three major cases against dera chief There were mainly three cases against the Sirsa-based dera chief instituted in 2002-03. All were investigated by the CBI. The dera chief already stands convicted in two cases, one related to sexual exploitation of women disciples and the second of the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. The third case was of Ranjit Singh’s murder. The first conviction was in a sexual exploitation case in August 2017, which had resulted in widespread violence in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Thirty-six people were killed in Panchkula alone in the violence reported after his conviction on conviction on August 25, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dera-chief-gets-life-term-in-ranjit-singh-murder-case-101634558310598.html

18-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet opposes Centre’s decision to extend BSF’s jurisdiction||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday announced that the state cabinet has resolved to oppose the Centre’s move to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) to 50km along the border in the state. Also read: 50 trains across 130 locations affected amid farmers’ ‘rail roko’ agitationAddressing mediapersons in Chandigarh after chairing the meeting of council of ministers, Channi said, “Our government will not accept the Centre’s decision to allow BSF’s jurisdiction to be extended from the existing 15km as it is against the spirit of federalism.” Last week, the Union government amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a 50km stretch, up from the existing 15km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Says special assembly session can be called Opposing the Centre’s move, the Punjab cabinet said that law and order is a state subject, and the police force is capable of dealing with any situation. “Punjab Police is competent to handle the law-and-order situation across the state. It has contained militancy and since communal harmony has prevailed here. In case the issue is not resolved, a special session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha will be summoned to reject the Centre’s order,” he said. Channi said such decisions should not be taken without consulting the state government. “A special cabinet meeting will be called on this issue. If the need arises, an all-party meeting will be called. We will take other (political) parties along (over this issue),” he said. Accuses SAD chief of stoking sentiments Criticising Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal for stoking sentiments by saying that central forces would now man religious places in Amritsar after extension in the BSF’s jurisdiction, Channi asked him not to attempt to push Punjab into the dark days of militancy by making such comments. He held the SAD responsible for misleading the state’s youngsters to take up the path of militancy in the past. “Anyone who rakes up such sensitive issues for vested interests is enemy of state,” Channi added. On Sunday, the SAD had targeted the Punjab government, saying the chief minister should answer “why he had acquiesced” to the Centre’s move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-opposes-centre-s-decision-to-extend-bsf-s-jurisdiction-101634555730271.html

The officials said that the pilgrims have been asked to stay in the lodging facilities available in the temple premises and wait till Tuesday to return. “As per our information, there are about 4,000 pilgrims in Kedarnath temple premises and 2,500 in Badrinath premises. We have asked all of them to stay in the lodging facilities there till Monday night and take the return journey after the weather clears on Tuesday,” said Ravinath Raman, chairman Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. He said that the appeal has been made amid a red alert issued by the Dehradun centre of India Meteorological Department for heavy to extremely heavy rainfall on Monday in the state. “The Char Dham Yatra has not been halted but an appeal has been made to the people to not go on the pilgrimage today and tomorrow. They have been asked to stay put where they are due to the threats of rockfalls and landslides on the highway amid heavy rains,” said Raman. To prevent any untoward incident due to heavy rains, the administration has stopped people in Haridwar and Rishikesh from going ahead with the Char Dham Yatra. In Rishikesh, the running of Char Dham Yatra vehicles has been stopped from the bus stand with police putting barricades to stop any traffic moving up the hills towards the four shrines. In Haridwar too, the pilgrims have been asked to stay in safe places on Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Monday visited the state control room of the disaster management department in Dehradun where he reviewed the preparations being made to handle any emergency situation. “During his visit, he spoke to the district magistrates of Pauri Garhwal and Rudraprayag districts during which he was apprised that three people died while two were injured in Pauri Garhwal’s Lansdowne town after the ceiling of their house collapsed due to heavy rains. The Rudraprayag DM informed him about the situation of Char Dham Yatra in Kedarnath shrine,” said an official from the CM office. He added that “During the meeting, the CM directed all the district magistrates to provide an hourly report on the rain situation and clear any blocked roads as soon as possible while keeping the response time to any emergency situation to a minimum.” The CM also urged the Char Dham pilgrims to exercise “caution.” Due to heavy rains in the state, the government earlier ordered all the schools to remain closed on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/over-6k-pilgrims-in-kedarnath-badrinath-asked-to-stay-in-safe-places-amid-heavy-rains-101634555070598.html
18-10-2021||Pune||Countdown to PMC polls: Vadgaonsheri’s dynamic growth offset by nagging civic problems||PUNE Till a few years ago, Vadgaonsheri was a parched locale where residential societies and house in general struggled to access water, potable or otherwise. The state government, along with the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) initiated the Bhama Askhed project that is now meeting the water needs of areas along Ahmednagar road, where Vadgaonsheri is located.While residents are happy a long-pending problem has been resolved, another issue has cropped up.Heavy rainfall in the city has exposed the PMC’s shoddy road work. During a recent 78-mm of rainfall in a four hour spell, several stretches of road here were flooded, disrupting traffic and damaging vehicles.The areas that suffered the most are Dhanori, Yerawada and Kalyaninagar. So grave is the problem that even deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who arrived in Pune at the airport on that day, was stuck in traffic for hours. Many of these areas do not have a storm-water drainage system despite housing a few major IT companies. Amit Wani, an employee with a private firm, said, “Our Shubham Society has 200 flats. For the last three years, water has been entering our society. The compound wall and vehicles get damaged. The parking lot is often submerged. Society members have seen snakes in the water.” Elected members on their part blamed the administration for the water logging though PMC officials said elected members too are responsible. Shailaja Patil, a resident of Ujwal housing society said, “After heavy rains DPs got submerged in water. We are all facing the problem of water logging.” After state government merged 23 villages under the PMC limits recently, the civic limits have extended further on the city’s eastern front, as areas like Wagholi, an entry-exit point for Pune, have also been merged into PMC limits. On one hand the area boasts being an IT hub with offices located in areas like Vimannagar and Kharadi, on the other there are no public toilets in these areas. A lack of public gardens makes the area concretisation look stark, making a walk along the road in summer difficult. “I shifted to Kharadi from the western part of the city which has a thick cover of greenery. Kharadi stretch only has tall buildings without any greenery, leave alone public gardens,” said Shreeram Ratnaparakhi, a 40-year-old IT engineer. Given that the Lohegaon airport falls in the area, the Indian Air Force has height restrictions on buildings in the area. Avinash Thube, a science teacher living in Vimannagar said, “Water scarcity has been resolved, but there are many issues like repeated road digging, traffic snarls, encroachments on footpaths. Many stalls are using illegal water connections.”The area, despite several problems, has developed rapidly. Despite water scarcity a few years ago, this area has large housing projects.Vadgaon Sheri, which is spread across two ward offices, Ahmednagar road ward office and the Yerwada/Kalas/Dhanori ward office under the PMC, has corporators from the NCP, BJP, and Shiv Sena in the PMC.Under various wards of PMC in Vadgaonsheri, a total of 14 elected members are from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), six are from the NCP, one member is from Shiv Sena and one is from the AIMIM.The Nagar Road Citizens Forum has issued a legal notice over the lack of basic services, and forum convenor Qaneez Sukhrani has said property tax will not be paid if residents do not get basic services. Kalyaninagar residents too are unhappy with the encroachments on roads and footpaths. The BRTS project in the area is currently at a standstill as metro work is going on. Sukhrani said, “Condition of roads deteriorate rapidly. Degeneration leads to potholes, cracks, fissures due to poor quality material used by contractor. Trenches are filled up hurriedly with mud, but the road is not levelled evenly.”Specifically on footpaths, Sukhrani added, “Most stretches do not have footpaths even though the road design includes footpaths. If there are footpaths, it is broken, not repaired, or not according to IRC norms. Where there are footpaths, encroachments and hawkers grab the place leaving pedestrians to risk their lives. PMC does not re-locate the hawkers with permits and evicts those who are illegal.”Then there is the garbage issue on which Sukhrani says: “PMC staff has no control over residential and commercial establishments against throwing mixed garbage in public spaces. PMC does not clear or remove broken branches, branches cut by various agencies, fallen leaves. These are left to rot in public spaces, especially behind transformers, junction and fuse boxes, around trees guards. PMC does not remove unwanted and dead cables hanging from trees and electricity poles.” Tit for tat In the last five years we did lots of work in these areas. Whatever promises were made by us have been executed. The area was facing a water scarcity and we completed the long-pending Bhama Askhed water project. The metro work is moving speedily and citizens are appreciating the work. The roads around Lohegaon airport got developed. We approved two flyovers. New gardens have been inaugurated. - Jagdish Mulik, BJP city unit president Despite having a clear majority, BJP failed to do justice to the area. They have 14 corporators, but they did not think about storm water drainage. BJP is trying to take credit for the Bhama Askhed dam, but with the help of Ajit Pawar we cleared all the hurdles and completed the project which was started in our tenure. Due to illegal constructions, nullahs have been diverted. Citizens should check who diverted these nallahs. -Sunil Tingre, NCP MLA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/countdown-to-pmc-polls-vadgaonsheri-s-dynamic-growth-offset-by-nagging-civic-problems-101634554171090.html
18-10-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: A tale of exam with unending woes||PUNE A crucial exam to fill up 6,200 posts for which over eight lakh job aspirants have applied. The exam gets cancelled at the eleventh hour in the first attempt – and when it is rescheduled, aspirants face issues that threaten to bar them from attending it.This is a tale of an exam to fill up vacant positions in Maharashtra’s public health department that will help the government prepare for a potential surge in Covid-19 cases anticipated by experts after Diwali. It also raises doubt whether the government should be outsourcing a crucial exercise such as an exam to a private agency?The posts to be filled are under Class C and D categories and pertain to staff nurses, auxiliary nursing midwives, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, X-Ray technicians, laboratory assistants and others such as ward boys and supporting staff.For years, the state public health department has been facing an issue of a shortage of staff. When the issue has taken a centre stage during the Covid-19 pandemic, state health minister Rajesh Tope assured of filing up all posts at the earliest to tackle the situation emerging due to deadly virus that has so far claimed at least 1.40 lakh lives with 65.89 lakh suffering from it.Instead of winning praise to initiate massive exercises to fill up a large number of posts, the government has come under fire from aspirants for the mess it has created. But the lessons seem to have not been learnt.For the second time within three weeks, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has faced an embarrassing situation as several aspirants have now complained about the allocation of multiple centres (in different cities) for the same paper on the same day for the Maharashtra public health department exam scheduled on October 24 and 31.The government has outsourced the exam process to Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL), which was previously too blamed for the fiasco as the government had to cancel the exam the first time at the eleventh hour owing to lack of preparations during the last week of September 2021.Within government, there’s a blame game and Tope is already pointing fingers at the IT department, which comes under none other than Thackeray with Satej Patil being a junior minister. Patil is so far silent while Thackeray has sought to examine credentials of Uttar Pradesh-based firm, which many say does not have the expertise to hold such exercise. Tope has earlier clarified that the health department has a limited role in setting up question papers. The rest of the preparations that include exam centres, hall tickets, seating arrangement, exam supervisor, their training among others was with the outsourced firm with support from the information technology (IT) department.When governments outsource work related to conducting exams to private agencies, the aim is to hold such exercise smoothly, maintain integrity, and ensure fair evaluation without any interference.In this case, neither of the three objectives are being achieved. To hold exams at this level has two parts – first is to fairness at the highest level and second is a logistical part. According to Nyasa executives, it has ‘large’ experience and ‘impeccable record’ of holding exams though it has not reflected in its initial conduct.Last month the firm informed the government at the last moment that they won’t be able to complete the preparations and applicants will have to face difficulties during examinations, those in the establishment had no option but to postpone exams for a few days as there were many discrepancies in the seating arrangement, training of invigilators among others.NCPL, as the government has claimed after facing ire, is part of a list of empanelled firms prepared by the state IT department. As per the procedure, the departments will have to select the firms only from the empanelled list of firms for holding recruitment examinations.Despite the embarrassment, the government continued the same agency to hold the exam.The least the government can do is remove the firm from its list and investigate the matter followed by action as promised by Tope earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-a-tale-of-exam-with-unending-woes-101634553870037.html
18-10-2021||Chandigarh||Bidding adieu to tradition of holding farewell parties||Like our birthday, our retirement day is fixed, too. The day we join service, we are made to remember the year of our retirement. Often, while filling forms, applying for loans, for passports or for permission to travel abroad, we have to fill the date of our retirement and it becomes just a routine. The feeling of retirement sinks in only on the day one actually retires, the day our professional colleagues gather around over a cup of tea to give us a send-off. During the course of my career, I have been a part of these farewells for 35 years. I remember, I was just 26, when I first got an opportunity to be a part of a retirement party. Those were the days when retirement parties stretched long as it was a part of the tradition of our college. With the principal seated on a higher platform along with the staff secretary, the vice-principal and the retiree and his/her family members and a huge gathering of almost 300 staff members, listening to one speaker after the other, some friends, some colleagues from the department and some speakers who volunteered to the staff secretary to be included in the list. We, the fledgling newcomers not fully acclimatised to the traditions and not attached with the retiree, passed time with much difficulty. At the back of the mind were the small kids we had left at home and a worry for their welfare. Hence, in spite of our physical presence, we were mentally absent and just waiting for the speeches to end and rush for a delayed lunch. That was when I was in my late twenties. Gradually with time, the professional life in college and the people started getting the better of me. I started listening earnestly and attentively to what was said for the retiree and sometimes got emotionally charged when the retiree unfolded his life’s journey. And then as I became senior, my involvement in the parties was looked up to, sometimes I was even asked to say a few words for the retiree as the list of speakers started declining and my oratory skills started getting recognised. In retrospect when I think of those functions now, there is a clear-cut graph of these parties becoming less emotional and more formal. A new protocol was devised for the farewell functions and not more than two or three speakers were sanctioned to say “a few words” for the retiree. Gradually, it became an established norm and those who were to speak were given an instruction to watch the time limit does not exceed 10 minutes. The natural flow was regimented, and the retirement parties became less spontaneous. Then a time came when it didn’t even remain a formality. A retiree’s popularity was measured by the number of staff members who attended the party. The show of courtesy ended and people who had any grudge against the retiree, showed it by boycotting the party. And with this, the charm of the retirement party was lost, and many retirees for the fear of a showdown refused to take the party, fearing absenteeism, in front of his/her family. All traditions debunked, a post-modern era set in when the farewell party, for the host and for the guest lost its sheen because of new ideologies and clash of viewpoints. The way grand narratives are questioned, and traditions subverted, the college became a political arena, the microcosm of what is happening worldwide. Liberal humanism gave way to the rise of separatist tendencies, an uneasy coexistence of several ‘political parties’. And then the Covid-19 pandemic ended it all. Human existence locked down in virtual medium bid adieu digitally. When institutions reopened, goodbyes were conducted with a handful of mandatory officials with masked faces stationed at a two-metre distance on the pretext of safety protocol. It was an end of farewells as we knew them. The writer retired as principal of Mohindra College, Patiala.

Badal had pointed to the meeting earlier between Channi and Union home minister Amit Shah and alleged that the CM had given his nod to the move during the meeting.Further, the CM also assured that a special session of the state assembly would be convened if it becomes necessary. “All Punjabis must be united in this fight for upholding Punjab's constitutional dignity and federal autonomy. If necessary, we shall convene a special session of Vidhan Sabha to address this matter,” Channi tweeted.

I warn @officeofssbadal not to misuse this sensitive issue for vested political ambitions.Earlier on October 5, Channi met with Shah and urged him to seal the international border citing concerns about illegal trafficking of drugs and weapons from across the border. It was this meeting which Badal had pointed to and criticised the CM over the Centre’s decision. The SAD chief also criticised the Centre for the move which he described was an “outright attack on the federal structure” and said it had to be dealt with above the partisan lines.The Union government has allowed the BSF a wider jurisdiction inside border states to search, seize and arrest within a larger 50kms stretch from the international border. Previously the limit was set at 15km, several news agencies reported. Along with Punjab, West Bengal, another border state, has also been vocal about its criticism to the move, while Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma has welcomed it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/extension-of-bsf-s-jurisdiction-punjab-cm-warns-sad-chief-badal-to-not-misuse-sensitive-issue-for-political-ambitions-101634551505926.html

18-10-2021||Delhi||Cloudy sky with light rain predicted in Delhi, air quality improves||Delhi is likely to see a generally cloudy sky with light rain and thundershowers on Monday according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) forecast. The minimum temperature in the city on Monday is likely to be at 20 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature is predicted to reach 29 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature on Sunday was 23.5 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal, while the maximum temperature was 30.4 degrees Celsius -- two degrees below normal.Sunday’s rainfall has led to improvement in Delhi’s air quality, which was in the “satisfactory” category on Monday morning with 94 AQI or air quality index at 7am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI in the national capital was 298, at the higher-end of the “poor” category. The prominent pollutant was PM2.5-- particles that have diameter less than 2.5 micrometres. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Also Read: Delhi govt’s ‘Red Light on, Gaadi off’ campaign to begin from todayOn Sunday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the very poor category with PM2.5 as the lead pollutant. Lower wind speed and low mixing layer height were inhibiting dispersion along with moderate stubble intrusion. However, now that wind direction is mainly from the eastern side and moderate rain is expected, AQI will improve significantly and touch moderate category for tomorrow and then again degrade to poor category for the next 2 days. The SAFAR effective fire count was observed as 815 but as winds were not favourable and rain was expected, the stubble contribution today was likely to be just 2%, which is down from 14% yesterday.”According to Safar, the local wind speed will be the factor determining the city’s air quality. The local wind speed and ventilation is in moderate category while there is no external dust intrusion in Delhi’s air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-see-cloudy-sky-with-light-rain-air-quality-improves-101634531788722.html

The campaign, which tells commuters to switch off the engines of their vehicles as soon as they stop at a red light, was first introduced by the government last year. This year, the first phase of the campaign will run for a month till November 18.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had said last week that the campaign will take place in two shifts - from 8am-2pm and then 2pm-8pm.According to Delhi government's plan, the campaign will be carried out at 100 traffic intersections spread across 13 police districts. The government also plans to deploy 2,500 civil defence volunteers for its effective implementation. These volunteers will work as ‘Paryavaran Marshals’ and will distribute pamphlets having details about chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s appeal to make the campaign a success.While announcing the date for this year’s 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign, Kejriwal on October 12 urged commuters not to take their vehicles once a week and rather travel on the metro, bus or share vehicles with others.Pointing out that the campaign was very successful last year, Kejriwal appealed to teachers, lawyers, office workers and trade union people in Delhi for their cooperation.Citing research from Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA), he said that switching vehicles off at red light can reduce pollution by 13% cent and ₹2500 crores can be saved per annum.The Delhi CM also appealed to the residents to download the Green Delhi app and complain against the industry or vehicle that is causing pollution. The app was launched last year to fight air pollution. “If you see pollution anywhere in Delhi -a truck causing air pollution, any industry that is causing pollution, waste being burnt- you can complain through the app. Our team will reach the spot and stop the source of pollution,” Kejriwal said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-s-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign-to-begin-from-today-101634517906573.html

18-10-2021||Chandigarh||Gross building violations at Victoria Heights: Mohali ADC||Probing into the building violations at Victoria Heights in Peer Muchalla, Zirakpur, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Pooja Sayal has found several irregularities.On October 7, Hindustan Times had highlighted that the residential project’s three 14-storey towers have come up without adequate setback space between them for movement of fire tenders in case of emergency.Following this, ADC Sayal had visited the project site and sought a report from the executive officer (EO) of the Zirakpur municipal council.“There are several building violations at the site. The MC EO’s report also substantiates this. I have also sought the original layout plan to determine whether there are more anomalies,” said Sayal.Besides not leaving setback space, the builder, Fortune Multitech Private Limited, has constructed 15 shops at the place earmarked for a park and parking area. The shops have come up without the consent of allottees or a change of land use permission from the competent authority. The builder has also increased the number of flats from 396 to 476, without any approval under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act. The society’s residents’ welfare association (RWA), comprising allottees who are awaiting possession, have already approached the Punjab and Haryana high court in this regard.“Between 2011 and 2018, the developer got the layout plans changed thrice. However, the allottees were never kept in loop,” said an MC official, not wishing to be named.Harish Gupta, president of the Zirakpur Builders Associations, said, “We will be holding a meeting of all builders in Zirakpur and advise them to follow the building norms.”Notably, in August, the Supreme Court had ordered demolition of the realty firm’s twin 40-storey Supertech towers in Noida for violating building norms. In its order, the top court had said that it was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida Authority and the developer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gross-building-violations-at-victoria-heights-mohali-adc-101634506465098.html

Considered the best batsman of the Oman team, Singh also idolises Indian cricketer Dhawan.“I am a huge fan of Shikhar paaji. I love celebrating like that on the ground. It brings out the Punjabi in me. Also, it was amazing to go out there and hit those shots for the team,” said Singh, who migrated with his mother and three siblings to Muscat in 2003 to join his father, Gurmail Singh.“My family belongs to the Ramgarhia community and has been involved in carpentry for generations. I am the first and only sportsperson in our entire clan. I feel so proud and privileged. Cricket is my passion and I want to do well for Oman in the ongoing T20 World Cup as we are the co-hosts also,” said Singh, who hit 62-ball 107 runs against Nepal last month. It was the second-fastest ODI ton by an associate batsman, Ireland’s Kevin O’Brian being the fastest.Singh’s was also the highest T20 individual score by any cricketer from Oman. He works with Khimji Ram Das company and looks after the corporate affairs apart from playing for Oman. His father works in the Oman police department’s carpentry section as a foreman and will retire in December. Praising 32-year-old Singh’s knock, Oman captain Zeeshan Maqsood said after the match, “Jatinder is a very important player of our team. He is the backbone of the team. The way he scored 73 runs against PNG shows his confidence and skills. He is going to play a crucial role in the upcoming games too. We take on Bangladesh in the next match. They are a test-playing nation. We want to give our best and record a win.” Hosts Oman chased the 130-run target set by the PNG in just 13.2 overs, courtesy Singh’s 42-ball-knock and his opening partner Aqib Ilyas’s 50 not-out off 43 balls. Singh hit seven fours and four sixes. The partnership between Ilyas and Singh is the highest partnership in the T20 World Cup for an Associate Nation.Oman will now play Bangladesh in their next Group B match on Tuesday.“Cricket has grown by leaps and bounds in Oman. We have better facilities and an experienced coach like Sri Lankan great Duleep Mendis. Our preparations are good for the T20 World Cup. We will put up a competitive show against Bangladesh and are hoping for a win,” concluded Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-jatinder-singh-sets-up-oman-s-win-over-png-in-t20-world-cup-101634506413777.html

A visit to the Phase 7 hospital, which is housed in a run-down building, revealed patients being asked to visit government hospitals in Chandigarh even for minor injuries, even though ESI has no tie-up with them for cashless treatment.Doctors don’t have adequate equipment to conduct even minor procedures and most of the medicines prescribed are also not stocked, forcing workers to pay for them outside.“There is no facility for laboratory tests or ultrasound either. Also, the centres operate only from 8am to 2pm,” said Jasbir Singh, chairman, Labour Laws Committee, Mohali Industries Association.He said as per the norms, the insured workers should be referred only to empanelled hospitals under the ESI scheme for cashless treatment, but doctors were sending workers to the Phase-6 civil hospital in Mohali; and GMCH, Sector 32, GMSH, Sector 16, or PGIMER in Chandigarh. The workers have no option but to spend money from their pockets and have to wait for months to get reimbursement.No driver for rickety ambulanceThe only driver for the ambulance retired over five years ago, but the authorities never filled the position since. As such, in case of emergency, patients struggle to make their own arrangements after being referred to other hospitals. The ambulance itself is also in a poor condition, with worn out tyres and damaged battery.On October 15, member of Parliament Manish Tewari had written a letter to Bhupender Yadav, Union minister, ministry of labour and employment, to highlight the abysmal conditions at the ESI health facilities.When contacted, Dr GB Singh, director, health services (ESI), admitted that there were shortcomings. “I have taken charge last week only. I will be visiting the hospital in Mohali and file a proposal to improve the conditions as per requirement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ailing-mohali-workers-suffer-amid-poor-state-of-esi-hospital-101634506407936.html

To meet the rising demand, the hospital authorities are requesting residents to donate blood and platelets.Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, said, “With dengue cases rising, more and more patients suffering from fever are getting admitted to the hospital everyday. The severe dengue patients require platelets and on average, 40 bags of platelets are being used everyday. Besides, 25 units of single-donor platelets, also known as apheresis platelets, are required per day.”He added, “Since the shelf life of platelets is limited, fresh donations are usually preferred. Mostly, the hospital tries to provide platelets from the blood bank, but attendants of patients also donate them.”Dr Suman Singh, director of health services, UT, said, “Transfusion of platelets depends on the severity of the case. At Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, around seven to 10 transfusions are done every two days.” She added that the health department had enough platelet kits and fresh orders had already been placed, but the demand was rising by the day due to spike in dengue cases in Punjab and neighbouring states.“At PGIMER too, the demand has increased, but high number of blood donors are helping meet the platelets’ requirement. We are also organising more blood donation camps,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).However, even though hospitals authorities claim that they have adequate stock, patients across the tricity have been reaching out to social media seeking help.

He also exhorted the media to refrain from tarnishing the image of Sikhs by showing incomplete aspects of the incident.“There have been more than 400 incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab in the last 5-6 years. Not a single culprit was given an exemplary punishment as to heal the wounds of the Sikhs. For the Sikhs, nothing is above Guru Granth Sahib. As the investigation agencies have been unable to expose the conspiracy by calling the culprits mentally ill, it has hurt the Sikhs’ trust in the law,” he said.Citing the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights drafted by the United Nations, the jathedar said that “any person goes on a violent path only if the rule of law fails to protect his human rights”. “The failure to bring justice to the Sikhs in incidents of disrespect to Guru Granth Sahib paved the way for the Singhu incident,” he claimed. An independent agency, he added, should probe all aspects of the incident so that the truth is revealed. Clumsy attempts were being made to provoke the sentiments of the Sikhs by desecrated their holy book, he said. “These incidents can be a trick to fuel communal and inter-caste tension in Punjab. The Haryana and Punjab police should investigate the incident impartially but should not harass any innocent Sikh,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/singhu-lynching-a-result-of-failure-of-rule-of-law-says-akal-takht-jathedar-101634502864271.html

The chief minister said the state government has set a target of providing employment at least to a member of every family of the state by 2025 and to achieve this goal, no stone will be left unturned for creating new dimensions of self-employment. “On the one hand youth are getting employment opportunities from these stores, on the other, people will get pure, certified and quality goods at affordable rates near their homes,” Khattar said. The chief minister said such a store will be opened in rural and urban segments having a population above 3,000 and 10,000, respectively. People will get direct and indirect benefits from these stores. Apart from MSMEs, small industrial units and cooperative sector units, quality products prepared by the women’s self help groups will be made available at the stores at a price lower than that in the market, he said. The chief minister added that all the goods will be sold through computerised system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-launches-har-hith-retail-stores-101634502205544.html

18-10-2021||Chandigarh||OP Chautala hits Ellenabad campaign trail for son Abhay||Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) patriarch and former Haryana chief minister OP Chautala launched campaign for the October 30 Ellenabad bypoll in favour of his younger son Abhay Singh Chautala, who had quit the seat in favour of farmers’ protest against three farm laws on January 27 this year. Chautala Sr had also won the seat in 2009, but he vacated it as he had also won from Uchana Kalan . In the 2010 bypoll, his younger son Abhay won from here. Abhay represented Ellenabad twice in 2014 and 2019 assembly polls. INLD had never lost from here since 1996. Travelling in a modified vehicle given shape of a chariot, Chautala visited 12 villages and slammed the BJP-JJP coalition government while interacting with the voters. He said amid the mustard cultivation season, farmers are being made to wait for hours for di-ammonium phosphate (DAP). “Due to anti-farmer policies of this government, farmers are forced to sell their paddy and bajra crops at price lower than the minimum support price (MSP). Abhay had resigned from this seat in protest against the three farm laws. Our family has a special affection for the voters of Ellenabad. Once our candidate wins from here, many leaders of the coalition government will switch sides,” he added. Bypoll crucial for INLD, Chautala The October 30 bypoll is very crucial for the INLD and OP Chautala himself. A win from here will boost the morale of INLD workers. After a vertical split in the INLD following a feud in the Chautala family, the INLD had won only the Ellenabad seat in 2019 polls and its breakaway faction Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) won 10. JJP leader Dushyant Chautala is now the deputy chief minister. Retired political science professor from Bhiwani government college, Anant Ram, said the Ellenabad bypoll means the most for the INLD. “Abhay’s win will underline his and his father OP Chautala’s grip especially in Sirsa district. If he loses, the message is clear that even his father’s presence makes no difference. This bypoll will decide the future of the INLD and Abhay,” he added. Three generations of Chautala clan toiling To ensure Abhay’s fourth consecutive win from Ellenabad, three generations of his family are making efforts to turn the tide in his favour. Abhay’s younger son Arjun Chautala has been visiting the villages where his father is scheduled to address the meetings the next day. His elder son Karan Chautala is accompanying his grandfather OP Chautala. Sunaina Chautala, wife of Abhay’s cousin Ravi Chautala, is taking care of the women folk in villages. Abhay Chautala said both Congress and BJP nominees want to win this by-election using money power but the Ellenabad voters have self respect and reject them outrightly. “After seeing the canvassing, I can say that I am going to win this by-poll by breaking my own victory margin of more than 85,000 votes. This election is a referendum on three farm laws,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/op-chautala-hits-ellenabad-campaign-trail-for-son-abhay-101634501964086.html

Nazma’s family had complained to the police and a compromise was reached. However, even after she got pregnant, the domestic violence continued. Meanwhile, Afsar planned her murder with a cousin and his friends. The case was transferred to CIA-1 and they found that it wasn’t an accident, but a murder,” Goyal said in a statement.Crime branch in-charge Rakesh Kumar said the suspect was arrested on Friday and presented before a court the next day that sent him to five-day remand.“An accident case was lodged at Farakpur police station, but now, relevant sections will be added to the FIR.

18-10-2021||Delhi||Migrants who left Delhi in second Covid-19 wave returning||Transactions recorded under the ‘one nation one ration card’ (ONORC) scheme — notified in July — have been going up consistently every month, indicating that migrant workers, who left the capital in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19 earlier this year, are returning, said senior Delhi government officials.Goods and services tax (GST) and value-added tax (VAT) collections are also up since July, suggesting that economic activities have gone up with a phased scaling down of lockdown restrictions.“Other than schools, prohibition on large gatherings, and maximum cap on guests in certain industries such as restaurants, bars, banquet halls, etc, are over. More migrant workers are now returning to the city each month,” said a senior official in the Delhi government on condition of anonymity.The ONORC scheme allows people to avail of subsidised food grains under the National Food Security Act from fair price shops in towns they live irrespective of where their ration cards are registered. Government records show that when the scheme was rolled out in July, there were 29,569 transactions at the 2,000-odd fair price shops in the city. This went up to 38,173 in August and 85,327 in September. This month, transactions have already crossed 46,000. Officials in the government’s food and civil supplies department said, over the next one week, it may exceed the 100,000-mark for the first time.The number of ration cardholders from other states who reside in Delhi is estimated by the government as 200,000, which translates to around 1 million beneficiaries (assuming each cardholder feeds four other mouths).These are over and above the 1.78 million ration cardholders and 7.2 million beneficiaries registered in the national capital.Going by Census 2011 data, around 40% of the 7.2 million are also believed to be migrants from other states who have settled in Delhi over time and got ration cards registered here.“Trade, commerce and industrial activities have picked up and it reflects in the GST and VAT collections in the first two quarters. That usually leads to higher labour demand,” said the first senior official cited above.Government records showed that GST collections in Delhi witnessed a decrease from ₹2,325.64 crore recorded in April to ₹991.05 crore in May and further down to ₹968.4 crore in June. But they went up to ₹1,584.75 crore in July, further up to ₹1,713.96 crore in August and ₹1,976.82 crore in September.VAT collections, too, reflect a similar trend. They went down from ₹417.01 crore in April to ₹358.17 crore in May and further down to ₹207.35 crore in June. But they started to go up after that— ₹440.03 crore in July, ₹557.7 crore in August and ₹565.92 crore in September, records showed.“We learnt that the government was scaling down restrictions and economic activities. But we did not have the confidence to return till September. Now it seems safe. I have a job in a factory. Thanks to the ration card scheme, we can avail subsidised food grain in Delhi,” said Rajesh Prajapati, a migrant from Bihar.Rakesh Kumar, a migrant from eastern Uttar Pradesh said, “Big cities like Delhi lack safety nets for poor people like us. The ration scheme comes as a major relief because our jobs are not very secure.”While the government had started with a phased relaxation process of the lockdown since June, HT had then published a series of articles on how migrant workers chose to stay put for a while for reasons ranging from Covid-19 cases in their own families, medical costs draining savings, lack of security net and job assurance in the city, and fears of a potential third wave of the pandemic.“These concerns have clearly reduced now. By Diwali, industries are expected to operate at 90% capacity and above. Labour demand is increasing. So, a lot of migrant workers are coming back to the city,” said Neeraj Sehgal, general secretary of the welfare body at Delhi’s most prominent industrial area in Mayapuri.Government reports said that more than 807,000 migrant workers left Delhi in buses they boarded from the interstate bus terminals in the first four weeks of the complete lockdown starting April 19 this year, that came after a record surge in Covid-19 infections.The actual number is likely to be higher because the city government did not maintain records of migrant workers who left the city in trains and other means in the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/transactions-under-one-ration-card-scheme-up-signals-return-of-migrants-101634500179573.html

The area around the Old Sabzi Mandi was the worst hit.Serpentine queues of vehicles were seen on roads leading to prominent spots in the city. A large number of cops were deployed to regulate traffic. Besides, police were deployed on the elevated road near the Clock Tower to provide a bird’s-eye view to the cops deployed on the ground for the shobha yatra.However, Covid protocols were simply ignored during the occasion. The traffic police, which remains proactive in challaning commuters for not wearing masks, preferred to look the other way.The roads leading to Clock Tower, Domoria Bridge, Mata Rani Chowk, Field Gunj and near the Chand Cinema witnessed massive traffic jams.The lack of coordination between the police and ‘nagar kirtan’ organisers also contributed to the traffic jam. Commuters were caught unawares as the police gave no prior information about the yatra.“It has been more than 30 minutes and I could hardly reach the Jagraon bridge in my car,” said a commuter.Caught in the traffic, some opted to park their vehicles at the railway station and walk to their destinations.Women were the worst-hit as besides being caught in the gridlock, they were harassed and were pushed and showed.The chaos also led to pollution and unnecessary loss of fuel as vehicles remained stranded or moved at a snail’s pace. Those who had to deal the most with pollution were two-wheeler riders and pedestrians.Gurpreet Kaur, while trying to calm down her five-year-old son who had suffered a bout of cough due to pollution, said: “My son is suffering from bronchitis, and I was taking him to the doctor. But we are now stuck in a traffic jam. I don’t know where to go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shobha-yatra-throws-city-traffic-out-of-gear-commuters-a-harried-lot-101634500050217.html

According to the police, the accused had bludgeoned Deepak to death with a stick following a petty issue of asking for a passage to cross. The accused have been identified as Deepak Sharma, 25, of Uttar Pradesh, who is living at Prem Nagar in Giaspura, Munish Kumar, 23, of A-one Colony of Bhattian Kalan and Ashish Pandey, 22, of Rasila Nagar, Jamalpur. The police produced the accused before the court on Sunday which remanded them to one-day police custody for questioning.

As they reached near Decent School, Bhamian, they found the accused, who were in an inebriated condition, had blocked the passage by parking their motorcycle. The JCP said that Deepak had asked the accused to give them a passage to cross. The accused started abusing them. After Deepak objected to it and challenged them, the accused gave them a chase and intercepted them near the school. The JCP added that the accused took a stick and hit Deepak on his head. Badal and Sonu fled the spot to call their friends. When they came back, they found Deepak lying injured and rushed him to a hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.

With the closure of these messes, these players were largely struggling to fulfil their basic dietary requirements.Ravinder Singh, district sports officer, Ludhiana, said only those players who were also getting an education along with their sports would get the diet funded by the state governmentHe had sought a list of such players from sports centres and local academies who were eligible to get money for their diet each day.There are two categories of players -- day scholars and residential players.Day scholars, who return home after playing their sport, will get ₹100 each day for the diet. However, residential players, who avail hostel facilities, will get ₹200 for their diet per day.“It is essential for the players to study as well. They need to strike a perfect balance between sports and education as that will groom them well and help them to lead a successful life. According to the government’s policy, only those players who are in schools or pursuing higher education are eligible to get funds for the diet from the government. We have asked for the lists of such players and, accordingly, will seek funds for them from the director, sports, Punjab,” Singh said.He added that messes were likely to reopen this week.Meanwhile, players are excited to get funds for their basic diet again.Rohit Kumar, 16, son of a labourer from Kotkapura in Faridkot, who is also a national NBA player in the junior category and trains at the District Basketball Academy here, said, “It got really difficult for my father to manage the budget for my sports and education. I couldn’t get a non-vegetarian diet which is really essential for the overall development of a player. It’s a big relief for many players like me who were waiting to get these funds again. Now I will at least have eggs and non-vegetarian food daily which will help me to match the international standards”.He added that so far, his coaches from the academy were helping him to get the basic diet at least.Sports centres in the state, which had been shut down to contain the pandemic, were allowed to reopen from October 11.With this, hostels of sports centres in the district will also open for the players.Another senior official said a few parents were still hesitant in sending their child back to the hostels of these sports centres fearing Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/finally-messes-to-reopen-at-sports-stadiums-in-ludhiana-101634500046061.html
18-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana’s air quality dips as farmers set stubble on fire||With the onset of the paddy harvesting season, the air quality index (AQI) is also beginning to deteriorate. The AQI that was between 50 and 70 in September has suddenly begun to worsen. As the district has witnessed nearly 200 stubble-burning cases so far, the air quality deteriorated to 205 on October 12 and later on, the AQI remained over 100, with particulate matter 2.5 being a prominent pollutant. The agriculture department claims that the number of stubble-burning cases is less as compared to last year, but the projection of pollution level shows otherwise. According to Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head, department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, currently, the airspeed is less than 2 km per hour. In such a situation, the suspended particulate matter in the air gets locked at and leads to an increase in the pollution level. She said as the rain was expected in a few days, the mercury was expected to dip. “Under such weather when the cold conditions set in and moisture levels are high, vehicular, industrial and smoke caused by stubble burning are going to increase the pollution level,” said Dr Kaur. Chief agriculture officer of the district Narinder Singh Benipal said in order to encourage stubble management, farmers were being given machinery free of cost. He said after the use, these machines could be returned to cooperative societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-air-quality-dips-as-farmers-set-stubble-on-fire-101634500044251.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Cops find ‘safe, profitable’ way to store seized cash||In order to ensure that cash seized from different crime spots remains safe from termites, rats and potential theft from the maalkhana (store room where case property is kept) at police stations, the Delhi Police are considering to put the money in a fixed deposit account, officers aware of the matter said.The officials said that a circular with directions detailing the measures to the city’s police stations and other investigation units such as the special cell and the crime branch for putting seized money into fixed deposit accounts in nationalised banks is likely to be issued this week.Apart from cash, jewellery may also be deposited in the banks, a senior police officer privy to the development said.The proposed move follows the order of a local court that accepted the application by an investigating officer (IO) and station house officer (SHO) of the Palam Village police station, and allowed them to transfer ₹96,340 in cash from the maalkhana to a fixed deposit account to be opened in the name of the police station. The money was seized during a raid on a gambling racket.In its order, the court appreciated the suggestion, and said, “…considering that substantial interest can be accrued on the monies if deposited in FDRs during the pendency of the case, and even until the District Nazir takes up the case property for disposal. The said monies would stand its worth if circulated in the economy rather than being sealed and kept in maalkhana. And further, the interest accrued can be used to enrich government treasury or reward the informer as the provision of Act (Delhi Police Gambling Act, 1955) suggests.”Buoyed by the court’s appreciation, the police station has now decided to approach the concerned courts, seeking permission for putting in bank around ₹8 lakh that were seized in nearly 40 different cases, mostly of gambling, and have been kept in the police station’s maalkhana for the past several years.“Once the circular is issued, officers of the other police stations may also approach the courts for saving the seized currency notes into fixed deposit, and the receipts can be produced during the court proceedings instead of the cash. Transporting cash between courts and police stations is also risky,” the officer added.Although data regarding the exact amount in cash and jewellery items kept in the maalkhanas at 210 police stations and other investigation unit across the city was not readily available with the city police, senior officers said that it could be in crores. Keeping such case property secure and intact for the perusal of the courts is the responsibility of the maalkhana in-charge.“There have been instances where seized cash property, including cash and documents, were misappropriated or were nibbled away by rats or termites in the maalkhanas. Being the custodian of the case property, the some maalkhana in-charge have even faced departmental action for such misappropriation. Keeping such money in a fixed deposit account would help address these problems,” said a second police officer, who asked not be named.In April-May 2008, smuggled gold biscuits worth lakhs of rupees that were seized and kept in the maalkhana at the Karol Bagh police station went missing, prompting the then police chief YS Dadwal issue an order, directing all police stations to divide the space in the maalkhana for miscellaneous property and costly items.“A similar misappropriation of seized cash property was reported from a police station in outer Delhi and brought to the notice of the top brass, That’s also a reason that the decision to deposit the seized cash as fixed deposit in banks is being taken,” said a second police officer, requesting anonymity.According to the rules, the seized money is transferred to the government’s treasury after the disposal of the case by the court concerned, and the arrested persons are convicted by the court.In case the alleged accused are acquitted and they claim the money, the amount is returned to them following the court’s directions.Since the disposal of the cases takes time, the seized currency notes are kept in the maalkhanas of the police stations until the court issues order for their disposal through the district Nazirs, the officer added.Nazir refers to a court official who is in-charge of the treasury, stamps and processes the goods, evidences and vehicles collected from the police investigators. Nazirs also issues summons on court orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-find-safe-profitable-way-to-store-seized-cash-101634499789356.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The baingi walla||It’s so quaint, so different from the rest of the street blab. This tinkling of Vijay’s ghanti, his bell. In fact, his entire establishment is sublimely quaint, like an echo emanating belatedly from a vanished sound.Vijay’s brass bell is heralding his arrival to whoever cares to notice as he makes his way through the bazar. He’s shouldering a heap of sohan papdi. The mithais are gently bobbing on a paraat (platter) that is dangling by a rope tied to a wooden staff perched on Vijay’s shoulder. This is balanced on the other side by a hefty metal box attached to a similar rope. The whole contraption resembles ‘insaaf ka taraju,’ the scale of justice. Vijay says he made it himself. “I don’t know the sheheri (city) name for it but I call this baingi.”Watching Vijay walk with his baingi is evocative of a celebrated sequence in Satyajit Ray’s film Pather Panchali in which a similar mithai seller ambles along with his yoked sweets, greedily followed by two children and a dog. But that was a black-and-white village in Bengal. This is a 21st century lane in the Milleneum City of Gurugram. Vijay has been selling sohan papdi in the area for more than 15 years. His extremely expressive face is frequently flashing a smile so infectious that each one of the lane’s vegetable sellers is flashing an equally glowing smile back at him.Vijay’s so-called baingi is more than a decade old but has become so rare these days that it might as well be handed over to the National Museum. The sweet seller laughs, agreeing that “even I don’t see anyone else using it.” A UP native, he recalls his childhood in the village in Aligarh where itinerant hawkers such as snake charmers and honey sellers routinely appeared “carrying this kind of thing.” Explaining that the baingi isn’t cumbersome to manage, Vijay says that he stops whenever he gets tired, and frees himself briefly from its weight. “It was this kind of palki in which Shravan Kumar carried his blind parents for the pilgrimage,” he says, referring to an anecdote in the Ramayan.The mithai seller continues to walk ahead, ringing his bell. And yes, the sohan papdi is delicious, which is sourced from a mithai shop. You may spot Vijay around the subzi mandi in Sadar Bazar. Sightings of baingi carriers (with slightly varying kinds of self-made baingis) have also been recorded in Old Delhi, such as the market lane that goes past Jama Masjid’ gate no. 2, as well as the alley running behind Jagat Cinema (see photo).

18-10-2021||Delhi||Man who faked abduction held for ₹10 crore fraud after five years||Five years after his family reported his abduction, a 48-year-old businessman, wanted by the economic offences wing (EOW) in a ₹10-crore cheating and forgery case, was arrested last week from Indirapuram, near Ghaziabad -- less than 10km from east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar police station, where the kidnapping case was registered in 2016, police said.The accused, Manoj Jain, his two sons and his wife, who was a co-accused in the case, were living with him in the ground floor house at Indirapuram since 2018, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram. The DCP added that a reward of ₹25,000 was recently announced on the arrest of Jain.“Between his arrest and shifting base from Krishna Nagar to Indirapuram, Jain became a prominent private financer for shopkeepers in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara. Some people in his new neighbourhood knew him as Amit, and for many others he was still Manoj Jain. He bought the new house in 2018 in his son’s name for around ₹50 lakh,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.The DCP said Jain and his brother, Manish, ran paper trading and garments businesses from their offices in Chawri Bazar in old Delhi and Gandhi Nagar in east Delhi.Sanjay Kaul, who was a family friend of the Jains, started investing in their business when the Jain brothers convinced him that they will pay him high returns. Kaul, who was running losses in his business, invested nearly ₹10 crore, investigators said.However, after paying handsome returns initially, the Jains stopped paying, and then refused to return Kaul’s investment. Kaul filed a police complaint in 2015 and named Manoj and Manish Jain, their wives and mother, said an officer from the anti-auto theft squad (AATS) that arrested Jain last week. He added that during initial probe, the police found that there were at least four more who alleged cheating by the Jain brothers.“When the Jains found that a case would be registered, and they may be arrested, they cooked up an abduction story. In January 2016, Manish filed a missing person’s complaint regarding his brother Manoj at the Krishna Nagar police station,” said the officer, adding that Manish apprehended that his brother has been abducted.In his complaint to the police, Manish said his brother (Manoj) went to pay ₹15 lakh to a client but he neither reached office nor returned home. Among other suspects, the police also questioned those who were allegedly cheated by the Jain brothers. But over the years, the police could not find any clue.In March 2017, a cheating and forgery case was registered against the Jains on the orders of a local court, and the investigation was transferred to the EOW. However, by that time all accused named in the complaint by Kaul had gone untraceable. After a while, wives of the Jain brothers and their mother got interim bail from the court. However, the Jain brothers remained absconding, the officer added.“Jain has confessed that his fake abduction was part of the family’s plan to avoid returning the money to the investors and evade legal action. Before shifting to Indirapuram, he lived in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. We are looking for his brother Manish who will be booked for filing a fake kidnapping case, besides his involvement in cheating investors,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-who-faked-abduction-held-for-10-crore-fraud-after-five-years-101634499063037.html

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in the same prospect today, laid the foundation stone of a new hospital with a capacity of 1,430 beds at Shalimar Bagh. Being constructed at a cost of ₹275 crores, this hospital will be ready in six months,” the Delhi government said in a statement.“Earlier it used to cost ₹1 crore to build a normal hospital bed, but our government is spending only ₹20 lakh to create an intensive care unit bed. Seven new such hospitals (including the one in Shalimar Bagh) are to be built in different areas of Delhi by the health department of Delhi government in six months,” Kejriwal said, according to the statement.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Shalimar Bagh Vandana Kumari also attended the event.“A new government hospital with 1,430 beds is being built in Shalimar Bagh. In the time of Covid, the whole world has understood the need for medical facilities. I would like to congratulate the people of Delhi on the fact that their government has been working constantly to strengthen the medical facilities of the city since day one,” the chief minister said.‘Bolstering health care infra to tackle Covid-19’He said that as a responsible government they are taking all steps needed to face any possible “third wave” of the coronavirus pandemic.“If there is a third wave of Covid-19 at any point, then as a responsible government, we are taking all important steps needed. Just in the month of April, when the second wave of Covid-19 came, the hospitals had the biggest shortage of oxygen and ICU beds. In this view, the Delhi government has taken a big step. The Delhi government is going to build seven new hospitals in different areas of Delhi, which will have a total capacity of 6,800 beds, and all these seven hospitals will be ready within six months. I think it will probably be a world record that within six months seven hospitals with a capacity of 6,800 beds will be ready.”The chief minister also said that the government will develop and implement an international standard system for medical care and facilities, and mentioned his government’s plan to implement the Health Information Management System (HIMS).“Within the next one-and-a-half year, every citizen of Delhi will have their own health card. Whether poor or rich, all the data of their health will be on the computer. The person will not have to carry any slip. They can go to any hospital, all the old X-ray reports from his childhood till date, and all the data will be on the computer. You will not need to go anywhere, you will go straight to the doctor and the doctor will be waiting for you. Whoever has a health card in his hand, his entire treatment will be free,” Kejriwal said.Health minister Jain tweeted, “Delhi government is going to build another state-of-the-art hospital for the people of Delhi. Its foundation was laid by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in Shalimar Bagh today. The construction work of this hospital with a capacity of 1,430 beds will be completed in the next 6 months.”During the event, a ‘havan’ was also performed and Kejriwal along with Jain participated in the ritual according to traditions and unveiled a commemorative stone plaque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-lays-foundation-for-1-4k-bed-shalimar-bagh-hospital-101634498131618.html

18-10-2021||Other||Uttarakhand forest deptt starts using DNA testing to deal with challenge of identifying ‘man-eater’ leopards||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand forest department has started DNA testing of faecal matter of leopards, caught after people get killed in their attacks, to ascertain whether the big cat is ‘problematic’ or ‘man-eater’. In the last two months, the department has sent faecal matter of two leopards, caged in Kumaon, for testing to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). On September 23, in an attempt to avoid man-animal conflict, night curfew was clamped in half a dozen villages in Pithoragarh district after an eight-year-old girl was dragged and killed by a leopard in Bajeti village adjoining the district headquarters. After the incident, a cage was set up and a leopard was caught. The test of its faecal matter revealed that it hadn’t consumed human flesh. Later it was released back into forests. In the case of a leopard caught in Nainital on October 9 after a two-year child was killed in a leopard attack a day earlier, the forest officials have sent its faecal matter for DNA testing to check whether it had killed the child. On Saturday, another leopard has been caught from the same area. Uttarakhand chief wildlife warden JS Suhag said that this is for the first time the department has started DNA testing the caged leopards in a major way to ascertain whether they had killed the children. “The testing of stools for human remains, such as hair and bones, helps in establishing whether the leopard has killed a human and eaten flesh or any other body part,” he said, adding that it is also for the first time that nine leopards have been radio-collared in the state. Challenge of checking man-leopard conflict Over 400 people have been killed in leopard attacks since the state was formed in 2000. Human deaths in leopard attacks account for nearly half of the total deaths due to wild animals in the state, reveals data of the state forest department. Wildlife experts say there are many factors due to which it has been difficult to check man-leopard conflict in the state, be it the hilly terrain which provides ample space to leopards to hide to human settlements scattered in hills overlapping with the leopard territories. Difficulties in identifying man-eater leopard Whenever people get killed in leopard attacks, under the pressure of angry villagers, the forest department gives permission for eliminating the problematic leopard and a hunter is roped in to shoot it down. But it is never clear whether the hunters have shot down the actual problematic leopard or another leopard using the same territory. To ensure that a leopard is a man-eater and the same one is hunted, there are options like DNA analysis of its faecal matter that contains traces of human remains, comparison of pugmarks, using camera traps in the area and physically following the leopard trail for a significant period. But the biggest challenge is time. Between angry villagers and the man-eater leopard roaming near humans, the forest department is often under tremendous pressure to act swiftly. Experts say it is easier to track a tiger than a leopard, as leopard moves in vast hilly terrains while tigers generally live in grassy forests. A leopard is very secretive animal and moves around generally in dark, like most felines. So, when a leopard is hunted, it is difficult to know the exact leopard. Also, the territory of a leopard, depending on the food availability, can vary from 10-15 sq km to 35-40 sq km. And they also target pigs, small cattle and dogs found near human settlements. A former senior officer in the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), wishing not to be named, said there are many challenges in identifying a leopard which has attacked or killed a human. “Mostly leopards attack humans accidentally when they come in contact with them. Many times, they attack but they don’t eat their victims. But it is still a good practice to use all available techniques to identify the individual leopard which has killed a human,” he said. ‘DNA testing will help save innocent leopards’ SK Gupta, nodal officer of animal forensics at Wildlife Institute of India (WII), said it is a good thing that the forest department is going for DNA testing of faecal matter of leopards which come into conflict with the humans. “This will also check the killing of innocent leopards under pressure by the locals. Leopards are also territorial and there may be more than one leopard occupying a territory, which may be overlapping with the areas where people live. This is good for the conservation of the leopards,” said Gupta who has been working on the technique of finding human DNA in the faecal matter of carnivores to ascertain whether they have eaten humans.Hunter Lakhpat Singh’s strategyHunter Lakhpat Singh, who has killed 55 man-eater leopards so far, said it is not easy to identify and kill a man-eater leopard, especially when it is moving in the hilly areas. “But there is a pattern in the activities of a man-eater leopard, which helps us to track it down. There is change in its behaviour. It is comparatively not afraid of humans. If it is afraid, it can’t attack humans. Also, mostly man-eater leopards attack between 6 and 8 pm,” Singh said. “When the young children in the villages are out playing, leopards take advantage of fading light. If a leopard is moving after 8 pm, it is generally not a man-eater. Of the 55 man-eater leopards I have shot, most of them happened between 6 and 8 pm. Only in five cases I have shot a man-eater after 8 pm and two during daytime.” On the strategy of killing a man-eater leopard, he said many of them often return to areas where they hunted earlier. He said when he is out to take down a man-eater leopard, he moves with a team of 2 more persons with a rifle and powerful searchlights. “While hunting the man-eater, we use powerful searchlights in the forest areas and it reflects the leopard’s eyes in the darkness which helps us in spotting it. With the searchlights on, the leopard stops in its tracks for some moments which gives us the window to take aim and shoot it down.” Leopard population in state The exact number of leopards in the hill state at present is not clear. But as per the records of the forest department, the last state-wide leopard estimation exercise was conducted in 2008, when the state reported 2,335 leopards. Also, according to The Status of Leopards in India report released in December last year, Uttarakhand reported the maximum number of leopards (839) in tiger habitations among Shivalik hills and Gangetic plains landscape, followed by 316 in Uttar Pradesh and 98 in Bihar. The report had pointed out that “there is an increasing need for corridor connectivity, and improvement of habitat, to reduce interface with humans and thereby reducing the chance of conflict.” Uttarakhand forest deptt’s fresh instructions for checking and dealing with man-leopard conflict In July this year, Uttarakhand Forest department released instructions for checking and dealing with the man-leopard conflict in the Himalayan state. The directions issued stated that quick response teams be deployed in such areas by the officials concerned where leopard movement is spotted and leopard attacks are being reported. After the leopard attacks , the officials concerned should try to understand the circumstances under which the leopards are attacking and come up with measures to check that such incidents don’t occur in the area in future. The officers concerned have also been directed to talk to people in the affected areas and guide them how to save themselves from leopard attacks. In December 2016, the Uttarakhand high court ordered a complete ban on the killing tigers, leopards and panthers that were declared “man-eaters/rogues,” directing the authorities that “the wild animal that pose threat to human life should be captured alive and released in nearby forests or can be kept in zoo temporarily and thereafter be released in its own habitat.” However, the state government moved the Supreme Court and got a stay on the HC order last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttarakhand-forest-deptt-starts-using-dna-testing-to-deal-with-challenge-of-identifying-man-eater-leopards-101634497645441.html

18-10-2021||Lucknow||Heavy rain across Uttar Pradesh; more likely, says weatherman||Lucknow: Several districts across Uttar Pradesh, including Lucknow, recorded heavy flash rain accompanied by strong winds on Sunday afternoon. The adverse weather was caused by western disturbances and cyclonic circulations, officials of the meteorological department said. Similar weather conditions would prevail across Uttar Pradesh on Monday, leading to more rain, the Indian Metrological Department (IMD) warned on Sunday. In Lucknow, heavy rain started after 3:30 pm and continued for two hours. The rain was accompanied by strong winds exceeding 40 kmph. Consequently, trees were uprooted and electricity supply disrupted in several areas. Low-lying area of the city also reported water -logging that led to traffic congestion. “The state recorded an average of 4mm rainfall on Sunday due to low pressure zone caused by western disturbance and lower cyclonic circulations,” said state MeT director JP Gupta. “Similar weather conditions will prevail across Uttar Pradesh till Monday evening,” he added. Very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is likely over west Uttar Pradesh in Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Badaun, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly and Sambhal on Monday. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Lakhimpur Kheri, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Mainpuri, Bijnor, Amroha, Hardoi, Aligarh, Mathura, Agra, Etawah and Auraiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/heavy-rain-across-uttar-pradesh-more-likely-says-weatherman-101634497405559.html
18-10-2021||Lucknow||₹25 lakh cash stolen from Agra police station||Agra Cash worth ₹25 lakh was stolen from the ‘maalkhana’ (goods house) of Jagdishpura police station here on Sunday. Taking a serious note of the security lapse, additional director general (ADG) Agra Zone Rajeev Krishna suspended six policemen, including the station house officer and a sub inspector. “It was a serious lapse, so strong action is being taken and those guilty will be brought to book at the earliest,” said the ADG. “Cash of about ₹25 lakh and 4 kilogrammes of gold were recovered in a criminal case recently worked out. This material and cash was kept in the ‘maalkhana’ of Jagdishpura police station. On Sunday morning, it was found that the cash was missing. There were apprehensions that weapons were also taken away but it was found that they were safe,” he said. “It appears that someone broke into the ‘maalkhana’ last night and took away cash. A case has been registered against unidentified people at Jagdishpura police station and SSP Agra has been asked for a detailed probe. Teams have been constituted to nab the culprit,” he said. “It is a case of negligence and station house officer (SHO) AK Tiwari, sub inspector on night duty Ram Niwas , head clerk and three constables on night duty have been suspended,” the ADG said.

18-10-2021||Delhi||Despite spell of rain, pollution in Delhi gets worse||Despite moderate spells rain of in parts of the city, Delhi’s pollutions level got worse, falling perilously close to the ‘very poor’ zone, with the average air quality index (AQI) reading hitting 298, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), even as officials said they expect the air to get better from Monday. The weather office, meanwhile, said showers are likely to continue on Monday as well.The air quality deteriorated after Saturday, when the AQI was 284, also in the ‘poor’ zone. At 6pm on Sunday, the pollution recordings in at least 11 localities were in the ‘very poor’ zone. These included Alipur, Shadipur, DTU, Punjabi Bagh, Nehru Nagar, Sonia Vihar, Narela, Bawana, Anand Vihar and Najafgarh, according to CPCB data.Pollution levels in Delhi were last worse on June 9 this year, when the AQI hit 305.An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is categorised as ‘poor’, and one between 301 and 400 is categorised as ‘very poor’.IMD data shows that between Saturday evening and Sunday evening, the Safdarjung weather station in New Delhi received 20.2mm rainfall, while the Palam observatory received 1.8mm rain. The forecast said moderate showers are likely to continue in Delhi on Monday as well. Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that spike in bad air was a reflection of the accumulated pollution over the last two days, and that the impact of Sunday’s rain will be visible in an improved AQI on Monday. “The AQI of the day is a 24-hour average. Delhi started receiving rains and easterly winds from Sunday morning and the improvement in pollution levels will be seen in Monday’s average AQI,” said a senior IMD scientist, adding that this will be aided by rainfall, which is expected to continue in parts of Delhi and the National Capital Region on Monday.This improvement, however, will be brief, officials warned. Pollution levels in the city will start rising again, once the western disturbance passes over Delhi and winds start blowing from the northwest — bringing in smoke from paddy residue burning — from October 19. A senior Union environment ministry official said the Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR and adjoining areas will announce measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) once the air quality starts deteriorating again. “We are monitoring the situation closely. The CAQM sub-committee will announce measures depending on the situation,” said the official.The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also said that the contribution of stubble fires in the Capital’s air was down to 2% from 14% on Saturday because of easterly winds on Sunday. On Sunday, 815 stubble fires were reported from parts of Punjab and Haryana, Safar said. “Low wind speed and low mixing layer height were inhibiting dispersion along with moderate stubble intrusion. However, now that the wind direction is mainly from the eastern side and moderate rainfall is also expected to continue, AQI will improve significantly from tomorrow (Monday) and then degrade again for the next two days,” Safar air quality analysis read. Data from the past five years indicates that there was a marginal improvement in air quality in 2019, 2020 and 2021 compared to 2016, 2017 and 2018. The number of poor, severe and very severe days was 168 in 2016; 138 in 2017; 129 in 2018; 114 in 2019; 65 in 2020 and 99 in 2021, the report said. The air quality in Delhi has declined this year compared to 2020, possibly due to the resumption of most economic activities, after the Covid-19 lockdown last year.Between January 1 and October 15 this year there were 189 days in satisfactory (51–100) and moderate (101–200) category and 99 in poor (201–300) very poor (301–400) and severe (>401) category compared to 224 in good, satisfactory and moderate category in 2020 and only 65 in poor, severe and very severe categories according to CPCB data.

18-10-2021||Delhi||Farm fires: Delhi CM Kejriwal blames neighbouring states for rise in pollution||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday hit out at Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, blaming them for the rise in pollution in the national capital and appealed to them to help farmers dispose of their stubble.Inaugurating a hospital in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, Kejriwal said the Delhi government controlled the air pollution and attributed the drop in the city’s air quality index (AQI) to stubble burning in the neighbouring states.“Delhi’s own pollution, including vehicles and industries is within the safe limit. I have been tweeting pollution data in Delhi for the past month. Pollution has started increasing from the last three or four days, and it is the pollution due to stubble, which is being burnt in the surrounding states,” said Kejriwal.He also urged these states to adopt the Pusa bio-decomposer, a proprietary microbial solution developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) to turn crop stubble into manure.“We made a solution. If you sprinkle it on the stubble, there is no need to burn it thereafter,” said Kejriwal.A total of 4,092 burning events were detected between September 15 and October 16 — 2,375 in Punjab, 1,026 in Haryana, 581 in UP, none in Delhi, 27 in Rajasthan and 83 in Madhya Pradesh, according to IARI.State environment minister Gopal Rai on Sunday also blamed the Capital’s rising pollution levels on “unchecked stubble burning” in these neighbouring states. Rai on Sunday said that incidents of stubble burning have increased rapidly in parts of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana over the last three days, which has thrown Delhi’s air pollution into dangerous levels. “According to Nasa (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), the number of stubble fires on October 13 was low, due to which the air quality index was 171 on that day. As incidents of stubble burning increased in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the pollution level in Delhi also starts increasing in the same proportion,” Rai said. He added, “In north India, crop harvest has been delayed due to the late withdrawal of monsoon from the region. Now stubble burning has started at a rapid pace. Delhi government makes has made all preparations and is also spraying the bio-decomposer in the fields of the farmers for free, but other states have not made any such preparations.” Rai also said that the central government granted around ₹250 crore to Punjab for the management of stubble, with which bio-decomposer can be sprayed free of cost in at least five million acres in the state. “We started the war room and started monitoring pollution levels 24-hours a day and saw that when stubble burning increases inside Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the pollution level of Delhi also increases in the same proportion. This year also we are seeing that the level of AQI on October 13 was 171. According to NASA pictures, the number of stubble burning incidents that day was low. But in the last three days, incidents of stubble burning have increased with great speed in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and with the speed with which the incidents of stubble burning have increased, with the same speed, the AQI reached 284 yesterday (Saturday),” he said. The minister said that the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had released a report last week, which claimed that the stubble burning is lesser this year compared to last year, but the case was that it is only delayed and is catching up fast. “In Delhi, we are taking all steps to ensure that local pollution sources are kept under check. We will not hesitate in taking the strictest action in penalising violators,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-fires-delhi-cm-kejriwal-blames-neighbouring-states-for-rise-in-pollution-101634496563336.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Transactions under one ration card scheme up, says Delhi govt||Transactions recorded under the ‘one nation one ration card’ (ONORC) scheme — notified in July — have been going up consistently every month, indicating that migrant workers, who left the capital in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19 earlier this year, are returning, said senior Delhi government officials. Goods and services tax (GST) and value-added tax (VAT) collections are also up since July, suggesting that economic activities have gone up with a phased scaling down of lockdown restrictions.“Other than schools, prohibition on large gatherings, and maximum cap on guests in certain industries such as restaurants, bars, banquet halls, etc, are over. More migrant workers are now returning to the city each month,” said a senior official in the Delhi government on condition of anonymity.The ONORC scheme allows people to avail of subsidised food grains under the National Food Security Act from fair price shops in towns they live irrespective of where their ration cards are registered. Government records show that when the scheme was rolled out in July, there were 29,569 transactions at the 2,000-odd fair price shops in the city. This went up to 38,173 in August and 85,327 in September. This month, transactions have already crossed 46,000. Officials in the government’s food and civil supplies department said, over the next one week, it may exceed the 100,000-mark for the first time.The number of ration cardholders from other states who reside in Delhi is estimated by the government as 200,000, which translates to around 1 million beneficiaries (assuming each cardholder feeds four other mouths). These are over and above 1.78 million ration cardholders and 7.2 million beneficiaries registered in Delhi. Going by Census 2011 data, around 40% of the 7.2 million are also believed to be migrants from other states who have settled in Delhi over time and got ration cards registered here.“Trade, commerce and industrial activities have picked up and it reflects in the GST and VAT collections in the first two quarters. That usually leads to higher labour demand,” said the first senior official cited above.Government records showed that GST collections in Delhi witnessed a decrease from ₹2,325.64 crore recorded in April to ₹991.05 crore in May and further down to ₹968.4 crore in June. But they went up to ₹1,584.75 crore in July, further up to ₹1,713.96 crore in August and ₹1,976.82 crore in September. VAT collections, too, reflect a similar trend. They went down from ₹417.01 crore in April to ₹358.17 crore in May and further down to 207.35 crore in June. But they started to go up after that— ₹440.03 crore in July, ₹557.7 crore in August and ₹565.92 crore in September, records showed. “We learnt that the government was scaling down restrictions and economic activities. But we did not have the confidence to return till September. Now it seems safe. I have a job in a factory. Thanks to the ration card scheme, we can avail subsidised food grain in Delhi,” said Rajesh Prajapati, a migrant from Bihar.Rakesh Kumar, a migrant from eastern Uttar Pradesh said, “Big cities like Delhi lack safety nets for poor people like us. The ration scheme comes as a major relief because our jobs are not very secure.”While the government had started with a phased relaxation process of the lockdown since June, HT had then published a series of articles on how migrant workers chose to stay put for a while for reasons ranging from Covid-19 cases in their own families, medical costs draining savings, lack of security net and job assurance in the city, and fears of a potential third wave of the pandemic.“These concerns have clearly reduced now. By Diwali, industries are expected to operate at 90% capacity and above. Labour demand is increasing. So, a lot of migrant workers are coming back to the city,” said Neeraj Sehgal, general secretary of the welfare body at Delhi’s most prominent industrial area in Mayapuri.Government reports said that more than 807,000 migrant workers left Delhi in buses they boarded from the interstate bus terminals in the first four weeks of the full lockdown starting April 19 this year. The actual number is likely to be higher because the city government did not maintain records of migrant workers who left the city in trains and other means in the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/transactions-under-one-ration-card-scheme-up-says-delhi-govt-101634496323564.html

18-10-2021||Lucknow||Not riots in UP in last 4.5 years: CM Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said riots had become a thing of the past in the state and cited a “riot-free” UP over the past 4.5 years of his rule to back his claim. “These riots affected the celebrations of the majority community whose members were embroiled in fake cases. Rioters are now aware if they are found involved, their seven generations would have to repay the damages caused due to their act,” Yogi said to applause at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Other Backward Castes (OBC) meet, featuring members of Prajapati (sculptors) community in Lucknow on Sunday. The CM’s statement came even as the opposition targeted the ruling party over what it termed “increased lawlessness” in the state and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav stating that UP required a “yogya” and not Yogi as mukhymantri (a capable chief minister and not a saint as CM).” However, in an apparent dig at the previous Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments that had ruled the state before him, Yogi said while his government had a zero tolerance policy towards rioters, previous governments patronised them. “There is an economic side to the riots and there is a religious side too. Previously, our festivals were usually marred due to riots which obviously hit economic activity,” he added. “Just about the time our festivals were to be held, state used to be under riot-induced-curfew. These riots and subsequent curfews also impacted our celebrations, our festivals. That’s because the governments of those time patronised rioters in every which way possible,” the CM said. Amid Yogi-Yogi chants, he said, “Now riots aren’t possible in UP. You would have seen how festivals have been celebrated with traditional fervour and gaiety unlike in the past when riots affected our idol makers and rioters damaged the profits by damaging earthen lamps.” Even as the opposition hit back with SP and BSP spokespersons Anurag Bhadauria and MH Khan respectively claiming that Yogi’s reference to riots and rioters were diversionary tactics, the chief minister continued aggressively attacking them. “Before the Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the slogan ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ (cooperation of all, development of all) in 2014, the opposition too had a slogan. It was: ‘sabka saath, apne aur parivaar ka vikas’ (cooperation of all, development of self and one’s family). That’s why the state continues to be backward,” the CM said. Yogi cited installations of statues of Goddess Durga during the recent Durga Puja, Dussehra celebrations at an estimated 41,000 places across the state and the peaceful immersion of idols as proof of his government having helped in ushering in celebrations by ending the “riot-culture”. “Statues of goddess were officially installed at 41,000 places. In fact, the number could be much higher. Moreover, there was no controversy during immersion. Of the 41,000 installations, 32,000 idol immersions had taken place and the rest were scheduled during the week. All this helps,” Yogi said. ‘Covid gave in before people enthusiasm’ Appreciating the festive spirit in which the Navratri festival was celebrated, the CM said Covid-19 failed in front of people’s enthusiasm. “The entire world saw how in front of your enthusiasm, Covid-19 which had devastated the world also failed,” he said. He also cited how his interactions with the people as well as those with party leaders like UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev had revealed that smiles of the common man had returned over the past 4.5 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/not-riots-in-up-in-last-4-5-years-cm-yogi-101634496023888.html

Till date, the state government is yet to get GST revenues of Rs30,000 crore from the central government. On one side, the union government wants to bring the state government in financial difficulties and on the other side it wants to bring down the government,” he said while addressing a gathering of NCP workers at a meeting in Rahtani, Pimpri- Chinchwad.“Today, the BJP is ruling the country but it won’t remain in power for long. The state government is being hounded by central agencies like the enforcement directorate (ED), Central bureau of investigation (CBI), Income tax (IT) and Narcotics Control of Bureau (NCB), but the state government will not bend before the centre.”“Today, as workers are being sacked from jobs there are no jobs in the market. Former finance minister P Chidambaram in an article said that if the government reduces 25 per cent cess on petrol-diesel it will reduce the burden on the population, but the government is not ready to reduce the fuel prices,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-ignoring-the-people-of-the-state-sharad-pawar-101634495963520.html
18-10-2021||Noida||Price of tender coconuts increases this dengue season in Gautam Budh Nagar||The rise in dengue cases in Gautam Budh Nagar has led to an increase in demand and price of tender coconuts. The price of the fruit has gone up by ₹15 to ₹20 in the last one month. According to sellers, a piece of tender coconut that was being sold at ₹50-55 till third week of September is now available for ₹65-70 in the district.Dinkar Pandey, who sells tender coconuts near Sector 62’s D-Park, said that the demand for the fruit has increased in the past few weeks. “There has been a surge in sales at my stall. I have been selling at least 60 coconuts a day for the past two-three weeks as against about 40 coconuts earlier. With demand increasing, prices have also increased,” said Pandey, who was selling a tender coconut for ₹65. Some vendors from the Sector 21-22 crossing have shifted to areas near the district hospital and the Child PGI Hospital. “Business is better near hospitals these days as dengue cases are rising. Most of the customers here buy five-six tender coconuts at a time,” said Prakash Yadav, a coconut seller near Child PGI Hospital who was selling tender coconut water for ₹70. According to traders at the wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Noida’s Phase 2, there has been a rise in demand for tender coconuts in the past three weeks. “Tender coconuts were being sold for ₹40-45 apiece till September. However, the prices have now increased to ₹60-65,” said Imrana Ahmed, general secretary, Noida Fal-Sabji Mandi Association. Ahmed also said that the rise in diesel prices has also added to the increase in the fruit’s rates. “One month ago, the transportation cost of a fruit truck from Azadpur mandi to Noida mandi was ₹1,000, which has now increased to ₹1,200. This has also led to a slight increase in the prices of some fruits,” she said. Meanwhile, with 17 new dengue cases reported in the district on Sunday, the tally of such cases has reached 210, according to data from the district health department. “The cumulative cases of dengue in the district stand at 210, with 28 active cases being treated at various hospitals,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. Medical experts say coconut water is beneficial for dengue patients as it helps keep the body hydrated. “When a patient is diagnosed with dengue, there are chances of their blood thickening and in children, there is a risk of blood clotting if fluid intake is less. Hence, doctors recommend consuming large quantities of fluids, and coconut water plays a significant role as it is filled with antioxidants and micronutrients,” said Dr DK Gupta, chairman, Felix Hospital, Noida Sector 137. Ayurvedic doctors also recommend coconut water for dengue patients. “On the onset of dengue fever or viral fever, coconut water is recommended for patients as it contains high amounts of electrolytes to keep the patient nourished and hydrated,” said Dr Partap Chauhan, director, Jiva Ayurveda.However, Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter), said that there is no scientific proof that coconut water specifically helps in recovery of a dengue patient. “High intake of fluids is recommended which can include various other drinks, like fruit juices, buttermilk, and lemon water,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/price-of-tender-coconuts-increases-this-dengue-season-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101634495905303.html
18-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Police bust online investment racket on social media site||New Delhi: The cyber cell unit (CyPAD) of Delhi Police on Sunday said they have busted an online investment fraud named “Profit_Mania”, and arrested a 44-year-old man for allegedly running the racket on a social media site along with his wife and a minor boy, who has also been apprehended in the case. The woman was bound down in the case, meaning she was apprehended by police file but released with directions to remain present whenever called for investigation, CyPAD officers said.The police said videos of some social media celebrities/influencers promoting the investment scheme were also uploaded on the social media account of the phoney scheme by the racketeers to increase the reach, and to attract investors. The police have identified the social media influencers, who may be asked to explain under what circumstances they agreed to make the promotional videos in favour of the fraudulent investment module, the CyPAD officials associated with the case said.“We have also seized over ₹12 lakh that was credited into the account of the fraudsters as investments by various people in the last some months. The racket was running for the past two years. We assume that the numbers of investors may be in hundreds. So far, we have identified and approached four investors. More victims of the fraud are being identified,” said deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) KPS Malhotra.Officials said that the apprehended boy, aged around 17 years, was the mastermind and the “technical brain” behind the entire racket that was operating through a social media platform, and claimed to be dealing in binary trading.“The cheats induced people by offering to double their invested money within a week. They shared UPI IDs or QR codes to the investors for making the investments. However, once the money was transferred to the racketeers’ account, they stopped responding to the investor’s calls or messages,” said an investigator.DCP Malhotra said that one of the investors, who was duped of ₹40,000 in January this year, filed a complaint in July and on that basis a cheating case was registered. The complainant alleged that he was surfing on the social media account, when he came across a page titled “Profit_Mania”. The page had screenshots of people conducting binary trading with the company and earning profits.A binary option is an option that either pays a fixed monetary amount or nothing at all.“The complaint chatted with the account holder, who introduced himself as Deepak Sahu and induced him to invest in the scheme that will increase his investment by three times in no time. He was tricked into scanning a QR code for making the investment. Thereafter, the account holder stopped responding to his messages,” added Malhotra.During the probe, he said, details of the beneficiary of the bank account in which the money was transferred were collected and the suspect was identified as Devendra Choudhary, a resident of Baran in Rajasthan. Over ₹12 lakh was found credited by various people to the account that was opened in the name of a 17-year-old boy, who later turned out to be the racket’s mastermind. Chaudhary’s wife was also a part of it.“We arrested Chaudhary while the juvenile was apprehended,” said the DCP, advising the general public not to fall prey to any online investment schemes blindfolded even if they were endorsed by social media influencers.The DCP has also advised social media influencers to desist from promoting such schemes without verifying its authenticity, by saying that “inducement to cheating is an offence punishable under Ineidn Penal Code.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-online-investment-racket-on-social-media-site-101634495903829.html

Police said that the members of the interstate gang have several cases registered against them in Delhi, Mathura and Rajasthan.

18-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida authority launches group housing plot scheme after 5 years||After a gap of nearly five years, the Greater Noida authority on Sunday decided to launch a plot scheme for group housing projects in the city. The authority will raise around ₹400 crore by selling four plots under the scheme, officials said.Of these four plots, one each is located in sectors Zeta 1 and Eta 2, and two plots are in Sector Sigma 3. The size of the plots will range from 23,500 square metres to 39,321 sqm.The authority officials said that a realtor, according to the UP government directions, will have to develop at least 25% flats for economically weaker section (EWS) and low income group (LIG) on each plot. It was 2016 when the Greater Noida authority had last launched the group housing plot scheme. The brochure of the new scheme will be available online from October 18 and the last date to download it from the websites -- greaternoidaauthority.in and https:/etender.sbi -- will be November 8. The last date to submit the applications is November 12 and the e-auction will be conducted on November 22, the officials said, adding that the reserve price has been fixed at ₹32,000 per sqm. “We will scrutinise first if an interested developer is financially and technically qualified to build the project and deliver the units as per the scheme. We have made it mandatory that each developer on these four plots also build EWS and LIG units,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.This is the first time that the authority has made it mandatory for developers to build EWS and LIG units in a group housing project. According to the authority, at least 200 housing projects are way behind their respective schedules due to multiple reasons, including ‘fund diversion’ and poor demands in the city. Developers said that the market conditions are tough post the Covid-19 pandemic.“Due to the economic crisis post Covid-19, the real estate sector is also witnessing a bad time currently. We hope that the scheme do well amid this slowdown in the realty sector,” said Prashant Tiwari, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (western UP chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-launches-group-housing-plot-scheme-after-5-years-101634495847560.html
18-10-2021||Noida||Integrated industrial township in Greater Noida to be connected with air, rails||The Greater Noida authority is taking steps to connect the integrated industrial township in Greater Noida with Jewar airport, Metro and railway, said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the authority, on Sunday.“We have started taking measures so that this township, which earned appreciation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the recent national Gati Shakti event in Delhi, gets connectivity with Jewar airport, Aqua Line Metro corridor, dedicated freight corridor on the Indian Railways, and Bodaki transport hub. We will build roads on small stretches as the township,” said Bhooshan, who is also the CEO of the Integrated Industrial Township Greater Noida Limited (IITGL).Bhooshan said this during an event where he allotted a 64,000 square metres land in the township to a foreign company which will manufacture components of LED with an investment of ₹600 crore. A total of five big companies have already bought nearly 200 acres in the township, and as of now, the IITGL has at least 200 acres of industrial land which can be allotted for industrial projects.In August, 2016, the Uttar Pradesh government formed the industrial authority -- IITGL -- in Gautam Budh Nagar. In 2017, the IITGL started allotting industrial plots in an integrated township spread over 747 acres. Mumbai-based developer Shapoorji Pallonji developed the township located around 40 kilometres away from the Jewar airport site. Nearly 50% of 747 acres is earmarked for industrial usage, and the rest for residential and commercial purposes.This township is first of its kind, which will work on “plug and play” mode. This means the company can start the operations right after allotment as the basic facilities, including drainage, sewage, waste management, roads among other services are already laid out.“Greater Noida has ranked 12th in ease of doing business, and we are trying to top the list by providing transparent and hassle-free services to the investors. We aim to help them in setting up businesses and then create job opportunities for the youth in this region,” said Bhooshan, adding, “This township will discharge zero waste into soil, recycle waste water and solid waste, and also provide the best services to companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/integrated-industrial-township-in-greater-noida-to-be-connected-with-air-rails-101634495843447.html

The AQI in the city on Sunday was still poor because it was the cumulative of 24 hours, and the improved AQI would be reflected in the Monday reading,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad and Noida (acting).The 24-hour air quality monitoring by the CPCB suggested that the air quality in Noida is likely to swing between the ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ categories. According to the CPCB, the city’s AQI at 6pm was 236 in Sector 62, 256 in Sector 125, 270 in Sector 116, and 330 in Sector 1.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.According to CPCB, the AQI in Ghaziabad on Sunday was 310 against 349 a day earlier, and 244 in Greater Noida against 330 on Saturday. Meanwhile, weather analysts said that the thunder showers are likely to continue on Monday.“A cumulative effect of southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea at the upper level, easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal at the lower level, a low-pressure area over South Madhya Pradesh, and a minor western disturbance over western Himalayas has led to the rainfall in the region. This may wear off from Monday evening,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.Two injured in lightningMeanwhile, thunder lightning struck a house in Noida’s Phase 3, leading to destruction of a property, police said on Sunday. “Thunder lightning struck a house in a village in Phase 3, leading to destruction of a house.

18-10-2021||Pune||Traffic police on wrong end of quick getaways, violent reactions to law||PUNE The case of an IT professional’s arrest in a case of attempted murder of a traffic policeman has brought forth the recurrence of grievous assaults on traffic police officials. The arrested man was identified as Prashant Shridhar Kantawar (43), a resident of Mohammadwadi in Hadapsar. “This man is an IT engineer and is obviously quite educated. His car was flagged down and our system showed a past violation for which he was asked to pay-up as per the prescribed protocol. That enraged him so much, as is the case in most such cases, that he did this. Now he is in police custody for five days as the case is serious. Now we will recreate the crime scene, retrieve CCTV and build a proper case. The injured official was in the hospital overnight and has injuries on his arm, leg, and back,” said sub-inspector Gajanan Bhosale of Mundhwa police station who is investigating the case.A complaint in the matter was lodged by Sheshrao Jaybhay of the traffic division of Pune police. Jaybhay was, unfortunately, not the first victim this year in Pune. A 42-year-old man was remanded to judicial custody by a local court in Pimpri for dragging a traffic policeman on the road after his hand got stuck on the arrested man’s motorbike along Wakad-Hinjewadi road in April.The arrested man, Sanjay Eknath Shedge (42), a resident of Adhale Khurd area of Maval, Pune, was riding on a Hero Honda Pleasure vehicle around 5.30pm on Friday along Wakad-Hinjewadi road. Ingale stopped him in order to check his papers at the nakabandi he was manning.The policeman’s hand got stuck in the carrier attached to the back of the vehicle when the accused tried to run away. He was chased and arrested by the local police. The man was booked in a case registered at Wakad police station.In January, constable Ravindra Namdev Karvande (30), working with the Chakan traffic division of Pimpri-Chinchwad police was assaulted with an iron rod in Talegaon-Chakan chowk by two for directing them to move the container truck. The two men identified as Rohit Babu Salvi (20), and Harshdeep Bharat Kamble (22), both residents of Kalyan, Thane, were remanded to judicial custody and a case was registered against them at Chakan police station.When these cases had seen a spike in 2019 during the tenure of former police commissioner K Venkatesham, the police purchased body cameras which helped record these incidents. However, the cameras seem to have taken a backseat in the recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traffic-police-on-wrong-end-of-quick-getaways-violent-reactions-to-law-101634495725409.html

Amid rising cases, the deputy commissioner on Sunday appealed to residents to take all safety precautions to control the spread of the vector-borne disease. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram on Sunday, appealed to residents to check all pots, water trays, coolers and trays inside the refrigerators; every week, to ensure that water does not accumulate and there is no mosquito breeding on their premises. “Citizens must pay special attention to cleanliness in their surroundings and ensure that they do not allow water to accumulate around homes. All pits should be filled with soil and clogged drains be cleaned. If it is not possible to prevent water stagnation in or around the house, then petrol or kerosene oil can be poured there. All the room coolers, water in the vases, utensil for feeding birds must be emptied once a week and dried completely. People must not keep broken cans, tyres, utensils, bottles in the house where fresh water can accumulate,” Garg said. The deputy commissioner also informed that door-to-door checks are being done by field workers. He appealed to the citizens to celebrate every Sunday as a “dry day”, during which all the coolers and tanks in the house should be thoroughly scrubbed with a cloth and the water from the refrigerator tray also be cleaned. “During power cuts, water melts and collects in ice trays in the refrigerator, which is clean water, where also breeding of mosquitoes can happen. Residents must remember to clean it and also ensure that water from air conditioners is also not being collected,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/six-dengue-cases-take-tally-to-170-this-season-dc-appeals-for-mosquito-breeding-checks-at-homes-101634495486169.html

18-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG yet to recover ₹7 cr from contractors of street vending zones||Senior officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) directed officials to recover dues of ₹7 crore from three contractors who oversaw its street vending zones till 2019. The recovery has been pending since April, when a police case was registered against them and recovery notices were issued. Officials said that the matter came up for discussion during the MCG’s town vending committee (TVC) meeting last Thursday, following which the civic body’s commissioner, Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, directed officials to recover the dues at the earliest.“Adhering to the directions of the MCG commissioner, the accounts and legal branches of the MCG have issued fresh notices to all three contractors concerned. They have been given a one-month deadline to deposit the remaining sum, failure of which would lead to lead to further action being initiated against them,” Dr Vijaypal Yadav, deputy municipal commissioner (DMC) of the MCG, who oversees the street vending zones, said.According to MCG officials, the issue pertains to three contractors hired in 2016 to oversee their street vending zones. The tenure of three contractors ended in September 2019 and was not renewed, but they illegally continued to collect monthly fees, including the MCG’s share, from street vendors.The MCG has over 1,600 street vendors in its 148 vending zones. For placing their cart in a vending zone, each street vendor pays ₹1,500 per month, of which ₹1,000 went to the contractor and ₹500 to the MCG.Cumulatively, the three contractors have paid ₹30 lakh and as per the agenda list for MCG’s TVC meeting, the contractors owe the MCG ₹2.68 crore, ₹2.41 crore and ₹1.9 crore.The issue came to the MCG’s notice in March this year, following which it was raised in a House meeting in April and an inquiry was subsequently conducted. After the probe, the three contractors were blacklisted an FIR was registered against them. However, six months on, they are yet to pay the sum.Since November last year, there has been severe scrutiny over the vending zones, which also led to the discovery of the three contractors continuing to collect fees from street vendors, officials said.As per a report submitted by Yadav in April to senior officials for perusal, the MCG, in 2016, had issued a work order for incorporating 3,452 street vendors into its street vending zones but the civic body had managed to only regularise 1,620 vendors under it. Of these, around 350 were also operating illegally as their original owners had either leased the carts to others or transferred the ownership to them, violating norms of the Haryana Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-yet-to-recover-7-cr-from-contractors-of-street-vending-zones-101634495429338.html

The government plans to open 5,000 stores across the state to wipe out unemployment.Khattar said they have set a target of providing employment to at least one member of each family by 2025 and to achieve this goal, “no stone would be left unturned for creating new dimensions of self-employment.”Khattar inaugurated the first Har Hith store in Farrukhnagar and also became the first customer to buy goods from such a store. Later, he inaugurated 70 stores across the state virtually, from the government tourist complex in Sultanpur.The chief minister (CM) said that such stores would be opened in all areas having a population of 3,000, in rural zones, and 10,000, in urban zones, for people to, directly and indirectly, benefit from them.Apart from micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), small industrial units and cooperative sector units, quality products prepared by women’s self-help groups (SHGs) will also be procured and made available at these stores at a price lower than their competition in the market, Khattar said.After the inauguration, the CM also interacted with villagers who had gathered at the Sultanpur tourist complex and took their feedback on the availability of fertilisers and other essential items.Earlier in the morning, Khattar also inspected the houses built under the Ashiyana Scheme in Sector 47 and directed the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran to clean and repair these flats by next month so these can be allotted to citizens of the below poverty line (BPL) category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cm-manohar-lal-khattar-opens-har-hith-stores-aims-to-generate-jobs-101634495427852.html
18-10-2021||Gurugram||Speeding: Two dead after falling off Iffco Chowk U-turn flyover||Two 21-year-old men died on Sunday after falling from the Iffco Chowk U-turn flyover around 11.30am. According to the police, the two were speeding on a Bullet motorcycle when they hit the boundary wall of the flyover at a high speed and fell off it.The police said the two of them were taken to a nearby private hospital for treatment by passersby, but one of them was declared brought dead, while the other is undergoing treatment. Later in the night, the police confirmed the death of the second person during treatment. The matter is being probed by the Sector 29 police.The deceased were identified as Saidur Rehman, a resident of Leh in Ladakh who was a student of a Delhi college, and Mohd Zaid, a resident of Mandikhera village in Nuh. The motorcycle was owned by Zaid and has a registration number of Nuh, the police said.According to a preliminary investigation, the two of them had taken the Iffco Chowk U-turn flyover and were going from Delhi to Sukhrali, when their motorcycle, which was being driven at high speed, hit the wall of the flyover due to which the rider lost balance. However, it was unclear who was riding the motorcycle.“Both the riders fell from flyover due to the impact of the crash, which is at a height of around 18 to 20 feet above the ground. The vehicles moving below at a high speed had to stop suddenly. The passersby took the victims to Medanta Hospital, where one of them was declared brought dead,” a police official, who did not wish to be named, said.The police official said that the matter is being probed and only after analysing the CCTV feed would they be able to know the exact reason behind the accident.The relatives of both the victims were informed and family members of Zaid reached the hospital in the afternoon. Rehman’s family is likely to reach Gurugram on Monday, police officials said.Following the incident, there was heavy congestion on the carriageway as vehicles slowed down. The situation normalised after they were taken to the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/speeding-two-dead-after-falling-off-iffco-chowk-u-turn-flyover-101634495426164.html
18-10-2021||Gurugram||Rainfall fails to improve Gurugram air, in very poor zone for second day in a row||Air quality in the city deteriorated rapidly over the past two weeks, from the satisfactory category to the very poor category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, an indication that anti-pollution measures are still lacking.Even as the city received light rainfall on Sunday, it recorded an AQI of 332 (very poor) on the CPCB bulletin, worse than the poor air quality recorded in neighbouring Delhi. This was the second consecutive day the city recorded very poor air, after recording an AQI of 308 on Saturday.However, on Sunday, data collated from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) air quality monitors painted a different picture, with 10 of the 12 monitors depicting the satisfactory level of air quality, while two monitors, at Tau Devi Lal Park and Rezang La Chowk, recorded moderate air quality between 9am and 6.30pm.Officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) attributed the dip in air quality to weather conditions of drop in temperatures and low mixing height of pollutants, inhibiting their dispersion.“This dip in air quality in the past two days is because of unfavourable weather conditions as there is a decrease in temperature, slow wind speed and decrease in mixing height of pollutants. This, ultimately, obstructs the pollutants to disperse in the atmosphere,” Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of HSPCB for Gurugram (north), said.When asked if the dip in AQI was due to lack of enforcement of anti-pollution measures issued on October 1, he said, “After reading various reports of dust control norms not being followed, especially at construction sites, I visited a few areas and saw the situation. I have instructed all agencies to follow the measures properly and submit a daily report. Our teams will also start conducting surprise raids at the hotspots or from where complaints are received, and take action accordingly.”Experts agreed that the dip in air quality may be due to unfavourable weather conditions, but pointed out that source reduction of pollutants has not happened.“Despite all instructions being issued, there is no difference in managing vehicular emission or dust management on the ground. Weather conditions are unfavourable, but with the rain that the city received on Sunday, the effects will be seen over the next two to three days, but our AQI may still be on the higher side as pollution sources in the city have not been checked properly,” Abhishek Srivastava, a city-based environmental engineer, said.According to the CPCB data, between October 3 and 6, the city recorded satisfactory air quality, with AQI scores below 100 while on Saturday, the city recorded very poor air quality for the first time this season.The pollution board has identified that the main causes for pollution in Gurugram are dust pollution from construction and demolition activities, vehicular pollution, and solid waste burning. The pollution control board has identified 18 hotspots for vehicular air emissions or traffic congestion, 13 hotspots for road dust, 10 areas used for rampant solid waste disposal, and seven hotspots for industrial air emissions.On October 1, directions were issued to 40 agencies in the city, including the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, GMDA, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran and the transport department, among others, to adhere to action plans issued for pollution hotspots in the city.More rain likely on MondayGurugram received light rainfall of around 1mm on Sunday, bringing slight relief to residents from pollution. Strong surface winds also helped slightly improve the air quality during the day.According to the weather bulletin issued by the Meteorological Centre in Chandigarh, heavy rain with thunderstorms, lightning with gusty winds (speed 30-40kmph) is likely at isolated places across the south and south-east Haryana districts.On Sunday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 31.8 degrees Celsius (°C), two degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 24°C, which was six degrees above the normal. The humidity level was recorded at 92% at the end of the day.The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to improve to the moderate category over the next two days as an effect of the rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rainfall-fails-to-improve-gurugram-air-in-very-poor-zone-for-second-day-in-a-row-101634495425121.html

No injuries were reported in the incident and the flames were doused in an hour.According to the fire department, the occupants had just left the premises, located on the top floor, around 1.30pm when the incident took place. Such was the intensity of the blaze that a team of officials from the Sector 50 police station and the fire department evacuated all occupants of the building.Rajesh Kumar, assistant fire safety officer (AFSO), Haryana Fire Services, said, “One of the neighbours had alerted us about the fire. The house was locked from outside as its occupants had left home just a few minutes earlier. A fire tender from the Sector 29 fire brigade was immediately dispatched. It took fire department officials around 15 minutes to reach the spot.”The apartment is located in Sector 49, behind Park Hospital and had three occupants. The lanes leading up to the site of the fire were extremely narrow due to the high density of residential buildings.Kumar said that the firemen, upon seeing the high intensity of the blaze, called for a water bowser truck from the Sector 29 fire brigade. A water bowser truck is similar to a water tanker and transports water to a fire site for dousing operations in instances when a hydrant is not located nearby.“It took us over an hour to douse the fire. Most items in the apartment were gutted. The fire could have spread to the three floors located below and as a precautionary measure, all its occupants were evacuated from the building jointly by Gurugram police and fire department officials,” Kumar said.Kumar said that dousing operations were conducted in such a fashion to ensure that the blaze did not spread to the kitchen, where an LPG cylinder was stored, failing which the blaze could have amplified.Fire department officials said that the electricity voltage load in the building was extremely high and they suspect that a short circuit caused the fire.“It was only when the occupants returned from the market did they find out that their house had caught fire. Their versions have been taken by firemen and investigations are ongoing to ascertain the cause,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fire-breaks-out-in-south-city-2-apartment-no-injuries-101634495423757.html

The incident took place reportedly at 1 am on Sunday, though the police were yet to piece together the sequence of events leading to the tragic accident. The police identified the twins as Surya Narayan and Satya Narayan, both students of Class 9. Police said initial questioning of the parents of the twins suggest that the deceased were trying to drive away lizards in the balcony, standing on a chair place atop a table. Police said while the mother of the two was asleep, their father TS Palani, was in Mumbai for official work. Palani, police said, is a senior officer with finance company. “When the incident took place, their mother and sister were sleeping in a separate room. Though the sequence of events is not clear at this juncture, we held discussions with their parents during handing over of the bodies. They said that there used to be a couple of lizards in the balcony, and the two boys were probably trying to drive them away, as they used to do often,” Mahipal Singh, circle officer (CO - city 1), said on Sunday evening. The police said that they also found a table and a chair in the balcony. “As their parents suspect, the children probably placed the chair atop a table and were trying to drive away lizards. In the process, they might have slipped and fell down. The bodies were handed over to the family members after a post-mortem examination. Earlier, there were speculations that the twins were playing in the balcony, but it was not the case. As of now we did not find any foul play,” the CO added. According to police, the incident took place at Prateek Grand City high-rise in Ghaziabad’s Siddharth Vihar locality. The residents said that the high-rise is a project comprising about 4,000 flats as high as up to 26 to 29 storeys. The occupancy is about 250 families at present, they added. The residents who rushed to the site soon after the incident said that the two children were lying close to each other. “There was hardly a distance of one metre between them. The guards also heard one loud sound as if they landed almost at the same time. Their bodies had injury marks as a result of the fall, and they were declared brought dead when taken to a hospital. Their father was away to Mumbai for the inauguration of his company’s new office, and he rushed back on Sunday morning,” said Sudhakar Yadav, member of the residents’ coordination committee of the high rise. He said that the residents also found a table and a chair intact in the balcony. “It was around 1am when the guards at the entrance of the parking heard a loud sound and they thought that some cars must have collided. But the noise came from the backside of the tower. Both children were found lying on the grass near the walking track. Police was called and they inquired about the incident,” Yadav added. Senior police officials said that they will continue probe into the incident. “On Sunday morning, we came to know from initial details that the children had told their mother that they will observe the moon from the balcony. Things are still not clear, but we will rope in a special team to inquire the reasons for the accident. There are several questions that need to be answered,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1). The police said that they have not received any complaint so far from the family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/trying-to-drive-away-lizards-twin-boys-fall-to-death-from-ghaziabad-highrise-101634495304381.html

The findings of the study have been recently published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR), the official journal of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“During the second wave of the pandemic, there was a big controversy in India that CT scans are increasing the risk of cancer in Covid-19 patients. It was being said the CT scan could produce genetic mutations and cause cancer, as it involved the use of ionizing X-rays which are categorised as hazardous radiation. However, we reviewed the current scientific literature and concluded that this theory holds little merit,” said Dr Mandeep Garg, chest radiologist, PGIMER, who is the lead author of the study.Despite using X-rays for more than 125 years and CT scans for nearly 50 years now, there was no definite scientific evidence to date, which could prove that CT scans increased cancer risk, the doctors concluded.The co-authors of the study are Dr Nidhi Prabhakar from PGIMER and Dr Ashu Seith Bhalla from AIIMS, New Delhi.Dr Garg said, “Also, not doing a CT scan fearing the hypothetical risk of radiation-induced cancer in a clinically relevant indication can delay treatment and cause more harm. The exposure to radiation from diagnostic medical imaging tests like CT scan results in limited radiation exposure and that too only to a portion of the body being scanned.”“Even if any damage occurs to the cells due to low-dose exposures to the CT scan, the body has the inherent ability to overcome this cell damage and repair DNA without leaving any signs of injury,” he said.The doctors also said there had been rapid technological advances in both CT scan hardware and software and the radiation delivered to patients in each CT scan examination has considerably reduced.Though there were no signs of causing cancer, the doctors advised that the CT scan should be used judiciously and only when clinically indicated or when its results are expected to impact the treatment decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ct-scan-won-t-raise-cancer-risk-in-covid-patients-experts-101634420409544.html
18-10-2021||World||Joe Biden administration asks US Supreme Court to block Texas abortion law||President Joe Biden's administration on Monday asked the US Supreme Court to block a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on abortion after a lower court reinstated the Republican-backed measure.The administration made its request to the Supreme Court seeking to quickly reverse a decision by the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals to lift a judge's order blocking the law while litigation over the matter continues.The Justice Department told the justices in a filing that the 5th Circuit's action "enables Texas's ongoing nullification of this court's precedents and its citizens' constitutional rights."The filing also said that "given the importance and urgency of the issues" involved the Supreme Court could decide to take up and hear arguments in the case even before lower courts have issued their own final rulings.The Texas measure, one of a series of restrictive abortion laws passed at the state level in recent years, bans the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not even realise they are pregnant.The justices on September 1 in a late-night 5-4 decision allowed the law to go into effect.The Texas measure makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest. It also gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked by making it more difficult to directly sue the state.Critics of the law have said this provision lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters, a characterisation its proponents reject.The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-administration-asks-us-supreme-court-to-block-texas-abortion-law-101634580974308.html
18-10-2021||World||Colin Powell: Former US secretary of state dies from Covid-19 complications||Colin Powell, the first African-American secretary of state and national security adviser to the US president, died on Monday of complications related to Covid-19. He was 84.Over four decades of life in US government, Powell would be remembered most distinctly for his speech, as secretary of state, at the UN Security Council that paved the way for the US invasion of Iraq in March 2003, wrongly alleging that Saddam Hussein, then Iraqi leader, had built a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). No WMD was ever found in Iraq. “A failure will always be attached to me and my UN presentation,” Powell wrote in It Worked For Me, his 2012 book. “I am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me.”“General Colin L. Powell, former US secretary of state and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, passed away this morning due to complications from Covid-19,” the Powell family said a statement on his official Facebook page. “He was fully vaccinated [against Covid-19]. We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment. We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American.”CNN reported that Powell had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, which left him immunocompromised.Colin Powell visited India four times as secretary state, the first of which took place in October 2001, just days after the US invaded Afghanistan in search of Osama bin Laden and others responsible for the September 11 terror attacks.Powell’s last visit came months after India turned down a request from the Bush administration to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq. The US had expected the deployment of a full Indian army division of 17,000 troops, according to reports at the time.A cabinet committee of the Vajpayee government decided in July 2003 to turn down the request after months of intense discussions.Colin Powell’s visit in March 2004 was dominated by outsourcing and trade. “My previous visits here in India were during times of great tension, crisis when people worried about the possibility of conflict,” he had said a town hall hosted by NDTV. “But now I am here at the time when people are talking about peace. We are talking about economic and trade issues for most of the day, not tension and conflict and the likelihood of war. “And I think this is a tribute to the leaders, a tribute to your Prime Minster and the members of this government, a tribute to President [Pervez] Musharraf, but really a tribute to the desire on the part of the Indian people to find a way forward, to find a way towards lasting peace in this part of the world. And for you young people, it’s especially important that you be advocates for peace as well, because it is your country that you’re going to be inheriting and leading.”A four-star general, Colin Powell made history in 1987 when then president Ronald Reagan named him his national security adviser, the first African-American to hold that position.He was followed years later by Condoleezza Rice. In 2001, then president George W Bush named him his secretary of state, once again the first African-American named as the top US diplomat.Born to parents from Jamaica, Powell fought in the Vietnam war and went to become the youngest and first African-American chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, a post he held during the 1990 Gulf War, when his strategy of using overwhelming force - after exhausting diplomatic, politician and economic means - came to be called the “Powell Doctrine”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colin-powell-former-us-secretary-of-state-dies-from-covid-19-complications-101634581052805.html

All countries on the grey list have “strategic deficiencies” in their measures to combat money laundering and terror financing.Virtually connected delegates will join those who travel to Paris for three days of meetings to discuss “key issues to strengthen global action against the financial flows that fuel crime and terrorism”, the watchdog said.Delegates will discuss the “outcomes of the FATF’s survey to identify areas where divergent anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules or their implementation cause friction for cross-border payments”. FATF is leading work on this aspect of the G20’s priority to improve cross-border payments.The meeting will also discuss the next steps to strengthen FATF’s standards on transparency of beneficial ownership, and finalise key reports, including revised guidance on virtual assets and their service providers.Under the German presidency of Marcus Pleyer, delegates representing 205 members of the global network and observer organisations, including the International Monetary Fund, United Nations and Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, will participate in the plenary meeting.After its last plenary, FATF had said that Pakistan had completed all but one of the 27 items in an old action plan that was drawn up to tackle money laundering and terror financing. The action plan was finalised after Pakistan was placed on the grey list in June 2018.The remaining item in the action plan was demonstrating that investigations and prosecutions of terrorist financing target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups.The new action plan to tackle money laundering was drawn up after FATF’s regional partner, the Asia Pacific Group, identified a “number of serious issues” during an assessment of Pakistan in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-to-review-pakistan-s-measures-to-fight-terror-financing-at-plenary-meeting-101634579673923.html

The militant group has also continued to search for “high-profile” women in the province, the watchdog claimed.The women interviewed by Human Rights Watch and San Jose State University (SJSU) Human Rights Institute have painted a bleak picture of their life under Taliban rule in Herat.“For the women in Herat we interviewed, life as they knew it had vanished overnight, and they were left hiding indoors, waiting in fear to see whether the Taliban would come for them,” an Afghan scholar associated with the project said.Adding that “for these women, the best-case scenario is to be unharmed but forced to live a drastically diminished existence. The worst-case scenario is to be arrested or attacked for their past achievements or for their fight to keep their hard-earned rights.”The on-ground situation Herat is appalling for women since they were the first ones to protest the Taliban’s takeover, in which two protesters were shot dead for defying the Taliban. However, two months after the takeover, women activists have stopped organising anti-Taliban protests and have restored to asking the rulers to respect their basic rights.Herat, which was once the stronghold of warlord Ismail Khan, fell to the Taliban after Khan was captured by the militant group. Khan, popularly known as the ‘Lion of Herat’ had returned to the frontlines in July after almost two decades to thwart the Taliban’s attempts of capturing the province but he was ultimately defeated.The Taliban abide by the strict Sharia law which has restricted women’s access to basic human rights all over the country.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-committing-widespread-violations-against-afghan-women-girls-in-herat-claims-human-rights-watch-101634568550452.html

And as far as conversion to Islam is concerned, this hypothesis is weakened," Omholt added.On Saturday, police announced the identities of the five victims, four women and one man: Andrea Meyer, 52, Hanne Merethe Englund, 56, Liv Berit Borge, 75, Gunnar Erling Sauve, 75 and Gun Marith Madsen, 78.Brathen had been living in Kongsberg, home to about 25,000 people some 80 kilometres (50 miles) west of the capital Oslo, for years and authorities have said he has a medical history, although details have not been made public.The Norwegian security services PST, which are responsible for counter-terrorism, also said the man had been on their radar.In the days following the attack police mentioned "fears of radicalisation," dating back to 2020 and before, which they said had been followed up at the time.According to public broadcaster NRK, a first warning had been received in 2015 and, according to Norwegian media, PST had warned in 2018 that the suspect could commit "a small-scale attack".News website Nettavisen also published a video that Brathen allegedly posted to social media in 2017, in which he issued a "warning" while declaring his Muslim faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-attacker-killed-victims-with-sharp-object-not-arrows-says-police-101634565977884.html

According to local reports, the violence came after an image was posted on social media that was perceived as insulting to the country’s Muslim majority.Also watch | Bangladesh: Hindu homes attacked over 'Facebook post' after violence at pandalsThe Bangladesh Chhatra League led the protest march, blaming the Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir for the attack, as they blocked a major intersection in Dhaka along with the university teachers and students to demand justice. Several other Hindu groups also joined the peaceful protest at the Shahbagh intersection.News website bdnews24.com reported citing the district’s superintendent of police Mohammad Qamruzzaman as saying that the police rushed to the fishing village as tension mounted over a rumour that a young Hindu man of the village had ‘dishonoured religion’ in a Facebook post. The attackers set fire to other homes nearby as the police stood guard around the man’s home, the report said.“Whoever is involved in the incident, will be brought to justice. I have provided some immediate assistance to the victims,” said Pirganj municipal mayor ASM Tajimul Islam Shamim said, according to the Associated Press.Also read | 'Attacks on Durga Puja pandals pre-planned': Bangladesh home ministerThe agency also reported that Asif Hasan, chief government administrator of the Rangpur district, said attackers also stole cash, cattle and other valuables during the attack.

Powell, also the first Black secretary of state, was fully vaccinated, according to the family statement.“We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment. We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, grandfather and a great American,” the Powell family said.The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was an American war hero who became the US secretary of state under the Bush administration. While announcing Powell's appointment in 2000, then US President George W. Bush hailed him for his “towering integrity” and his “sense of duty and honour” as a soldier."In directness of speech, his towering integrity, his deep respect for our democracy, and his soldier's sense of duty and honour, Colin Powell demonstrates... qualities that will make him a great representative of all the people of this country."In his remarkable decades-long career, Powell found it hard to live down his infamous speech to the United Nations Security Council, which paved the way for the Iraq invasion and ouster of Saddam Hussein. He had alleged the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which turned out to be a false claim. The misleading intelligence input, resulting in the Iraq invasion, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives."It's a blot... and will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now," Powell said in a 2005 interview with ABC News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colin-powell-first-black-us-state-secretary-dies-of-covid-complications-101634558981468.html

18-10-2021||World||EU exported 'over 1 billion' Covid-19 vaccine doses in past 10 months||The European Union (EU) has exported "over one billion" doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the past 10 months, the bloc's chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday."Very clearly, the European Union is the largest exporter of Covid-19 vaccines," she said, announcing the "important milestone" in a brief broadcast and statement.Von der Leyen said that 87 million of the doses had been funnelled through the WHO-led Covax scheme to mid- and low-income countries.Most of the exports are orders paid for by other countries for Covid-19 vaccine doses manufactured in the EU.Von der Leyen said that, separate from the export figure, "the EU will donate in the next months at least 500 million doses to the most vulnerable countries". She urged other countries "to step up, too".Her declaration comes in the context of a sharp divide between wealthier regions and poorer ones in terms of Covid vaccination rates.The European Union, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Singapore and Japan are all among those to have more than half of their populations fully vaccinated.Meanwhile many countries in Africa and other places such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Myanmar and Syria have less than 10 percent of their people inoculated.The European Union, which has 65.6 percent of its population fully inoculated according to an AFP tally of official statistics, has been stepping up exports of vaccines.So too is the United States, which has 57 percent fully jabbed. President Joe Biden said last week his government was raising its donations to Africa to a total 67 million doses.G20 countries have pledged to fairer distribution of Covid-19 vaccines after WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala pointed out early this month that, of more than six billion vaccine doses administered worldwide, only 1.4 percent of people in poor countries have been fully vaccinated.The European Union has in place a vaccine export control mechanism under which doses to be sent abroad have to be first approved by Brussels and the member state in which they are produced.Only one shipment -- a 250,000-dose consignment of AstraZeneca meant for Australia -- has been blocked under the scheme, back in April."We have always shared our vaccines fairly with the rest of the world," von der Leyen said."We have exported as much as we delivered to EU citizens. Indeed, at least every second vaccine produced in Europe is exported."She added: "Together with President Biden, we aim for a global vaccination rate of 70 per cent by next year."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-exported-over-1-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-past-10-months-101634552057375.html
18-10-2021||World||‘India’s role key in ensuring stable and secure environment in Afghanistan’||India has a key role as an important regional actor in ensuring a stable and secure environment in Afghanistan though responding to the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country will require interacting with the Taliban, Italian ambassador Vincenzo de Luca has said. De Luca said that such interactions with the Taliban would not be tantamount to recognition of the setup in Kabul, and the Taliban have to act on the call by the G20 states to rescind their links with terror groups and tackle the presence of terrorists on Afghan soil. In an interview, he also elaborated on the outcomes of the extraordinary G20 leaders meeting convened under the Italian presidency on October 12. How does Italy as the president of the G20 plan to get in humanitarian assistance directly to the Afghan people before the onset of winter? What are the possible hurdles in the delivery of aid and its distribution in a non-discriminatory manner? What immediate steps are needed for aid to start flowing? The sense of urgency with respect to a possible humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan was the reason why Italy decided to take action and convene a G20 extraordinary leaders’ meeting on Afghanistan. In his closing remarks, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi underlined how the meeting confirmed a strong will to act immediately by the G20 countries, since the international community is dealing with a colossal humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. In this scenario, the only way to ensure effective distribution of aid is through the role and the activity of the United Nations, which seem to have received a broad mandate to coordinate all the relief efforts directed at the Afghan people and to respond to the humanitarian emergency. The G20 leaders’ meeting expressed support for the United Nations to carry out this mandate, operating in accordance with internationally agreed humanitarian principles, to make sure that aid is delivered in an efficient and non-discriminatory way. What role does Italy see for India in efforts to deliver this humanitarian assistance? Is there anything India should be doing to help the Afghan people ?Being an important regional actor, India’s involvement in consultation and coordination activities is key to ensure a stable and secure environment and effective initiatives aimed at humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. Italy and India share the view that Afghanistan needs immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. To this end, the continued presence of the United Nations in Afghanistan must be preserved. Italy will also contribute through a consistent national financial pledge, on the one hand, and by supporting the European Union in the implementation of its relief initiatives, on the other hand. As far as the latter is concerned, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced a 1 billion Euro support package for Afghanistan in the meeting. The Indian PM has called for a unified response by the world community to ensure the desired change in the situation in Afghanistan but the absence of the top leaders of China and Russia at the G20 extraordinary summit suggests there are divisions on the approach towards Afghanistan. Your comments. All G20 members were involved in the preparatory process of the leaders’ meeting. Chinese and Russian ministers attended the event on October 12 and both countries actively contributed to the virtual G20 foreign affairs ministers meeting on Afghanistan last September 22. In the G20 leaders’ meeting, a consensus on some lines of action emerged: Firstly, the G20 will play an advocacy role within the international community to fully support UN activities and respond to UN appeals on humanitarian assistance. Secondly, the G20 called on the Afghan authorities to ensure the safety, security, and freedom of movement of all UN and associated personnel throughout the country. Thirdly, the G20 countries strongly called on the Taliban to rescind their links with terrorist groups and tackle their presence on Afghan soil. G20 leaders have made it clear they will not recognise the Taliban and there is opposition to unfreezing the foreign assets of Afghanistan. Could this lead to the collapse of the economic and financial system in Afghanistan?Any action in tackling the current situation in Afghanistan would require interacting with the Taliban. If we want to respond to the humanitarian crisis effectively and to prevent the economic collapse of the country, there is no alternative to having contact with the Taliban. This, however, will not entail their recognition. At present, Afghanistan is also experiencing a crisis of the payment system and risks the collapse of its banking system. This issue must also be urgently addressed because if money doesn’t flow and payments cannot be done, the entire economy of the country might crumble, making any sort of assistance nearly impossible. In this framework, the World Bank and the IMF will play a key role. The G20 countries have called on the Taliban to rescind links with terrorist groups and tackle their presence on Afghan soil. What immediate steps by the Taliban would be seen as a suitable response to this call? How does Italy, as the president of the G20, view India’s position regarding Pakistan backing cross-border terror from Afghan soil? As stated in Resolution 2593 adopted by the UN Security Council on August 30, there is a strong expectation that the Afghan territory is not used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts. There is a common understanding of the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan and of the fact that security, including counterterrorism, and development are intertwined. At the G20 leaders’ meeting, it was clearly reiterated that Afghanistan must not become a safe haven for terrorists and a threat to international security. Are any steps being planned by the G20 to keep Kabul airport operational and for opening up other Afghan airports to facilitate the departure of foreign nationals and Afghan citizens who wish to leave? At the same time, are there concerns about an influx of Afghan refugees into Europe? A preliminary condition for carrying out the humanitarian activities is that the Kabul airport remains open and in operation and our PM thanked Turkey and Qatar for their action toward this end. The same principles are reiterated in the Chair’s Summary of the meeting, whereby it is stated that the G20 fully supports current and future technical efforts to keep the Kabul international airport wholly operational and the future reopening of other Afghan airports to commercial flights. Moreover, close cooperation with UN agencies and local authorities in the region should be pursued and substantial relief should be provided to migrants and refugees in these countries. The resilience of hosting communities should also be supported. To relieve pressure on countries in the region, options of safe and legal pathways from these countries for Afghan refugees could be explored, in cooperation with the UNHCR. What specific steps will be taken to ensure the human rights of the Afghans, especially women and minorities, and to preserve the gains of the past 20 years? Participants in the G20 leaders’ meeting addressed a strong request to the Afghan authorities to respect human rights, with particular regard to women’s and minorities’ rights. The Taliban were also urged to fully respect their own commitment to allow the safe passage of those who wish to leave the country. The issue of the human security of the Afghan people is at the core of the G20 concerns. The provision of public services, such as education and healthcare, and the fight against Covid-19 in Afghanistan will be addressed through all means available and within the United Nations framework of assistance. The G20 members finally agreed that substantial relief should also be provided to Afghan migrants and refugees in neighbouring countries, especially for women and children. In conclusion, in the Italian Prime Minister’s words, the virtual G20 leaders’ meeting on Afghanistan proved to be the first useful multilateral exercise for a common response to the Afghan crisis, with a particular focus on the humanitarian emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-ambassador-underscores-india-s-role-in-afghan-situation-g20-s-take-on-taliban-101634552250040.html

The paper said the feat had "caught U.S. intelligence by surprise"."It was not a missile, it was a space vehicle," ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing in Beijing when asked about the report, adding it had been a "routine test" for the purpose of testing technology to reuse the vehicle.The significance of a reusability test is that it can "provide a cheap and convenient method for humans to peacefully travel to and from space", Zhao said, adding that many companies had carried out similar tests.The foreign ministry said the test had taken place in July, not in August as reported by the Financial Times.The United States is closely watching China's military modernisation programme to assess the possible risks posed to it by its increasingly assertive strategic competitor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-a-space-vehicle-china-denies-report-of-hypersonic-missile-test-101634551126616.html

However, Hlaing refused to share any details regarding who will be released. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 7,300 people continue to remain behind bars in Myanmar.Hlaing's remarks come two days after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) said on Saturday that he will be excluded from the association's upcoming summit on October 26.Instead, foreign ministers of the bloc decided to invite a non-political representative from Myanmar to its summit, in what was seen as a snub to the military leaders behind the coup against Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in February.Also Read| Asean decides to exclude Myanmar military chief from key summit on October 26: ReportsThe bloc, which has been widely criticised as a toothless organisation, took a stand after the junta rebuffed requests that a special envoy meet with "all stakeholders" in Myanmar- a phrase seen to include Suu Kyi.In a televised address on Monday, the Junta chief made no mention of the ASEAN’s decision but urged it to consider the provocations and violence being carried out by its opponents."More violence happened due to provocations of terrorist groups. No one cares about their violence and is only demanding we solve the issue. ASEAN should work on that," Hlaing said.Min Aung Hlaing led the February coup in Myanmar, which resulted in widespread protests across the Asian country and the military resorted to violence to disperse the demonstrators.Hlaing's administration justified the takeover as it cited alleged rigging in the 2020 elections, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won.

18-10-2021||World||China’s economy slows due to power shortage, supply disruptions, Covid-19||China’s economy grew at just 4.9% in the third quarter of 2021 - the slowest growth this year - as it scrambles against a crippling power shortage, disruptions in the global supply chain, and sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks, data from the national bureau of statistics (NBS) showed on Monday.Rising commodity prices and restrictions on the real estate market are adding to woes for the second largest economy in the world.The slowdown is adding pressure on the policy makers of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to help recover economic growth. China’s economy had seen a remarkable recovery in the first quarter of the year after successfully controlling the Covid-19 pandemic.The slump that China’s economy is going through is telling. In the third quarter (Q3), the country’s GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year, slower than the growth of 18.3% in Q1 and 7.9% in Q2, NBS statistics showed.The country’s GDP expanded 9.8% year-on-year in the first three quarters, putting the average growth for the period in the past two years at 5.2%, according to the NBS data.Experts told Chinese official media that China’s GDP growth in the fourth quarter will face extra pressure, which may further drag down GDP growth for the whole of 2021.“The domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,” NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui said in Beijing on Monday. “Since entering the third quarter, domestic and overseas risks and challenges have increased.”In September, China was hit by its worst power crisis in recent years.“Surging electricity demand in a rebounding economy, plunging coal supplies and Beijing’s climate change policies create a perfect storm disrupting global supply chains,” the business website Caixin reported.Spokesperson Fu remained optimistic about tackling the power shortage. The power crisis had a “certain impact” on normal production, Fu said, but he added that the impact on China’s economy “is controllable”.Rising energy prices globally as well as tight domestic supplies of coal and electricity partly led to power outages in some regions that affected normal production orders, Fu was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.China has rolled out a series of measures to ensure power supply and keep electricity prices stable, he said, adding that as these measures gradually take effect, the power crunch would be eased and its impact on economic operation will be alleviated.“Global worries about a possible spillover of credit risk from China’s property sector into the wider economy have also intensified as major developer China Evergrande Group wrestles with more than $300 billion of debt,” Reuters reported on Monday.On Sunday, it was widely reported that as winter approaches, Chinese authorities fear what is being called a “twindemic” - a likely combined increase in Covid-19 outbreaks and influenza cases across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-economy-slows-due-to-power-shortage-supply-disruptions-covid19-101634542170392.html

The post was meant to criticise his former employer over non-payment of retirement funds.But the missing punctuation mark caused a defamation case to be filed against him, reported The Guardian.The incident happened in October last year, reported The Guardian, when New South Wales (NSW) Central Coast realtor Anthony Zadravic posted on Facebook, "Oh Stuart Gan!! Selling multi-million $ homes in Pearl Beach but can’t pay his employees superannuation. Shame on you Stuart!!! 2 yrs and still waiting!!!"Since the word ‘employees’ didn't have an apostrophe, it indicated that he was referring to several employees of Gan rather than himself. The post was meant to highlight non-payment of his dues.Though Zadravic deleted the post within 12 hours, Gan was made aware of it and he filed a defamation case against his former employee, the report further said.Zadravic pleaded the court to dismiss the petition, saying the failure to punctuate social media post was trivial. But the court last week allowed the case to proceed pointing to the seriousness of the claim in it, said The Guardian report.Judge Judith Gibson said the missing apostrophe suggests "a systematic pattern of conduct", saying that the failure to pay looks deliberate.The judge also noted to such instances where Facebook posts cost their authors dearly, the report added.Zadravic is now facing the prospect of paying more than $1,80,000 in damages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-an-apostrophe-in-facebook-post-lands-real-estate-agent-in-legal-trouble-101634540309114.html

That compares with more than a 70% inoculation rate in most wealthy nations.Merck on Oct 11 applied for U.S. emergency clearance of the first pill for COVID-19 after it cut hospitalizations and deaths by 50% in a large clinical trial. The medicine, made with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, could gain authorization as soon as December.The U.S. drugmaker has taken the unusual pandemic step of licensing several generics of its antiviral molnupiravir before its branded version was even authorized for marketing.But international health officials said even that is not enough for the medicine to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers, while noting shortcomings and red tape among global organizations that could further slow distribution.Merck this year plans to produce 10 million treatment courses of the pill, which is taken twice a day for five days, and another 20 million next year.In addition, its licensing deals with eight Indian drugmakers will allow cheaper generic versions for 109 low- and middle-income countries including in Africa, a move international groups acknowledge is a positive concession.But as wealthy nations secure molnupiravir supply deals - the United States has already locked up 1.7 million courses with an option for 3.5 million more by January of 2023 at about $700 per course - concerns grow over who might be left out.NOT MOVING QUICKLY ENOUGHMerck said it has worked on the technology transfer needed to start generic manufacturing, in contrast to vaccine makers who continue to resist calls to waive patents or allow for generic versions to boost supplies.But a recent report prepared for the United Nations' Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator program tasked with buying COVID-19 therapeutics for poor countries cited concerns that U.N. agencies were not moving quickly enough to secure adequate volumes of potential new treatments ahead of time, including Merck's drug.Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, has 24 companies signed up and willing to make the drug if Merck agrees to expand the licenses.“If you're not in the license, you're relying on Merck, and it looks to us that that could mean a potential supply shortfall as well as overpricing," said Peter Maybarduk of Public Citizen, who sits on the MPP governance board. He suggested that could lead to wealthy countries outbidding poor nations for the medicine.It is unclear how many generic pills will be available or when. The licensed Indian manufacturers including Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla Ltd, Dr. Reddy’s Labs , Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Sun Pharmaceuticals, and Torrent Pharmaceuticals declined to provide details on production plans.In addition, manufacturing for low-income countries in many nations also requires World Health Organization (WHO) approval, a regulatory process that typically takes months.Merck said it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country’s ability to pay. A spokesperson confirmed it is in discussions about expanding licenses for generic molnupiravir "to build sufficient global supply of quality-assured product to meet orders globally."But middle-income countries will be hard pressed to negotiate against the richest nations, another MPP official said.The governments of Australia, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia said they already had deals or were negotiating supply contracts with Merck. The EU is considering buying the pill after Merck applies for authorization in Europe.The eight generic manufacturers chosen by Merck all have WHO pre-qualified facilities to allow them to supply buyers like the Global Fund, according to Paul Schaper, Merck's executive director of global public policy. They will set their pricing and decide how much they plan to manufacture.“What we are anticipating and hoping for is that they will compete with each other on pricing,” Schaper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merck-covid-19-pill-sparks-calls-for-access-for-lower-income-countries-101634527066288.html
18-10-2021||World||China growth slides to 4.9% in third quarter||China's economic growth tumbled more than expected in the third quarter, official data showed Monday, as the property sector struggled with tighter policy measures and an energy crisis loomed.After a swift coronavirus bounceback, recovery in the world's second-biggest economy is losing steam, with gross domestic product growth coming in at 4.9 percent on-year, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), citing an "unstable and uneven" domestic rebound.The latest figure disappointed expectations of 5.0 percent growth predicted by analysts polled by AFP, and was a sharp three percentage points down from the 7.9 percent expansion in the April to June period."We must note that current international environment uncertainties are mounting and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven," NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said Monday.But GDP for the third quarter rose 0.2 percent over the three months before that, authorities added.Meanwhile, industrial production growth slowed further to 3.1 percent on-year in September."Growth was dragged down by a slowdown in real estate, amplified recently by spillover from Evergrande's travails," said Oxford Economics' head of Asia economics Louis Kuijs.The struggles of property giant Evergrande -- under a mountain of debt worth more than $300 billion -- have been weighing on sentiment among prospective buyers.Kuijs noted there was an "additional hit in September" from electricity shortages and production cuts due to strict implementation of climate and safety targets by local governments.He added that the damage was visible in the slowdown of industrial output.Power rationing in recent weeks, along with surging raw material costs and the government's climate push, has led to reduced mining and manufacturing activity.But retail sales picked up to 4.4 percent -- improving from 2.5 percent in August -- with fewer virus containment measures in China, which has imposed swift local lockdowns over a handful of cases.The urban unemployment rate was 4.9 percent last month.The Chinese government is trying to recalibrate the economy to one driven by consumers and away from investment and exports.But officials presently have to walk a fine line between supporting growth and keeping a lid on inflation, with factory-gate prices rising at their fastest rate in a quarter of a century.Despite still-strong foreign demand, factors such as extreme weather and virus outbreaks -- on top of energy shortages and the cooling housing market -- have all weighed on China's economy, analysts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-growth-slides-to-4-9-in-third-quarter-101634524732687.html

By Friday, when some curbs will be lifted, the Australian city of 5 million people will have been under six lockdowns totalling 262 days since March 2020.Australian and other media say this is the longest in the world - exceeding a 234-day lockdown in Buenos Aires, Argentina.While coronavirus cases keep rising in Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, the state’s double-vaccination rate is set to reach 70% this week, allowing for the ease in restrictions.“Today is a great day,” said Victoria premier Daniel Andrews while announcing the lockdown. “Today is a day when Victorians can be proud of what they have achieved.”When hospitality venues and some businesses reopen, their capacity will remain heavily restricted. More easing, including the reopening of many retailers, will come once 80% of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated - estimated by November 5 at the latest.Grand Mosque in Mecca drops social distancingThe Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia operated at full capacity on Sunday, with worshippers praying shoulder-to-shoulder for the first time since the pandemic began.Workers removed floor markings that guide people to social distance in and around the Grand Mosque, which is built around the Kaaba, the cubic structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.Tycoon Robert Durst on ventilator, has Covid-19US real estate mogul Robert Durst, sentenced to life in prison for killing his best friend, has been placed on a ventilator after becoming infected with Covid-19, according to a US media report published on Saturday.Durst, 78, was given a life sentence this week with no possibility of parole after a jury found him guilty of killing his friend in 2000 at her Beverly Hills home to keep her from talking to police about the disappearance of his wife two decades earlier.1 hurt in French nightclub shooting over Covid passTwo men who were refused entry to a French nightclub for producing a fake Covid-19 health pass have been arrested over a shooting at the venue that left one party goer injured, prosecutors said on Sunday.The incident had taken place on Thursday night in the outskirts of the eastern town of Montbeliard.“It has been confirmed that one of the men tried to present a health pass that did not match his identity,” the public prosecutor for the area, Ariane Combarel, told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-gears-up-to-lift-lengthy-covid-lockdown-101634496543761.html

Al-Naba, the IS group’s weekly, has published a warning and it further read that Shia Muslims will be targeted in their homes and strongholds, reported Khaama Press.The statement has especially threatened Shia Muslims living in Afghanistan. From Baghdad to Khorasan, Shia Muslims will be target everywhere, said IS.The warning came after a powerful explosion rattled a Shia mosque in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province on Friday, killing over 60 worshippers while wounding more than 80. The attack was claimed by Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K). On October 8, a terror attack on a Shia mosque in Kunduz had killed more than 100 people.The Taliban have said that not recognising the new government in Afghanistan is benefiting IS-K. While talking to Anadolu Agency, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the official recognition of his government and international aid were important for the country’s recovery.Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s former prime minister Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai passed away at the age of 78, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.Ahmadzai served as prime minister of Afghanistan from 1995-1996 before the Taliban took control of the country.

18-10-2021||India||3 cops suspended after official detained for principal’s disappearance escapes||Bhubaneswar: Three policemen were suspended in western Odisha’s Bolangir on Monday after the president of a private school’s managing committee in neighbouring Kalahandi district who was detained in connection with the disappearance of the school’s principal, escaped from police custody, police said.Three policemen who were responsible for guarding Gobind Sahu have been suspended on charges of dereliction of duty, said Bolangir superintendent of police Kusalkar Nitin Dagdu.Sahu escapad from police barracks in Titlagarh town of Bolangir late on Sunday after being allowed to step out on the pretext of washing his hands after dinner. Sahu was detained on Wednesday last, October 13, for questioning in connection with the disappearance of school principal Mamita Meher on October 8.The missing principal brother, Banti Meher, blamed the principal’s disappearance on the school managing committee’s president, according to the FIR registered by the police. In the FIR, Banti Mehr alleged his sister went missing after she threatened to expose Sahu, who she alleged, harassed the school’s female teachers.In recent days, her family had questioned why the police hadn’t placed Sahu under arrest.Congress MLA from Kantabanji, Santosh Singh Saluja alleged that the delay in arresting the school official could be linked to minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra earlier felicitating at a public event.“It is not possible to hold an impartial inquiry in the matter as long as minister Mishra is at the helm of affairs,” Saluja said.BJP leader Manoj Meher asked why Mishra who is also the local MLA hasn’t made any public comment about the case.Minister of state Dibya Shankar Mishra could not be contacted for his comments. Kalahandi district BJD vice president Jitendra Mohanty denied that there was any link between the school official and the ruling Biju Janata Dal.”The case is still under investigation, so the minister does not want to speak to the meadia on this as it may be interpreted as interfering in the probe,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-cops-suspended-after-official-detained-for-principal-s-disappearance-escapes-101634581593031.html
18-10-2021||India||India, Israel share ties of centuries: Jaishankar||The Indian diaspora in Israel has served as an umbilical cord that has nourished relations between the two nations, and there is a need to better document the heritage and history of the community, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said. Jaishankar made the remarks while interacting with members of the Indian Jewish community and Indologists in Jerusalem on Sunday. He is on his first visit to Israel after becoming foreign minister, and is holding talks with officials to boost bilateral relations.He said he was happy to be in Israel, a “land with which we have ties of centuries”, and amid the Indian Jewish community that has “in many ways been an umbilical cord” that has nourished these relations.Some Indian Jews were “uprooted in more difficult times and moved against their will”, while others made “more prescient choices” to move out of the country, he noted. “But among all of them, I would say that the Indian Jewish community is in many ways very unique because one, like other communities, it is a community that has existed peacefully in India for hundreds of years, which maintained its Jewish identity despite isolation from other Jewish communities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-israel-share-ties-of-centuries-jaishankar-101634581449285.html
18-10-2021||India||Dera chief Ram Rahim, 4 others awarded life sentence in 2002 murder case||Panchkula: A special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation in Panchkula on Monday awarded life sentence to Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and four others convicted in the murder of former dera manager Ranjit Singh in 2002. The four others are Jasbir Singh, a follower; Krishan Lal, a dera manager; Sabdil, gunman of the dera head; and Avtar Singh, a dera functionary. “All five convicts, including Ram Rahim, have been awarded life sentence,” CBI special public prosecutor HPS Verma said. The federal investigative agency had sought the death penalty. Ram Rahim had pleaded for mercy. The court had convicted the dera head and four others on October 8.Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra. “We are satisfied (with the punishment). It has been a long battle for my family. We have lived in fear all these years, but have fought to get justice,” Jagseer Singh, son of Ranjit Singh, said after Monday’s verdict. Ranjit Singh was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter that revealed the sexual exploitation of woman followers at the dera, according to the CBI. In June 2002, Ranjit Singh was summoned to the dera and threatened with dire consequences, but he refused to seek pardon, saying he had done nothing wrong. The dera chief is already serving a 20-year jail term for raping two followers and has been sentenced to life for the murder of a journalist in 2002. Ram Rahim appeared through video-conferencing from Sunaria jail in Rohtak, while the four others were present in the court at the time of the sentencing. The hearing was conducted amid tight security at the Panchkula district court complex. Prohibitory orders were in place against the assembly of five and more people in Panchkula district. There were mainly three cases against the Sirsa-based dera chief since 2002. All were investigated by the CBI. The dera chief has been convicted in two cases, one related to sexual exploitation of women disciples and the other of the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. The third case was Ranjit Singh’s murder. The first conviction was in a sexual exploitation case in August 2017, which had resulted in widespread violence in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Thirty-six people were killed in Panchkula alone in the violence reported after his conviction on August 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dera-chief-ram-rahim-4-others-awarded-life-sentence-in-2002-murder-case-101634581472894.html
18-10-2021||India||4 dead in Uttarakhand; heavy rain claims 41 lives across country||New Delhi: Four people were killed in Uttarakhand on Monday as heavy rain lashed several parts of the country, triggered by western disturbances and low pressure areas in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, taking the rain-related death toll to 41 in the past 48 hours across India.Of the 41 deaths, 35 were reported from Kerala, four from Uttarakhand and one each from Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal. Kerala received extreme rainfall on Friday and Saturday due to a low pressure area in the Arabian Sea. Six districts in central and southern Kerala received over 204mm rain in 48 hours. Peerumedu in Idukki district received the maximum 297mm rainfall. Other parts of the country, such as Chandigarh, Kolkata and Shimla, received the highest single-day rain in October in the past one decade.In Uttarakhand, several roads were blocked as heavy rains threw life out of gear on Monday. While three people died in Lansdowne in Pauri Garhwal district after a shanty collapsed under heavy muck brought in by the rains on Monday morning, a 53-year-old woman died in a similar incident in Champawat district. In the hilly Pithoragarh district, at least 10 roads, including three major arteries — Tanakpur to Pithoragarh, Jauljibi to Munsiyari and Tawaghat- to Darma — were blocked due to landslides, officials said.The state government suspended the char dham yatra and advised pilgrims who arrived in Haridwar and Rishikesh by Sunday not to proceed further till the weather improves. Higher reaches in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh on Monday received snowfall, bringing down day temperatures by at least 5 degrees Celsius. Many rivers, including Sutlej in Himachal Pradesh and Ram Ganga in Uttarakhand, were flowing 3-5 feet above the danger mark, officials said. Uttarkhand received 36.7mm rainfall in the past 24 hrs, whereas Himachal Pradesh received 37.2 mm, almost 40% more than the decadal average of daily rainfall in October in the western Himalayas.The sudden rainfall was owing to confluence of two weather systems (westerlies and easterlies) from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, meteorologist Mohammad Hussain Mir said. “These systems together focused over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and other areas to bring the precipitation,” he said. “This does not happen routinely, but occasionally every 2-3 years.” The unseasonal rainfall has impacted the government’s purchase of farm produce, especially paddy, in western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. However, agriculture department officials in Punjab said there was less impact on paddy procurement in the state as rainfall there was negligible. The rain brought good news to farmers preparing to plant the winter crop, which would be completed by mid-November in the plains of northern India.In eastern India, heavy rainfall, triggered by a low pressure area over West Bengal and northern Odisha, battered districts in southern Bengal, including Kolkata, and coastal parts of Odisha since Sunday night. Some of the India Meteorological Department stations in the coastal districts, such as South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore, received more than 100mm rain in the past 24 hours. The Met department in Jharkhand has issued a yellow alert, a warniong for severe weather, as the state received 89mm rainfall in the past 24 hours. “The total rainfall during post-monsoon in Jharkhand is not very unusual. On many occasions in the past, cyclonic formations have caused more rain in the post-monsoon season in Jharkhand,” said Abhishek Anand, head of the weather department in Ranchi.Bihar also received rainfall in many regions such as Parsa and Amnaur in Saran district, Jandaha in Vaishali and Tarari in Bhojpur districts. The eastern state recorded 110.6mm rain against the normal rain of 53.1 mm between October 1 and October 18, a jump of 108%, official data show. Low pressure over southern Madhya Pradesh and cyclonic circulation over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining northern Odisha caused the rainfall, said CK Singh, meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre. “The untimely rain in the state will have negative impact on crops,” Patna-based agriculture expert Anil Kumar Jha said. “The excess rain that occurred this month has resulted in abundance of moisture in soil. Consequently, farmers will face difficulty in harvesting ready kharif crops, while sowing for rabi crops, including lentils, oilseeds and grams, will be delayed.” Several districts in Madhya Pradesh, such as Sheopur and Agar Malwa, witnessed 200mm to 300mm rainfall in 24 hours. Sheopur recorded 312mm rainfall in the past 24 hours, followed by Datia (177mm), Agar Malwa (107.8mm) and Niwari (101mm), according to the local weather office. In Raisen, Agar Malwa, Sheopur, Datia and other parts of northeast Madhya Pradesh, paddy and Bajra crops ready for harvesting have been damaged, officials said.

18-10-2021||India||Rail Roko: Many stranded, traffic hit as farmers block tracks for six hours||The countrywide call to block rail traffic for six hours by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) against the Lakhimpur Kheri violence evoked strong response in several parts of Haryana, Punjab, parts of Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh. The SKM, a collective of farmer organisations protesting farm reforms, had called for the Rail Roko protest on October 18 to demand the resignation of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, whose son Ashish Mishra has been booked for murder for his alleged involvement in the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh in which eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed earlier this month.Since Indian Railways did not issue any advisory to suspend or divert trains, many passengers were stranded from 10am to 4pm.In Punjab, rail traffic was blocked at several locations in Bathinda, Amritsar and Ludhiana. SKM activists said they staged protests at more than 100 places in Punjab and brought the rail traffic to a standstill.Farmers squatted on railway tracks at several locations in Karnal, Kurukshetra and Panipat districts in Haryana, but served food and water to stranded passengers, officials said. “I had to go to Delhi but there are no trains since morning. Now I am left with no option but to wait here till the movement of trains is restored,” said one Shruti Kumarat Karnal railway station.  “The call was given a week ago and commuters should have avoided travelling,” said Jagdip Singh Aulakh, Karnal district president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni), a constituent of SKM. In western Uttar Pradesh, farmers squatted on rail tracks and staged sit-ins on railway platforms at several places. The protests impacted movement of over a dozen long-distance trains at Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Hapur and Bijnor, railway officials said. Blocking the movement of trains on the Lucknow-Bijnor-Najibabad route at Maujpur railway junction near Najibabad, BKU youth wing’s former state president Digamber Singh said: “The blockade affected the plying of the Chandigarh Express and other trains.”Police including Rapid Action Force personnel were deployed at railway stations and tracks. “No confrontation occurred anywhere and the protest remained peaceful,” said Rajeev Sabbharwal, additional director general of police (Meerut zone). The SKM had exempted Lakhimpur Kheri district from the strike call. “Owing to the already tense situation in Lakhimpur Kheri and also inclement weather hitting paddy farmers here, SKM leaders had called off the rail roko agitation in the district,” said Amandeep Singh Sandhu, district president, BKU (Tikait). In Uttarakhand, trains were stopped in Rudrapur, Kashipur and Khatima areas of Udham Singh Nagar district. “Halting trains is against railway laws. The railway police force will definitely file a case against the protesters,” said KD Kapri, station superintendent of Khatima railway station. There was negligible impact of the railway blockade call elsewhere in the country, with sporadic protests reported from West Bengal, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Rail movement was normal in these states, railway officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-roko-many-stranded-traffic-hit-as-farmers-block-tracks-for-six-hours-101634580633663.html

18-10-2021||India||India, Israel agree to conclude free trade pact by June 2022||India and Israel will resume negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) from November with the intention of signing the long-pending pact by June 2022, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid said on Monday.The two countries held their first round of negotiations on an FTA in May 2010 but a deal has proved elusive. This is the first time the two sides have set a deadline for concluding the talks, reflecting the seriousness attached to the issue.Following his meeting with Lapid in Jerusalem, Jaishankar said the two countries were looking forward to finalising the agreement by the middle of next year.“Our officials have actually agreed on the resumption of the India-Israel free trade negotiations. Starting the negotiating process, talks will start in November and they are very confident that they would be able to conclude the negotiations by next June,” he said.Lapid said the FTA will be “finalised as fast as we can” in the interest of both sides. “We are continuing with our policy of connections, and we have seen in India a very important ally for many years. India also brings with her new opportunities for cooperation,” he said.Since the two countries established diplomatic ties almost three decades ago, bilateral trade has grown from $200 million in 1992 and reached $4.14 billion (excluding defence deals) during April 2020-February 2021. The balance of trade is in India’s favour. <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Very productive talks today with APM and FM <a href=”https://twitter.com/yairlapid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@YairLapid</a>. <br><br>Discussed a wide range of regional and global issues. <br><br>Agreed to resume FTA negotiations next month. <br><br>Agreed in principle on mutual recognition of Covid vaccination certification. <a href=”https://t.co/sir0QDYzx3”>pic.twitter.com/sir0QDYzx3</a></p>&mdash; Dr. S.

Jaishankar said that while procedures are worked out, Israel will allow travel by Indian citizens vaccinated with Covishield, the Indian variant of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The ministers also agreed to expand cooperation in water and agriculture, which, the Israeli side said, has become a “central anchor” of relations in recent years.Jaishankar described his talks with Lapid as “productive” and said they had discussed a range of regional and global issues. Lapid said Jaishankar’s visit is a precursor to events to be held next year to mark 30 years of bilateral relations. Following the meeting of the foreign ministers, a signing ceremony was held to mark Israel’s accession to the International Solar Alliance (ISA), founded in 2015 at the initiative of India and France. Jaishankar and Israeli energy minister Karine Elharrar signed the agreement which will allow Israel to contribute its knowledge and experience to ISA.“What a great pleasure it is to see Israel joining the International Solar Alliance. I think you bring a lot of value to the table. And as we approach COP26, it’s very important to know about our growing agenda – green growth, green economy is given its new place,” Jaishankar said.Elharrar added, “Membership in the ISA, alongside more than 80 countries blessed with sun and promoting solar energy, will enable the state of Israel to contribute to the global struggle against climate change and to advance together solutions for a greener future.”Jaishankar is currently on his first visit to Israel since he became the external affairs minister in 2019. He is holding talks with the top Israeli leadership to boost cooperation in areas ranging from security to trade and climate change. During a meeting with the Israeli business community on Sunday, Jaishankar explored the possibilities in innovation, digital, green growth and health.Lapid and Jaishankar, accompanied by their wives, also visited Shalva Center, a facility caring for children with disabilities and providing support to their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-israel-agree-to-conclude-free-trade-pact-by-june-2022-101634574873352.html

The religious organisation took to Twitter to say that the temple suffered “signifcant damage" during the attack.Earlier in the day, noted lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar took to Twitter to condemn the violence at temples in Bangladesh and criticised the Sheikh Hasina-led Bangladesh government.What is happening in Bangala Desh is a matter of great shame . Those who are trying to crush a vulnerable minority are bullies cowards and sick communalists.

The idol of Srila Prabhupada, the founder of Iskcon, was allgedly desecrated and books were set on fire.ALSO READ | Iskcon authorities seek UN chief, PM’s intervention after attack on temple in BangladeshThe violence at Iskcon temple in Noakhali came days after a series of vandalism were reported at Durga Puja pandals in Comilla, Chandpur, Chitagong and Cox’s Bazar districts, after posts went viral on social media about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a pandal in Comilla district. The mob also clashed with police personnel when they tried to disperse them. Local media reports claim at least three people were killed and several sustained injuries in separate such incidents. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh government ordered a probe into the matter.The Indian government last week said it was in close contact with Bangladeshi authorities over the attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvenduled-delegation-meets-bangladesh-envoy-over-attack-on-iskcon-temple-101634569442386.html
18-10-2021||India||Top executive of pvt firm found murdered in Kolkata house he was trying to sell||KOLKATA: Subir Chaki, managing director of a Mumbai-headquartered engineering firm Kilburn Engineering, and his driver were found murdered on Monday morning in his south Kolkata house that he was trying to sell, police said. Investigators suspect that Chaki, who lives in New Town on the eastern outskirts of Kolkata, may have come to the three-storied house at Kankulia road to seal the deal for the house with a prospective buyer.Chaki and his driver, Rabin Mondal, were found dead with multiple stab wounds on their body including wrists and ankles.Police said the ground floor of the house was rented to a private company and no one lived on the other floors.The two bodies were discovered on Monday when employees of the private company reported for work on Monday morning. “They found the door connecting the ground and first floors shut from the inside, which was unusual,” an officer from the Gariahat police station said on condition of anonymity.“There was nothing valuable in the house that might have led to a robbery,” the officer cited above said.Police said the mobile phones of Chaki and his driver were missing and could have been taken away by the person who killed them.“It seems that the accused knew that Chaki was coming to his Kankulia road home. On earlier occasions, he would send his driver with the keys when prospective buyers wanted to see the property. It is possible that Chaki might have come to collect some payment in cash. Local residents said they heard several people talking inside the house on Sunday evening. They also claimed to have heard a woman’s voice. These claims are being verified,” a second police officer added.An alumnus of St Xavier’s School in Kolkata, IIT-Kharagpur and IIM-Calcutta, Subir Chaki had been with Kilburn Engineering Ltd for more than four years.“His son and daughter live in London and Mumbai, respectively,” the officer added.Rabin Mondal’s son Dilip Mondal said, “My father worked for Chaki for more than 20 years. He used to come home only once a month…. We have no idea what happened.”Police said the autopsy was completed on Monday evening and the bodies were handed over to the families of the two victims.The investigation has been taken up by the detective department of the Kolkata Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-executive-of-pvt-firm-found-murdered-in-kolkata-house-he-was-trying-to-sell-101634572052110.html

18-10-2021||India||‘Will continue to put forth our views till Teni resigns’: Tikait on ‘Rail Roko’ agitation||Following the completion of the six-hour ‘rail roko’ agitation across India, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said the movement was “fine” and that farmer unions will plan their “further strategy.” “Until he (Union home minister of state Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’) is arrested and he resigns, we will continue putting forth our views,” he told news agency ANI.Tikait said that Teni, whose son is an accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, cannot “roam out in the open.” The BKU leader said that Teni will “influence the investigation” into the case and will try to save himself so the Centre must dismiss him as the minister.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body for dozens of farmer unions, called the six-hour-long stir between 10am and 4pm on Monday, demanding the removal of Teni as the Union minister for the involvement of his son Ashish Mishra in the Lakhimpur violence case. As many as eight people, including four farmers, lost their lives in the October 3 incident after two SUVs ran over a group of protesters and the violence that ensued.Throughout the day rail operations were massively impacted due to the agitation with farmers blocking the railway tracks in several areas in Haryana and Punjab by staging sit-ins and even squatting on them. Authorities in Haryana’s Sonipat railway station deployed personnel of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) in order to maintain security.As many as 50 trains across 130 locations in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan were affected due to the ‘rail roko’ agitation, ANI reported quoting a Northern Railway official. However, no such case was reported from Uttar Pradesh where police have imposed Section 144 of CrPC, prohibiting gathering of multiple people in one area.As per the latest updates, 10 accused have so far been arrested by the police, including Ashish Mishra. Sumit Jaiswal, Shishupal, Nandan Singh and Satya Prakash Tripathi were arrested on Monday by Lakhimpur Police and the SWAT team of the crime branch, according to ANI. Mishra and his alleged accomplice Ashish Pandey were denied bail by a court in Lakhimpur Kheri last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-rail-roko-tikait-says-will-continue-such-protests-till-teni-resigns-101634569134297.html
18-10-2021||India||'Cannot cut corners': WHO says awaiting additional information on Bharat Biotech's Covaxin||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday said it cannot cut corners to recommend Covaxin’s inclusion in the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for vaccination against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The UN health agency said it is expecting one additional piece of information from Covaxin manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, which has been submitting data to the WHO on a rolling basis.“We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners - before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective,” the WHO said in a series of tweets.The WHO’s nod for Covaxin’s emergency use authorisation is necessary for its widespread acceptability as a safe and effective vaccine around the world. Covaxin’s emergency use listing would encourage other countries to ease travel measures for those vaccinated with the India-made vaccine.“The timeframe for the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure is dependent on how quickly a company producing the vaccine is able to provide the data required for WHO to evaluate the vaccine’s quality, safety, efficacy and its suitability for low- and middle-income countries,” the WHO posted on Twitter.On Sunday, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that the technical advisory group will meet on October 26 to decide on the emergency use listing of Covaxin. She added that the WHO’s goal is to have a broad portfolio of vaccines approved for emergency use and to expand access to populations everywhere.While the decision has been delayed multiple times, the Hyderabad-based company has maintained that it doesn’t find it “appropriate to speculate or comment on approval process and its timelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-cut-corners-who-says-awaiting-additional-information-on-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-101634568304903.html
18-10-2021||India||Foreign ministers of India, Israel, US and UAE to hold virtual meeting||India, Israel, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are set to build on the momentum created by the Abraham Accords by holding the first virtual meeting of their foreign ministers on Monday.The meeting, described in some quarters as a “new Quad”, will be joined by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid from Jerusalem, US secretary of state Antony Blinken from Washington and UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan from Abu Dhabi. Jaishankar is currently on a visit to Israel.India, Israel and the UAE have already stepped up trilateral cooperation, especially in trade and investment, since the US brokered the Abraham Accords between the two West Asian countries in August 2020. This meeting will be the first to bring the four countries together on a common platform.The meeting also dovetails with India’s efforts to build new plurilateral and multilateral partnerships focused on cooperation in areas ranging from security to connectivity and energy. India has robust defence, security and trade cooperation with Israel and the US, while the UAE is a key energy partner. The UAE is also home to more than three million Indians, and security cooperation has been growing rapidly, with the first-ever visit by an Indian Army chief taking place last year.There was no official word from the four countries for the agenda of Monday’s meeting.India has backed the Abraham Accords process, following which Israel also normalised relations with Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. The external affairs ministry has said these efforts are in line with India’s support for “peace and stability in West Asia which is our extended neighbourhood”.In May this year, India, Israel and the UAE concluded the first trilateral partnership whereby an Israel-based company will be producing a robotic solar cleaning technology in India for a project in the UAE.A statement issued at the time by the Israeli embassy in New Delhi said the Abraham Accords agreement between Israel and the UAE had “paved the way for friendships and business partnerships across the region”. The statement added, “India being a friend of both the UAE and Israel is clearly the preferred partner to leverage the global potential of the UAE, Israel and India trilateral.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-foreign-ministers-of-india-israel-us-and-uae-to-hold-virtual-meeting-101634565812205.html
18-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 19, 2001 — Asha Bhonsle gets Dada Saheb Phalke award for her contribution to cinema||New Delhi- This is one award over which there will be no dispute. Asha Bhonsle was today honoured with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award for her contribution to cinema. In the world of Indian films, there is no greater prize. And there is no argument over Asha Bhonsle’s greatness.“I am very happy. It is a great honour for me,” said Asha when she heard about the award. But the news would also have been music to the ears of the vast legion of her fans around the world.For nearly half a century, her voice has captivated audiences in India and abroad. O.P. Nayyar fans get nostalgic when they hear her songs and the MTV generation taps its feet to remixed versions.Asha lived for many years under the shadow of her equally popular sister, Lata Mangeshkar, who was initially preferred by music composers in the highly competitive music environment of the fifties.When Asha was struggling, Lata, Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum and Suraiya were all household names. Nayyar took her under his wing and she rendered some of the most memorable solo numbers heard in Hindi films.“Piya, piya na laage mora jiya...” from Phagun and “Le ke pehia, pehia pyar...” (CID) with Shamshad and Rafi ushered in not only an era of melody but also gave Punjabi folk music a big boost.It was O.P Nayyar who, by never ever using Lata’s voice, became instrumental in shaping Asha’s career. The two, however, parted ways during the making of Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye when Asha sang her last song for Nayyar, “Chain se humko kabhi...”Asha’s parting with Nayyar coincided with the beginning of another great partnership: this time with Rahul Dev Burman, whom she eventually married.The Pancham-Asha combination took the world of music by storm and hit after hit resulted. “Chura liya hai tumnejo dil ko, nazar nahin churana sanam...” from Yaadon Ki Barat and “O mere sona re, sona re, sona...” from Teesri Manzil are just two songs that come to mind. Asha Bhonsle hasn’t just survived through the ages. She has thrived. From working with Shankar-Jaikishan for Raj Kapoor’s magnum opus Mera Naam Joker to singing playback for Karisma Kapoor in Dil To Pagal Hai she has done it all. Of course, her fans would say, there’s lots more to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-19-2001-asha-bhonsle-gets-dada-saheb-phalke-award-for-her-contribution-to-cinema-101634565091765.html
18-10-2021||India||Eye on Raipur, Chhattisgarh’s TS Singhdeo back in Delhi to meet Cong leadership||RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singhdeo, who had to cut short his Delhi visit due to infant deaths in his constituency, returned to the national capital on Monday to continue efforts to reach out to Congress leadership, people familiar with the matter said.Singhdeo’s visit comes against the backdrop of speculation that the health minister is nudging the party leadership to take an early call on his reported two and a half year power-sharing agreement with chief minister Bhupesh Baghel after the Congress won 68 of 90 seats in the 2018 assembly elections. According to this reported pact, TS Singhdeo, who was one of the claimants in 2018, agreed to let Bhupesh Baghel be the chief minister for the first half of the assembly’s five-term term on the assurance that his turn would come in 2021.Both, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and health minister TS Singhdeo, have made several visits to Delhi over the last few months.Singhdeo took a flight to Delhi on Saturday and expected to spend a couple of days in the city but had to return to Chhattisgarh on Sunday after news emerged about the death of four infants in a government medical college in Ambikapur, which falls in his constituency.On Monday, he was back in Delhi.Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was already in Delhi over the weekend for the Congress Working Committee (CWC). Baghel reached Delhi on Friday and after the meeting of the Congress’ highest policy-making body on Saturday, also met Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Baghel hasn’t spoken about his meeting with Priyanka Gandhi but a leader close to him insisted that this meeting focussed on Uttar Pradesh politics, not Chhattisgarh.“Nothing about the power-sharing formula was discussed in the meeting on Saturday evening; neither was there any hint about it… The discussion was about the strategy of upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh,” said the functionary who spoke on condition of anonymity. Baghel was appointed as the party’s senior observer for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections expected early next year.Singhdeo hasn’t spoken after landing in Delhi on Monday but when he left on Saturday, he did insist that it was a “routine visit”.“If I get time with senior Congress leaders of Delhi, I will definitely meet them,” the health minister said.A Congress leader in Chhattisgarh said Singhdeo was trying to meet the party leadership in Delhi to talk about the 2018 power-sharing formula. “Some political developments are expected in the next couple of days,” he said.Political commentators in Chhattisgarh said it was time the Congress takes a call on the reported power-sharing agreement.“Every week, there are rumours about the power-sharing formula in Chhattisgarh… Everyone in the state is in confusion… It would be good for Congress high command to send a concrete message and resolve this issue as soon as possible,” said Sudeip Shrivastava, a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-raipur-chhattisgarh-s-ts-singhdeo-back-in-delhi-to-meet-cong-leadership-101634564430982.html

Tewari also said that many terrorist organisations across South Asia and the larger Middle East region have been encouraged by the Islamic group’s violent and rapid takeover of Afghanistan after the withdrawal of US and allied troops in August.“The blowback that we are seeing in J&K should have been anticipated after the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan,” Manish Tewari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“It has been two months since the Taliban have captured Afghanistan. Every radical and extremist outfit, not only in South Asia but across the largest middle eastern region, has been emboldened by this takeover,” he added.Also read | ‘Grim situation in J&K fallout of strategic blunders by Modi govt’: KhargeAs many as 11 people have been killed in Jammu and Kashmir—four over the weekend—particularly those from other states. Among those killed on Saturday and Sunday in three separate incidents, three were from Bihar and one was from Uttar Pradesh. Several political leaders have condemned the killings as the Union territory witnessed a bloody week after the counter-terror operations were intensified from October 11.Meanwhile, another Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday criticised the Union government for the situation in J&K, which he described as “grim.” “At-least 30 civilians, including locals, local minorities & immigrants from other states, have been killed by terrorists this year,” Kharge pointed to the spurt in violence against civilians as he tweeted. “Situation in J&K is grim. It's a fallout of the failed policies & strategic blunders by Modi govt. No course correction in sight,” he added.The Congress party, during its working committee meeting on Saturday last week, has condemned the targeted killings of minorities by terrorists and held the Union government responsible. “J&K has been a Union Territory for two years. The entire responsibility for bringing the perpetrators of these barbaric crimes to justice is that of the Union Government. Restoring social peace and harmony and confidence amongst the people in J&K rests with the Modi government too,” president Sonia Gandhi said in her opening address at the meeting.Also read | Shadowy group claims responsibility for attack on migrant workers in J&KThe Centre has in the past expressed concerns about the security implications for India and the region in general, after the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. Defence minister Rajnath Singh has made references to the political developments of the past two months in Kabul in several of his speeches since then. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too discussed the issue with Union home minister Amit Shah and the top officials of his government, including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.The Taliban recaptured Afghanistan since the US announcement of a phased withdrawal of troops from the war-torn nation and by August 15 they reached the gates of the capital city Kabul. Ashraf Ghani, the then PM fled the country and after the full withdrawal of US troops by August 31, the Taliban formed an interim administration with Mullah Hasan Akhund as the PM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-manish-tewary-ties-attacks-in-j-k-to-rise-of-taliban-says-should-ve-anticipated-blowback-101634561622769.html
18-10-2021||India||Protests against Bangladesh violence rock Assam’s Barak Valley||More than ten thousand people in three districts of Barak Valley part of Assam on Monday gathered to protest violence on religious minorities in Bangladesh. They burnt Bangladesh’s National flag, attempted to cross Indo-Bangadesh international border and called for boycotting Bangladeshi products, officials said. The protest was called by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) where members of several organisations, including Bharat Sevasram Sangha, Sankar Math, Gauriya Math, Bajrang Dal, women’s wing of RSS, joined.In Karimganj district, where the border is divided by the Kushiyara river, hundreds of protesters attempted to cross it and go to Bangladesh. While in Hailakandi, Bangladesh’s national flag was burnt to mark the protest.The protesters sent memorandums to prime minister Narendra Modi and requested the government to stop all kinds of trades with Bangladesh. They also blamed that Bangladesh is trying to vacate the Hindus and this act of violence is part of that conspiracy.Former MLA from Karimganj district and senior BJP leader Ranjan Das said, “If India cuts all the trade relations with Bangladesh, like we did it with Pakistan in past, the country will be bound to starve. Also, India is the largest consumer of Bangladesh’s food products. We are going to boycott each and every food product coming from Bangladesh. We have sent a letter to prime minister Narendra Modi and requested him to give a strong message to Bangladesh so that the Hindus living there don’t face harassment anymore.”President of Karimganj BJP, Subrata Bhattacharjee, said, “Bangladesh has forgotten that India saved them from Pakistan and gave them the identity of an independent nation. Our forces won the war against Pakistan in 1971 and if we wanted, the entire country would have been part of India at that time. The people attacking Hindus in Bangladesh should understand that we can do this even today if required.”After taking out a massive rally in Karimganj district, the protesters gathered at the bank of Kushiyara and suddenly some people jumped into the river. They said, “We are going to Bangladesh to protect the Hindus there.” However, border security forces stopped them and requested not to do this again.In Cachar district, the rally started from Subhash Nagar ground and thousands of protesters gathered in front of the deputy commissioner’s office.VHP leader Mithun Nath while addressing the protesters, said, “We worshipped the same idol here which were vandalised in Bangladesh. I was surprised to see people dancing here on the streets while going for immersion. As if they don’t know what is happening with the Hindus in Bangladesh and how the idols of Maa Durga were vandalised there. It’s time we started thinking of ourselves as global Hindus and stop pretending as seculars.”Purna Chandra Mandal from VHP said, “It has been proven that the Quran was placed along with Durga idol by a Muslim man in Cumilla pandal. Still, more than 200 pandals across 30 districts in Bangladesh were vandalised by Muslims. ISKON temple, where there was no Durga Puja, was attacked and devotees were killed. It is a part of a conspiracy to vacate Hindus from Bangladesh. If this continues, we’ll enter into Bangladesh’s territory in mass numbers to protect our brothers and sisters.”He appealed to the Muslims in India to protest against the acts of violence in Bangladesh. He said, “...If they do not condom the act of violence in Bangladesh, we will consider that they are supporting it. It is time to make it clear that we are not going to act like hypocrites. There will be violence against violence.”Mrinmayanananda Maharaj from Bharat Sevasram Sangha, Vigyananda Maharaj from Sankar math, Abhayacharan Krishna Gauriya Math, Santanu Naik from the VHP also spoke during the protest in Silchar.Meanwhile, some other leaders also raised voice against violence in Bangladesh and also questioned the government of India for being a silent spectator.Former deputy speaker of Assam assembly and a senior BJP leader, Aminul Haque Laskar, said, “Sheikh Hasina once said that the Hindus in Bangladesh have their right to practice religion and festival is for everyone. But her inactive attitude after the Durga Puja incident is helping the miscreants attack more and more Hindus. I appeal to her to prove that she cares for Hindus residing in Bangladesh and take some appropriate steps.”Rajya Sabha MP from West Bengal and former MP from Silchar, Sushmita Dev questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on this matter. She said, “India gives maximum credit line to Bangladesh when it comes to international trade. Now, when Hindus are being killed in Bangladesh, Narendra Modi is silent. At one point, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma said that Hindus are safe in Bangladesh and there is no reason for more migration. But we can see how safe they are.”Echoing Sushmita Dev’s remarks, Assam Congress’s working President Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha said, “I think Modi ji is too impressed by hilsa fish and mangoes of Bangladesh that he ate.

But now, terrorists are killing poor people in Srinagar. This is really saddening,” news agency ANI quoted Malik, who is known for unfettered speeches, as saying.He was also quoted saying the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will not do well in election-bound states if the demands of farmers are not addressed.BJP leaders declined to comment on Malik’s remarks and dodged queries over them.Malik served as the J&K governor from August 2018 to October 2019 before the state was bifurcated into two union territories. During his stint as the J&K governor, Malik was in the eye of a storm in 2018 when he claimed he did not receive People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti’s fax staking claim to form the government as his fax machine was not working. The PDP made a pitch to form government after the coalition government it ran with the BJP collapsed.Also Read | Reconsider India-Pak T20 World Cup match: Union minister Giriraj SinghSpeaking to reporters in Rajasthan on Sunday, Malik said the issue of securing Minimum Support Price through legislation should be resolved.

Malik also raised the issue of casualties and the non-payment of compensation. He was quoted to have said that 600 farmers have died during nationwide protests against three farm laws enacted last year.

18-10-2021||India||Migrant workers killed in Kashmir could barely make ends meet||The five migrant workers killed in Kashmir this month were poor street vendors and labourers barely making ends meet hundreds of kilometres away from their homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi from Bihar were shot dead at Wanpoh in Kulgam district in the latest in a series of targeted attacks that have left 11 people dead this month. The attack on Sunday was the third on migrant workers in two days. Arvind Kumar Sah, a resident of Banka in Bihar, was killed in Srinagar and Sageer Ahmad, a carpenter from Saharanpur, was shot dead in Pulwama on Saturday. On October 5, Virender Paswan, 55, also from Bihar, was killed in Srinagar.Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi’s fellow workers said the two had been working as labourers in Wanpoh and earned ₹500-700 daily. “We were sitting in our room when we heard that some people in another room were shot at. We took them to the hospital,” said Muhammad Zulfikar, a construction worker from Bihar living in Wanpoh. Another worker said one of the two killed in Wanpoh was shot six times.News agency ANI quoted the mother of Joginder Reshi saying he had been in Kashmir for around four months. “He is survived by three children. The government should help us,” she said.Also Watch: What non-Kashmiri workers said while fleeing amid targeted terror attacks Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi, who were in their late 20s, were killed a day after Ahmad, 53, the carpenter, was shot dead in Pulwama while he was doing the dishes. He is survived by four daughters and son, who lost their mother six months ago. “He has four daughters and a son who works in Rajasthan. Saghir had gone for work far away from his family because of the poverty. If there would have been work here, why would he have gone hundreds of kilometres away from home,” Ahmad’s brother, Muhammad Naeem told journalists on Sunday. He demanded strict punishment for the killers of his brother.“His son was also forced to go to Rajasthan for work; so bad is the condition. They have nobody to take care of them except us uncles. The government should provide help of ₹one crore for my nieces.”Ahmad was killed on the day Sah, 30, was shot dead in Srinagar. Sah sold golgappa and would earn ₹300 to 400 daily. He lived in Srinagar’s Hawal areas along with a group of migrant workers. Sah, who had been working in Kashmir from a decade, is survived by parents and four brothers. He had been home earlier this year.Paswan, who earned ₹200 to 300 daily and is survived by four daughters and two sons, had not been home since 2019 as he wanted to save money for the education of his children, said one of his friends who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-killed-in-kashmir-barely-made-ends-meet-101634559570666.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a yellow alert across 11 districts from Wednesday even as the death toll from flash flood and landslides in the state rose to 35. The yellow alert indicates severely bad weather that could change for the worse and cause disruptions in the day-to-day activities. It was issued as water levels rose sharply in many reservoirs due to heavy rains in catchment areas. A red alert was issued to 10 dams in the state and shutters of Kakki dam in Pathanamthitta were opened. Pilgrimage to hill temple of Sabarimala was suspended due to a rise in water level in Pambba and other rivers, said state minister K Rajan. Rajan added after opening the gates of Kakki dam, water level in Pambha river will go up by at least 15 cm and pilgrimage in the prevailing situation was not advisable. Many pilgrims, who arrived Kottayam and Pathanamthitta from neighbouring states, were sent back.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan chaired an emergency meeting on Monday to review the situation and constituted an expert committee to regulate release of water from some of the dams. The expert panel includes weather experts, hydrologists, structural engineers and climatologists. It will monitor water levels in all dams. “We are closely monitoring the situation,” Vijayan said.The water-level in Idukki reservoir, Asia’s biggest arch dam, rose on Monday and prompted an orange alert. Idukki Member of Parliament Dean Kuriakose has asked the government to open some of its gates.The IMD said the state is likely to receive fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy downpour for three to four days starting Wednesday. The government has opened more relief camps and advised people not to return to their damaged homes. Also Watch | Kerala Rain: House swept away by floodwaters; yellow alert in 11 districts The state received heavy rainfall on Friday and Saturday, which triggered flash floods and landslides in Kottayam and Idukki districts.

Among eight dead in Kokkayar, five were children. In Kottayam district, the toll from rain-related mishaps rose to 14.Opposition leader V D Satheesan, who visited landslide-affected areas, said the relief operation was delayed and warning was not conveyed properly. “In some of the affected areas, rescue teams reached a day after the mishap. Despite strong warning, how did it happen? We need an answer from the government,” he said.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP S Ventakeshan, who represents Madurai, Tamil Nadu, has written to Thakur calling the move “disgusting”, and claiming that “marketing of historical treasures may have an adverse impact on the polity and tranquillity of the country”. Prabhu Chawla, editorial director at the New Indian Express, too, questioned the move. “If it is true, then how can PB sell India’s recorded history to private players including foreigners? Would GOI [government of India] pay the foreigners for its future use? Brits took away earlier records. Now this? Who is an insider working for outsiders,” Chawla wrote on Twitter. Responding to criticism, Prasar Bharati chief executive officer (CEO) Shashi Shekhar Vempati said the policy in question was being misinterpreted. “There is no such decision. A recently notified policy for syndicating content rights seems to have been misinterpreted,” he replied on Twitter. Vempati further clarified that the copyrights for all the footage will remain with Prasar Bharati. HT on Saturday reported that Prasar Bharti is planning to allow satellite TV channels and internet streaming content providers the option of purchasing archival content rights that dates back to before the Independence, a move meant to boost revenues and digitisation. Also Read: Prasar Bharati to auction archival, premium content to boost revenueThe content includes a trove of rich footage, such as the constituent assembly debates and of moments that were significant milestones for the country. These will be syndicated to bidders through an e-auction, the notified policy said.“The policy will ensure that archival and premium content of Prasar Bharati is syndicated to third parties through an open and transparent mechanism of e-auction in order to fetch the maximum market value of content on demand basis,” Prasar Bharati said in a notification dated October 8. “Prasar Bharati, the Public Service Broadcaster has played a key role in modern times in preservation and promotion of Indian culture, history and values. This has been the key factor in content creation since [its ] inception. Prasar Bharati has accumulated rich and heritage content in its centralised repository at archives as well as a number of stations, kendras located in all corners of the nation. News division of AIR (All India Radio) & DD (Doordarshan) too have an illustrious recording of many important milestones of development of India,” it added. “The TV channels as well as the new channels on OTT (over-the-top services) are continuously looking for good saleable content. This has created a demand for programme content of Prasar Bharati in India and overseas for the purpose of broadcast as well as streaming on Digital Platforms,” the notification said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prasar-bharati-policy-to-auction-archival-content-courts-controversy-101634557890686.html

The authorities imposed prohibitory orders against the assembly of five or more people in the entire district anticipating violence by the followers of the convicted godman. As many as 36 people were killed in Panchkula in August 2017 after a local court convicted Gurmeet Ram Rahim in a rape case.The self-styled godman was produced before a special CBI court in Panchkula on October 12, but the court reserved its order on the quantum of sentence and decided to hear the case on Monday. A former follower of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Ranjit Singh was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native village in Kurukshetra's Khanpur Kolian.ALSO READ | 6 years since Bargari sacrilege, SIT probe revolves around local Dera followers, Ram Rahim yet to be grilledThe Central Bureau of Investigation officials in their chargesheet said Ranjit Singh was murdered as Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter highlighting the sexual exploitation of female disciples on the Dera premises.Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is already serving a 20-year jail term for raping two followers and has been sentenced to life for the murder of a journalist in 2002.According to a report published in Hindustan Times, at least three cases were lodged against Gurmeet Ram Rahim between 2002 and 2003.

The attack on Sunday was the third on migrant workers in two days. Arvind Kumar Sah, a resident of Banka in Bihar, was killed in Srinagar and Sageer Ahmad, a carpenter from Saharanpur, was shot dead in Pulwama on Saturday. Five of the 11 civilians killed this month in Kashmir were migrant workers.United Liberation Front (ULF) claimed responsibility for the attack in Wanpoh. In a statement circulated on the social media, ULF said the attack was carried out as a reprisal to what it claimed the “lynching of 200 Muslims only in Bihar” in last one year by “Hindutva forces”. There is no record of 200 lynchings in last year in Bihar.Umar Wani, who claimed to be a spokesman for the ULF in the statement, said: “As already warned all non local stooges to leave our land or get ready for what they deserve. This was retaliatory strikes against the atrocities committed by Indian occupational forces against innocent civilians.”ULF and The Resistance Front, another shadowy group, earlier claimed responsibility for other targeted attacks on the civilians. Shadowy groups are known to claim responsibilities for such attacks to provide plausible deniability to proscribed terrorist groups. ULF is most likely a front for Pakistan based terror groups, and its claim could not immediately be verified.Also Read: Tejashwi Yadav slams Nitish Kumar after 2 from Bihar killed in Jammu & KashmirHT has reached out to the J&K administration for a comment on the claim and this copy will be updated when it responds.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami, a four-time legislator from Kulgam, condemned the Wanpoh attack as barbaric and added such incidents have no place in a civilised society. “Killing innocent labourers who have come here to earn their livelihood is a heinous crime. This is aimed at targeting the interests of people of Kashmir and this is happening at a time when the harvesting season is at its peak. Mere condemnation is not enough. It is time for all of us to come forward and unitedly raise our voice against these criminals who are committing such heinous crimes,” Tarigami said in a statement.

However, the BJP has increased the fuel prices so much that now it is more difficult for the middle class to travel by road,” she tweeted in Hindi and attached a newspaper clipping comparing aviation turbine fuel prices with that of petrol and diesel.Aviation fuel costs ₹79 per litre while petrol ₹105.84 a litre in Delhi.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at the government by posting a news clipping saying if taxes were not increased, the prices of petrol and diesel would have been ₹66 and ₹55 per litre. “Sabka vinash, mehengaai ka vikas (destruction of all, development of rising prices),” he tweeted.Also Read | ‘Priyanka Gandhi will be Congress’ face in UP elections’: Party leader PL PuniaPetrol prices in most places in the country have been above the ₹100-a-litre mark.

18-10-2021||India||‘Committed a sin’: BJP slams Congress over alleged anti-Sardar Patel remarks in CWC meet||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday accused the Congress of “committing a sin” over alleged remarks targeting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which, it said, were made during the Congress Working Committe (CWC) meet on October 16. Citing a media report, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra questioned if Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former chief Rahul Gandhi would reprimand Tariq Hameed Karra, who reportedly made anti-Patel remarks.“Tariq Hameed Karra said that it was only Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister, who integrated Jammu and Kashmir with India, while Sardar Patel tried his best not to let this happen. He also said that Patel conspired with Jinnah to keep J&K away from India,” Patra said at a media interaction, adding that the entire episode raised a few questions.Patra then sought to know from Sonia and Rahul Gandhi if they objected to the “vilification” of Sardar Patel. Describing Karra's behaviour at the CWC as “peak sycophancy,” the BJP leader further said, “He himself comes from Jammu and Kashmir, and his only objective was to establish Rahul Gandhi as the next Congress president. This is why he glorified the Gandhi family. One family did everything, and others did absolutely nothing. How can the Congress have such a mentality?”This proved that the Grand Old Party will insult national heroes just to raise the legacy of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Patra further said.A former leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Karra joined the Congress in 2017. A former MP from the Sri Nagar Lok Sabha constituency, he is the first politician from the Valley to be nominated as a member of the CWC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-a-sin-bjp-slams-congress-over-alleged-anti-patel-remarks-in-cwc-meet-101634544363745.html

18-10-2021||India||Delhi reports first death due to dengue, 723 total cases this year||Delhi last week reported its first death due to mosquito-borne viral illness dengue this year, according to a weekly report by municipal authorities. The city has reported 723 cases of dengue so far in 2021 including 382 in October alone. The report said 243 cases of dengue were reported in just one week. In comparison, 395 cases of dengue were reported during the same period last year. There were 644 cases reported in the same period of the year in 2019. Delhi faced its worst dengue outbreak in 2015 when nearly 16,000 people were affected and 60 died.Dengue causes fever, body ache, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases fatal drop in blood pressure or internal bleeding. Dengue came into prominence amid a waning Covid-19 pandemic after it was identified as one of the diseases, along with scrub typhus and leptospirosis, which claimed at least 51 lives, mostly of children, in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. This year along with the mild type 1 dengue, the severe type 2 is also in circulation in parts of the country.There are four serotypes of dengue virus. Type 1 and 3 are the milder serotypes while type 2 and 4 are associated with severe disease. Patients suffering from serotypes 1 and 3 have symptoms like fever, headache, body ache, and pain behind the eyes. Type 2 is associated with more severe disease leading to drop in platelet count, inability to form blood clots, and internal bleeding. Type 4 is associated with leaking of fluids from the capillaries leading to drop in blood pressure and circulatory shock (not enough blood reaching the organs).Also Read | Dengue outbreak in Chandigarh: Hospitals face challenge of high platelets’ demandOfficials previously said the surge in cases of dengue was late this year because of the delayed monsoon and sporadic heavy showers followed by dry spells that promote the breeding of the aedes aegypti mosquito which spreads the infection. The aedes aegypti mosquito breeds in clean, stagnant water. Monsoon showers lead to water collection across the city, increasing the breeding grounds for the mosquito.Usually, the number of cases starts increasing in July after the monsoon showers and peak in October. The life cycle of the mosquito is eight to 10 days. Experts suggest cleaning out all stagnant, clean water sources every week. This is the basis of the Delhi government’s “10 hafte, 10 baje, 10 minute” campaign to prevent mosquito breeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reports-first-death-due-to-dengue-723-cases-this-year-101634542889098.html

18-10-2021||India||Small to medium-sized drones allowed for personal trips to domestic travel||The civil aviation ministry has allowed travellers to carry small to medium-sized drones for personal trips to domestic destinations without major restrictions for their carriage. They can be carried either in hand or checked-in luggage depending on the size. Major airlines allow drones in check-in baggage.“If drones are asked to be mandatorily checked-in, it is because of individual airline policy and not a regulatory requirement,” said a ministry official, who did not want to be named. “When drones are accepted as check-in baggage, the batteries need to be removed and carried in carry-on baggage only.”There will be no restrictions for spare batteries if their watt-hour (WH) is less than 100. The ministry has allowed a maximum of two batteries if the WH is over 100 but less than 160 WH with the approval of the airlines. “No spare batteries are allowed if WH is more than 160,” said the official.There are five categories of drones based on their weight. Nano drones weigh up to 250 grams, micro drones between 250 grams and 2 kg, small drones between 2 and 25 kg, medium drones between 25 and 150 kg, and large drones over 150 kg.“Nano drones can be carried in hand baggage with batteries in the passenger cabin or checked-in baggage (without batteries). Ideally, it is advisable to carry Nano drones in hand-carry baggage and not in checked-in baggage, as these drones have Lithium batteries and hence the potential risk of fire...,” the official said. He said security personnel at airports will detect lithium with online screening and offload nano drones.Officials cited a risk assessment and said it was concluded that drones with batteries over 160 WH must be shipped as cargo. “However still the risk is that in passenger baggage, due to handling and movement, lithium can catch fire. Due to this, most airlines allow the same to travel in-cabin baggage since all crew is trained to handle any incident of fire or smoke in the cabin due to lithium,” the official said.Also Read | ‘J&K IAF bases guarded against drones’: NSG DGThe government has hence clarified that drones smaller in size with batteries must be carried as cabin bags. It added for large drones, small batteries of lithium must be removed. Larger drones with batteries (160 WH) will have to be carried in cargo compartments with proper smoke detection and fire suppression. Passengers have been mandated to take prior approval from the airlines before carrying drones.Drone Federation of India director Smit Shah welcomed the move. “Drones have already started becoming a common technology for Indians and with this allowance of air carriage, it will further...help the drone industry grow. Also, this clarification was required for quite some time now as many drone companies faced issues while transporting their equipment which was taking days because they had to be transported via roadways. With these specifications by MoCA (the ministry of civil aviation), there will now be a set way to transport drones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-clarifies-norms-for-carrying-drones-by-air-travellers-can-fly-with-small-to-medium-size-drones-101634541149164.html

Strange logic in respect of a government-OWNED hospital!” Chidambaram tweeted on Monday. “Why does the Goa government have a Department of Health and a Minister of Health, if they are not responsible?”Chidambaram, who is the Congress’s election observer for poll-bound Goa, called for chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane’s resignations.As many as 84 people died at the Goa Medical College and Hospital between May 10 and 14 amid interruptions in oxygen supply. The three-member committee’s report said the hospital administration failed to flag the issue in time. But it concluded the deaths could not attribute to the shortage of oxygen. The committee insisted it did not find anything unusual in the number of deaths as compared to the other days.The Goa Association of Resident Doctors first flagged the issue of oxygen shortage on May 3. After the high court took up the matter, Rane called for a probe into the deaths.Also Read: These 7 states and UTs have vaccinated entire adult population with first Covid-19 doseThe committee said there were reports of “pressure drops during the changeover of empty (cylinder) trolleys”. It added this caused panic among patients and health care workers, but they “could not conclude that such intermittent incidents of drop in pressure were long enough to cause loss of life.” Experts say low levels of saturation can cause deaths.The committee was initially expected to give its report in three days on May 15. But a member of the panel had to be replaced after he took ill. This delayed the panel’s report until July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chidambaram-slams-goa-govt-s-clean-chit-to-itself-over-oxygen-deaths-101634540549583.html

Jaishankar said that the community has been, in many ways, "an umbilical cord" that has nourished the ties between India and Israel.The foreign minister said that the Indian Jewish community carried some flavours of India with it to Israel which they have retained, or assimilated in some form. "I am told, for example, that the distinctive Malida thali made by the Bene Israelis - and Malida is now officially incorporated in the local calendar here. Likewise, the influence of the mangalsutra and the mehendi among Bene Israelis, the practice of baat pukka for formalizing marriages among Baghdadi Jews, and symbolic adorning of the Torah arks with jasmine garlands and the use of manara by the Cochini Jews," said Jaishankar."You also adopted that very Indian tradition of removing shoes before entering the synagogue. And you all still remember our way of life, our languages, our festivals, and, I am told about the Maiboli journal in Marathi," he added.Talking about the festivals, Jaishankar said Onam, Holi and Diwali are celebrated in Israel along with Purim and Hanukkah.Citing ancient connections between the two civilizations - both cultural and religious, Jaishankar applauded the contribution of Indian Jews in the nation building process of India, describing them as "one of us"."India’s connections with Jerusalem goes back 800 years in time. One of our revered Sufi saints, Baba Farid, meditated in a cave inside the city walls in Jerusalem. And this place later has become a shrine and a pilgrim lodge for travelers from India," said Jaishankar.Jaishankar also highlighted the community's contributions in enriching India's literature and arts with the likes of Nissim Ezekiel who was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi award.Later, he posted about the interaction on Twitter and said he is confident that the Indian Jewish community will bring the two countries closer."Very pleased to meet the Indian Jewish community in Israel. Valued their manifold contribution to India-Israel ties. Confident that they will bring us even closer together in the coming years," said Jaishankar.Very pleased to meet the Indian Jewish community in Israel.

18-10-2021||India||'Attacks on Durga Puja pandals pre-planned': Bangladesh home minister||The Bangladesh home minister has said that the attacks on Durga Puja pavilions were 'pre-planned' and aimed at destroying communal harmony in the country. His statement came after the Bangladesh police booked more than 4,000 individuals in connection with the violence that rocked the country in the last few days."It appears to us that it was a motivated act instigated by a vested group," Bangladesh's minister for home affairs Asaduzzaman Khan said on Sunday."Not only in Comilla, but attempts were also made to destabilize the country previously through communal violence in Ramu and Nasirnagar," Khan was quoted as saying by Dhaka Tribune.When asked about the reason behind the incident in Comilla, the minister said, "We'll make it public once we get all the evidence and those who were involved in it will be given exemplary punishment."The minister further said that no incident has been reported since Saturday night.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, claimed on Sunday that the violence during Durga Puja in Bangladesh is part of a systematic attack on religious minority groups and the situation calls for implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in West Bengal.CAA offers citizenship to non-Muslims who entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015. Its critics, among whom chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a prominent face, insist that it is discriminatory as it leaves out Muslims and links citizenship to faith in a secular country.The violence broke out in Bangladesh on Friday over the alleged desecration of the Quran at a pandal during Durga Puja festivities. Many pandals and temples - including the Iskcon temple - were attacked. The shops and houses of Hindus were also allegedly vandalised.Clashes took place in Chandpur, Chittagong, Gazipur, Bandarban, Chapainawabganj, and Moulvibazar and resulted in several casualties, reported Dhaka Tribune.One person was killed and 17 others, including the officer-in-charge of Begumganj police station, injured, according to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attacks-on-durga-puja-pandals-pre-planned-says-bangladesh-home-minister-101634517188664.html
18-10-2021||India||Gurmeet Ram Rahim sentencing today in murder case, CBI seeks maximum punishment||A special CBI court is expected to pronounce the quantum of punishment for Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and four others in a murder case. They were convicted on October 8 for the murder of Ram Rahim's former manager Ranjit Singh in 2002.Ahead of the sentencing, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code for Criminal Procedure (CrPC) have been imposed in Haryana's Panchkula district.The security measure has been taken in view of August 2017 violence when 36 people were killed following Ram Rahim's conviction in a rape case.While the CBI sought death sentence for the Dera chief at last hearing, Ram Rahim pleaded for mercy via video conference from Rohtak jail, where he is serving a 20-year term for raping two followers.Ram Rahim highlighted social works done by the sect like blood donation camps, eye check-up camps, tree plantation drives and assistance at various places during natural calamities. He also cited his health problems, including blood pressure, eye and kidney ailments while pleading for mercy.The CBI, meanwhile, opposed Dera chief's plea saying the victim treated him as God and the accused committed offences against him. The agency also said he had criminal antecedents and committed offence in a cold-blooded manner without provocation. It has demanded the "maximum punishment" under the IPC Section 302.Ranjit Singh, who was also a follower of the sect, was shot dead in 2002.He was murdered for his suspected role in the circulation of an anonymous letter, which narrated how women were being sexually exploited by the Dera head.According to the CBI charge sheet, the Dera chief believed that Ranjit Singh was behind the circulation of the anonymous letter and hatched a conspiracy to kill him.The other convicted in the murder case of Ranjit Singh are Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh, Avtar Singh and Sabdil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gurmeet-ram-rahim-sentencing-today-in-murder-case-cbi-seeks-maximum-punishment-101634515261803.html

18-10-2021||India||Ahead of 2023 assembly polls, Tripura’s indigenous parties join hands on statehood demand||With two years left for Tripura to go for assembly polls, the regional indigenous-based political parties including ruling BJP’s alliance partner Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) and royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarma’s party TIPRA Motha have come together on a common platform to press for their demand of statehood. A total of eight different indigenous organisations decided to constitute a joint movement committee to press for their demands of separate statehood and other issues following a four-hour-long discussion in Agartala on Saturday. “We will soon have a committee, a joint movement committee for our demands of Tipraland/Greater Tipraland in the next 2-3 days. We are also planning to go to Delhi this month to submit a memorandum regarding our demands to the Centre,” said Tribal Welfare Minister Mewar Kumar Jamatia, also general secretary of IPFT. The IPFT was formed in 1997 but faded away in 2001. Later, NC Debbarma, who is now president of the party, revived it in 2009 keeping the separate statehood demand of Tipraland as the main agenda. Engaging a number of youth in the statehood demand movement, the IPFT led by NC Debbarma did a series of protests in the state and New Delhi for a few years. Their movement attracted BJP’s attention and then they jointly contested the assembly polls in 2018 to defeat the two-decade old Left government. In the 60-seater Assembly, the IPFT has eight MLAs. One IPFT legislator later offered to tender his resignation. The schedule of IPFT’s visit to Delhi is yet to be fixed; however, the TIPRA Motha is slated to leave the state for Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on October 23 to raise their voice in support of their Greater Tipraland demand. “It is a pre-scheduled programme. Over one thousand people will join us in our three-day long programme at Jantar Mantar,” said Pradyot. He added that he had requested the IPFT to extend their support to his Greater Tipraland demand and also wished to speak in one voice whenever they get to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Home Minister Amit Shah. “Both demands of Tipraland and Greater Tipraland are almost similar. I have requested the IPFT to support the Greater Tipraland demand. I have always supported their demand for Tipraland. If they support our demand, then we can speak in one voice in Delhi,” he said. After resigning from the Congress in 2019, Pradyot had floated his own political party TIPRA Motha this year. His party contested the district council polls keeping the agenda of forming Greater Tipraland by including indigenous population living outside TTAADC in Tripura and other Indian states like, Assam, Mizoram and some parts of neighbouring country Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-2023-assembly-polls-tripura-s-indigenous-parties-join-hands-on-statehood-demand-101634503404715.html

Talking against the former chief minister and making allegations show his irresponsible behaviour,” said Khan. The Congress leader said that Siddaramaiah has done everything for the benefit of the minority community, and alleged that JDS chief HD Devegowda does not have any concern towards the minority community. “There were chances in Hassan and Ramanagara where Muslim candidates could have won the elections but he did not give tickets to minority candidates in Hassan and Ramanagara. And, now he is making allegations. Why could not he give a ticket to the grandson of former union minister Jaffer Sharief in Mandya instead of his son? It is the silly family politics,” he added.

18-10-2021||India||Hike in taxes after Covid increases Andhra Pradesh revenue||Amaravati: The various taxes and levies, hiked in the name of Covid-19 last year, seem to be paying off as the Andhra Pradesh government earned an extra ₹12,052.29 crore in tax revenue in the first five months of the 2021-22 financial year. The state’s total revenue was an extra ₹15,688.46 crore from April to August this year, compared to the corresponding period last year, state accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General revealed. At the same, the state almost exhausted its targeted borrowing estimate, securing loans of ₹36,976.93 crore (99.86 per cent) in the first five months itself. As per CAG accounts, AP’s revenue from April to August was ₹53,159.11 crore, compared to ₹37,470.65 crore last year. While tax revenue increased by over ₹12,000 crore, non-tax revenue too showed a spike of ₹423.12 crore and Central grants by ₹3,213 crore. But, the revenue deficit mounted to a staggering ₹31,188.49 crore in five months against the annual target of only ₹5,000 crore. Capital expenditure, however, took a dip from ₹8,608.64 crore last year to ₹5,482.53 crore this year, indicating the state spent ₹3,125.76 crore less on development works. At the same time, the revenue expenditure, which includes numerous freebie doles, shot up to ₹84,347.60 crore as against ₹75,669.98 crore in the corresponding period last year. Citing loss of revenue due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown last year, the state enhanced various taxes to fetch an additional ₹20,000 crore revenue per annum. Among the additional levies were a ₹4,500 crore ‘prohibition tax’ on liquor, ₹600 crore revised tax on petrol and diesel, another ₹600 crore (road development) cess on petrol and diesel, ₹300 crore levy on natural gas, ₹2,000 crore tax on properties in urban local bodies and ₹350 crore ‘user charges’ on garbage. The land values in urban areas have been hiked by 10 to 30 per cent to realise an additional ₹800 crore. The professional tax was increased for an additional income of ₹161 crore. “We are now reaping the benefits of the tax hike but the mounting revenue deficit is still a worrying factor. The revenues may be looking good but we are still in the red,” a top finance official pointed out. Besides, the spiralling revenue expenditure was also a cause for concern, with interest payment (on loans) alone touching ₹8,187.12 crore in the first five months. “Bulk of our revenue is going towards salaries, pensions and loan repayments. Not a single rupee is available for any other thing, leave alone development works. We are borrowing heavily to keep the freebie schemes going and that is reflecting in our accounts,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hike-in-taxes-after-covid-increases-andhra-pradesh-revenue-101634498423630.html
18-10-2021||India||Take uncompromising stand on gender-based violence: 700 alumni in letter to IIT-Guwahati||Over 700 former students of Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) from all over India have written to authorities in IIT-Guwahati (IIT-G) seeking an uncompromising stand on gender-based violence. The letter (which HT has seen) written on Friday by 769 IIT alumni was in response to an incident of alleged rape of a female student in IIT-G in March this year by a senior student. “We ask IIT-G administration to take an uncompromising stand and demonstrate unequivocally that gender-based violence and harm is unacceptable, (and) has no place on IIT campuses and will not be tolerated,” the letter stated. “We ask you to hold anyone proven guilty accountable by enforcing consequences which match the severity of the crime and are consistent with ICC’s (internal complaint committee’s) recommendations,” it added. The letter addressed to directors of all the 23 premier engineering institutes also suggested a list of actions to make IIT campuses “one of the safest and most inclusive institutions of learning in the world”. On April 3 this year, police had arrested the 21-year-old IIT-G student for allegedly raping a fellow student on March 28. The IIT-G authorities, who were initially accused of being slow to act, suspended the accused student following his arrest. In August, the Gauhati High Court while observing that there was “clear prima facie case” against the accused, granted him bail as both the victim and accused were “talented students” and the “state’s future assets”. Though the student was expelled by IIT-G in September following a decision by the senate (the institute’s highest decision-making body), his termination was withdrawn this month after an order by Gauhati HC. “We would like to express our anguish and outrage at the recent events reported in the media about a female student of IIT-G who was allegedly raped by a senior on campus, and then left injured and unconscious for several hours before being taken to hospital,” the letter by the IIT alumni stated. “We are also distressed to learn that some recommendations by ICC at IIT-G, recommending stringent action against co-accused, were ignored by management. The incident has brought renewed focus on the challenges female students face on campus, and the long-term harm caused to them,” it added. In their list of suggestions about actions needed to be taken, the former students mentioned establishment of a centre for equity and inclusion in all IIT campuses, a more diverse set of safe reporting channels and making a public commitment and enforce greater accountability for administrators and faculty. “We cherish our years spent at IIT and our experience of college life. What we want is to make IIT campuses one of the safest and most inclusive institutions of learning in the world. We believe IITs can position themselves to be a model and shining light for other institutions and society at large,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-uncompromising-stand-on-gender-based-violence-700-alumni-in-letter-to-iitguwahati-101634498363695.html
18-10-2021||India||Congress high command will decide on CM face for Karnataka, says Siddaramaiah||Hubballi Senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Sunday said the party high command will decide on its chief minister after winning the 2023 assembly polls in Karnataka, and whomever they name, every one will abide by it.The Leader of Opposition in Karnataka also made it clear that he has no interest in national politics and will remain in the state. “High Command will decide. Congress party is a national party. Who made Basavaraj Bommai the CM? Did MLAs do it? It was the (BJP) high command and RSS which decided. Similarly, we too have the high command,” Siddaramaiah said in response to a question on whether he will become CM if Congress wins assembly polls.Speaking to reporters here, he said, on the basis of the opinion expressed by the newly elected MLAs, the high command will decide on the new Chief Minister. “Whoever is made (the CM), we will accept it.” Reiterating that the high command has not invited him to national politics and the issue was not discussed during his recent meeting with Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the former Chief Minister said that he too was not interested in it and wants to continue in state politics.“I’m now 74 years old, I may be in politics maximum five more years, I am fine with Karnataka, I’m happy with Karnataka politics,” he said.It is no secret that Siddaramaiah is nursing his ambition to become chief minister for a second term if the party wins the next assembly polls in 2023.However, with state unit President D K Shivakumar also being seen as a strong contender for the Chief Minister post, and his loyalists too like Siddaramaiah’s, already openly pitching for their leader as CM face, according to party sources, there is growing political one-upmanship between the two leaders and the issue may become contentious in the days to come.In response to a question the Congress Legislature Party leader expressed his opinion in favour of Rahul Gandhi taking over the mantle of the Congress party, as its national President.“Several working committee members have expressed their opinion that he (Rahul Gandhi) should become the party president, he has said that he will consider it. My opinion is also that Rahul Gandhi should become AICC president, I have said it a number of times,” Siddaramaiah said.The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday decided that elections for the new Congress president would be held between August 21 and September 20 next year with a majority of party leaders urging Rahul Gandhi to assume the top post, a request he said he would consider.Continuing his attack against the RSS, Siddaramaiah said, it is a communal organisation, which is in favour of ‘Manusmṛiti’, and anti-minority, hence he is opposed to it, and his opposition to the organisation is not to appease anyone.“Not now, since I joined politics in 1971, I’m opposing (RSS). It is because, it is a communal organisation. RSS began in 1925, their activities since then show that they want to divide the country and the society and not to unite it,” he said.Further questioning the claims of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ by BJP which follows RSS ideology, he asked “is there a single Muslim MLA from that party? RSS say they are social organisation, why there are no Muslim or Christian member in RSS?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-high-command-will-decide-on-cm-face-for-karnataka-says-siddaramaiah-101634498243770.html
18-10-2021||India||Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu calls for people’s movement to protect environment||Hyderabad: Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday called for a people’s movement to protect the environment and urged people to voluntarily participate in various conservation activities.He called upon the youth in particular to pro-actively lead the movement and motivate others to adopt sustainable practices. “They (youth) should drive the point among the people that if we take care of nature, nature, in turn, will take care of mankind,” he said.Referring to effects of rapid urbanisation and deforestation, Naidu said there has been a frequency of extreme weather conditions such as flash-floods and landslides in recent times in different parts of the world. “These are clear signs that climate change is real and it cannot be business as usual anymore,” an official press release quoted him as saying.To mitigate such weather conditions, the Vice-President said, “...it is imperative that we co-exist harmoniously with nature. We must balance our developmental needs with environmental protection and make sure everyone understands the importance of sustainable living.” “Meaningful development is possible only when it takes into account the cost on environment,” Naidu said.He was speaking here at the release of ‘Nursery Rajyaniki Raraju’, a book on the life story of late Palla Venkanna, who is credited with transforming the village of Kadiyam in Andhra Pradesh into a popular hub of plant nurseries.The Vice-President expressed his appreciation of Venkanna for his tireless efforts towards a ‘Green Bharat’. He said Venkanna, who had collected over 3,000 varieties of plants from around the country, believed that “if every home can turn green, the country as a result will turn green.”“Palla Venkanna’s life story remains an inspiration to future generations,” he said. Naidu lauded the Telangana government for taking up plantation of trees as a movement under ‘Haritha Haram’. He suggested that all the state governments take the initiative of creating awareness among children on environmental protection and tree plantation from the school level.Telangana home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vicepresident-venkaiah-naidu-calls-for-people-s-movement-to-protect-environment-101634498004864.html

The operations are on to flush them out but it may take time because of the thick jungles,” said a police officer on condition of anonymity.“We have also detained three people in Bhata Dhurian area on the suspicion of providing logistical support,” said the officer.It was a matter of investigation whether they provided food and shelter to the terrorists voluntarily or at gunpoint, an official told news agency PTI.So far, the news agency said, contact with hiding terrorists was established thrice -- first on October 11 in Poonch’s Surankote which was followed by another exchange of fire between the security forces and the fleeing terrorists in the adjoining Thanamandi forest in Rajouri district the same day but the ultras managed their escape in both the encounters.Five Army personnel, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), were killed in a fierce gunfight during a counter-insurgency operation in Surankote forest on Monday. Four soldiers, including another JCO, died in another encounter in the Nar Khas forest in the Mendhar area of Poonch on Thursday evening.“The presence of terrorists in the forest area connecting Poonch and Rajouri has observed two-and-a-half months ago and accordingly tactical operations were launched to track them down,” Deputy Inspector General of Police, Rajouri-Poonch range, Vivek Gupta said on Saturday.The terrorists are holed up and the joint forces are on the job to take the operation to the logical conclusion, he added.On Sunday, additional director general of police, Jammu zone, Mukesh Singh reached the site of the encounter.

18-10-2021||India||Jaishankar urges Israel businesses to focus on India||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday encouraged Israeli businesses to focus more deeply on the opportunities and take advantage of India’s business-friendly policies, saying New Delhi regard them in many ways as perhaps “among our most trusted and innovative partners”.Speaking at the India-Israel Business Roundtable soon after his arrival in Israel on his maiden visit, Jaishankar said there is an enormous effort of change happening in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office and people have heard bits and pieces of that change.“If you were to connect all those dots, I think, you get a picture of an India that is moving towards acquiring those deeper strengths which will make it more competitive in terms of the world economy. And that to you is of interest because from those deeper strengths will come new opportunities and I’ll speak about some of them,” he told the gathering.“So you have today really a very energetic economy -- the message that I would be giving to the counterparts of the Israeli government is you know ‘we regard you in many ways as perhaps among our most trusted and innovative partners’,” he said.While this change has been going on for a few years and during the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic when people have not been in touch physically, interestingly the change process has accelerated, he said.“We have had some really big reforms, some of them might be of interest to you. One is called ‘production linked incentive’, which is to attract manufacturing to India from the birth so that anybody who is bringing in new production capacities and delivering on it is incentivised appropriately. Now this has covered 13 sectors so far. And many of them are exactly the sectors which some of you are interested in including batteries, electronics et al,” he said.He said the new farm laws make agriculture much more sustainable which actually creates the basis for greater businesses in agriculture and greater employment in agriculture. “We certainly think those changes would encourage much more investment into agriculture and food production.” Later, he tweeted that a “productive meeting with Israeli chambers of commerce and the innovation ecosystem.” “Appreciate their visible enthusiasm for doing more partnerships with India. Many post-Covid priorities including digital,health,agriculture & green growth are natural areas for our collaboration,” he tweeted.“Encouraged Israeli businesses to focus more deeply on Indian opportunities. And take advantage of our business friendly policies,” he said in another tweet.The roundtable discussions on promoting bilateral trade ties included leading officials of almost all the important business organisations in Israel.During his visit, Jaishankar would call on President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid.He will also be holding talks with leading academics from all over Israel, business community leaders and interacting with the Indian Jewish community.Jaishankar will also be visiting places of historical significance to India, demonstrating its long-term presence in the region and constructive role played in shaping the history of the region.India and Israel elevated bilateral relations to a strategic partnership during the historic visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel in July 2017.Since then, the relationship between the two countries has focused on expanding knowledge-based partnership, which includes collaboration in innovation and research, including boosting the ‘Make in India’ initiative, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement ahead of his departure||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-encourages-israeli-businesses-to-focus-more-deeply-on-opportunities-in-india-101634497403965.html
18-10-2021||India||Take uncompromising stand on gender-based violence: Alumni write to IIT Guwahati||GUWAHATI: Over 700 alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) from across the country have written to the IIT-Guwahati authorities seeking an “uncompromising” stand on gender-based violence, months after an incident of a student allegedly raped by a senior rocked the campus. The letter, which was written on Friday and signed by 769 alumni, stated: “We ask IIT-G administration to take an uncompromising stand and demonstrate unequivocally that gender-based violence and harm is unacceptable, (and) has no place on IIT campuses and will not be tolerated.” “We ask you to hold anyone proven guilty accountable by enforcing consequences which match the severity of the crime and are consistent with ICC’s (internal complaint committee’s) recommendations,” it added. The letter, seen by HT, addressed to directors of all the 23 premier engineering institutes also suggested a list of actions to make IIT campuses “one of the safest and most inclusive institutions of learning in the world”. On April 3 this year, police arrested a 21-year-old IIT-G student for allegedly raping a fellow student on March 28. The IIT-G authorities, who were initially accused of being slow to act, suspended the accused following his arrest. In August, the Gauhati high court, while observing that there was “clear prima facie case” against the accused, granted him bail as both the victim and accused were “talented students” and the “state’s future assets”. Though the student was expelled by IIT-G in September following a decision by the senate (the institute’s highest decision-making body), his termination was withdrawn earlier this month after an order by the high court. “We would like to express our anguish and outrage at the recent events reported in the media about a female student of IIT-G who was allegedly raped by a senior on campus, and then left injured and unconscious for several hours before being taken to hospital,” the letter by the IIT alumni stated. “We are also distressed to learn that some recommendations by ICC at IIT-G, recommending stringent action against co-accused, were ignored by management. The incident has brought renewed focus on the challenges female students face on campus, and the long-term harm caused to them,” it added. Among suggestions listed by the former students about actions needed to be taken, included establishment of a centre for equity and inclusion in all IIT campuses; a more diverse set of safe reporting channels and making public commitment; and enforcement of greater accountability for administrators and faculty. “We cherish our years spent at IIT and our experience of college life. What we want is to make IIT campuses one of the safest and most inclusive institutions of learning in the world. We believe IITs can position themselves to be a model and shining light for other institutions and society at large,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-uncompromising-stand-on-gender-based-violence-alumni-write-to-iit-guwahati-101634497403446.html
18-10-2021||India||Unutilised vaccines with states doubled since Sept: Govt data||The number of Covid-19 vaccines lying unutilised with various states has nearly doubled over the past one month, growing from about 50 million doses in early October to at least 100 million now, according to government data, which suggests that there is no shortage of vaccines.A senior official in the ministry of health and family welfare said on condition of anonymity, “As per the latest data, more than 10 crore vaccine doses (10.42 crore or 100 million on Sunday) were lying with the states under the vaccination programme. At any given time now, the states have enough vaccine doses to be administered in the programme. In fact, the volume has more than doubled.”As per the data, a week ago there were at least 80 million doses available at any given point, which at the beginning of the month was about 50 million. Last month, on average, the number of balance and unutilised doses with the states at any given time was close to 50 million. “The supplies have gone up significantly as compared to the number of doses being administered daily, so much so that we almost tell states every other day to administer more doses in a single day as supplies are no longer an issue,” said another central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.The increase in vaccine supplies has been attributed to an increase in overall vaccine production and improved logistical arrangements in the country.From about 100 million Covishield doses and 2-2.5 million Covaxin doses till a couple of months ago, the monthly availability of both vaccines has now gone up to 220 and 6 million doses, respectively.While Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is locally manufacturing Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield, Bharat Biotech is manufacturing Covaxin that the company developed in collaboration with the country’s apex biomedical research regulator, the Indian Council of Medical Research.“Earlier, states used to complain frequently about vaccine supply shortage, and we used to ask them to be patient as companies were in the process of ramping up their monthly vaccine production that would lead to more supplies. We get supplies daily; a few days ago, we even got more than a crore vaccine doses in a single day,” said the second official.As per government data till Sunday, at least one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been provided to states and Union territories under the national vaccination programme since it was launched on January 16, and 976.5 million doses have been administered so far.“The supplies are going to go up further in the coming weeks with Zydus Cadila’s anti-Covid vaccine also expected to be added to the list. The company is likely to provide 6 million doses soon; negotiations are on,” said the second official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unutilised-vaccines-with-states-doubled-since-sept-govt-data-101634497231228.html

18-10-2021||India||Three Nihangs sent on six-day police custody||Rohtak: Three members of the Sikh Nihang order, arrested in connection to a lynching of a Dalit labourer at a farmers’ protest site, were on Sunday sent to six days of police custody, even as Haryana police constituted two special investigation teams to probe the incident. On October 15, the body of Lakhbir Singh (35), a Dalit farm labourer from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district, was found tied to a police barricade near the Singhu farm protest site on the outskirts of the capital with his left hand and right foot cut off. Nihangs, a Sikh order distinguished by blue robes and swords, alleged the man desecrated Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, even as the victim’s family questioned the attackers’ claim that he committed sacrilege and demanded a high-level probe. So far, four people, claiming to be members of the Nihang order, have been arrested in connection with the gruesome killing. Hours after Lakhbir Singh’s body was found, Sarabjeet Singh, a resident of Punjab’s Gurdaspur district, claimed that he had “punished” Lakhbir Singh for the “desecration”. He was arrested and sent to seven days in police custody. The next day, three other Nihangs – Narain Singh, Govindpreet Singh and Bhagwant Singh – surrendered before Sonipat police in connection with the lynching. The three accused were produced before a court in Sonepat.All three confessed to their crime before the court. “They claimed that only four people were involved in this case,” said Virender Rao, Sonepat deputy superintendent of police (headquarters).“Inside the court, the accused folded their hands and confessed to their crime. Narain Singh once again claimed that he hit the labourer’s leg thrice with his sword and cut his foot, while Sarabjeet Singh cut his hand. They also admitted that four members of the Nihang order were involved in the killing,” said a police official who had accompanied the accused to the court. He declined to be named.Meanwhile, at Kundli border, Baba Raja Ram, another Nihang, said Lakhbir Singh was killed for desecrating Guru Granth Sahib. “ Where is law and order? No justice system has given strict punishment to the accused involved in sacrilege cases since 2015. There is nothing above the Granth Sahib for Sikhs. The Indian justice system has failed in giving justice to Sikhs since 2015 in more than 400 cases of sacrilege,” he said. “Our four people have surrendered before police and police should refrain from implicating any other person in the case. If police try to arrest any member of our community, we will protest against them, and they will have to face dire consequences. Police should investigate the sacrilege case as the labourer had disrespected the holy book.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-nihangs-sent-on-six-day-police-custody-101634496923894.html
18-10-2021||India||Sasikala terms herself AIADMK general secretary at party’s jubilee event||Chennai The year long (2021-22) golden jubilee celebrations of the AIADMK’s founding began on Sunday, and it was marked by a renewed and an open attempt by V K Sasikala, confidante of late party supremo J Jayalalithaa, to get back control of the party by harping on ‘unity’ mantra. Sasikala’s strong pitch for joining forces for the sake of the ‘party and people’ was, however, rejected by the AIADMK, which reiterated that there is no place for her in the party. She unfurled the AIADMK flag at the T Nagar memorial of party founder and late Chief Minister M G Ramachandran here and a plaque unveiled on the occasion addressed her as party ‘general secretary,’ which was strongly opposed by the main opposition party. Recalling a didactic Tamil film song ‘Kanpona Pokkiley’ in a MGR flick, which cautions against choosing a path based on whims and fancies rather than wisdom and reason, Sasikala said, “you decide to whom this is applicable today.” Apparently, the message was to the AIADMK brass, steered by O Panneerselvam and K Palaniswami, both former Chief Ministers. Addressing supporters at MGR’s Ramapuram Garden residence here, Sasikala said had the party been in power in the golden jubilee year, it would have been a proud moment, in honour of both MGR and ‘Amma.’ Ahead of the start of her prison term in 2017, she ensured that the AIADMK was in the saddle of power in Tamil Nadu, she said.Recalling her announcement of staying away from politics ahead of the Assembly poll in April this year, she said she took that stand as she wanted the party to be not affected in any manner whatsoever. “It is the responsibility of all of us to guard the party. The need of the hour is unity,” she said adding the divisions among them facilitated ‘our enemies,’ seen as a pointer to arch rival DMK, which captured power in Tamil Nadu after a gap of 10 years.Sasikala said that if attention was not paid to the welfare of the people, the party and cadres, “we will be thrown away, whatever top positions one may hold and all of us should realise this truth.” “For the sake of the party, the people and workers, this is the time to stand together.” In a symbolic gesture to press for what she termed “unity,” she said she was addressing them at the Ramapuram house, which witnessed the unification of factions led by Jayalalithaa and MGR’s wife Janaki Ammal, decades ago and later the AIADMK went on to capture power again in 1991.Similarly, the followers of MGR and Jayalalithaa should join forces to usher in the AIADMK government again in Tamil Nadu with people’s support, she said. “We should come together and the party has to win, long live the AIADMK, let Tamil Nadu grow,” Sasikala said as her supporters clapped and cheered. Reacting to Sasikala’s overtures, AIADMK senior leader D Jayakumar said she would not be taken back into the party. “No one can touch the AIADMK,” he asserted.Mocking at Sasikala, Jayakumar, referring to her supporters hailing her as ‘revolutionary mother’ wanted to know the kind of revolution she ushered in. “What revolution has she done?” he asked adding all that she did was only for the sake of her family. Be it cadres or the people, no one would ever accept her back into the AIADMK, he said. Accusing Sasikala-led camp as “looters” he said she did no sacrifices for the party’s sake and the AIADMK and people would never accept her or her relatives. The party is united against her and she was eased out of the AIADMK years ago, he said. Following that, the party came with a new organisational structure, comprising top posts of coordinator (O Panneerselvam) and co-coordinator (K Palaniswami) and decided that no one would be elevated to the position of general secretary, the numero uno post held by Amma. “Amma is our permanent general secretary. Though she is not alive, she is guiding us.” Jayakumar sought to know why Sasikala did not visit the memorials of leaders MGR and Jayalalithaa though she returned in February from Bengaluru after serving a four year prison sentence. She could not tolerate the golden jubilee celebrations of the party and the AIADMK suffered defeat in 1996 only because of her camp, he claimed. On a plaque, declaring her as party chief, Jayakumar, also a former Minister said that she has no moral or legal right to use the AIADMK’s name or flag or to claim that she is the party’s general secretary. “How can she become the general secretary merely by embossing her name in a plaque ?” he wondered adding the party would consider taking legal action. The Election Commission and a court ruling made it amply clear that “we are the AIADMK and the party’s two leaves symbol and the flag belongs to us,” Jayakumar said.Hence, Sasikala unilaterally claiming to be the party’s chief went against the court verdict and EC’s directives, he pointed out. AIADMK top leaders Panneerselvam and Palaniswami presided over the inaugural of the year long golden jubilee celebrations at the party headquarters here. They garlanded the statues of MGR and Jayalalithaa, distributed sweets and food to cadres and gave away ₹15 lakh financial assistance to the kin ( ₹3 lakh to each of the five families) of five party workers who passed away recently.A book of poems on late Jayalalithaa, authored by party office-bearer Sa Kalaipunithan and a compact disc of party’s jubilee song were released by the top two leaders. The AIADMK headquarters wore a festive look and cultural programmes were also held. The AIADMK, which held the reins of power for 30-plus years in Tamil Nadu was founded on October 17, 1972.

The SKM asks for this action to be taken up peacefully, without any destruction and damage of any kind to any railway property,” it said.Four of the eight people who died in the violence on October 3 were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles.The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and Ajay Mishra who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time. Ashish Mishra was arrested in the case on October 9.The SKM also claimed that at effigy-burning events across Uttar Pradesh, several farmer leaders were put under house arrested while some were detained.SKM condemns this and asks the UP government not to suppress the right to protest of ordinary citizens, it added.

The review process has now commenced with the expectation that we will receive EUL from WHO at the earliest ,” Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said in a statement after submitting the documents last month. WHO began a rolling review of Covaxin on July 6, 2021. Covaxin is one of the six vaccine approved by India’s drugs regulator for emergency use, and one of the two vaccines being administered under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme. The other vaccine that is largely being given under the programme is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-to-meet-on-oct-26-to-decide-on-emergency-use-of-covaxin-101634496564967.html

They were referred to the hospital from different district hospitals of the region. One death took place on October 15 and three other infants died on October 16,” Dr Lakhan Singh, superintendent of the medical college told HT adding that two infants were suffering from birth asphyxia while other two were underweight.“A three-member team of medical college will inquire the matter while a team of Raipur will also reach to Amikapur,” said Singh.In the wake of these deaths, state urban administration and development minister Shivkumar Dahariya, who is also in-charge minister of Surguja district, has left for Ambikapur to chair a meeting of officials. Health minister TS Singh Deo, who was in Delhi, has left his tour midway and returning directly to Ambikapur, a release issued by Singh Deo’s staff said.“On the direction of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, Dahariya has left for Ambikapur where he has called an emergency meeting of the district collector, chief medical and health officer (CMHO) and superintendent of the medical college,” a statement issued by the public relations department said.A release issued by the health minister’s staff said that Singh Deo has cancelled all his scheduled programmes in Delhi and will directly reach Ambikapur from there. In view of the seriousness of the issue, the health minister has directed to send a special team of health departments from Raipur and Bilaspur to Ambikapur, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/team-sent-to-chhattisgarh-hospital-after-4-newborns-death-101634496444008.html

Kerala has seen a series of natural disasters in the past four years, causing loss of lives and property. In August 2018, the most severe flood of the century claimed 483 lives. A year later, 48 people died after a portion of a hill came down at Kavalappara near Nilambur in Malappuram district. In August last year, 74 people were killed at Pettimudi in the Idukki district after a landslide decimated a settlement of tea plantation workers. On Saturday, two landslides claimed 18 lives in Idukki and Kottayam districts. Residents of Kootickal and Kokkayar, the two worst-hit hamlets, witnessed a tragedy of such magnitude for the first time. Though natural disasters are largely attributed to climate change, many ecologists blame human intervention as well for recurring mishaps. Many landslides were triggered by unscientific developmental work carried out in ecologically sensitive areas, experts said, lamenting that such issues come up for discussion only when a tragedy strikes. Kerala was suffering from a man-made disaster and its impact could have been limited if the Gadgil commission’s report was implemented in earnest, said environmental scientist V S Vijayan, chairman of Thrissur-based Salim Ali Foundation, which works in the area of biodiversity conservation.The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, also known as the Gadgil Commission after its chairman, ecologist Madhav Gadgil, had in its 2011 report recommended a series of actions to conserve the Western Ghats, a Unesco heritage site that plays an important role in breaking rain clouds over the subcontinent. When all six states in the Western Ghats region – Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat – opposed the suggestions, another committee was constituted under former ISRO chief Kasturirangan. The second report faced objections as well.If the remained unchanged, Kerala would witness more such mishaps, Vijayan warned. “It is a fact nobody can stop rains or control floods. Due to climate change, such tragedies are bound to increase. We have seen heatwaves in some western counties,” Vijayan said. “But we can take measures to lower the intensity of such tragedies. Quarrying and unbridled developmental activities are still rampant in many ecologically sensitive areas of Kerala.”Cloudbursts might have triggered torrential rains at several places in Kottayam and Idukki districts, a weather expert said. “The pattern of the rains shows it is a cloudburst. Some of the areas in Idukki and Kottayam received more than 20 cm rainfall in 2-3 hours,” said M G Manoj, a scientist at the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research in Cochin University of Science and Technology. “We need long- and short-term strategies to tackle such tragedies. Usually, soil study or soil piping phenomena are not done while constructing houses,” Manoj said. “Proper geological studies are needed, at least for new dwelling units.” “We can reduce the intensity of disasters by listening to early warnings and disseminating them to targeted audiences. We need more studies in hazard-reduction areas,” he said.After the Kavalappara tragedy in 2019, many experts said soil piping was rampant in many areas of the state, but no serious study was done.Soil piping and lateral spread (which occurs when the soil starts moving downhill) are more visible in Kerala these days. These two often trigger major disasters. Like cloud pattern, soil pattern is also undergoing a sea change,” said V Nandakumar, a scientist at the Thiruvananthapuram-based National Centre for Earth Science Studies. “We cannot control rains. But we can mitigate damage triggered by extreme rains,” Nandakumar said. “Human intervention plays a key role in multiplying damages at several places.”Recently, in north Kerala’s Kozhikode, vibrations accompanied by mysterious sounds were felt in a newly constructed house. Later, geologists and experts examined the house and found that soil piping or lateral spread might have triggered them and asked the occupants to shift from the premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cloudbursts-may-have-triggered-flash-floods-landslides-in-keralaexperts-101634495849241.html
18-10-2021||India||Vegetable prices up due to fuel price hike, rain: Govt data||Prices of vegetables, especially onion and tomato, are rising in urban areas, including the national capital, on the back of higher fuel prices and damage to summer crops due to heavy rains, trade data showed on Sunday. The prices of edible oil too continue to be dearer due to high global prices, prompting the Union government to tighten measures such as requiring traders to reveal stocks. The central government on October 13 wrote to states to ensure prices of edible oils are brought down after cuts in import duty until March 22 . The government has built a record reserve of 200,000 tonnes of onions to deal with potential spikes in prices during the current lean season. Prices of some food items, where seasonality plays a big role, tend to be volatile. Onion is one of them. Its rates often stoke food inflation and impact monthly budgets of consumers, poor or rich, because the vegetable is a base ingredient of most Indian dishes. Onion prices tend to rise during September because it marks the beginning of a nearly three-month lean season, when stocks from previous crops deplete, past data show. Fresh harvests usually arrive in winter. Tomato prices shot up to ₹60-65 a kg, while onions were selling for ₹50-55 in Delhi, Patna, Kolkata and Mumbai, up ₹20-25, price data from agricultural produce market committees showed. Rains in Karnataka and Maharashtra have upended supply lines and damaged crops in key growing regions, said Arun Solanki of Nashik-based Solanki India Ltd, which supplies vegetables grown in Maharashtra. “There is Rs10-15 increase in prices of these vegetables as supply has slowed. Back-end suppliers say this is because of heavy rains this summer,” SP Gupta of New Delhi’s Ghazipur Wholesale Vegetable and Fruit Market said. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are major onion-producing states, accounting for over 75% of total summer onion output. All of these states witnessed delays or damage to summer onion crops. Price rise is a key determinant of monetary policy. Moderate inflation helps the Reserve Bank of India to keep interest rates low to spur economic activity, which has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Onions, a staple in most Indian households, are likely to make consumers cry again with erratic monsoon leading to an eventual delay in harvest,” Crisil Ltd, a ratings firm, said in a recent research note. Crisil’s on the ground report said onion seed transplantation suffered critical lags due to on and off rains during the June-September monsoon, potentially delaying the time the crop takes to mature. Summer onions account for no more than 30% of India’s annual supply, but they are critical to price stability because they replenish supplies during the lean September-November period. “The buffer size (of onions) has been enhanced from 5,137 MT (million tonnes) in 2017-18 to 100,000 MT in 2020-21, which has been further enhanced to 200,000 MT in 2021-22 to ensure a more effective intervention to control prices,” a government document reviewed by HT said. The government is “monitoring prices of all essential commodities as always”, an official said on condition of anonymity. If prices rise, the government will step in by releasing onions “as and when needed” from its warehouses to keep rates stable, he said. Market watchers point to a familiar pattern in India’s onion-price spirals every alternate year or so. In the first half of 2017, for instance, wholesale onion prices plunged, leading to widespread protests by farmers in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Then, in the second half of that year, when the government intervened in the market to buy out excess stocks, prices began rising. In 2019 and 2020, too, retail rates had soared past ₹90 a kg between September and November in many cities. Onion trade in the country suffers from classic price volatility. This is caused mainly by supply-disrupting factors such as extreme weather, losses from inadequate or improper storage, or frequently shifting production levels, all of which can cause supplies to go from surplus to scanty in a matter of weeks. Experts hold that longer dry spells followed by short periods of heavy rainfall are telltale signs of a changing climate’s impact on the monsoon, which waters 60% of the country’s cultivated area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vegetable-prices-up-due-to-fuel-price-hike-rain-govt-data-101634495724272.html
18-10-2021||India||4 of 10 most wanted terrorists killed in Kashmir: Police||Srinagar: Amid a spate of civilian killings across Jammu & Kashmir, the police on Sunday said they have killed four of the 10 most wanted terrorists, on the “target” or “hit list” of security agencies.On August 2 this year, the J&K Police released a list of top 10 terrorists that it aimed to target. The list, posted on Twitter by the Kashmir Zone Police, included the names of seven terrorists who have been active for some time and three new recruits. “Top 10 #targets: #Old #terrorists- Salim Parray, Yousuf Kantroo, Abbas Sheikh, Reyaz Shetergund, Farooq Nali, Zubair Wani & Ashraf Molvi. #New #terrorists- Saqib Manzoor, Umer Mustaq Khandey & Wakeel Shah,” said the tweet.“Of these 10 terrorists, four have been killed in different operations,” Inspector General of Police (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said on Sunday.The development comes amid the killing of 11 civilians in targeted attacks in Kashmir, including five hailing from other states. A total of 32 civilians have been shot dead in Kashmir so far this year.Nine soldiers have been killed in counterterror operations that began on October 11, the highest casualty the army has suffered in a week in the region in recent years. At least 13 terrorists, including a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander, have been shot dead by security forces in October.According to the police, the four killed include Abbas Sheikh of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) backed The Resistance Front (TRF); top LeT commanders Umer Mustaq Khandey and Saqib Manzoor, and Jaish commander Wakeel Shah.Police said Sheikh and Manzoor were top LeT commanders and were also responsible for carrying out numerous attacks on civilians, lawmakers and security personnel. Sheikh, who is also the chief of the TRF, along with his associate Saqid were killed in an encounter in the Aloochi Bagh area of Srinagar on August 23 this year. Shah, too, was killed in August in connection with the murder of BJP leader Rakesh Pandita in Tral.Khandey, police said, was involved in the killing of two police constables and was killed in an encounter in Pulwama on October 16.In March, too, the police had released a similar list of wanted terrorists and announced rewards for those who will provide information about them.“The other commanders or top terrorists, who are still at large, are Saleem Parray (LeT), who has been accused of several civilian killings in Hajin; Yousuf Kantroo alias Issah (LeT), accused of perpetrating several attacks in Budgam and Srinagar districts and has been dubbed as the A+++ category terrorist; Hizbul Mujahideen commander Farooq Bhat alias Farooq Nali, an A++ category terrorist; and another Hizb commander Mohammad Ashraf Khan or Ashraf Molvi, among others,” said IGP Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-of-10-most-wanted-terrorists-killed-in-kashmir-police-101634495610341.html
18-10-2021||India||Kerala rain toll increases to 24||Thiruvananthapuram:  As many as 24 people died in Kerala in the past two days due to flash floods and landslides triggered by torrential rains that were induced by a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea. Early warnings and preparedness helped save many lives, rescue officials said. Landslides killed 12 people in Kottayam and six in the Idukki district. Six died in rain-related mishaps in other parts of the state. The rains slackened by Sunday afternoon, but authorities kept up a strict vigil. The threat of landslides and water-logging across multiple districts continues, said rescue officials, declining to be named. The India Metrological Department has issued yellow alerts in 11 districts, which indicate the possibility of severely bad weather. Rains triggered two major landslides in Kokkayar in Idukki and Kootickal in Kottayam districts, claiming 18 lives. Peerumedu in the Idukki district witnessed the maximum rainfall at 240 mm. “I was playing outside the house when I heard a deafening sound. When my father came out, we saw gushing water and boulders coming down from the nearby hill. Our house was destroyed and swept away. I grabbed hold of a tree branch and later fell into a stream and swam across it,” said 11-year-old Jabin, who had a miraculous escape. He is undergoing treatment in a hospital in Poonjar for a minor fracture. A search is on for his missing father and other relatives. In Kootickal, three generations of a family of six were swept away in the surging waters. Bodies of grandmother Claramma Joseph (65), her daughter-in-law and a grandchild were recovered. Survivors in Kootickal said even in the worst flood of 2018 they were not affected, and the area has no history of landslides or flash floods. Heavy rains began on Friday night and a landslide took place around 10 in the morning on Saturday. The whole area was cut off after roads were damaged, local residents said. Water and slush travelled around 12 km to hit human settlements. In Kokkayar, one of the victims, Fousiya, sent a Whatsapp message to her relative, capturing the fury of nature. Her son and daughter were seen in it. After a few seconds, floodwaters engulfed the entire family. Bodies of six of her family members have later recovered 1 km from their house. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan reviewed the situation and said the government is making all efforts to save lives. Rescue operations were in full swing, he said. One hundred and five relief camps have been set up, the chief minister said. He asked people in the camps to follow the Covid-19 protocol to contain the spread of infections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Vijayan and offered help. State revenue minister K Rajan announced a grant of ₹4 lakh to the kin of the deceased. Home minister Amit Shah assured all help to Kerala. “We are continuously monitoring the situation in parts of Kerala in the wake of heavy rains and flooding. The central government will provide all possible help to the state,” he tweeted on Sunday. Defence forces are helping district administrations to remove slush and boulders to locate the missing. Four persons are still missing, district officials said. Cloudbursts triggered the torrential rains at several places in Kottayam and Idukki districts, an expert said. “The pattern of the rains shows it is a cloudburst. Some of the areas in Idukki and Kottayam received more than 20 cm rainfall in two to three hours,” said M G Manoj, a scientist at the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research in Cochin University of Science and Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-rain-toll-increases-to-24-101634495484766.html
18-10-2021||India||Will avenge every drop of innocent blood in Kashmir: LG Manoj Sinha||Amid a spate of civilian killings in the valley, Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday said that “every drop of innocent blood will be avenged” and those responsible for the killings will be hunted down.Nine civilians were killed in targeted attacks by terrorists on non-locals and people from minority communities in different parts of Kashmir in October so far. The most recent Two migrant workers-- one from Uttar Pradesh and another from Bihar-- were shoot dead by terrorists at Eidgah, Srinagar and Litter in Pulwama on Saturday.In his radio address, Awam Ki Awaz on Sunday, Lt Governor Sinha paid tributes to the civilians who were killed recently.“I pay my heartfelt tributes to the martyr civilians and condolences to the bereaved families. We’ll hunt down terrorists, their sympathisers and avenge every drop of innocent civilian’s blood.”Lt Governor further said that when next month people will be celebrating Diwali, they should light one candle in honour of those soldiers who laid down their lives for country and whose lives were snatched by the enemies of humanity. “I make a promise that terrorism and its entire ecosystem will be uprooted,” he said.Sinha said that attempts are being made to disrupt peace and socio-economic progress of J&K and individual growth of people. “We remain committed to fast-paced development and will endeavour to build a prosperous and peaceful UT of J&K,” he said.The recent spate of killings has triggered fear among the people in the Valley and criticism of the security apparatus by political parties.National Conference president Farooq Abdullah Sunday said Kashmiris were not involved in the recent civilian killings in the union territory and that these attacks were carried under “a conspiracy to defame Kashmiris”.“The killing of innocent people is unfortunate. It is a conspiracy to defame Kashmiris,” Farooq told reporters here.On Saturday, Arvind Kumar Sah, 29, a resident of Banka area in Bihar, was shot at close range by the terrorists in Srinagar’s Eidgah area while Sageer Ahmad, a carpenter from Uttar Pradesh, was attacked at Litter in the Pulwama district.Earlier, on October 7, two school teachers -- Supinder Kaur, principal of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School and Deepak Chand, a teacher at the same school in Srinagar’s Eidgah-- were shot dead by terrorists inside the school premises.On October 5, three more civilians -- Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and a well-known pharmacist in Srinagar; Virender Paswan, a street vendor from Bihar’s Bhagalpur, and Mohammad Shafi Lone, the head of a taxi stand in Bandipora district-- were killed by terrorists. On October 2 as well, two civilians , Majid Guru and Mohammad Shafi were killed in Srinagar.The Resistance Front (TRF), a front for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba had claimed responsibility for most of the attack.A total of 29 civilians have been shot dead in Kashmir so far this year, news agency AFP had quoted authorities as saying.Security forces intensified counterterrorism operations in the Valley after the targeted civilian killings in October. Nine soldiers have been killed in the operations that began on October 11– the highest casualties the army has suffered in a week in the region in recent years.At least 13 terrorists, including a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander, have also been neutralised in the operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-avenge-every-drop-of-innocent-blood-in-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-101634495184876.html
18-10-2021||India||'Democracy can’t rest on a bed of lies, need to hold Facebook to account'||Former Facebook employee Sophie Zhang, who earlier exposed the company’s partisan policy in removing inauthentic accounts from the social media platform ahead of the 2020 Delhi elections, said that the only way to ensure transparency on part of the company was to put pressure on it to ensure fair treatment for people across the spectrum.Zhang is among several former Facebook employees and contractors who have said that the company’s policies and management are leading to harm. Earlier this month, Frances Haugen sent a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission citing internal documents that back some of these allegations.In an interview with Hindustan Times, Zhang said that democracy can not rest on a bed of lies. “The only way to ensure that Facebook treats everyone well, and fairly, is to put pressure on the country. Citizens of India need to make their voice heard if they feel content is been censored in a biased manner, in favour of a particular political party,” she said.Zhang in April revealed that Facebook had planned to take down a series of fake accounts ahead of the Delhi elections, but stopped when it realized a BJP politician was behind one such network. “While two Congress, one Aadmi Party and one Bharatiya Janata Party-linked IT cell-style networks were actioned, one was spared despite being repeatedly flagged,” she said.She added that a network of 50-60 accounts run by BJP Lok Sabha MP personally was identified, but despite repeated concerns being raised, the network was never removed. “There was one Aam Aadmi Party-related network, which curiously was also linked to a different cell supporting the Congress in a different state,” she said. “These inauthentic accounts were removed, then two Congress related networks were stopped and one BJP.”The Congress and the AAP did not respond to requests for seeking a comment. Amit Malviya, the BJP’s in-charge for the National Information Technology department, could not be reached despite repeated attempts.Zhang said such networks of fake accounts works to create automatic content, likes, comments and posts in large numbers to promote a particular political party or individual. “For example, around the Delhi election, many accounts emerged that said we had earlier voted for Narendra Modi, but would now vote for Kejrwal,” she said. “These were bad actors and not actual people.”To be sure, she said that there was no way of being certain that these networks were being run by the political parties. “But in case of the BJP MP, it was obvious that the network was being operated from his house, and was being personally done.” Zhang declined to disclose the name of the politician.This, however, is not the first time Facebook has been accused of not censoring political content. Last year, the social media firm’s public policy head Ankhi Das had to step down over allegations that Facebook refused to action “hate-speech” by a BJP politician.According to Zhang, in the United States, the people who take decisions for the direction of the company, are the same ones that are responsible for keeping those in power happy. “Political interference as such has always been a part of the company decision making,” she said. “Refusal to take action against the BJP is part of the pattern, its what the company does, we can’t blame individuals for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/democracy-can-t-rest-on-a-bed-of-lies-need-to-hold-facebook-to-account-says-whistleblower-101634493383273.html
