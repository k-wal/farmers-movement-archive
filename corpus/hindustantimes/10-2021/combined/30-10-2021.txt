30-10-2021||Other||Ludhiana: Students move court as private schools deny transfer letter||The local education department is flooded with complaints from students who migrated from private schools to government schools in the district, accusing their former alma mater of withholding their documents including, school transfer certificate (STC), character certificate, and detailed mark sheets.Around 184 cases came to the fore wherein students of Classes 8 to 12, who migrated from private schools to the government schools, were denied school transfer documents by their previous schools due to non-payment of the dues. Many students adopted the legal course and have moved the court. The district education department has made a special committee to deal with such complaints.The designated team is conducting talks with the concerned private schools and requesting them to release the school leaving certificates. Around 100 complaints have been settled after the intervention of the committee to date.Other than the 184 cases, 12 complaints have been forwarded to the district education officer by the local deputy commissioner’s office. These include complaints of students who have passed Class 12 but are struggling to get their TC. In one such case, the father of a student submitted before a local court that his daughter had passed both Classes 10 and 12 from a private school, but the school was not releasing her Class 12 detailed mark sheets and the character certificate. The school, according to the father, is demanding ₹1.50 lakh dues in lieu of the documents.According to the officials, most of these students got admissions in the government schools after an order released by the former education secretary, schools, dated August 7, 2020, which stated that even in case a private school refuses to issue the STC to a student, heads of the government schools can admit the pupil after doing self-verification.“Admissions were done adhering to the orders of the secretary. Another order was later released directing the government schools to admit the students after taking all the documents from them including STC”, informed an official.He added, “When we sought STC from the students who migrated from the private schools, the schools denied issuing the same contending that the students have not cleared their dues. These certificates are even required during job interviews.”A list of over 150 private schools including MGM Public School, Dugri, BVM School, Sector 32-A, Jamalpur, Venus International Public School, Sai senior secondary Public School, Lucky Model School, Starex Public School, Dashmesh Public Senior Secondary School, Decent Public School, Arya Girls Senior Secondary School, and Orient Convent School, was submitted with the department by the committee. A few private schools have written to the department expressing displeasure against the admissions given to their students in the government schools without taking TC from them.A senior officer, on the condition of anonymity, said most of the PSEB affiliated private schools have issued STC to the students after mediation by the committee. Meanwhile, the CBSE schools are still reluctant to release the documents without clearance of dues.DEO Lakhbir Singh said that the committee formed in this regard is working efficiently, and soon students will get their TC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianastudents-move-court-as-private-schools-deny-transfer-letter-101635618361059.html

There had been brisk polling all over the constituency since morning with people making beelines at every polling station.“Those who were already in the queue at the time of closing hours were allowed to cast their vote. Similarly, special arrangements have been made for Covid-19 patients, if any, to exercise their franchise till 7 pm,” Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel said.The polling percentage, therefore, is expected to go up further after 7 pm. The final polling figures would be disclosed only after collecting the data from all the 306 polling stations, he said.While former state health minister Eatala Rajender, whose resignation from the assembly seat led to the by-election in Huzurabad, is fighting the by-election on the BJP ticket, ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi has fielded its student wing leader Gellu Srinivasa Yadav. The Congress also fielded its state NSUI president Balmuri Venkat.In the morning, there were reports of clashes between the TRS and the BJP cadres over the distribution of money among the voters. The BJP workers prevented TRS leader P Kaushik Reddy from entering the polling booths at a couple of villages for allegedly influencing the voters.Similarly, the TRS cadres obstructed BJP leader Tula Uma from entering some polling booths. The timely intervention of the police officials brought the situation to normal.Goel, who inspected some of the polling stations in Kamalapur village, said the polling was largely peaceful. He said he had received as many as 88 complaints about alleged malpractices in the Huzurabad by-poll and the election observers were looking into the same. “If any of these complaints are proved true, we shall take appropriate action, even after the declaration of results,” he said.Badvel bypollMeanwhile, polling in the by-elections to Badvel assembly constituency in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district began on a dull note but picked up later in the afternoon.By the closing hours, 68.12 per cent of polling was reported from 281 polling stations in the constituency, EC officials said, adding that it might go up by four to five per cent after all those who were standing in the queue cast their votes till 7 pm.Andhra Pradesh chief electoral officer K Vijayanand said there were no incidents of any clashes or untoward incidents in the polling and everything went off peacefully. “There were troubles in three Electronic Voting Machines in the morning and they were immediately rectified,” he said.BJP Rajya Sabha MP C M Ramesh said the ruling YSR Congress party indulged in malpractices in the polling by enrolling fake voters and impersonation. However, the CEO said there were no written complaints from anybody in this regard.The YSRC has fielded Dasari Sudha, widow of former MLA G Venkata Subbaiah, whose sudden death in March necessitated the by-poll in Badvel.

30-10-2021||Delhi||Will follow Supreme Court’s order on Rohingya: Karnataka in affidavit||In less than three weeks after the Karnataka government told the Supreme Court that it does not intend to deport or take any coercive action against Rohingya Muslims, the state government has filed a fresh affidavit, leaving it open for the court to determine the action to be taken against these refugees.The change of stand became visible when the state filed its second affidavit in response to a petition filed by a lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay on October 26. The petition sought an order from the court to identify, detain and deport illegal immigrants and infiltrators including Bangladeshis and Rohingyas within a year.The new affidavit filed by KN Vanaja, Under secretary in the state department of home, disclosed that a total of 126 Rohingyas have been identified in the state who are not staying in any camp or detention centre. “This respondent undertakes that whatever the order that would be passed by this Court will be scrupulously adhered and followed in its letter and spirit,” the affidavit said.What this affidavit lacked was the clear assertion made by the state in its previous affidavit filed on October 7 responding to the same petition where it was said, “72 Rohingyas identified in Bengaluru city are working in various fields and Bengaluru city police have not taken any coercive action against them as of now and there is no immediate plan of deporting them.” This affidavit was filed by YS Chandrashekhara, police inspector in the office of Director General and Inspector General of Police.This response by the Basavaraj Bommai-led government of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) did evoke an element of surprise as the national party in power at the Centre had taken a firm stand against the continuation of Rohingya immigrants in the country. In an affidavit filed September 2017, in response to a petition filed by two Rohingya immigrants seeking refugee status, the Ministry of Home Affairs said, “Continuance of Rohingyas’ illegal immigration into India and their continued stay has serious national security ramifications and threats.”The affidavit had then estimated there are over 40,000 Rohingyas Muslims in the country and disclosed that intelligence inputs gathered against them pointed out their links with Pakistan-based terror organizations and who are indulging in anti-national activities such as mobilization of funds through hawala channels, procuring fake identities and indulging in human trafficking.It was for this reason, Upadhyay in his petition filed in 2017 demanded the Centre and state governments to amend their laws to make illegal immigration and infiltration a cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. In addition, he sought directions from the Court to declare the preparation of forged/fabricated PAN Cards, AADHAR cards, Passport, ration cards and Voter I-cards and such other identity documents a non-bailable, non-compoundable offence.The earlier response by Karnataka urged for dismissal of the petition by saying, “The Petition is devoid of merits. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed.” However, the recent affidavit has steered clear of this stand and has left it to the courts for deciding the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-follow-supreme-court-s-order-on-rohingya-karnataka-in-affidavit-101635618122482.html
30-10-2021||Bangalore||84% voter turnout in Hangal, 69% in Sindgi; polling ends peacefully||Voting for the bypolls to Sindgi and Hangal assembly constituencies in Karnataka concluded on Saturday without any untoward incidents being reported. A total of 19 candidates are in the fray in the two constituencies, including six from Sindgi and 13 from Hangal. The polling began at 7 am and concluded at 7 pm. Late on Saturday night, officials of the State Election Commission said that the approximate voter turnout at 7 pm was 69% in Sindgi and 84% in Hangal. “Details will be updated soon,” read the Commission communication. While the Commission is yet to release final voter turnout at the two constituencies, as per the figures at 5 pm, Sindgi reported 64.54% voter turnout and Hangal 70.76%. According to State Election Commission data, Sindgi had recorded 71.43% turnout in the state assembly elections in 2018 and 59.83% during the parliamentary elections. Similarly, Hangal recorded 84.40% voting during the 2018 assembly election and 80.80% turnout in the parliamentary elections in 2019. The by-elections have been necessitated as the seats fell vacant following the death of Sindagi JD(S) legislator M C Managuli and BJP’s C M Udasi from Hangal. While Ramesh Bhusanur, who came second behind Managuli in 2018 polls, is the BJP candidate from Sindagi, Shivaraj Sajjanar is its candidate from Hangal constituency. The Congress named M C Managuli’s son Ashok Managuli, who has joined the party, as its candidate from Sindagi, while former MLC Srinivas Mane is its candidate from Hangal. The JD(S), which was the first to announce its candidates, has fielded 33-year-old post graduate Naziya Shakeel Ahmed Angadi from Sindgi and 35-year-old B.E, M.Tech graduate Niyaz Shaikh from Hangal. This is the first electoral challenge for Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai after taking charge. In the high-pitched campaigning, which lasted for over 15 days, all the three major parties- BJP, Congress and the JD(S)- spared no opportunity to attack each other on various platforms and issues in an election which Bommai said would become an indicator of what the state can expect in the 2023 assembly elections. For the last 10 days, the chief minister has left no stone unturned to ensure a victory in the two bypoll-bound constituencies--Sindgi and Hangal--with the latter seat turning into a prestige issue as it comes under his home district Haveri. The Congress, by ensuring a win, wants to give momentum for its preparations in the run up to 2023 assembly polls in the state, while the JD(S) is looking to retain Sindgi seat and thereby prove that it still commands a support base in the northern districts. Congress leaders have alleged that the JD(S) deliberately fielded minority candidates for the Hangal and Sindgi by-elections to help the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/84-voter-turnout-in-hangal-69-in-sindgi-polling-ends-peacefully-101635618121013.html

The total project cost is an estimated Rs4,727 crore. Five years ago when the project was first proposed, the total cost was around Rs2,619 crore.Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “We have estimated a cost of Rs305 crore for the stretch between Sangamwadi and Bundgarden bridge. It is part of the 7 km stretch between Sangamwadi and Mundhwa. We are now working on the remaining stretch between Bundgarden bridge and Mundhwa.”The Mula-Mutha riverfront development project will be executed in 11 stretches. As per the proposal sanctioned in the general body meeting, the corporation will spend Rs700 crore on the first few stretches after which, the project will be implemented on public private partnership (PPP) basis. Of the 11 stretches, Sangamwadi to Bundgarden bridge (3 km) accounts for nine stretches. The corporation has decided to start work on the priority stretch between Sangamwadi and Mundhwa at an estimated cost of Rs700 crore. The riverfront development project includes river edge protection, interceptor sewage network, water replenishment, promenade finishing works, public access and ghats, landscapes, public amenities, roads and bridges and urban infrastructure. The largest share of the project (Rs1,245 crore) will be dedicated to river edge protection for which the PMC will spend Rs234 crore.Estimated cost of Rs20 crore per kmAccording to civic officials, the Mula-Mutha flows for 44 km through the PMC, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), Khadki and Pune cantonment areas. The PMC will have to spend Rs20 crore per kilometre for development of the riverfront. It will take more than five years to complete the project. There is 650 hectare land available for developing the green belt of the river which will be given to private players to get funds for the project. Out of the 650 hectare, only 75 hectare belongs to the government and the rest is private land. Hence, the PMC will get money in development charges from development of the land around the river.Priority stretches of the riverfront development projectMundhwa bridge to Mundhwa Jackwell (Kharadi) – approximately 3 kmBundgarden bridge to Sangamwadi bridge – approximately 4 km||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-floats-tender-for-priority-stretch-of-mula-mutha-riverfront-project-101635617642328.html

Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said the Bisrakh police received information around 10pm that a man was shot dead in a Mahindra Scorpio near the Ek Murti roundabout in Greater Noida West. “A police team reached the spot and found a man dead near his SUV. A liquor bottle, two glasses and leftover food were found from the vehicle,” he said. Manjeet received five bullet injuries and died on the spot, police said, adding they scanned his call records and found that a person named Yashpal,45, was in touch with him on Friday night. “When we questioned Yashpal, he admitted to have committed the murder with the help of two accomplices. Primary investigation suggests that Manjeet and Yashpal were involved in property dealing. They had some dispute over commission for facilitating the sale of a property. On Friday night, Manjeet reached the spot in his SUV while Yashpal and two others reached there in another car. Manjeet and Yashpal were drinking in the SUV while two others were standing outside. The victim and the suspect had a heated argument over the property issue, after which Yashpal and his accomplices shot him dead,” Chander said. Police conducted a search and arrested Yashpal from Greater Noida. Yashpal owned four licensed revolvers and police have seized three of them, the officials said. According to police, Manjeet was a history sheeter and six criminal cases, including a murder case, were registered against him in Noida. On the basis of a complaint by the victim’s family, a case was registered against the suspects under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian penal Code on Friday night, police said, adding that they have launched a search to arrest the other two suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/property-dealer-killed-in-suv-in-greater-noida-one-held-101635617160912.html
30-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Vehicular traffic yet to resume at UP Gate site||Traffic movement is yet to be regularised on the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway even after the removal of police barricades from the UP Gate flyover on Friday, officials said on Saturday. Officials of the Ghaziabad traffic police said that they will allow traffic movement from Ghaziabad to Delhi only when the farmers vacate the UP Gate site, where farmers have been protesting against the three controversial farm laws since November 2020. They have been occupying the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway and erecting dais and temporary tents there since December 3 last year. They have been demanding rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.“The farmers have been protesting against the new farm laws for the past 11 months, and the agitation will continue. The Delhi Police has removed the barricades and the road is now open. But the traffic movement has not resumed as the Ghaziabad traffic police has not allowed commuters from Ghaziabad along the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway. Farmers intend to go to Delhi and the farmers’ umbrella body -- Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) -- is holding discussions over the developments related to the removal of barricades,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, UP Gate site spokesperson of SKM.In a statement on Saturday, the SKM said that it has always maintained that the police have been blocking the roads near the protest site and the hasty removal of barricades clearly vindicates the stand of the protesting farmers.“The SKM clarified that it has allowed a two-way movement of traffic near the morcha (protest) sites in the past and will do so in the future too. If the central government wants to open the passage completely, it also has to open the passage to fulfill the demands of the farmers. Whether the farmers will continue their agitation at the same location or move it to Delhi is a collective decision which will be taken at an appropriate time,” the SKM said in a statement.Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), said that although the flyover area is not barricaded, commuters movement on the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway may not resume soon. “It is because the farmers are camping at the UP Gate and we are unable to release the traffic movement towards Delhi. It may pose several issues. Once the farmers vacate the area, the traffic movement will resume smoothly,” he added.Meanwhile, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that they have proposed a joint committee of officials for a damage assessment exercise. “Apart from short circuited electrical cables and damage to roads, our prime concern is the structural safety of the expansion joints of the UP Gate flyover as we have not been able to carry out repair and maintenance works for the past 11 months. This could lead to risk in commuting. So, we are proposing for a joint committee which will include NHAI officials and officers of other Uttar Pradesh agencies,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.“Once the joint committee submits its report, we will also ascertain the amount of expenditure involved in repair and maintenance works of the expressway. We will also propose that the NHAI will not bear the cost alone, and other agencies will be involved in sharing the expenditure. It is not because of the NHAI that the commuter movement is held up,” Garg added.The UP Gate site is one of the several sites, including different borders of Delhi, where the farmers have been camping to protest the farm laws.On October 21 this year, the Supreme Court had said that the farmers have the right to protest, but cannot block roads indefinitely. The court was hearing a petition filed by a Noida resident, who urged the protesters to move away from the roads across the National Capital Region (NCR) as “their agitation takes a toll in daily commuting”.The court had also granted a three-week time period to the farmer unions to file their response, and listed the next date of hearing on December 7 this year. “Ultimately, a solution has to be found. We are not averse to their right to protest even when a legal challenge is pending, but roads cannot be blocked,” the court had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-vehicular-traffic-yet-to-resume-at-up-gate-site-101635616981088.html

30-10-2021||Noida||Air quality in Noida, nearby areas improves from ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category||The air quality in Noida and adjoining areas improved from the ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category following stubble burning and winds carrying the dust particulates into the National Capital Region (NCR), weather experts said on Saturday.According to pollution monitoring agencies, the air quality index (AQI) in the region will improve further over the next two days due to the change in the wind direction.The Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB) said that the AQI reading, on a scale from zero to 500, Noida on Saturday recorded the AQI at 260 against 282 a day earlier. Ghaziabad’s AQI was recorded at 297 against 284 a day earlier, and Greater Noida at 273 against 321 on Friday.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the air quality is likely to improve in the coming days.“The AQI is in the ‘poor’ category and will remain the same on Sunday, and is likely to improve to the ‘poor’ or upper end of the ‘moderate’ category on Monday due to an expected change in the wind direction from the northwesterly to southeasterly, preventing transport of emissions from stubble burning. Share of crop residue burning emissions is about 12% (effective fire count being 1,826), which contributes to increase in the PM2.5 level due to the transport by northwesterly winds,” according to a statement issued by the Safar on Saturday.Meanwhile, Noida recorded a slight drop in the daytime temperatures.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida on Saturday was recorded at 29.2 degrees Celsius (°C) and 14.8°C, against 30.5°C and 14.8°C a day earlier. “The maximum and minimum temperatures will hover around 30°C and 15°C, respectively, on Sunday,” said an IMD official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-in-noida-nearby-areas-improves-from-very-poor-to-poor-category-101635616740868.html

The roads broke down completely within months of them being made.“For the last three years I have written to every authority concerned for the repair of these two roads but I have only received assurances and false promises from officials and ministers. No repair work has been done on these roads in this government,” said Singh. “I also raised this issue in the legislative assembly and was assured by the minister concerned that the roads will be repaired within three months. But his assurances were only a lie said on the floor of the House,” he added.Earlier this month, the MLA also met the district magistrate of Amethi and informed him about the need for repair of the roads. “Both the roads are important routes used by locals. Hundreds of accidents have occurred on them and several people have also lost their lives because of it. If the government cannot repair these roads, I will begin my sit-in from October 31,” said Singh.The MLA has announced that he will sit in protest at the Gandhi statue in Lucknow’s Hazratganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/unrepaired-roads-in-constituency-sp-mla-threatens-to-resign-from-up-assembly-sit-on-protest-101635616504293.html

30-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Industrial unit faces ₹25 lakh penalty for violating emission norms||The regional office of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has recommended a penalty of ₹25 lakh against an industrial unit in Sahibabad for failing to adhere to norms for reducing pollution-causing emissions. Officials said that the non-complying unit in Sahibabad was tracked by a night patrolling team on Friday. “We checked the same unit nearly two months ago and issued a show cause notice. On Friday night, our patrolling team again found the unit erring as emissions were higher than the standard limits. As the violation has taken place in the period when the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) is in place, we have recommended a hefty penalty of ₹25 lakh against the unit. The recommendation has been sent to the headquarters,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “This is the first instance of an industrial unit which was found non-complying with emission norms during the Grap period in the district this year,” said Sharma. The officials also said that the deadline of road repair works ended on October 30 and they will now start levying fines against the Ghaziabad municipal corporation.“We will now start penalising the Ghaziabad municipal corporation as many roads are still under construction/repairs even though the deadline set by the state government ended on October 30,” Sharma added. The officials said that the potholed roads are a major source of PM10 pollutants. They further said that a similar action may be initiated in connection with the surface relaying work of the CISF Road in Indirapuram which is pending for almost a year now and is a major source of dust pollution. According to data of the municipal corporation, the civic body is taking up pothole repair works over about 165km of roads and completed about 121km till October 28. The records also indicate that about 77km of road stretches were proposed for restoration while only 22km got completed till October 28. The corporation officials said that they completed almost 90% of the patch work and 86% of road restoration work before the monsoon, but prolonged spell of rains deteriorated the road conditions. “We have completed about 90% of the road repair/patch works as of today. It is likely to get complete in another day or two. Only the resurfacing works are pending, which will also be completed soon,” said NK Chaudhary, chief engineer of the corporation. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality of Ghaziabad on Saturday remained under the ‘poor’ category, with an air quality index (AQI) value of 297 as gainst 284 a day earlier. The UPPCB has implemented Grap in NCR cities of the state on directions of the CPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-industrial-unit-faces-25-lakh-penalty-for-violating-emission-norms-101635616500929.html
30-10-2021||Noida||Uttar Pradesh allows use and sale of green crackers for 2 hours on Diwali, but with riders||The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to allow use and sale of green crackers on Diwali only for two hours in areas where the air quality is in the ‘moderate’ category or better, officials said on Saturday.The move came following the recent directions by the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to keep the pollution levels in the region in check.The directions were issued by the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (home), Awanish Awasthi, on Friday night. “The Supreme Court has clarified in an order dated July 23, 2021, that if the air quality in the region is under the ‘moderate’ category or better, respective officials may allow use and sale of green crackers there,” according to the order by Awasthi.According to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) data, air quality in 27 cities was in the ‘moderate’ category between January and September this year. The 27 cities being monitored during this period included Ghaziabad and Noida among others.However, green cracker traders said that the administration officials in Ghaziabad have not responded to them over the issue of licence for sale of the crackers. “We are running from pillar to post to meet every concerned officer, but no one is telling us clearly if they will give us the licenses for sale of green crackers even after the directions issued by the ACS (home). We have made investments in huge amounts, and those are stuck up. Only five days are left for Diwali, but we have not received any clear answer in the matter. In such a case, we have no option left but to stage a protest,” said Ashutosh Gupta, president of Footkar Cracker Association, Ghaziabad.“According to the order issued by the Uttar Pradesh government, Ghaziabad is listed among the 27 cities having ‘moderate’ air quality,” Gupta added.Officials have also been asked to follow the December 1, 2020, order of the National Green Tribunal. “There will be a total ban on sale and use of all fire crackers during the Covid-19 pandemic in the National Capital Region (NCR) and all cities or towns in the country, where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ category and above,” said the NGT’s December 1, 2020, order quoting the Uttar Pradesh government’s directions.Officials of the Ghaziabad administration, on the other hand, said that they will take the present air quality of the city into account to bring in the move.“We have taken a legal opinion in the matter, and will take into account the current AQI which is under the ‘poor’ category. If the AQI is ‘moderate’ or better, we may allow sale and use of crackers as directed. In case the AQI is in the ‘moderate’ category or better on Diwali, which will be celebrated on November 4 this year, we will allow sale of green crackers to seven traders -- who already have permission for the same,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city).Ever since the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) was put in place in Ghaziabad on October 15, 2021, the city’s AQI has been recorded between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ category, except for being under the ‘good’ category on October 18, 2021, and the ‘satisfactory’ category on October 19 and 25 this year, besides being under the ‘moderate’ category on October 26 this year.An air quality index (AQI) between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On the other hand, police officials of Noida said that the department is deliberating on the matter and more details will be shared at the earliest. The issuance of licence is under the jurisdiction of the police, after the Commissionerate system was implemented in Noida.Love Kumar, joint commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the Commissionerate has received directions from Uttar Pradesh government on issuance of licence to vendors for selling green fire crackers. “We are studying the order... We will take suitable measures on this at the earlies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/uttar-pradesh-allows-use-and-sale-of-green-crackers-for-2-hours-on-diwali-but-with-riders-101635616140948.html

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Minor child’s welfare responsibility of both parents: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has said that it is the responsibility of both the parents to bring up a minor child and look after the child’s welfare, both emotionally and financially.The HC bench of justice Jaishree Thakur dismissed the plea of a Haryana resident, who had challenged a Mahendergarh family court order of asking the husband to pay an interim monthly maintenance of ₹8,000 to the minor daughter, who was residing with his estranged wife.The husband was directed by the family court in September on maintenance plea from the child and family court as an interim measure awarded this amount till the final decision, further observing that any amount of interim maintenance awarded was adjustable with any other amount awarded at the time of resolution of dispute.In the HC, the husband had argued that the wife is working as a nurse and earns ₹12,000 per month. However, the court directed for interim maintenance to him only.The husband, in the HC, had argued that it is the moral responsibility of both the parents to look after the upbringing and welfare of the minor child, but in the case in hand, he has been burdened with the entire liability to do so.She too would be responsible for upbringing and welfare of the minor daughter, he had demanded, adding that the matter should be sent to the mediation and conciliation centre for one-time settlement.The court, while observing that responsibility lies with both the parents, dismissed his plea and said the daughter is residing with the mother and she is providing her all essentials, out of her monthly earning, whereas, the husband is earning ₹36,953 per month as per the records submitted in court.“Thus, the court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order (family court order). Needless to say, at the time of final adjudication any payment made will be automatically adjustable,” the court of justice Jaishree Thakur said.As of demand for mediation proceedings, the HC said the family court could be approached for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/minor-child-s-welfare-responsibility-of-both-parents-hc-101635615251899.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Police fail to submit forensic report, HC grants bail in 1.6kg drug seizure case||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted default bail to a Fatehabad resident who was arrested with 1.6kg ganja in December 2020.In the case in hand, the police had submitted challan without the forensic report. Taking that as ground, accused Bhim Sain had approached high court seeking bail earlier this month.The FIR in question was registered on December 22, 2020 under the NDPS Act at station city, Fatehabad. The challan was submitted on February 11.The petitioner had argued that in various judgments it had been held that filing of the challan without FSL report will not be regarded as a complete challan and, thus, the accused will be entitled to default bail.The government had admitted that FSL report has not been submitted but reasoned that challan will be considered a complete one.Taking note of the fact that the challan has not been submitted and the importance of FSL report in drugs cases, the bench of justice Anupinder Singh Grewal ordered release of the accused on bail.Earlier this month, a coordinate bench too had released an accused from Sirsa on bail on similar grounds observing that the forensic reports in drugs seizure cases form the foundation of the case of prosecution and in case the same is not there, the entire case of prosecution “falls to ground”. In both the cases in hand, accused were found with commercial quantity drugs.The court also took note of strong observations made in one Ajit Singh’s case in which another bench had observed: “We emphasise on the stringent aspect of the NDPS Act which would compellingly persuade us to take the aforesaid view (granting default bail). Without determining the nature and content of the contraband, it will be draconian to propel an accused into the throes of a trial.”“The liberty of an individual will constantly be imperiled at the hands of dubious officials of the police who may venture to falsely implicate a person,” the bench had observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-fail-to-submit-forensic-report-hc-grants-bail-in-1-6kg-drug-seizure-case-101635615000766.html

The half-day protest was planned by ‘Save Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary’ and saw nearly 200 people join the fast at different times of the day. Deputy leader of the Shiv Sena, Sachin Ahir, visited the site along with local leaders including the local MLA. Additional commissioner Kunal Khemnar and his team from the PMC also visited the site and were taken for a quick tour of the sanctuary.Ornithologist Dharmaraj Patil said, “The area is visited by 110 local and migratory birds, or more. Even today, a large number of ornithologists came to study them. We showed them the birds and the many illegal things taking place at the sanctuary. Ahir assured action to protect the sanctuary and directed the PMC team as well. He also assured that he would take the land dispute matter to the environment minister.”Joining the group via video call was actor-turned-environmental activist Sayaji Shinde who tried to understand the reason behind the protest. Patil said, “This is quite a fruitful day in the life of the sanctuary and we hope that an Aarey-like decision will be taken in favour of the Dr Salim Ali sanctuary as well,” Patil said.Satya Natarajan, member of ‘Save Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary’, said, “The Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary in Yerawada has been a victim of the apathy of administrative authorities for many years. In such a large area of 22 acre adjacent to Pune city, some people with unholy intentions have been working towards destroying the green belt rich in trees and biodiversity. In the past two years, a large number of trees have been axed, debris and rubble from nearby construction sites has been thrown inside, and even the trees transplanted by the Maha Metro have been killed.”Meghana Baphna, member of ‘Save Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary’ and resident of Kalyani nagar, said, “There are a lot of illegal activities underway such as dumping construction debris in the natural stream passing through the sanctuary. Ahir suggested that the commissioner lodge an FIR against such activities. The commissioner too has promised proper action against the perpetrators of illegal dumping in the sanctuary. Further damage to the sanctuary will have to be stopped with immediate effect. We will be discussing further with officials in Mumbai and mapping a concrete plan to save this beautiful oasis in the heart of the city and prevent it from becoming a dump yard. Our immediate demands are clean up every bit of debris in the sanctuary, let the nullah flow freely and remove every obstacle in its natural flow, maintain a gate to the sanctuary to disallow dump trucks from entering, and have security for the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/locals-activists-hold-sit-in-fast-to-protect-dr-salim-ali-bird-sanctuary-in-pune-101635614881052.html

They accused the vice-chancellor of giving patronage to the three accused.Victim’s mother, who is also a contractual employee at MDU, said the culprits behind her son’s death are roaming freely and police have failed to take action against them.“A cop had visited our house and threatened that we will not get justice by raising slogans outside the V-C’s house,” the victim’s mother said, adding, “If police will not take action against the accused, I will also end my life.”INSO national president Pradeep Deswal alleged that the V-C is shielding the accused as his camp office OSD has been booked.“There were many complaints against the OSD but the V-C had thrown them in the dustbin. The victim had written three persons’ names in the suicide note and a fair enquiry is needed,” he added.After two hours of protest, the V-C came out and said, “The victim had been recruited through an agency and was not a permanent employee. Police are investigating the case.”Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Udai Singh Meena said police are investigating the matter.“I have not received any complaint that some cop had given threats to the victim’s mother. We are aware of the fact that the victim’s family protested outside the V-C’s residence,” the SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deceased-gardener-s-family-protests-outside-mdu-v-c-s-residence-101635614822477.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Another procurement scam of ₹5.06 crore detected in Karnal, 12 mandi officials booked||Another scam of bogus paddy procurement of 25,852 quintal worth around ₹5.06 crore was detected in Karnal’s Jundla grain market, putting a question mark on the Haryana government’s claims of making the procurement process transparent.Police have registered a first investigation report (FIR) against 12 people, including eight employees of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board, for the alleged irregularities in paddy procurement.The inquiry has also hinted at collusion on part of the food supply officials and Hafed officials, who were deputed at Jundla for making procurement of PR paddy after physical verification.Action was initiated following inquiry and physical verification by a team under Hisar zonal marketing enforcement officer (ZMEO) Nihal Singh.As per this report, 68,935 bags (each containing 37.5kg) of 25,852 quintal procured parmal varieties of paddy was not found on the spot exposing that fictitious gate passes were issued in this regard by the staff of the grain market concerned.The FIR was registered against Jundla secretary market committee Ajay Kumar, auction recorders Anil and Dilshad Ahmad, mandi supervisor Kuldeep Singh, auction recorders (market committee Naresh Chander and Vikas Maan, and computer operators Rohit, Asmit Singh, Bhawar Singh, Mohit, Ajay Kumar and Amit Kumar under Sections 409, 420, 467 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and an investigation has been initiated.The report has accused auction recorders Anil Kumar and Dilshad Ahmad of deliberately issuing fictitious incoming gate passes of paddy without actual arrival in the mandi. It has mentioned details of the computer operators of the mandi including Rohit, Asmit Singh, Bhawar Singh, Mohit, Ajay and Amit Kumar, who were on duty when the fictitious gate passes were generated.The report revealed that the mandi secretary, who is overall in-charge of the mandi, has failed to perform his duty efficiently by not controlling the issuance of fictitious incoming gate passes without the actual arrival of PR paddy.The report revealed that it is the duty of the purchase agency officials to verify each and every stock record before procurement. But the availability of less stock than shown in the records, indicated that they too had indulged in bogus purchase without actual arrival of the produce in the mandi, thereby leaving all opportunity to the millers to cover up the stock by purchasing paddy or rice from the adjoining states at lesser rates.Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board chief administrator Vinay Yadav said, “The FIR has been registered and other departmental action is to follow against the officials involved in this fictitious procurement.”He said efforts are being made for corruption-free procurement in state and strict action will be taken against people involved in the fictitious procurement.This is the second such scam reported in Karnal within a fortnight as 32 people, including a mandi supervisor, auction recorder, two computer operators and 28 commission agents were booked for alleged bogus procurement of 12,573 quintal paddy of ₹4.81 crore at Gheer grain market in Karnal district on October 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/another-procurement-scam-of-rs-5-06-crore-detected-in-karnal-12-mandi-officials-booked-101635614522175.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||Anupriya’s efforts to unite Apna Dal factions suffer jolt||Union minister and Apna Dal (S) president Anupriya Patel’s efforts to unite Apna Dal (S) and Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) seems to have suffered a blow as Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) president and Anupriya’s mother Krishna Patel has alleged that Apna Dal (S) working president Ashish Patel is making attempts to weaken her party. Ashish Patel, an MLC, is also the husband of Union minister Anupriya Patel. In September, Anupriya Patel had sent a proposal to her mother for uniting Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) with Apna Dal (S).Addressing a press conference here on Friday night, Krishna Patel also alleged that Ashish Patel was an agent of the BJP and had an eye on her property. “Recently, a letter addressed to the director general of police, UP, went viral on social media. It demanded protection for me. In the letter, it was shown that there was a dispute between my daughters regarding my property,” Patel said. “In this regard, I want to say it clearly that all our movable and immovable properties have been earned by my husband Dr Sonelal Patel and I. Therefore, I am the natural owner of the properties after Dr Patel,” she said. She further alleged that the Ashish interfered in each and every affair of her house. She said that she was facing a threat under present circumstances and therefore she should be provided security. She said while fighting against social injustice, unemployment and anti-farmer policies of the central and the state governments, her party would overcome these conspiracies and once again emerge as a big force in the state. My party would play an important role in the formation of next government in UP after 2022 assembly polls, she claimed. Meanwhile, refuting all allegations, Apna Dal (S) working president Ashish Patel said, “Mata Ji (Krishna Patel) is under pressure from her other daughter Pallavi Patel and son-in-law Pankaj Niranjan. That is why she is speaking like that. All allegations against me are baseless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/anupriyas-efforts-to-unite-apna-dal-factions-suffer-jolt-101635614342683.html

The owners were asked to remove their goods and items first, after which the demolition was carried out,” said Lot.Officials from the enforcement team further said that illegal structures along MG Road and around Sikanderpur will be removed in the coming days. “Wherever green belts and government land has encroached illegally, it will be cleared.

30-10-2021||Lucknow||Comply with order on security deposit interest payment or face action: UPERC to discoms||Passing severe strictures against distribution companies (discoms) for still not complying with its order asking it to pay consumers the interest on their security deposit, the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) has granted one last chance to them by providing three months’ time to ensure compliance or face penal action.The commission has asked discoms to also submit an interim report on the progress made in the matter by November 15. The commission got furious when discoms sought more time to comply with the commission’s earlier order. “Despite the categorical submission made by director, UPPCL, in July 2019, request is being made to provide another three months even after lapse of more than one-and-a-half-years from the committed time. It is an extremely disturbing situation galore with consumer apathy that even after two years from the committed time, the respondents need more time to comply with the directions,” the three-member bench headed by UPERC chairman RP Singh observed in its order on October 27.Earlier during the hearing, the UPPCL submitted that the KESCO was already making timely payment of interest on security deposit and apprised the commission that other four discoms had also submitted that, as per the decision taken in the board meeting, it was decided that the system shall be updated in the next few months depending upon the connected load and other conditions associated with the consumers but said that required more time to update security data.“The commission has so far been patient and tolerant with the licensee and thus provides one last opportunity to the licensee before initiating the proceedings under Section 142 of the Electricity Act 2003. But it also reminds the licensee not to test the patience of the commission or else it will most certainly invite the wrath of the commission,” the commission further noted in its order.The commission also raised concern on the issue that information about large number of consumers was still not available with the discoms. “The commission is anguished and peeved that interest on security deposit, which is being approved by the commission for the past so many years as part of the annual revenue requirement (ARR) is not being credited into the accounts of the consumers on one pretext or the other,” the commission observed. “Not having information about security deposit status of large chunk of consumers and almost no visible effort to rectify the situation is now not in the zone of monopolistic lackadaisical attitude rather it is criminal on consumers. Even the amount that has been credited in the current financial year has not been provided by MVVNL and PuWNL,” it added.Observing that the attitude of the licensee (UPPCL/discoms) was the most consumer-insensitive and in total disregard of rules/ regulations, the commission granted one last opportunity by providing three-month time to the discoms to ensure compliance and submit the information on amount of interest on security deposit paid in FY 2021-22, number of consumers who have been paid interest on security deposit along with the amount numbers of consumers who have not been paid interest on security deposit in the past 10 years and treatment of arrear in regard to interest on security deposit that was not paid to the consumers.The security deposit is the amount that a consumer has to pay to the discom concerned while taking an electricity connection and the amount is refunded once the consumer surrenders the connection permanently. The amount depends on the nature and number of kws (kilowatts) of the connection. Under the rules, discoms must pay interest annually on the security deposit at the prevailing bank rate or above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/comply-with-order-on-security-deposit-interest-payment-or-face-action-uperc-to-discoms-101635613920685.html

Police said three other friends of the victim who were also booked for the murder are being questioned. The victim has been identified as Mohammed Mohamud Duale. According to police, a group of eight friends were having a party at a hotel in Sector 45 on Wednesday night. After midnight, all of them went to one of the suspects’ house in Mayfair Garden in Sector 50.Police said soon, an argument broke out and snowballed into an ugly fight. The suspects allegedly pushed the victim and his head banged against a wall after which he fell unconscious. Police said the suspects were in an inebriated state and didn’t realise the intensity of the injury at that time. They put the victim on a bed and fell asleep. Abdirizak Mohamud Hassan, a cousin of the deceased, said he received a call from a relative who informed him about Duale’s death. Police said Duale was living in Delhi and had gone to Gurugram on Wednesday to attend a party.

30-10-2021||Delhi||Liquor likely to cost more in Delhi from November 17. Here's why||Amid the festive season, liquor prices in Delhi are likely to go up very soon as private vends open from November 17 under the new excise policy. The Delhi government’s excise department is still in the process of fixing the maximum retail price (MRP) of liquor brands to be registered in Delhi. However, officials noted that the wholesale prices of all types of liquor -- Indian or foreign -- are likely to increase by 8-9 per cent."The increase in wholesale price will lead to at least 5-10 per cent increase in MRP of liquor, although the actual effect will be realised only after the new retail system as per the excise policy for 2021-22 is in place," a liquor trader told news agency PTI.All the 849 vends in the national capital will be operated by private entities from November 17.Under the new Excise Policy 2021-22, the excise duty and VAT have been subsumed in the licence fee. A nominal excise duty and VAT of 1% each on wholesale price (WSP) of the alcoholic beverage will be levied to arrive at the landing price to the retailer, the order read.The EffectThe order stated that since all vends shall be operated by private business entities in a competitive market environment, they are likely to operate at their maximum efficiency and as a result, the market size in terms of number of casks sold is likely to show a significant increase as compared to 2019-20.So far, tipplers in Delhi have enjoyed a relatively lower price for their alcoholic beverages when compared with the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Considering the incorporation of factors including central sales tax at 2%, profit margin for the wholesaler, import pass fee and freight and handling charges, as approved in the Excise Policy 2021-22, the impact is 10 per cent to 25 per cent rise for some brands of whisky (Indian manufactured foreign liquor or IMFL), with fluctuation per unit from 8 per cent (Royal Stag Premier) to 25.9 per cent (Blenders Pride Rare), PTI reported.A similar impact is expected on all other categories of liquor as well.Moreover, the capping of ₹50 as retail margin on sale of IMFL and ₹100 on sale of foreign liquor has been discontinued and there will be no cap on the retail margin of IMFL, foreign liquor, beer and wine.The competitive market forces will keep watch over the sale price to the consumer, the order said.At the same time, discount on MRP has been allowed in the Excise Policy 2021-22 to bring competitive market forces into effect.The Risk"It is important that the consumer should not be burdened with price increase. The changes brought about in the new excise policy will need reasonable time to play out in the market,” the order stated."In the overall interests of consumers of Delhi, to prevent the interstate smuggling, the MRP for 2021-22 should as far as possible be in the same range as prevailing in Delhi," it said, adding that the impact of increase in wholesale price (if any) also needs to be factored in while fixing the MRP.The Excise Commissioner will fix MRP for each liquor brand and product after taking into account the input of licensees and the price of the product in the neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.Nearly 40% or 260 of the city-state’s liquor shops, the private vends, have already shut on October 1 and will remain closed till November 16.So far, the majority of retail sales in Delhi was handled by the government's agencies. During the transition period in October, only government-run liquor outlets are open.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/liquor-likely-to-cost-more-in-delhi-from-november-17-here-s-why-101635613119382.html
30-10-2021||Gurugram||No central helpline number in Gurugram for reporting complaints of air pollution||Authorities in Gurugram are yet to come up with a centralised helpline number, where residents can lodge complaints of sources contributing to air pollution, even though almost a month has passed since the district administration issued the first set of directions to nearly 40 agencies to combat air pollution in the district ahead of winter. Officials from Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said the air quality monitoring control room could not be set up as contractual workers cannot be hired, according to an order issued by the state government in September. S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “In the last week of September, the state government issued an order stating that no outsourced workers can be hired, due to which the process of setting up the air quality monitoring control room has been delayed. We are in touch with the officials concerned and taking up the matter on priority. The control room should be functional by the first week of November, when it is being predicted that the air quality in the National Capital Region is likely to drop to very poor category.” The control room usually has five members, including a supervisor, who monitor activities such as dust control measures, sprinkling of water, open waste burning and local sources of pollution. Officials from Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said no helpline number has been released but the air lab for monitoring local sources of pollution have been set up at Sector 42. Subash Yadav, nodal officer for urban environment at MCG said, “As part of implementing the measures listed in the graded response action plan (Grap) on October 15, the air lab was set up in Sector 42. We have been monitoring local sources of pollution and all departments have been directed to take measures to prevent deterioration of air quality. We are also in the process of issuing challans to violators. No helpline numbers have been issued but we learn about violations from residents and take action accordingly.” Meanwhile, residents said that in the past few days, waste burning has increased in the city, with such instances coming to the fore on a daily basis. This week, waste burning incidents have been reported from Sector 62 and Sector 57 among other areas. Ruchika Sethi, a member of Citizens for Clean Air, a city-based group, said, “At this point, someone from the enforcement agencies should start taking accountability as waste burning is not a sporadic issue anymore but rather rampant. It has become a conventional practice of managing waste and is not considered a risk to health. Air pollution itself is not considered as a risk to human health and environmental safety. While we appreciate a quick response system to waste fires and night time patrolling, we need preventive action here, as once waste is burnt, the toxic emissions are already in our breathing system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-central-helpline-number-in-gurugram-for-reporting-complaints-of-air-pollution-101635613320613.html

30-10-2021||Delhi||DU to name two upcoming colleges after Veer Savarkar, Sushma Swaraj||New Delhi: The Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh has selected the names of Veer Savarkar and late BJP leader Sushma Swaraj for two upcoming colleges of the university.During an executive council meeting on Friday, the VC declared that the names of Swaraj and Savarkar had been finalised for consideration from among the other names in the fray. Seema Das, an executive council member, said that the EC had been informed about a pool of names in the previous meeting. “The VC was supposed to finalise some names from the pool. During the meeting on Friday, when a member sought an update on the development, we were told that these two names were finalised,” said Das. The idea of naming upcoming colleges was first floated in an academic council meeting in August.Rajpal Singh Pawar, another EC member who was present at Friday’s meeting, said that he was among a few who raised objections to point out that the shortlisted names were of people associated with a particular ideology. “In the last meeting, we had asked them to add more names. We had pointed out that none of the two names had any connection with the field of education. We suggested that they could give other names such as that of APJ Abdul Kalam. The VC was authorised to make the selection,” said Pawar. AK Bhagi, former EC member and president of National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF), a right-wing teachers’ group, said that plans for naming upcoming colleges after Swaraj and Savarkar were finalised in August itself.

30-10-2021||Other||Gurugram: Bursting of crackers allowed for 2 hours subject to good air quality||The district administration issued an order on Saturday evening allowing residents to burst green crackers strictly between 8pm and 10pm on Diwali, which will be observed on November 4 this year, only if the air quality remains in the moderate zone or below. According to the order, which came into immediate effect on Saturday and will remain in force till 6am on November 5, sale and use of only reduced emission firecrackers or green crackers is allowed in Gurugram district. The order, issued by deputy commissioner Yash Garg, mentions that following orders of the Supreme Court and Commission for Air Quality Management, “There will be total ban on sale and use of all kinds of fire crackers during Covid-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category.” Directions have been issued to allow only use of green crackers in cities/towns, where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below, for a duration of not more than two hours. “...celebration of any specified festivals or permitted occasions will continue,” said the order. “The orders have been issued as a preventive measure and bursting of crackers will be allowed only if the air quality is in the moderate zone,” said an official from the district administration requesting anonymity. According to experts, the air quality in the national capital territory is likely to dip to very poor category by November 3, a day prior to Diwali, and then increase significantly with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 as the predominant pollutant. “The manufacture, sale and use of joined firecrackers [series crackers or laris) is hereby banned as the same causes huge air, noise and solid waste problems. The sale is permitted only through Iicensed traders... (who) can sell only those firecrackers which are permitted by the order of Supreme Court of India. Even those firecrackers which have already been produced and they do not fulfil the conditions mentioned in Suggestion Nos. II and III (that is green crackers) above are not allowed to be sold in district Gurugram,” said the order. In case of violations, people can register complaints by calling on toll free number 18001801817 or e-mail at cmc@mcg.gov.in. According to the order, the deputy commissioner of police, Gurugram, commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, all sub-divisional magistrates, duty magistrates, and station house officers of Gurugram district shall ensure strict implementation of the order. According to the directions mentioned in the order, “All the official respondents, and particularly the police, shall ensure... that there is no sale of banned firecrackers. In case any violation is found in the implementation of the order, the station house officer of the police station concerned... shall be held personally liable for such violation and this would amount to committing contempt of the court, for which such SHO(s) would be proceeded against.” The regional offices of the pollution control board have also been directed to carry out short-term monitoring in the district for 14 days--seven days prior to Diwali and seven days after the festival--to check for parameters like emission of aluminium, barium and iron. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer for Gurugram north, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said monitoring of the above mentioned three parameters started on October 28 and will continue even after Diwali. Meanwhile, on Saturday, Gurugram recorded poor air quality for the second consecutive day with an AQI of 272 and PM 2.5 as the prominent pollutant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-bursting-of-crackers-allowed-for-2-hours-subject-to-good-air-quality-101635613082392.html
30-10-2021||Kolkata||Bypolls 2021: Bengal records 71% turnout till 5pm amid sporadic scuffle||A high voter turnout of nearly 71 per cent was recorded till 5 pm on Saturday in West Bengal's four assembly constituencies where bypolls were held, an official said. Barring a few stray incidents, polling, which began at 7 am, passed off peacefully in all four constituencies, the Election Commission official said.According to the official, Dinhata registered 69.97 per cent turnout till 5 pm, Shantipur 76.14 per cent, Khardah 63.90 per cent and Gosaba (SC seat) 75.91 per cent. The final poll percentage at 6.30 pm will be available only on Sunday. "Voting has been peaceful and there was no problem anywhere across the four segments," he told PTI. Scuffle between TMC and BJP supporters was, however, reported outside a booth in Khardah, where saffron party candidate Joy Saha apparently caught hold of a "fake voter" and handed him over to the police. "The man is a Bangladeshi infiltrator. He came here to cast his vote in favour of the TMC," Saha said. TMC candidate and state minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay dubbed the allegations as baseless. Security personnel had to use baton to disperse the crowd outside the Khardah booth. According to TMC members, deceased MLA Kajal Sinha's son, Arjodeep, was injured in the melee and had to be hospitalised. The ruling party activists gheraoed Saha's car and staged a sit-in on G T road for some time. Kajal Sinha's death due to COVID-19 necessitated the bypoll in Khardah. TMC MP Sougata Roy claimed that Saha's security personnel assaulted Arjodeep. "People of Khardah will give a befitting to the BJP for beating up Kajal Sinha's son. Joy Saha's security personnel mercilessly assaulted Arjodeep," Roy said. During the day, senior CPI(M) leader Tanmay Bhattacharya had also claimed that his car was attacked when he was about to enter a party office in Khardah. He accused TMC activists of carrying out the attack, an allegation that the ruling party denied. Similar brawls among activists of rival political parties were also reported from Shantipur in Nadia district and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas district. In Santipur, Nadia district, BJP's Jagannath Sarkar gave up his assembly membership to retain his Lok Sabha seat. Gosaba in South 24 Parganas fell vacant following the death of sitting TMC MLA Jayanta Naskar. In Dinhata constituency of Coochbehar district, TMC candidate Udayan Guha accused Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nisith Pramanik of entering booth number 232 with armed guards. "Such an incident has created a reign of fear in the area. This is unacceptable. We have complained to the EC," Guha told reporters. Pramanik, whose resignation from the assembly led to the bypoll in Dinhata, denied the allegations as "politically motivated". The EC had ordered strict maintenance of COVID-19 guidelines during the by-elections to the four seats. It deployed 27 companies of central armed forces in Dinhata, 22 in Santipur, 20 in Khardah and 23 in Gosaba, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bypolls-2021-bengal-records-71-turnout-till-5pm-amid-sporadic-scuffle-101635607582749.html
30-10-2021||Pune||Covid: Only 3,400 pregnant women vaccinated in Pune since July 20||PUNE: Despite the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) having found Covid-19 vaccines safe for pregnant women in July this year, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) ever since has managed to vaccinate only over 3,400 out of the nearly 66,000 pregnant women at any given point of time in a city with an estimated population of 50 lakh.Dr Suryakant Devkar, PMC immunisation officer, said, “We have vaccinated over 3,478 pregnant women in Pune city through various campaigns like special sessions for women, priority sessions for pregnant women or those with special abilities. The central government has allowed vaccination for pregnant women since July and starting July 20 till Friday, we have been able to vaccinate over 3,400 women.”However, vaccinating over 3,400 out of the nearly 66,000 pregnant women at any given point of time in the city as per PMC records is just nominal. Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer, said, “As per the annual records, given the population of the city which could now be over five million, we assume that there are over 66,000 women who are pregnant.”The ICMR approved vaccination against Covid-19 for pregnant women and even those breastfeeding after both vaccines were found safe and pregnant women were found to be vulnerable and in need of the vaccines.Dr Sanjay Gupte, former president of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society of India and city-based obstetrician, said, “Despite creating awareness among women that vaccinating pregnant women would actually help the child, women are hesitant to take the vaccine because of side effects post vaccination like fever or rumours regarding clotting and other such issues. Also, some women who have difficulty conceiving or are planning to have a child may not take the vaccine fearing that it may either lead to abortion or make it difficult to conceive. Now that the number of new cases is going down, the need for the vaccine is also going down among pregnant women.”Dr Gupte added that there have been multiple studies proving that the antibodies formed in the mother post vaccination are transferred to the child in due course, thereby providing protection to the child as well and so, such fear and vaccine hesitancy is baseless and every pregnant woman should get the jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-only-3-400-pregnant-women-vaccinated-in-pune-since-july-20-101635612840712.html

30-10-2021||Lucknow||Mathura lawyer to represent three Kashmiri students charged with sedition||A Mathura lawyer has accepted the brief to represent three Kashmiri students charged with sedition after they allegedly praised Pakistan on WhatsApp after the Indian cricket team’s defeat in a T20 World Cup match in Dubai on October 24.The Mathura lawyer, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, has come forward despite Agra lawyers deciding not to contest the case on behalf of the three Kashmiri students.“Family members of all three Kashmiri students contacted me on Friday evening and asked me to represent their sons currently in Agra jail. I have accepted the brief and would be contesting their case,” Chaturvedi said on Saturday.He is also the lawyer of Atiq-ur-Rehman, Masood Ahmed and Mohammad Alam who, along with Delhi-based Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, were arrested in October 2020 while moving towards Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gang raped and killed last year.These four were charged with sedition and under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Differing with the stand of the Agra lawyers, Chaturvedi said, “It is a question of the image that our country carries internationally of a cultured and law-abiding democracy where no one is punished without being provided the opportunity of being heard. We lawyers are proud to be part of the judicial system which is held in high regard and we are all liable to safeguard the values on which our judicial system stands.” “The lawyers of Agra can oppose me but this would not deter me from keeping alive the values of the judicial system of our great nation,” Chaturvedi said, adding that he would seek bail for all three Kashmiri students at an appropriate time. The Agra lawyers stuck to their stand that they would not appear for the Kashmiri students. “These three Kashmiri students were studying in the prestigious Engineering College of Agra because of PMSSS (Prime Minister Special Scholarship Scheme), yet they preferred to insult India and praise Pakistan once the result went against India in T20 World Cup match between India and Pakistan,” said Nitin Verma, the division head of Yuva Adhivakta Sangh, a body of young lawyers. Ajay Singh, a lawyer and convenor of the Jan Manch in Agra, echoed similar sentiments and held that it was the patriotic duty of lawyers not to appear on behalf of those booked for sedition. The case against the three Kashmiri students was registered on a complaint from Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader Gaurav Rajawat on Tuesday last (October 26), who alleged that the three had raised “anti-national” slogans and praised Pakistan after the match on Sunday last. The RBS Engineering College in Agra suspended the three students from the college hostel on Monday. These three students were arrested by the Agra police on Wednesday evening and were sent to jail after being charged with sedition and presented in an Agra court on Thursday (October 28).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mathura-lawyer-to-represent-three-kashmiri-students-charged-with-sedition-101635612602119.html

30-10-2021||Lucknow||Three more Zika virus cases in Kanpur, two of them IAF personnel||Three more cases of Zika virus were reported in Kanpur on Saturday, taking the tally in the district to four, the highest anywhere after Kerala where 90 cases have been recorded, said health officials.Kanpur district magistrate Vishakh G Iyer confirmed the new cases.The development comes a week after the first case of Zika virus in Uttar Pradesh was reported in Kanpur on October 23 when an IAF warrant officer’s sample tested positive.Among the three new patients, two are Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel and one is a civilian (a family member of one of the infected personnel). Their reports came in on Saturday evening from King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow.“The health department had sent 500 samples of IAF personnel, their family members and people living in a radius of two km of IAF station to KGMU. Three of these samples tested positive,” the district magistrate said.Zika virus disease is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, which bite during the day. Symptoms are generally mild and include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache.While the source of the infection in Kanpur hasn’t been traced, the storage facility between hangars seven and eight at the IAF station has emerged as an area of interest. Specialists from the Centre and the state are camping in the city for about a week. The health authorities believe this storage facility could be the possible breeding ground at IAF station.“Three of the infected IAF personnel were working in hangars seven and eight and may have contracted the infection,” said a senior health official, adding the focus was on this facility and necessary steps were being taken.In the first case, the IAF warrant officer was afflicted with fever and admitted in 7 Air Force Hospital.When there was no improvement in his condition, the doctors sent his samples for tests to the National Institute of Virology on October 20, on suspicion that he had contracted a vector-borne disease.Twenty-two contacts of the IAF warrant officer had tested negative. The reports of subsequent samples, around 250, had been negative too.But the fresh cases have put the health department back on its toes and the area of screening has been increased. The sampling would be done as far as Adarsh Nagar and Shyam Nagar localities where three infected people lived. The focus was earlier on Pardevanpurwa, the IAF station and localities within a one km radius.Iyer said the priority was pregnant women at the IAF station and other localities.“We have asked the IAF to share the details of such women, their samples will be taken and tested in Lucknow,” he said.The Zika virus is known to affect the baby’s head in the womb, said the health experts.Kanpur’s chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh said the health department has formed containment clusters—each consisting of 400 houses.The teams were doing rigorous screening, source reduction, anti-larva spray and identification of people who are sick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/three-more-zika-virus-cases-in-kanpur-two-of-them-iaf-personnel-101635612420566.html

The park has swings, green patches for canines and their pet parents, civic officials said. North corporation mayor, Raja Iqbal Singh, in his inaugural speech, said with the advent of Covid-19 pandemic, the lives of pet dogs and their parents got confined to indoors, which made them fall prey to lifestyle diseases. “This park, which is the first of its kind in Delhi, will help the pets to stay fit, rejuvenate and recreate in safe open spaces like parks. They will also get free check-up and anti-rabies vaccination here,” he said. Vishakha Yadav, assistant deputy commissioner (Karol Bagh), said a seamless registration counter has also been installed to ensure adequate safety measures for the pets and the pet parents. “Beautifully depicted dog caricatures and paintings are drawn throughout the park, giving it a lively atmosphere.

A few more witnesses will be provided security after analysing their threat perception, the officials said.The security was provided to the witnesses after the Supreme Court on October 26 ordered protection for them and directed the UP police to expedite recording of the eyewitness’ statements before a judicial magistrate.Lakhimpur Kheri additional superintendent of police (ASP) Arun Kumar Singh, who is a member of the nine- member Special Investigation Team probing the violence, said one armed police personnel each has been deployed for the security of the 60 witnesses.Sharing further details, another police officer requesting anonymity said at least 17 more witnesses were likely to get security. He said the police officials have decided to give a gunner to all such witnesses whose statement has been recorded before a judicial magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).He said the judicial statement of 77 witnesses has been recorded till Saturday.The statements of only those witnesses, who have revealed any crucial facts about the incident, were recorded before the judicial magistrate, he said.Besides, the statements of over 30 more witnesses have been recorded by police under Section 161 of CrPC, the officer said. Over 50 people, who were present at the site of the incident on October 3, turned up to record their statements at the crime branch office at Lakhimpur Kheri reserve police lines on Saturday. The SIT had released contact numbers of its members, urging eyewitnesses to come forward and contact them to record their statements and provide digital evidence, said senior police officials on October 26.On October 3, violence erupted after a car mowed down four farmers near Banbirpur village under Tikunia police station limits of Lakhimpur Kheri. Four other people, including two BJP workers, Shubham Mishra and Shyam Sunder, journalist Raman Kashyap and a driver, Hari Om Mishra, were also killed.Two separate FIRs—the first in connection with the mowing down of four farmers and the second regarding the killing of the four others—were registered at the Tikunia police station.

30-10-2021||Lucknow||Rectified spirit recovered from licensed liquor shop in UP’s Pratapgarh||A team of excise department of Prayagraj raided and seized five drums of rectified spirit and 31 cartons of Indian liquor from a licensed liquor shop at Kanevara under Fatanpur police station of Prataparh district late Friday night, police said. However, MLA Raniganj Dheeraj Ojha alleged that the raid and the recovery were fake and demanded a fair probe. SP-Pratapgarh Satpal Antil said “Excise officials from Prayagraj led by inspector Ajay Kumar Singh raided the liquor shop owned by Arun Kumar Saroj of Aamapur Berra village of Raniganj area of Pratapagrh and seized five drums of rectified spirit and 31 cartons of Indian liquor.”However, on Saturday when the excise department team reached the Fatanpur police station to get an FIR lodged, the Raniganj MLA also reached the spot and alleged that the excise team has shown fake recovery, he said.CO Raniganj Atul Anjan Tripathi also reached the police station and tried to assure the MLA of proper action based on facts of the raid. The MLA also went to Kanevara and repeated his demand of a fair probe. “There was no ruckus but the MLA insisted that a fair and proper investigation be carried out and only then action be initiated so that no innocent suffers,” Antil added. Rectified spirit is commonly used in making spurious liquor. The manufacturers often set up a mini distillery to make this illegal liquor on their own and using rectified spirit as the main ingredient. They mix caramel colour to make it look like real liquor without raising suspicion of either consumers or even officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rectified-spirit-recovered-from-licensed-liquor-shop-in-up-s-pratapgarh-101635612060577.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP plays up 1990 Ayodhya firing on 31st anniversary of incident||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday played up the police firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya on the 31st anniversary of the incident that took place during the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led rule on October 30, 1990. While chief minister Yogi Adityanath made a mention of the incident, the BJP shared a video of the police firing on its official @BJP4UP twitter handle. The BJP attack came a day after Union home minister Amit Shah had set the tone for the 2022 UP poll campaign, referring to the Ayodhya firing. He had stated that while kar sevaks were killed during Samajwadi Party (SP) rule, the dream of a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya was set to be fulfilled under the BJP. Shah had made these remarks during a meeting of the party’s booth level cadres from the Awadh region in Lucknow. The party has now planned events at Kashi (Varanasi), west UP, Braj, Gorakhpur and Kanpur regions. The next big meeting that Shah is likely to attend in UP would be in Varanasi on November 12. The entire BJP top brass is expected to be present for that. Varanasi is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency and a key region in Purvanchal or eastern UP. “The Ayodhya firing discourse would gain traction as elections draw close because such issues come in handy for political parties to cater to their respective vote banks,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political observer. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, too, has begun playing up the Ayodhya firing incident, stating that had there been a BJP government in UP in 1990, none would have dared to open fire at the kar sevaks. Adityanath has also been referring to the late Kalyan Singh, who was the UP chief minister when the Babri mosque at Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992. Kalyan Singh had admitted that unlike in 1990 when police got permission to open fire at kar sevaks, he denied a similar request to the security forces in writing two years later. After the 1990 Ayodhya firing, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the BJP had coined the term ‘Mullah Mulayam’ (cleric Mulayam). In the run- up to the 2022 UP polls, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had recently sought to rebuild on the theme by referring to Mulayam Singh Yadav, the father of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav as “abba jaan” (meaning father in Urdu). ENDORSEMENT OF YOGI ADITYANATHUnion home minister Amit Shah’s aggressive backing of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s leadership on Friday, urging the people to re-elect the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under him to power in Uttar Pradesh appeared to have settled the leadership issue. “He took the chief minister’s name 17 times in 32 minutes, linked his return as chief minister of UP to Prime Minister Narendra Modi again returning to power at the Centre for the third time in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, spoke of how UP has developed under him and made a detailed comparison between his stint as well as that of the SP,” a BJP leader said.Since May-June, the BJP top brass have made it clear that the party would go into the 2022 UP polls with Yogi at the helm. However, Shah on Friday made it clear that if the BJP returns to power, Adityanath would again be the party’s chief ministerial choice. Shah also patted Yogi for fulfilling 90% of the promises made in the party’s 2017 manifesto that was released by him. “I think in two months’ time that remain, if you could complete the remaining promises too, we could proudly state that BJP has fulfilled all the promises in the manifesto,” Shah had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-plays-up-1990-ayodhya-firing-on-31st-anniversary-of-incident-101635612000609.html

This is why this is not at all a case of paper leak and the exams would be conducted as decided earlier.”Earlier the public health department exams have come under heavy criticism for mismanagement of the exam, from question papers not reaching in time to the allocation of wrong papers, seating arrangements not done, and the allegations regarding a paper being leaked out before the exam. The health department had also issued a complaint to Nyasa, the agency conducting the exam after the fiascos at the examination centres on October 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/exam-papers-not-leaked-maharashtra-health-department-clarifies-101635611580441.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||UPHRC to state govt: Station SDRF/NDRF team in Bundelkhand region to check open borewell mishaps||The Uttar Pradesh Human Rights Commission (UPHRC) has directed the state government to permanently station a unit of state disaster response force or national disaster response force in Buldelkhand region where digging of borewell is common due to scarcity of water so that response time in case of an emergency could be reduced from 12 to 24 hours in case of a child getting trapped in an abandoned borewell.The UPHRC has also directed state chief secretary to file a reply within six weeks informing about measures taken to comply with the guidelines of the Supreme Court to check deaths of children after falling into open borewells. Justice Bala Krishna Narayana, chairperson, UPHRC, passed the order on October 27 on a petition filed by Alok Singh, director of the Sarvebhyo Foundation, Lucknow.The petition was filed after the December 4, 2020, incident in village Kulpahad, Mahoba district, in which Ghanendra, 4, died after falling into an abandoned borewell. “The Supreme Court had taken suo-moto cognizance of children dying after getting trapped in open/ abandoned borewells in various states. The top court had issued notices to all states to take immediate steps to prevent such type of incidents,” said Singh. The Sarvebhyo Foundation has also argued before the commission that the Uttar Pradesh government has failed to implement these guidelines. “The state government is under an obligation to implement measures recommended by the Supreme Court for preventing fatal accidents of small children as a result of their falling into abandoned borewells and tubewells,” the court had observed.“It is also ardent duty of the state government to institute inquiries into the deaths of small children due to their falling into uncovered open borewells and tubewells for fixing liability of persons/officers agencies responsible for such incidents and to initiate appropriate proceedings, including criminal prosecution against such persons,” observed the court. Singh, whose Sarvebhyo Foundation has closed several open borewells in Mahoba region, has also designed an mobile app ‘open borewell child safe’ that is available on Playstore for reporting open borewells.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uphrc-to-state-govt-station-sdrf-ndrf-team-in-bundelkhand-region-to-check-open-borewell-mishaps-101635611461290.html

30-10-2021||Mumbai||October reports around 39% fall in Covid vaccination: BMC||Mumbai has reported a significant drop of 39% in inoculation in October as compared to the previous month’s figures. This can be attributed to the festive season and most of the eligible beneficiaries in the city being administered their first dose. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, around 95% of the city’s eligible population has been inoculated the first dose, while 56% of people have been fully vaccinated. According to civic body data, between September 1 and 29, over 2.6 million citizens were vaccinated, while the number dropped to 1.6 million until October 29. The data also shows that there has been no shortage of doses, as the civic body received 1.6 million doses in October against 1.7 million doses the previous month. This means that the civic body has surplus vaccine doses in stock.In terms of private and public vaccination centres, both have witnessed a major fall in the number of beneficiaries in October, compared to September. In private hospitals, nearly 300,000 citizens took vaccines until October 29, compared to around one million in the same period during September. In public vaccination centres, over 1.3 million citizens took vaccines in October compared to over 1.6 million during the same corresponding period in September.Dr Sonam Solanki, consultant pulmonologist at Masina Hospital said, “There has been a decline in the number of beneficiaries of the vaccine. There are multiple reasons for that. Due to the festive season, many people are travelling. The concern and scare regarding Covid have gone down, which is why the people are not getting vaccinated.”Dr Solanki added, “Secondly, there is a subset of patients who have gotten Covid after the first dose, and as per the mandatory requirement they have to wait another three months before taking the second dose. Another subset of the patients feels that the vaccine is not required and are still worried about the side effects, the long-term and the short term effects of the vaccine which is why they are not taking it.”BMC officials also point at festivals like Navratri, Dussehra as the reasons for the drop in the percentage. The BMC targets to fully vaccinate 9.2 million adult population above the age of 18 years by February 2022. “If the Central government allows, even booster doses may have to be administered. Till now 56% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated and 95% have got at least the first dose,” said the official.Further, the BMC received the highest of over 1.7 million vaccine doses in September, 1.6 million doses in October being the second highest followed by 996,860 vaccine doses in August, 983,390 doses in July and 739,190 in June. In May, the BMC got 523,440 vaccine doses, 947,500 in April, 810,950 in March, 571,000 in February and 265,000 in January 2021. The vaccination drive was kicked off in the city on January 16, 2021, with healthcare workers. This is followed by front-line workers, senior citizens, those between 45 to 59 and lastly those between 18 to 45 starting May 2021.Meanwhile, on Saturday 54,153 vaccine doses were administered taking the total count to 14,119,732. Out of the total vaccine doses administered, 5,300,344 citizens are fully vaccinated in the city..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/october-reports-around-39-fall-in-covid-vaccination-bmc-101635611254012.html

They would ask their victims to pay anywhere from USD 100 to USD 400 for their help,” DCP Jaiker said. Police said they are trying to figure out how many people were duped by the suspects. Police are also on the lookout for the owner of the flat, who they suspect is also involved in the fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhipolice-bust-fake-call-centre-duping-us-nationals-in-malviya-nagar-5-held-101635611252404.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Young environmental activists petition for climate education in Delhi schools||New Delhi: A group of young environmental activists have started an online petition, requesting the Delhi and central governments to include climate education in Delhi schools to sensitise youngsters about the impact of the global climate crisis. Aniket Gupta, a young Delhi-based environment activist, who started the petition, said introducing climate literacy in the school curriculum has become a necessity, considering the fast degradation of the environment globally and the extreme weather events that are being reported worldwide. “I think awareness of climate change isn’t enough. We need to sensitise children too from an early age. Record-breaking heat waves, changing rainfall patterns, dust storms and increasing air pollution scares me about my future and the future of generations to come. If as children we are not taught about the climate crisis, and what we can do to stop this cycle of permanent damage to our planet in even the smallest of ways we can, there is no way we will live to see a green planet again,” Gupta said. He added, “Just a few loose mentions of global warming and deforestation in school textbooks will not help. We need a comprehensive curriculum that not only creates awareness among kids about their natural world but also sensitises them towards the beings that they share this planet with.” Gupta is supported by three other co-petitioners, Aditya Dubey, Seher Taneja and Dwishojoyee Banerjee, who are also students and have been regularly raising their voice against various aspects of environment degradation in the national capital. Ever since the petition was started on Change.org late September, they have also met Aam Aadmi Party legislators, and senior leaders from the BJP, who have agreed to support their demands and raise it before their respective governments for consideration. “We are in touch with our area (Krishna Nagar) MLA, SK Bagga. He has agreed to hear our proposal. We are also presenting our proposal to the vice-chairperson of Dialogue and Development Commission, Jasmine Shah. Charu Pragya, lawyer and BJP spokesperson, has also accepted our proposal and promised to present it to education minister, Dharmendra Pradhan,” Gupta said. A Delhi government spokesperson said that they will consider the proposal once it comes before them. Experts said that such a proposal by the young generation should be taken seriously by the political representatives. “In the times that we are in, environment has to be the centre of all discussions. One of the ways by which we can make masses sensitive towards the environmental crisis is to catch them early. It will be a good idea to have young children know about what is happening around them and how they can make things better,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/young-environmental-activists-petition-for-climate-education-in-delhi-schools-101635611228428.html
30-10-2021||Patna||FIR against SDPI activists for ‘raising provocative slogans’ in Patna||The Bihar police on Saturday registered an FIR against four named and 40 unidentified members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) who allegedly raised provocative slogans during an unauthorised procession in the Phulwarisharif police station area of Patna on Friday. The FIR said that people were defying lockdown orders and trying to stir up communal tension in the area. SDPI is said to be the political outfit of the Islamic organisation Popular Front of India (PFI). Police said that the members of SDPI took out a procession on Friday against the alleged violence in Tripura where a mosque was vandalised and shops and houses were attacked during a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) rally on Tuesday afternoon. The members tried to enter the main market when there was a hustle between policemen and protestors. More than 100 members of SDPI staged the protest condemning the violence in Tripura and the state police which allegedly did not stop the violence. The procession started from Ishapur and concluded near the police station roundabout. However, the members of the SDPI were not paying heed to the police’s appeals and were continuing their activities. SHO of Phulwarisharif police station Rafique-Ur-Rahman said that an FIR has been lodged on the statement of Circle Officer Chandan Kumar against Engineer Ehsan Parvej, general secretary of the SDPI, besides Athar Parvej, Sabbir Mallik, Mohammad Sarfaraj and Kaushar Bano. “An FIR was lodged under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligently doing any act known to be likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life, 153 (giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), Section ¾ of the Epidemic Act and Section 51 of Disaster Management Act,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/fir-against-sdpi-activists-for-raising-provocative-slogans-in-patna-101635610980535.html

30-10-2021||Other||‘They didn’t take politics seriously’: Mamata’s fresh jibe at Congress in Goa||West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee renewed her attack on the Congress accusing the party of being incapable of taking on the BJP whilst also backing the comments by political strategist Prashant Kishor who made similar comments two days ago at a private function in Goa.Speaking during a breakfast interaction with media persons, Banerjee said that while it wasn’t her business to be talking about the affairs of other parties, she slammed the Congress for contesting against her in the recently concluded West Bengal Assembly Elections and said that they should not expect flowers in return.“I cannot say everything right now because they didn’t take politics seriously,” she responded when asked whether she would consider being part of a larger grand alliance that included the Congress to take on the BJP in 2024.“Modiji is going to be so powerful because of Congress. If one cannot make a decision, why should the country suffer for that? They have got enough opportunities. Instead of BJP, they contested against me in my state. How do they expect that they will contest me and we will only give flowers and sweets to them?” Mamata said. “I want to see that all regional parties are strong. We are a union of states and the federal structure should be strong. If the state is strong, the centre is strong. Delhi ka dadagiri anik naka (We don’t want bullying from Delhi anymore). Enough is enough,” Mamata said.“We want committed people, the committed local political parties who are really fighting, who really want to fight against the BJP, let us work together,” she added.Backing comments made by political strategist Prashant Kishor, Banerjee said that his comments were a reflection of the present scenario.“You have taken one side of his comments. I believe that he has said that if the BJP is to be defeated, then you can’t be going about it like the Congress. That’s not how the BJP will be defeated. He has said that if the BJP is to be fought, it has to be fought strongly,” Banerjee said.Her comments came on the second day of her three-day visit to the state. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is also in the state visiting, meeting and interacting with people.Banerjee also took on the BJP for a host of issues including sky-high fuel prices, low vaccination rates, the farmers’ protest and harassment of dissidents.“First you (BJP) increase the price (of fuel) and then ask us to reduce? Why are you increasing the price? We never increased the price. Are you not even worried about the country? Is there no worry for you?” she asked. “The farmers are sitting for one year in protest. The BJP is not even looking at them. What all lies about vaccines. So many people have not even taken one dose of the vaccine. Only 29% of the people have taken both doses but we have 1.3 billion people, where has it all gone? What about the PM Cares Fund? The central government has taken money from the employees from every sector. And it’s not even going to be audited and if I question then they will send the ED to my house or CBI,” she added.Banerjee spent the day visiting the Basilica of Bom Jesus besides also visiting a market in north Goa and giving a brief speech.Earlier in the day, she met Goa Forward party members Vijai Sardesai on the back of having met members of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and a bunch of independents.“She made a statement that all have to go together and throw out the BJP. To welcome this proposal, I and my MLAs had come together to meet her because, for the last two years, I have been saying that Team Goa has to fight to take on the BJP. We have to take it to the next gear. We came here to speak about how we can take this proposal forward. She has given her opinion on this. Our party will think about this and make a decision,” Sardesai said after emerging from the meeting with Banerjee.Meanwhile, the BJP has dispatched Member of Parliament from Bangalore, Tejaswi Surya, to counter Banerjee’s Goa visit and accused her of terrorism, mafia and corruption (TMC) to counter her temple, mosque, church acronym in Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/they-didn-t-take-politics-seriously-mamata-s-fresh-jibe-at-congress-in-goa-101635610261974.html
30-10-2021||Other||Reopening of Dudhwa National Park postponed till Nov 15||Lakhimpur Kheri: The wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers, planning to go for Dudhwa safari, will have to wait for at least two more weeks. In view of the heavy water-logging inside Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary, caused by recent floods in Kheri, the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) authorities have postponed the reopening of Dudhwa National Park till November 15. It was scheduled to open on November 1. “Due to heavy water-logging prevailing in the park area, the reopening of Dudhwa park from November 1 has been postponed as jungle routes are not fit for the movement of tourists,” said field director, DTR, Sanjay Kumar Pathak. Pathak said, “We hope to open up the park on November 15, however, a suitable decision will be taken on November 8 after a review meeting.” World-famous Dudhwa National Park was scheduled to reopen from November 1 to kick start the tourist season. The park authorities had geared up to greet the visitors after corona pandemic-induced lockdown. Tharu huts and guest houses were repaired and whitewashed, jungle routes were repaired and Dudhwa Safari Gypsies were arranged. However, the untimely rains on October 18 and 19 and heavy discharge of 53,3000 cusec waters into Sharda on October 19 changed the entire situation, leading to massive floods, resulting in heavy water-logging in Dudhwa and Kishanpur jungles. The jungle routes turned muddy and whitewashing of the huts and guesthouses was washed away. Dudhwa deputy director Kailash Prakash also said that the reopening of Dudhwa from November 1 was not possible due to water-logging. The decision to open the park for the tourists would be taken next week. “The jungle routes have turned slushy besides waterlogging. Hence, the plan to reopen the park for tourists has been postponed until the situation improves,” he said. Until 2019, the tiger reserve used to be reopened for public on November 15 every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reopening-of-dudhwa-national-park-postponed-till-nov-15-101635610200711.html
30-10-2021||Patna||Lalu’s meeting with BJP leader alarms Cong||A meeting between Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Rajya Sabha member R K Sinha with Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad on Friday night, on the eve of polling for the two assembly seats on Saturday, raised the political heat in Bihar, with Congress reiterating its allegations of a “possible tie-up between BJP and RJD.”The meeting, which took place at Prasad’s wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi’s residence, was also attended by leader of opposition in state assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, and RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwary. “It was a mere courtesy call to enquire about well-being of Lalu Prasad. I know Lalu since Patna University students’ union days. I spent close to two hours there, but no politics was discussed. He is undergoing treatment for some ailments which I also had. He enquired about the places where he can get treated,” said Sinha.Lalu, who was convicted and jailed in Jharkhand in December 2017 in fodder scam cases, returned to Patna earlier this week after a gap of over three-and-a-half years. Sinha, who has a RSS background, had only recently appealed to voters, particularly those belonging to Kayastha community, to vote for the National Democratic Alliance in assembly by-polls. He had also praised the development in Bihar during Nitish Kumar’s government and inflation control under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. However, Congress, which claimed to have severed its ties with RJD after announcing its exit from Grand Alliance in Bihar, smelt something “foul” in the meeting. “This proves our earlier allegation that the two parties (BJP and RJD) have entered into a secret agreement. What were these leaders negotiating and discussing?” asked Congress spokesperson Anand Madab, who also posted a picture of the meeting on the social media and urged voters of the two assembly seats to “understand the real game”. RJD denied Congress’s allegations. “The two have known each other for a long time. RJD doesn’t need to take secular certificate from anybody. Personal relations should not be linked with politics,” said RJD spokesperson Chitaranjan Gagan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalus-meeting-with-bjp-leader-alarms-cong-101635609300540.html
30-10-2021||Patna||Less than 50% vote in Bihar bypolls||The by-election for two assembly seats in Bihar, Tarapur in Munger district and Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga district, both won by chief minister’s party Janata Dal (United) in 2020 state polls, concluded peacefully on Saturday, recording a voter turnout of 49.59%, much lower than the 54.76% recorded last year. Counting of votes will take place on November 2, officials said.State’s chief electoral officer (CEO) H R Srinivasa and additional director general of police (headquarter) Jitendra Singh Gangwar, at a press conference after the polls, said no untoward incident was reported during the polling.“Twelve people were arrested as a preventive measure during the polls,” Gangwar said.A total of 17 candidates are in the fray for the two seats. The contest became triangular when allies Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress fell out and fielded candidates for both seats. In 2020, the two parties had unsuccessfully contested from one seat each — RJD from Tarapur and Congress from Kusheshwar Asthan. In Tarapur, Congress has fielded Rajesh Kumar Singh, who is pitted against Arun Kumar of RJD and Rajiv Kumar Singh of JD(U).In Kusheshwar Asthan, JD(U)’s Aman Bhushan Hazari, whose father Shashi Bhushan Hazari had won the seat in 2020, is up against Ganesh Bharti of RJD and and Atirek Kumar of Congress. Atirek’s father Dr Ashok Kumar has won the seat multiple times in the past and holds considerable influence in the area. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), the Chirag Paswan faction of the LJP, has also fielded candidates from both the seats. The high-octane campaign for the bypolls was joined by ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who returned to Bihar earlier this week after a gap of more than three-and-a-half years following his incarceration in a Jharkhand jail in fodder scam cases.Congress, in a rare display of assertiveness in dealing with RJD, fielded its new catch, Kanhaiya Kumar, for the campaigning.Meanwhile, CEO Srinivasa told reporters that the poll panel was looking into an audio clip being circulated in the social media in which a former block development officer posted at Kusheshwar Asthan is purportedly heard talking apparently to a person close to JD(U) nominee Aman Bhushan Hazari in an intimidating tone and cautioning him to refrain from indulging in any malpractice. “ We have also received the audio clip . We are enquiring into the matter and will take suitable action,” he said. JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said the audio clip showed how the former BDO, posted in Gaya now, was trying to influence polls in favour of one party. “ They were all making allegations of misuse of official machinery in the polls. See how this officer previously posted in Kusheshwar Asthan is restless to work for one party,” Kumar said, in an apparent dig at RJD which had recently sought the removal of a police officer, alleging he was working in a partisan manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/less-than-50-vote-in-bihar-bypolls-101635609120567.html

30-10-2021||Mumbai||Worli fisherfolk occupy sea near coastal road site, say won’t vacate until demands met||Between 120 and 150 fishing boats from Worli Koliwada on Saturday occupied a portion of the sea near the coastal road construction site, where work is underway on building an interchange to connect the coastal road and the Banda-Worli Sea Link (BWSL). The fisherfolk said that this segment of the controversial infra project will cut off access to their customary fishing grounds, and have refused to vacate the area until their demand for a redesign is met. Boats have been parked in the alignment of the interchange since around 8am on Saturday, and Worli’s fisherfolk have appealed to other fishing communities across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to join the agitation.HT had reported on October 17 that Cleveland Bunder – an artisanal fishing port in Worli Koliwada – is at the risk of permanent closure owing to the coastal road, specifically the interchange. The civic body plans to construct two connecting bridges between the south-end of BWSL and the north end of the coastal road, as part of a link that will allow traffic to flow seamlessly between the two. Fisherfolk said this interchange will run parallel to Cleveland Bunder and severely constrict the only navigational route available to boats venturing out to open seas.On October 14, nearly 200 boats from across the Worli fishing zone had gheraoed a temporary jetty at the coastal road construction site as a mark of protest. They demanded to meet with the civic body officials and Worli legislator and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Thackeray, along with officials, met with two community leaders including the president of the Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsyavevsay Sahakari Society (WKNMSS) on October 25 and assured to look into the matter and respond within a few days. However, the community leaders said there is no response yet. HT reached out to Thackeray’s representative, but the minister was unavailable for comment.Meanwhile, pre-construction activities on the interchange have continued, with movement of barges and tugboats in the Koliwada’s customary fishing grounds. Fisherfolk were also informed by the civic body on October 8 that they will not be allowed to fish in a 500-metre strip of water stretching from Haji Ali to Bandra, to facilitate the movement of tugboats and barges, for a period of two years.“The movement of boats in our fishing grounds has already destroyed about 70 to 80 fishing nets. It costs between ₹70,000 and ₹1 lakh to get each net made. Who is going to pay for them? Not only will the interchange force us to shut down Cleveland Bunder, but we’ll also not be able to fish in our own waters for two years until the work is done. This is a gross violation of conditional clearances granted to the project, which clearly state that our activities cannot be impacted. We will not accept any outcome other than a redesign of the interchange. If that is not agreeable to the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) then we will continue to park our boats and won’t allow construction work to continue,” said Nitesh Patil, president, WKNVSS.In a letter to officials on October 24, representatives of WKNVSS wrote, “One of the specific conditions of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) clearance dated January 4, 2017, was as follows: ‘BMC to ensure that no fishing activity is hampered during construction and operation phase of the project’. Thereafter the final CRZ clearance dated May 11, 2017, was granted by MoEFCC (Union environment ministry), subject to the following specific condition: ‘Bridges with navigable spans will be provided by the project proponent as committed, so that there are no obstructions to fishing boats’.”The fisherfolk have maintained that their request for a navigable span, of at least 200 metres, as opposed to the proposed distance of 60 metres, under the interchange, has been raised formally on multiple occasions since 2016. The assistant commissioner of fisheries has also written to BMC and the fisheries commissioner in April 2017 and December 2018, respectively, pointing out to the fisherfolk’s concerns over possible closure of their only navigation route out to sea. Subsequently, in January 2019, the assistant commissioner of fisheries also wrote to fisheries commissioner saying that the department’s no objection certification (NOC) for the project should be re-examined in light of this predicament.Officials from BMC’s coastal roads department, including chief engineer Vijay Nighot, could not be reached for comment despite efforts. However, a senior official from the fisheries department, occupying the post of assistant commissioner, said, “The fisherfolk should not be impacted by the project. We will have a discussion on violations of our NOC on Monday.”“After the losses they have suffered already, the Worli fishers are asking for an increase in the navigation span just to be able to sustain their livelihood. This a just and reasonable demand. The fisherfolk are now counting on Thackeray to act on their behalf,” said Shweta Wagh, an architect and researcher with the Collective for Spatial Alternatives, who was present at Saturday’s protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/worli-fisherfolk-occupy-sea-near-coastal-road-site-say-won-t-vacate-until-demands-met-101635608341479.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP lawmaker, six rebel BSP MLAs join Samajwadi Party||A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker and six rebel Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs joined the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the presence of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at the party’s state headquarters in Lucknow on Saturday.The development came a day after Yadav inducted two western UP Congress heavyweights, Harendra Malik (former MP) and his former MLA son Pankaj Malik, into the party.On Saturday, Rakesh Rathore, BJP MLA from Sitapur Sadar, joined Akhilesh’s party along with BSP rebel MLAs Aslam Raini (representing Bhinga in Shravasti), Mujtaba Siddiqui (Pratapur, Prayagraj), Aslam Ali Chaudhary (Dhalauna, Hapur), Hakim Lal Bind (Handia, Prayagraj), Sushma Patel (Mungra Badshapur, Jaunpur), and Hargovind Bhargava (Sidhauli, Sitapur).The BSP suspended these MLAs after they opposed the nomination of the party’s official candidate for the Rajya Sabha polls last October.After inducting the seven MLAs, Akhilesh said, “After today, the chief minister will change his slogan from ‘Mera Parivaar, Bhajapa (my family, BJP)’ to Mera Parivaar, Bhaagta Parivaar (my family is running away).”The six rebel BSP MLAs met Akhilesh Yadav for the first time last year and then again in June this year. Rakesh Rathore, too, met Akhilesh more than once in the last six months and had been speaking against the BJP.Aslam Raini said, “We will ensure that the Samajwadi Party attains a record victory on all the seats. Last year, we had sensed that it is the SP that will oust the BJP and form the next government.”Rakesh Rathore said, “I am glad that the SP has embraced me, will work for the party’s victory and see Akhilesh Yadav as the next chief minister.”Referring to Rathore’s joining, the SP chief said, “Now, the honourable (chief minister) must get the house cleaned for Diwali and make way for us.”Openly attacking the Congress for the first time, he said, “The BJP is Congress, the Congress is the BJP.” He had been hitting out at only the BJP till now, avoiding any attack on the BSP or the Congress.On Monday (October 25), former BSP leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar announced joining the Samajwadi Party at a rally in Ambedkar Nagar on November 7 in the presence of Akhilesh Yadav.For the last one-and-a-half years, the Samajwadi Party has been attracting leaders from other parties, largely the BSP and the Congress. The switchovers have intensified as the assembly polls are due early next year. Akhilesh Yadav has been repeatedly saying that “any leader who wishes to join the SP is welcome”.He also said, “The SP will not ally with any big political party, but will instead opt for strategic alliances with small regional parties.”Recently, Akhilesh Yadav cemented an alliance with the SBSP (Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party), a former BJP ally-turned-rival.Senior Uttar Pradesh minister and state government spokesman Sidharth Nath Singh said that Samajwadi Party may have been making lofty claims of victory in the 2022 assembly polls but the fact remains that it has been inducting “rejects” of other parties to complete its list of 403 candidates. It only manifested the desperation of Akhilesh who had been busy taking in leaders from other parties left and right, clearly showing his party did not have candidates to field in 2022 elections, the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-lawmaker-six-rebel-bsp-mlas-join-samajwadi-party-101635608282183.html

Jaydeep Pawar, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC (garden department and tree authority), said, “If the residents are not happy with the condition of our gardens, they will definitely complain about it. So, instead of waiting for their complaints, we ourselves should find out the gardens that are in a bad shape. Therefore, we have decided to conduct this survey and based on our findings, we will grade the gardens as A, B, C and D.” Pawar said that during the survey, they would take different aspects of the gardens such as size, seating arrangements, jogging tracks, open air gyms, toilets, streetlights, greenery and cleanliness among others into consideration. “The survey will be started just after Diwali and completed within a month. We will immediately start working on the gardens that receive low grades,” he added.Around 70 gardens in Navi Mumbai have open air gym facilities. Almost all of them have garbage composting units.

30-10-2021||Mumbai||Many framed in false cases by NCB, I have more proof: Nawab Malik||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik again hit out at Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede saying that many of the drug-related cases registered by the officer were fake and he had an army of private people used to frame people in fake cases by placing drugs after raids.Malik said he will produce more proof to corroborate his claims and expose Wankhede. He alleged that Wankhede implicated people and tried to delay their bail for cheap publicity.Malik also said that the drugs were provided on the cruise through a catering service from a restaurant. He also raised questions over the ownership of the restaurant. Malik said that one girl spoke to the media about her sister who was allegedly framed by Wankhede in a false case. He said hundreds of such people will come forward to expose Wankhede.“I am will submit the documents and proofs to the director-general (DG) of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for further investigation. NCB has framed Aryan Khan and others in a bogus case registered after the cruise drugs bust. The seizure was not done from the cruise ship, but the photographs released, were taken in Wankhede’s office. Wankhede has an army of private people, who would plant drugs in the houses of the people. Fletcher Patel, KP Gosavi, Adil Usmani are part of the ‘Wankhede gang’ involved in these cases. Wankhede has never involved NCB employees and officers in taking action against the drug peddling,” Malik said.Wankhede and his team arrested Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan and a few others for their alleged involvement in the cruise drugs party on October 2.Malik for the past three weeks has been levelling serious allegations against Wankhede and NCB over their vigilance, discrepancies in investigation and the information related to the officer’s religion. Malik has raised serious questions over the handling of a cruise drug bust accused Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, by Kiran Gosavi who is facing serious cases and a BJP office-bearer Manish Bhanushali.Malik had also released birth and marriage certificates of Wankhede claiming that he was a Muslim, but has secured the IRS job in the Scheduled Caste category. Malik, who earlier in the week, produced an anonymous letter reportedly of an NCB employee who had claimed that 23 cases registered by the agency were fake, said that he has collected more proof.“We have collected more proofs to establish how fake cases were registered by Wankhede. He would implicate people in fake cases. We are going to expose it in due course,” he said.Malik reiterated that Kashiff Khan, managing director of Fashion TV, was the organiser of the party and he was involved in the consumption of the drugs, despite which, no action was taken against him.“Khan, whose full name is Kashiff Malik Khan has said that I have levelled allegations against him out of misunderstanding. But I have proofs to show his involvement in organising the party, the cases he is facing and his criminal background. I have information about a restaurant from where the catering service was given on the cruise and the drugs were supplied through it, ”he said.Malik while speaking to the media in Gondia on Saturday, said that Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan should have gotten the bail much earlier. “My stand is very clear. The people who are hardcore criminals, terrorists should be put behind the bars, but the ones who can produce themselves whenever demanded or who are not going to run away should be given bail. The bail is the right of the accused. However, Wankhede for the publicity, ensured that the accused were not given bail for days,” he said.Late on Saturday, Nawab Malik also tweeted a photograph raising questions over his identity and his relationship with Sameer Wankhede and his father. “Who is this person? What ishis relation with Dawood Wankhede and Semeer Dawood Wankhede? Please let us know,” he tweeted.Reacting to the statement by vice chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Caste Arun Haldar over the caste certificate of Wankhede, Malik said, “The vice chairman has announced his result on the grievance. But let me tell him that the issuing authority for the certificate is Mumbai collectorate. I am not surprised by his (Haldar’s) statement as he is a BJP leader,” Malik said.Wankhede on Saturday met Halder and handed over an application to him over the questions raised on his caste certificate and alleged ‘harassment’. Halder later said, “He has denied the allegations of any religious conversion. After listening to his complaint, I think he is from a Scheduled Caste,” he said in Delhi. Wankhede has been refuting all the allegations levelled by Malik. He said on Friday, “These are malicious allegations to target my reputation. They are false and are being levelled for the first time in the 15 years of my service. I condemn the attempt in strong words.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/many-framed-in-false-cases-by-ncb-i-have-more-proof-nawab-malik-101635605280360.html

30-10-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC sets aside order on transferring whistleblower IFS officer’s petition||The Uttarakhand high court has set aside the December 4, 2020 order of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) in which the Tribunal transferred the hearing of Indian Forest Services (IFS) officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s petition from CAT’s Nainital Circuit Bench to the principal bench in Delhi. The HC ruled that reasoning contained in the impugned order is “legally unsustainable”. Chaturvedi, a 2002 IFS batch officer, presently posted as the chief conservator of forests (CCF) in Haldwani Nainital, filed a petition in CAT Nainital bench in February 2020 alleging that the recruitment of the joint secretary-level posts through contract system in the Union government for a period of three to five years, a policy decision taken in 2019, was arbitrary, irrational, and ridden with irregularities, which need to be investigated. In October 2020, the Centre filed a transfer petition requesting the transfer of the case from CAT’s Nainital Bench to the principal bench in Delhi. On December 4, 2020, the CAT principal bench transferred Chaturvedi’s petition from Nainital Bench to the principal bench, Delhi. Following this, Chaturvedi filed a writ petition in the HC on December 16, 2020, challenging the transfer of his petition. Hearing Chaturvedi’s petition, the division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik issued the order on October 23, but a copy of the order was uploaded on Friday evening. HT has a copy of the order. The HC order said according to Rakesh Thapliyal, Assistant Solicitor General appearing for Centre, “since the decision with regard to a policy decision of the Centre would have nationwide repercussions, therefore, only the principal bench is a suitable bench for deciding the validity of the policy decision… since no cause of action had arisen in Uttarakhand, the Nainital Circuit Bench does not have the territorial jurisdiction to hear the petition... since the relevant files are lying in New Delhi, and since relevant witnesses would be available in New Delhi, it would be in the interest of justice to transfer the case to the Principal Bench, rather than keeping the case pending before the Nainital Circuit Bench”. The HC order stated that “the impugned order tends to create an impression that somehow the Principal Bench is the superior Bench to other Benches of the CAT, which are functioning throughout the country. Since all the Benches including the Principal Bench, are equal, such a misimpression cannot be made in the mind of the litigant. For, the Principal Bench cannot be allowed to robe itself with a superior authority which was never given to it by the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985. After all, the Principal Bench cannot be permitted to be a usurper of the power”. The HC order stressed that the CAT principal bench should have considered the convenience of both parties. The HC said the Centre has sufficient means for shifting the files from New Delhi to Nainital Bench, adding that files can be transferred even electronically. “A bare perusal of the impugned order clearly reveals that the Tribunal has failed to consider the hardship caused to the petitioner… on every date of hearing, it is the petitioner who would be required to travel from Haldwani to New Delhi. His travelling would not only entail financial expenditure but also require time and energy. It will also necessitate that the petitioner should take leave from his work, thereby, preventing him from discharging his official duties. Travelling from Haldwani to New Delhi would also adversely affect his physical health, and psychological makeup… Thus, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner”. The court also argued that the “policy to hire the Joint Secretaries on a contractual basis, for three to five years, adversely affects the petitioner’s right of consideration for the said post. Such a policy decision, prima facie, does affect the petitioner’s right of consideration in the state of Uttarakhand. Therefore, a part of the cause of action does arise in the State of Uttarakhand...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hc-sets-aside-order-on-transferring-whistleblower-ifs-officer-s-petition-101635601741598.html

The civic body has now initiated the procedure for the same.The UMT bus services were operational not only in the city but also connected to the nearby cities of Ambernath and Badlapur. It was stopped eight years ago due to poor response and losses. With this initiative to resume the services, the civic body plans to acquire 20 electric buses initially. The civic body also plans to run these buses within the city and to the nearby cities too.In 2010, the UMC started the bus services through a private contractor in the city. After three years, the bus services were stalled due to financial loss. In the last eight years, not a single UMT bus has been running in the city.“The civic body is in talks with companies dealing with buses. Through e-tendering, a company will be finalised and 20 electric buses will be purchased for the city. The company will bear the cost for the driver and the maintenance of the buses while the civic body will look after the appointment of the conductor and ticket sales,” said an officer of UMC.“Once the 20 buses are acquired and the response is good, we will acquire more buses in future for the city,” added the officer. Mahesh Punjwani, 35, a resident of Ulhasnagar Camp 5, said, “There are no other modes of transportation in the city apart from the auto rickshaws. The bus facility will be a major relief from the hefty fares charged by the auto drivers.

Inspector Sudhir Sankhe has been transferred for overlooking the spurious diesel scam.The Solapur police had recently arrested seven persons involved in the diesel scam and had sealed Sai Om Petrochemicals in Wada. The spurious chemical-laden diesel was manufactured in Wada firm and later transported to Solapur and other areas for sale in the state.Senior inspector Sanjay Salunkhe of Solapur police with his team had sealed the Wada unit, located at Khupri village in Wada, Palghar, after the seven arrested accused divulged that they procured the adulterated diesel for sale in Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli and even in adjoining areas of Telangana. The main users of adulterated diesel were long-distance luxury buses and taxis. The drivers made forged bills of sale to cheat their employers, said police. An open parking ground, off the Pune-Hyderabad road, belonging to a private bus agency, was the main centre where the adulterated diesel was filled in private luxury long-distance buses, an officer said.“We raided the spot and the racket came light. The main source of production of spurious diesel was the Wada petrochemical unit,” he added.The police have arrested Himanshu Bhumkar, 21, of Barshi taluka, along with Tanaji Tate, Yuvraj Prabhalkar, Avinash Ganje, Sudhakar Ganje and two others under Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and sections 379 (theft), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 287, 336 (endangering human life), 465, 467, 468, 471 (forgery) of the Indian Penal Code. “The accused are in police custody and further probe is on,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/adulterated-diesel-scam-wada-police-officer-transferred-101635600059942.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Daily positivity rate falls to 1.92% in Thane ahead of Diwali||Thane city’s weekly positivity rate has fallen to 1.92% from 2.34% that was recorded in the first week of October. Increased testing and fewer cases in the last two weeks have lowered the positivity rate in the city, claim Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) and experts.“We have increased testing ahead of Diwali to more than 3,000 daily. However, persons should be interested or those with symptoms can be tested. Among those who are positive, there are around 60% who are asymptomatic. This makes it difficult to trace those with symptoms and to conduct tests. There continues to be reluctance as well among those who have been fully vaccinated to undergo a Covid test,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.The daily positive cases in the city have also become less. October 25 recorded 23 daily positive cases, the lowest since April 13, 2020, when the city recorded the same number of cases. Currently, on a regular basis, the city has been recording less than 50 daily positive cases.In the first week after lockdown relaxations on August 15, the weekly average was 46. By the last week of August, it increased to 54.2 and 62.75 in the first week of September. By the last week of September, the weekly average continued to be at 58. Meanwhile, in the last week of October and a week before Diwali celebrations begin, the weekly average is at 38.TMC was testing more than 4000 till June. During the peak of the second wave, they conducted 10,000 tests as well on a regular basis. In February, just before the advent of the second wave, the testing was reduced to less than 4,000 when the number of positive cases saw a spike. Despite this, TMC is conducting fewer tests while its neighbouring cities of Kalyan-Dombivli and Navi Mumbai have both increased their number of daily tests.Dr Dinesh Samel, associate professor, department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, Kalwa, said, “This is a positive sign. If increased testing led to more cases, it would have been a cause for concern. But, the last few days’ positivity rate shows that the situation has improved. However, people should not become complacent. They should continue to maintain all Covid protocols during the festival season as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/daily-positivity-rate-falls-to-1-92-in-thane-ahead-of-diwali-101635599521000.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Burglar boasts about his short stint with Aryan Khan in jail, lands in police net again||Giving interviews to news channels and boasting about his short stint with actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan inside Arthur Road jail in Mumbai proved costly for a 44-year-old barrack-mate of Aryan Khan. Police identified Shrawan Nadar, who was lodged in barrack number 1 with Aryan, when he was giving interviews to news channels and arrested him in pending cases. Originally from Tamil Nadu, Mankhurd resident Nadar was lodged at Arthur Road jail after his arrest in a theft case of Matunga police station. On Saturday, he boasted before television cameras that he was lodged in the same barrack, in which 23-year-old Aryan was lodged. He said, two came to the jail almost the same time. In around 10 days he was granted bail and accordingly he walked out of the jail. On Thursday when Bombay high court granted bail to Aryan and two others, Nadar went to Arthur Road jail, expecting Aryan would come out, but it didn’t happen. At the time, Nadar spoke to media persons and claimed that he saw Aryan weeping inside the jail and he also had a haircut etc. He also claimed that Aryan requested him to go and meet his father (Shah Rukh Khan) in Bandra and asked him to send some money inside the jail. He said, accordingly he had visited Mannat in Bandra to see Aryan’s family and give them his message. But security persons did not entertain him. “It is not clear whether Aryan asked him to send a message to his family or Nadar planned to extract money from his family, but one thing is verified that he was also in barrack number 1 where Aryan was lodged,” said a police officer. “While Nadar was busy giving interviews to news channels, describing Aryan’s life inside the jail, coincidentally, Juhu police officers who were looking for Nadar for past eight months in a housebreaking case, spotted him (Nadar) on the television screen. They immediately alerted local crime branch (unit-3) officials, following which Nadar was immediately detained from outside the jail and was taken to the crime branch unit. Later he was handed over to the Juhu police,” said a crime branch officer, requesting anonymity. Senior inspector Shashikant Mane of Juhu police station said, “Nadar has 13 cases of housebreaking and thefts against him. He has three cases on him from our police stations and was wanted in a housebreaking case for the past eight months. A local court on Friday remanded him to police custody up to November 1.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/burglar-boasts-about-his-short-stint-with-aryan-khan-in-jail-lands-in-police-net-again-101635599219874.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai magistrate court issues non-bailable warrant against Param Bir Singh||MumbaiAn additional chief metropolitan magistrate on Saturday issued a non-bailable warrant against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Riyaz Bhati – a purported aide of gangster Dawood Ibrahim – and one Vinay Singh. The magistrate, Sudhir Bhajipale, issued the warrant acting on a plea filed by the Mumbai crime branch, which is investigating an extortion case registered against Singh and others at Goregaon police station. Advocates Shekhar Jagtap and Sairuchita Chowdhury, who appeared for the crime branch, informed the court that they had already served summons at Singh’s Mumbai and Chandigarh addresses, asking him to join the investigations. He, however, has not appeared before the investigators, they added. Bhati and Vinay Singh were also served notices under 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code for appearance before the investigating officer and they, too, have failed to honour the notice, said Jagtap and Chowdhury. Their anticipatory bail applications have been rejected by the sessions court, the lawyers pointed out, and submitted copies of the relevant documents, summons and notices for perusal of the magistrate court. Goregaon police had in August registered an extortion case against Singh, dismissed Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze – arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases – and Sumeet Singh, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh and Bhati. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by hotelier and civic contractor Bimal Agarwal, alleging that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him. They also threatened to register cases against his hotel restaurant and bar. The crime branch has already arrested Sumeet Singh, who allegedly used to collect money for Vaze. According to crime branch officers, Vaze is the prime accused on whose orders money was collected by Sumeet Singh from Agarwal. On Thursday, the chief judicial magistrate court at Thane had issued a warrant against Singh in an extortion case registered against him at Thane Nagar police station. Meanwhile, the magistrate court on Saturday also rejected an application by Vaze for staying the execution of the production warrant issued against him by the additional chief metropolitan magistrate court. Vaze’s counsel Raunak Naik had argued that he had still not recovered after the bypass surgery performed on him on September 13. The magistrate court had issued a production warrant against Vaze, after which the special NIA court has allowed the crime branch to take him in their custody for interrogation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-magistrate-court-issues-non-bailable-warrant-against-param-bir-singh-101635599159879.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh refused to cooperate with ED without a valid reason: HC||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has refused to co-operate in the investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) without any valid reason, the Bombay high court (HC) has observed in its detailed order, by which the petition filed by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was dismissed on Friday. “The applicant, without any valid reason, has refused to co-operate with the investigation by not attending the summonses issued by the authorities,” said the division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal while rejecting Deshmukh’s plea. “The applicant has failed to establish the case of legal and factual malice on the part of the respondent/directorate in proceeding with the investigation in question,” said the bench and rejected Deshmukh’s allegation that the money laundering case was initiated against him out of political vendetta. ED has registered an enforcement case information report (ECIR) against Deshmukh on the basis of the April 21 first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The April 21 FIR has been registered against the NCP leader on the basis of the allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh that Deshmukh had instructed certain officers, including dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Waze, to collect a monthly sum of ₹100 crore from various establishments such as bars, dance bars and hookah parlours in Mumbai. ED has been issuing summons to Deshmukh since June 25, but he has not appeared before the agency so far. On September 1, the former home minister had moved HC, questioning the repeated summons issued to him by ED and urged the court to allow him appear before the investigators through audio-video medium and produce documents sought by the agency through his representative. Apprehending arrest by ED, he had also sought protection from coercive steps. HC, however, rejected Deshmukh’s claim that the issuance of summons to him by ED was a clear abuse of power by the agency’s officers concerned and the summons were being issued with mala fide intent, and that Singh, who levelled allegations of corruption against him, have been booked for more heinous crimes. Instead, the court found force in submissions of additional solicitor general Anil Singh that while Deshmukh kept on proclaiming that he is ready and willing to co-operate, his conduct was entirely otherwise and for some reason or the other, he is avoiding attending ED office pursuant to the summons. “We find this submission as justified,” said HC. “If there are no mala fides and no illegality, then there is no question of not attending and cooperating with the investigation,” said the bench. HC said issuance of summons is part of the investigation and HCs would not interfere and interdict a lawful investigation, unless exceptional circumstances exist. “There is no jurisdictional error in the issuance of summonses as they have been issued by the officers duly authorised under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act),” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-refused-to-cooperate-with-ed-without-a-valid-reason-hc-101635598320312.html

Uttar Pradesh recorded its first case of Zika virus on October 24 after an Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel tested positive for the viral disease in Kanpur.The state health authorities last week sent 22 samples of people who were in close contact with the infected for testing. Those 22 samples tested negative for Zika.The IAF personnel was admitted to the Air Force Hospital in the district and was suffering from fever for a few days before his admission. The Centre sent a team on Monday to assess the situation and it consisted of an entomologist, public health specialists and gynaecologist drawn from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, National Centre for Disease Control and RML Hospital, New Delhi.Officials at Pokharpur and Pardevanpurwa localities of Kanpur’s Chakeri area undertook sanitisation programmes including anti-larvae spraying, identification of fever patients, screening of seriously ill people and pregnant women in a bid to curb the further spread.

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab terminates power purchase pact with GVK Goindwal plant||Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday approved the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited’s (PSPCL) proposal to terminate the power purchase agreement (PPA) with GVK Goindwal Sahib (2x270 MW) plant. Subsequently, the PSPCL issued the termination notice to the company. Also read: Punjab: PSPCL to procure 500 MW solar powerThe termination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) made during the previous SAD-BJP government was the promise of the Congress before coming to power in the state and the previous dispensation of Capt Amarinder Singh was criticised for not doing enough to terminate them. This is the first agreement being terminated by Congress government in Punjab. Default notice issued for high power cost According to a government spokesperson, a preliminary default notice was issued by PSPCL to GVK on Saturday for the cancellation of PPA due to high power cost and falling lowest in the merit order, procurement of energy from GVK that had been restricted only within the range of 25% to 30% during most of the times of a year resulting in higher tariff of about ₹7.52 per unit for last year. The chief minister said this step had been taken to safeguard the interest of consumers of the state by way of reducing the burden of costly power. The spokesperson said the basic premise of entering into a PPA by GVK was to provide cheaper power to PSPCL. GVK had been generating energy by arranging coal from Coal India Limited under the Shakti Policy. As per the PPA, GVK was required to arrange a captive coal mine but it failed to do so, even after more than five years of synchronization with the grid, he said. The spokesman said the capacity charges are being decided by Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) based on capital cost of around ₹3,058 crore, which is equivalent to ₹1.61 per unit of the fixed cost. GVK moved appellate tribunal Going against this decision, the spokesperson said GVK moved the appellate tribunal for electricity (APTEL) for claiming a higher fixed cost to the tune of ₹2.50 per unit based on claims of capital cost of about ₹4,400 crore, which is pending adjudication. According to GVK, the spokesperson said that the variable cost is about ₹4.50 per unit and fixed cost is around ₹2.50 per unit. Thus, the total claim of GVK under tariff comes out to around ₹7 per unit, which is increased further due to surrender of its costly power. Therefore, the intention of GVK is clear that it requires to charge higher tariff which is not the basic premise on which the PPA was entered into with PSPCL. This was commercially unviable for PSPCL to continue the PPA with GVK. GVK defaulted on loan payments The spokesperson said GVK had defaulted by not clearing dues accrued to it, against the loans taken by it from lenders. Consequently, it had become a stressed asset and a resolution plan was required to be implemented by GVK, which it failed to do. Accordingly, lenders have approached the National Company Law Tribunals (NCLT) for a resolution plan for GVK, which is under consideration before the tribunal, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-terminates-power-purchase-pact-with-gvk-goindwal-plant-101635594299745.html

A high-level meeting, involving Maharashtra Minister of State for Forests, Dattatray Bharne, and top officials of the ministry was held on Friday to evaluate the measures being taken to save the big cats following. The deaths of the tigers have been reported primarily from Nagpur, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli since January this year. Expressing concern over the deaths of several tigers, Bharne asked the wildlife wing of the forest department to take “effective measures” to save tigers. A majority of these tigers fell victim to the poachers. On the other hand, as many as 35 people in the state were killed in tiger attacks in Maharashtra till October this year. The neighbouring Chandrapur district is a major flashpoint of man-animal conflict. Chandrapur, the tiger region of the state housing the famous Tadoba tiger sanctuary, reported 33 deaths this year alone. The forest minister also obtained information regarding the herd of elephants that entered Gadchiroli district recently from the adjoining state and asked the officers to make compensation available to farmers in Dhanora tehsil of Gadchiroli district as the elephants had damaged the crops. He sought a report on the stay of elephant herds in Maharashtra. After taking stock of the situation, Bharne asked the offices to initiate special measures to curb tiger deaths. He stressed upon creating awareness among people residing in areas near forests that were tiger habitats. The officers informed him that 42 persons were arrested in seven cases to check the incidents of poaching of tigers and other wild animals this year in the state. Bharne asked them to continue with the action. State forest chief, G Saiprakash, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and other senior officials were present in the meeting. Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray, took stock of the progress of works of the ambitious Gorewada International Zoo through a video conference on Friday. He asked the officers concerned to set the priorities and also press for timely completion of the work. Thackeray chaired the high-level meeting while Sitaram Kunte, chief secretary of Maharashtra; Vikas Kharge, principal secretary to the chief minister; OP Gupta, principal secretary (finance); Venugopal Reddy, principal secretary (forest); G Saiprakash, principal chief conservator of forests (head of forest force); Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) were present. Gorewada International Zoo is named after Balasaheb Thackeray. The chief minister also asked the officers concerned to rope in businessmen and locals to make the project planning more effective. Further, he suggested bringing in various animals and birds from other countries. African safari, night safari, walk-in-aviary, tribal trail, walking trail and such projects should be started at Gorewada to attract tourists in greater numbers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forest-minister-directs-officials-to-take-measures-to-save-big-cats-in-maharashtra-101635594121263.html

NMMC has also been painting the city with flamingo pictures and putting up sculptures to remind the people of the biodiversity. “We need to go beyond this and protect and conserve the birds,” Kumar said.Commenting on the Flamingo City proposal, Sunil Agrawal of Save Navi Mumbai Environment, said “It is long overdue to protect and conserve the city’s biodiversity. We need more and more green lungs as the so-called planned city is fast turning into a concrete jungle.”Apart from this, the environmentalists also requested authorities to conserve the NRI and TS Chanakya wetlands that are frequented by flamingoes.The Mangrove Cell has also expressed its desire to conserve these two wetlands as part of the satellite sanctuaries for the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary as proposed by BNHS.BNHS has suggested maintaining these wetlands as a risk mitigation measure for the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA). Birds from Thane sanctuary tend to fly to these and other wetlands for roosting during high tides. These two wetlands also attract thousands of migratory birds and are part of the city’s biodiversity.Supporting the idea of conserving the two wetlands, BNHS director, Bivash Pandav, said “We are blessed with such natural wetlands and must make all efforts to protect them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/plea-to-brand-navi-mumbai-as-flamingo-city-catches-cm-thackeray-s-attention-101635593521009.html

Two of the robbers tried to escape from the spot. Police reached the spot and initiated investigation. Also read: At 105, India’s first voter Shyam Saran Negi votes for 33rd timeThe three robbers, impersonating as customers, entered the branch of Muthoot Finance as soon as the employee opened the office in the morning. They produced a gold chain, saying that they needed some loan against it. Before the employees could complete the formalities, the three walked towards the cabin where the safe containing mortgaged gold was kept. After the manager asked them to keep off, the robbers opened fire. A bullet hit the manager’s arm. The security guard opened fire and left one of the robbers seriously injured, while two of his accomplices fled.

30-10-2021||Mumbai||After authority’s order, Mumbai district collector to investigate passengers’ refund issues||Mumbai district collector is set to investigate consumers’ travel refund issues against Mango travels, following the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA)’s order on October 5. This comes after Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), a voluntary consumer organisation, had received various consumer complaints against travel companies’ unjust behaviour of not refunding travellers for booked packages that stood cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic.HT is in possession of CCPA’s order. According to MGP, it received consumer grievances against various tourist companies with regard to non-refund of tour cost paid by consumers for package tours, which were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, due to which it conducted an online survey of affected consumers. The result of the survey conducted by MGP revealed a total of 48 complaints of 117 bookings against Mango Holidays India Pvt. Ltd. and amount of Rs.10,680,843 blocked by them.The survey had also revealed that more than half of the consumers were senior citizens wherein in it was not feasible and advisable for them to utilise the credit voucher unilaterally offered by the company in near future. Hence on behalf of various consumer complaints, we filed complaint against them” said MGP chairman Advocate. Shirish Deshpande.MGP said that the consumers had alleged that Mango Holidays had refused to refund the amount paid by the consumers towards their package tours and instead, it was offering a non-refundable and non-encashable credit shell to consumers after deducting substantial amount under various needs as ‘cancellation charges/ rescheduling charges’.“It is also alleged that Mango insisted consumers to undertake future tours much against their wishes and contrary to the health/ travel guidelines issued by the government. Our prayer is that Mango should refund not only these 117 travellers, but to all those whose tours got cancelled and refund them,” Deshpande added.Based on the examination of the organisation’s complaint, the Central Authority issued a show cause notice to the travel operator, on April 15, 2021. After which the travel operator had even submitted its response to the show cause notice via email on April 27, 2021. “It had denied all the allegations levelled against them and had also submitted that they did not indulge in any unfair trade practices,” Adv. Deshpande said.“CCPA has accepted that the deeds of the travel company is a case of unfair trade practise, prima facie. The matter was heard on May 28 and we received the order on October 5. Hence, an investigation will be done by Mumbai district collector,” Deshpande added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-authority-s-order-mumbai-district-collector-to-investigate-passengers-refund-issues-101635591561513.html
30-10-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: From Frido to free-go, medical mobility in cruise control||India has begun its inexorable climb towards the Japanese “valley of death”. The 60+ age group is the fastest growing demography. Birth rates are on decline and longevity is up. Japan hit those numbers a decade ago and have since been a nation struggling to cope with an ageing demograph.The Covid outbreak and subsequent lockdown period was when Arcatron Mobility pivoted and successfully overcame a ‘”Death Valley” of their own. For Arcatron Mobility –Arc stands for wheels and Tron for acceleration – the number that matters today is 110 million. That is the number of “senior” citizens (aged 60+) that exists in India.Demographically, overall India is still a very young country, but 100 million is a big number – big enough to consider senior citizens needing assistance to carry out daily activities, which include walking, sleeping, hearing, and going to the washroom. Ganesh Sonawane, Laxmikant Banjarey, Kunal Kamble and Dewaj Baruah started out as inventors. Today, these founders of Arcatron Mobility are businessmen, startup founders. The inventors have understood the monetisation aspect of the startup world and today, can claim to, like the company name, to have the wheels to accelerate to success.In the beginning… Sonawane, Banjare, Kamble and Baruah are NIT Calicut alumni. In college they began a club ‘Unwired’ and made a drone and radio-controlled aircraft. The “team” was born while bringing these projects ‘live’, they also got support from the institute. However, venturing into wheelchair manufacturing was a case of serendipity. Says Sonawane, “An NGO had come to our college and hosted a contest called Aavishkar. ‘Design for Disabled’ was the theme. When we participated in Aavishkar, where the prize was ₹30,000, we could not believe the videos shown to us. It was very simple problem statements; a disabled-women operating a wheelchair needing assistance to go to the washroom. Solutions for such problems were available in western countries decades ago, but in India it was unsolved. So, we developed a prototype and passed the design stage. We were offered a grant, but we were asked to form a company.”The foursome avoided the early bite and believed they were not ready for the jump; and industry work experience was the calling.“We were placed in big companies and got two years of hands-on experience. Later, we started exploring prototype building as a hobby. The idea was to convert a prototype into a product so that it reaches market and benefits people. We thought we will ‘IP’ it and give the licence to a manufacturer. While doing these activities we ran out of money and realised we had to raise funds. That’s when we approached big companies, but they were asking us business- related questions like, what is the market size? We were dumbstruck and had no clue on numbers and feasibility, cost…. Researching the market made us realise that this opportunity is big enough to explore the formation of a company,” Sonawane says. Product ecosystemSonawane says it is not easy to build a company around a small niche like the disabled population in India. He adds, “The rehabilitation ecosystem is strong in countries like US, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and also the Middle East, because the products are funded by insurance companies there. In India, products are not covered in health insurance. So, we knew that starting for only this segment would not make sense in terms of viability and sustainability. Elderly needs are also valid, but the product-ecosystem is completely broken.”“Even today, there is no good design for a walker in India. About 80 per cent products are still imported. That was the gap we decided to fill. We want a better world for ourselves, our parents and children. All should get better mobility devices when they need it. That’s why we started in 2015.”Why only buy cheap (Chinese) or buy exorbitant (Eurpoean)?Says Sonawane, “For the first two years, we were primarily doing only research and development. We also studied about other companies, including some abroad. There was no Indian company which had done any credible work in the wheelchair and other rehab products space. There were trivial innovations which had very low sales numbers. So, customers have only two choices, either buy cheap Chinese products or buy exorbitant European products. Both were not feasible.”“We knew that if we had to form a substantial company, we had to break this stigma. How to break it? And, how will we know that we have succeeded? One data point was that if premium clients like top hospitals, rehab institutions, tech savvy customers from India, who normally would buy only high-end imports, buy from us. Second data point was if customers or dealers from richest and advanced ecosystems buy from us. Neither of these had ever happened in India. We had zero background of product development, but we wanted to get the first 50 or 100 customers from this category,” Sonwane explained.“We picked up the shower-chair as a problem statement. We named it the ‘Frido-Go’ wheelchair which folds and fits into a suitcase and can be used for a shower as well as a multipurpose wheelchair for shorter period of time. We got 100 pre-orders even before launching. Most of them were from premium ‘Indian’ clients who were going to use Indian product for the first time. We also got orders from Canada, Europe, Israel, New Zealand, Luxembourg. The Paraplegic Rehabilitation Centre (PRC) at Khadki was among our first customers,” Sonawane stated.Distribution: key bottleneckThe unconventional start worked for Sonawane and his team, but was short-lived. Says Sonawane, “We had a misconception; that we need to be innovating new products and we are sorted. There were a few early adopters, but that got saturated and was not scaling. We got 50 orders per month, but growth was stagnant.”“Elderly customers are not active searchers. Wheelchair users are sparse and at different locations. Awareness is also less. In this segment, there are 5,000 distributors in our country who sell surgical equipment, but for them it’s a commodity business. We knew that cracking distribution for our innovative product is going to be hard. Marketing and distribution were the key bottlenecks for us. So, we took an on-the-ground approach and decided to build a very basic product first. Everybody asks whether our chairs are motorised? That’s not relevant. Bathroom access was the problem statement we had picked,” said Sonawane.Strategic inflection pointAs is witnessed in the startup space, being good at innovation and not being able to scale is where 99 per cent of companies fail. Sonawane and his team also realised it, but managed to recover in time. The Covid outbreak and subsequent lockdown period was when they pivoted and successfully overcame what they call the ‘”Death Valley”. “Before Covid, our online sales were dismal. We were trying to get distributors to sell our product, but they could not understand it. We had a wrong strategy at that time. Innovative products can’t be sold through commoditised chains,” said Sonawane while sharing his learnings.“We had lot of dependency on China for spare parts. We started to feel the burn in November-December 2019 when our suppliers refused to continue supply. We did not have any backup. We started developing it, but by then Covid-19 came to India. There are 110 small-big parts in a wheelchair which are either procured or developed from 50 to 60 vendors. We do critical assembly and welding. All of that was not happening. After initial exemptions were given by government for medical equipment, we got the product up, but logistics was screwed. We could not track our products. We had to refund to customers. It was a strange experience and we realised that we can’t scale this product,” he added.And… the pivotReading the history of pandemics led Sonawane to a strategic inflection point. He wrote a memo to his team saying: “This is war. If we don’t adapt to this situation we will not survive. We have to do something drastically different to get through this”. Arcatron team participated in the Covid Cawach initiative of central government and also won a prize of ₹50 lakh for the concept and design of domestic high-scale manufacturing machines with UV treatment for surgical masks. They then backed out since the “government was too slow” releasing the funds.“We saw the inefficiencies in distribution of sanitiser and masks. We knew the manufacturers and saw that the distributors were looting. Utilising our supply chain expertise, I started with my family. We provided low-cost good quality masks at construction sites of my in-laws. First time we sold something that was not unique or innovative. We were just testing our sales and marketing skills. It was also a first time when we faced competition from big market players. In masks, we saw unique opportunity where the product was not proper and hence, we launched our own range of premium masks – ‘Frido’ – meaning ‘Freedom to do more’,” Sonawane said.Online successSays Sonawane, “Cloth masks had to be cleaned often and they were not comfortable for long use. People faced problems breathing. We solved all of it at once and launched copper and silver range of masks. They were comfortable and premium masks starting at ₹500. I took a personal interest and studied how Amazon marketing works. I started experimenting and within a week our sales started picking up. Within a month I felt that grip and our sales grew 5x. We cracked the online marketing bottleneck and now we are confident of launching any product and selling through Amazon. That was a new beginning for us. We understood how ‘direct to customer’ works and hence, we have a strong belief in future of commerce.”“Now, we are balancing between some product lines which will be cash cows and some products where long-term investment is involved. We got cash flow positive in April 2021 and we are profitable on month-on-month basis so far. Before this, for five years we were burning and had to be dependent on external investors or raise next round to move ahead. For a company like ours which has a socially relevant goal for long term, it becomes difficult to depend on external investors where you have to multiply very fast. Now we have figured out our own multiplication. We are investing our profits in long-term innovations. When that happened, we found more investment opportunities,” Sonawane claims.FundingArcatron Mobility has raised around ₹6.7 crore so far from Angel and Seed investors. It received first funding of ₹1.5 crore in July 2017 from Indian Angel Network. “Sudhir Mehta of Pinnacle Industries was our one of the first professional investors. Before that there was private friend and family network including Anup Hingorani, who were funding us. Mehta has also given us manufacturing support,” says Sonwane.“Initially, I had individually invested ₹10 lakh and Laxmikant and Kunal had put ₹5 lakh each. I raised personal debt from banks and friends and family to invest in the company. Most of that was put in when the company was going through a different time and we were not able to raise money. So far Individually I have invested around ₹70 lakh in the company. I was the biggest investor in the company as the next big angel investor was about ₹30 lakh,” Ganesh informed.King makersSonawane says, “Within a year, we have reached 3,000 orders a day (in June 2021) from 200 orders a day (in June 2020). With 300 orders per hour and 10 working hours, this rapid scaling pushed our limits from all ends. We realised that those who own the ‘market access’ are king makers. We are doubling and tripling in terms of our capabilities because that is the future of sales for all innovative products.”Future plans“We aim to be the market leader in mobility devices in India. We want to be known as the most trusted brands globally. Transit wheelchairs and standard wheelchairs are also scarce in market. Besides, we are looking to enter into affordable electric mobility for elderly and differently-abled persons,” says Ganesh Sonawane, co-founder, Arcatron Mobility||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-from-frido-to-free-go-medical-mobility-in-cruise-control-101635591539541.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Auto driver arrested for rape of Thane woman by promising her job||A 40-year-old Thane-based woman, who was lured with the promise of a job by an auto rickshaw driver, was raped by him while ferrying her from Thane to Bhandup. The incident occurred on a deserted patch between Bhandup and Vikhroli on October 23 while the complaint was registered at the Wagle Estate police station in Thane on October 29.Wagle police arrested the auto driver, Brij Mohan Giri, 40, who has been riding an auto for six to seven years, and handed over the case to Vikhroli police.According to the police, the woman had hired Giri’s auto to reach a placement agency. The driver heard her talking over the phone requesting to look for a job for her. Giri overheard the conversation and got her into some small talks. He told her that he knew a few people who could give her a job and took her phone number.The woman who stays with her husband and children was in need of a job as her family was in a dire situation due to the pandemic. The driver called her and assured that he could take her to a person who would hire her. He picked her up on Saturday morning and while on the Eastern Express Highway he stopped his auto between the bushes in Vikhroli and Bhandup. He asked her to follow him.An officer from Wagle Estate police station said, “The woman first went with him but as soon as he took her into the bushes, she refused to go inside. He forcefully took her inside, beat her up and raped her. Later, he threatened to kill her if she went to the police, snatched her gold chain, dropped her at her residence and fled the spot. The woman was initially scared but mustered courage and went to Wagle Estate police station on Friday to register a complaint against the man.“We registered FIR under rape and theft case, and arrested the accused while he was on duty in Thane. As the incident happened under the jurisdiction of Vikhroli police, we have handed over the case and the accused to them,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/auto-driver-arrested-for-rape-of-thane-woman-by-promising-her-job-101635591120876.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||At 105, India’s first voter Shyam Saran Negi votes for 33rd time||Shyam Saran Negi, 105, cast his vote for the 33rd time on Saturday as poll officials welcomed India’s first voter at the polling booth at Kalpa village in Himachal Pradesh by rolling out a red carpet for him during the Mandi parliamentary byelections. District officials escorted Negi to the polling booth inside a primary school built in 1890, which can be aptly dubbed as a nursery of Indian democracy. Negi has never missed his date with voting. Also read: Slow start to polling in Himachal Pradesh byelectionsPopularly known as Masterjee in the village, the wheelchair-bound centenarian was accorded a warm welcome with naib tehsildar Hari Ram accompanying him to the polling station, where he was felicitated. Born on July 1, 1917, according to official records, Negi was the first to vote in India’s maiden general election. Though the election was held in February 1952, polling in tribal Kinnaur was organised five months in advance in October owing to fears of inclement weather as the valley is snowbound in winter. Kalpa was called Chinni at that time. Negi was put on election duty but he cast his vote before moving to the polling booth assigned to him. Ever since, he has not missed voting a single election. Kalpa was the headquarters of Chini tehsil of the then Mahasu district of Himachal Pradesh. In 1960, Kinnaur district was carved out of Mahasu and Kalpa was made the district headquarters. In 1990, the district headquarters was shifted downhill at Reckong Peo for the administrative convenience of the people of Kinnaur. The voter turnout in Kalpa village has increased ever since Negi was declared India’s first voter. Before the introduction of EVMs, the polling percentage was 55% for Lok Sabha and 60-65% for Vidhan Sabha elections. After the introduction of EVMs in 2003 and increased awareness due to initiatives taken by the Election Commission and district administration, the poll percentage increased to 70% in parliamentary and 76% in the Vidhan Sabha elections. In 2012, then chief election commissioner Naveen Chawla had visited Negi’s home in Kalpa village of Kinnaur to acknowledge him as independent India’s first voter. During the 2014 elections, Google made a video featuring Negi for its pledge to vote campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-105-india-s-first-voter-shyam-saran-negi-votes-for-33rd-time-101635590039546.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Over 81.38% voter turnout reported in Ellenabad bypoll||Over 81.38% voter turnout was recorded in the Ellenabad bypoll in Haryana, election commission officials said. The voting had started at 7am and continued till 6pm.According to the election commission’s data, 81.38% voter turnout was reported in Ellenabad, while in the 2019 assembly polls, 83.24% voter turnout was recorded. Counting of votes will take place on November 2.After voting, the fate of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) candidate Abhay Singh Chautala, his former aide and Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal, and BJP’s Gobind Kanda is locked in the EVMs. Though 17 candidates are in fray, the main competition is between these three laeders.Sirsa deputy commissioner (DC) Anish Yadav said polling went smoothly and no incident of violence or unfair means was reported.“Tight security arrangements were made with deployment of 30 companies of the central security force, five companies of the rapid action force and the state police. Of the 211 booths, 121 were sensitive and hyper-sensitive. Ellenabad’s booth number 116 and Mehna Khera’s booth number 9 had been set up as model booths,” the DC added.After visiting Ellenabad constituency, Hisar range IGP Rakesh Arya said total 65 patrolling parties were formed to ensure free and fair elections.“We had installed 52 nakas on the borders of Punjab and Rajasthan,” Arya added.Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal cast his vote at his native Darba village. “I’m satisfied with the arrangements here,” he said.Thermal scanners in place, most voters weren’t wearing masksThe voters were in queue since 6.30am. Most voters in the rural areas are dependent on agriculture and voting is on amid mustard cultivation. Women and elderly voters outnumbered the youth at polling booths in the morning.Voters were being screened with thermal scanners at the polling booths but most of them were seen standing in queues without a face mask.Result of bypoll important for farm stir tooThe results of the Ellenabad bypoll is not just important for the BJP, INLD, and Congress but also for the farmers agitating against the Centre’s three farm laws.Rohtak-based political commentator Satish Tyagi said result of the bypoll will underline the impact of farmers’ stir against the farm laws, especially in Haryana.“This bypoll is being necessitated after Haryana became the epicentre of the farm stir and its results will definitely be a referendum to the farm laws,” Tyagi said.“If BJP loses from here with a big margin, then farm laws will have an impact and vice versa. The farmers have made this bypoll an issue of prestige for them and the BJP has also made all attempts to win the election and prove that there was no effect of farm laws,” Tyagi added.‘Matter of prestige’The bypoll was necessitated after INLD’s lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala had resigned from the Haryana assembly on January 27 after the Republic Day violence at Red Fort, in support of the farmers protesting against the farm laws.The Ellenabad bypoll is just as crucial for the INLD because it’s the only seat in the 90-member Haryana assembly from where the INLD had won in 2019.A decisive win would reassert the INLD’s stature in state politics, particularly in the Jat-dominated farming belt.On the other hand, the BJP sees the bypoll as a golden opportunity for it and a test for the INLD, which has been holding the agriculture-dominated seat since 1996.Abhay has been representing the constituency since 2010, while the BJP has never won from here. No member of the Chautala family has lost from here so far since 1966.This assembly seat includes 35% Jat voters, a majority of whom are dependent on agriculture. Hence, INLD’s Abhay has been expecting their support amid the farm agitation. However, the BJP is trying to get majority of the non-Jat chunk of votes as it has fielded turncoat Gobind Kanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/peaceful-polling-underway-in-haryana-s-ellenabad-101635587879303.html

30-10-2021||Indore||Indore to issue guidelines to control unauthorised news channel on social media||Indore district administration has said it will act against unauthorised news channels running on social media platforms such as Youtube, for spreading “fake news”, a senior district official said. Additional district magistrate Pawan Jain, who is also the nodal officer for cable TV digitisation, said the administration will release detailed guidelines under Section 144 of CrPC to control the mushrooming of unauthorised news channels telecasting on social media. Section 144 of CrPC gives selected district officials the power to issue an order in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger.“In coordination with the public relation department, we want to control the channels, which are being used for circulating hatred, for blackmailing and defaming people,” said Jain, noting that online channels and websites didn’t need to register with any platform and therefore verification of their credentials was an issue.“We have also asked MSOs (multiple-system operators) to get police verification done for their employees. Similarly, we will ensure through police verification that Youtube Channel and other news portal have not employed any hardcore criminals,” Jain added However, the journalist association and Youtube channel owners said while they don’t have any problem with guidelines but it shouldn’t be used to control “a new era of journalism”. “Many scams are being exposed by genuine Youtube news channel and WhatsApp newspaper so the government shouldn’t generalise that all news channels on Youtube are bogus. If they come up with guidelines that will harm the real journalism, we will oppose it,” said Arvind Tiwari, Indore Press Club president.

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana cave-in: Efforts on to detect reason behind leakage, says MC||A day after a road in Deep Nagar caved in, Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) officials suspected that the leakage in pipes could have been persisting for at least six months due to which soil erosion took place and a major portion below the road became hollow. Having no equipment to detect the underground leakage, the MC officials said the exact reason behind the incident is still uncertain and efforts were being made to know the cause. It is also suspected that the sewer lines got damaged due to laying of underground wires, resulting in leakage. The MC officials said the repair work will be carried out during the night hours too, but it will take around a week to repair the damaged portion. MC subdivisional officer Anshul Garcha said the reason behind the incident is unknown as of now, but the department is working on it. “The leakage is suspected to be going on for at least six months as a major portion of road had become hollow. The repair works will take around a week as the damage is huge. The MC will also check additional length of the damaged sewer line on both sides of the road to detect any other leakage. Senior officials have been apprised of the situation and efforts are being made to expedite the repair works,” he added. Two siblings and a woman had a narrow escape after a major road portion of Deep Nagar main road near Dandi Swami chowk had caved in on Thursday morning around 8am and the trio fell into about 15ft deep crater. On their way to school, the siblings were on a two-wheeler, while the woman was crossing the lane. A video of the incident was also widely circulated, sending shockwaves across the city. While the students were rescued by passersby, the two-wheeler that sank in the accumulated sewage was pulled out seven hours after the incident. Residents had slammed the MC officials for allegedly showing lackadaisical behaviour. They rued that the same portion had caved in around six months ago as well when the civic body was reconstructing the road. But rather than checking any leakage, the contractor rebuilt the road, they claimed. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had issued show-cause notices to three officials, including executive engineer, SDO and junior engineer, over the negligence. Decades’ old sewer line also damagedGarcha said the decades’ old brick sewer lines moving around 20ft below the road portion also got damaged due to the cave-in. “The sewer lines have been blocked in the area and the sewage flow is being diverted for repairing the damaged parts. Super-suction machines have been deployed at the spot for clearing the site of accumulated sewage,” he added. RTI activist files complaint with human rights bodyCiting the recent road cave-ins, including the one that took place in Deep Nagar, RTI activist Arvind Sharma has filed a complaint against MC officials with the Punjab State Human Rights Commission on Friday for “posing grave danger to the lives of commuters”. Accusing the MC officials of adopting careless behaviour towards the rising cave-in incidents, Sharma said that a father-son duo also had a narrow escape after their car got stuck and overturned as a portion of road caved in in Haibowal area on October 24. Such incidents have also been reported in different parts of the city, including Model Town Extension, Dugri, and Kaka Marriage Palace road, but no concrete steps were taken by the civic body, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-cave-in-efforts-on-to-detect-reason-behind-leakage-says-mc-101635563397655.html

30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Being home alone in the city||It’s evening and she is sitting alone by the lake in Sunder Nursery with a coffee mug by her side. Architect and urban conservationist Smita Babar, 32, graciously allows herself to be snapped. The next day, on e-mail, she answers a few questions about her solitary rambles in the city.What were you doing by the lake?I was trying to get in touch with my feelings. Being in the present moment is a challenge for many of us and we don’t even realise it. Coming close to the nature helps me with it.What did you do for the rest of the evening in the park?After finishing my coffee I looked at the sky for some time, stared at the lake and tried to be compassionate towards myself. Then I listened to the two songs of Nelly Furtado on loop—Island of wonder and Say it right. Afterwards, I took some pictures and videos of the lake. The phone was used only to take pictures and videos, to listen to songs and to write down my thoughts. I had turned off the internet to be at peace. After some time I sat at some other place by the lake, until it got dark.Don’t you feel weird hanging out all by yourself?I find it normal to sit at a cafe alone and enjoy my coffee. But when it comes to dining at a restaurant, the servers very often come across to be extra-sweet and extra-polite with me. They try harder to make me more comfortable and to make sure that I am served well. I’m not sure it is because of respect or pity they feel towards me for being alone or it is just good old chivalry. I’ve experienced this even at a small eatery in Nizamuddin where I was the only female customer relishing nalli nihari and khamiri roti. I also observe that very often women, who are dining with their families, look at me with awe and I can tell that they are wondering why am I sitting alone. I even get a sense that some of the women are envying my freedom of being able to sit at a restaurant and enjoy a meal by myself.How often you go out all by yourself in the city?I take myself out on a date once a month. I dress up and treat myself at one of the wonderful places I keep adding to my ‘to visit’ list. I love walking around Green Park Market and Connaught Place at different times of the day.When people are alone, they often hum a song without probably even realising it.I don’t hum or sing to myself casually. I am a trained classical singer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-being-home-alone-in-the-city-101635551080636.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt on hookahs: ‘Not important to drop guard for unnecessary service’||Opposing a bunch of pleas against the use of herbal hookahs in the Capital, the state government on Friday told the Delhi high court that it is not necessary to lower the guard for an “unnecessary and ill-intended service which is likely to increase the severity and transmission of Covid-19”.In a status report filed before Justice Rekha Palli, the Delhi government has said that due to the upcoming festivals, chances of a third wave of Covid, and discovery of a sub-variant of the virus in many states, it would like to continue the prohibition on the use of hookah (with and without tobacco i.e. herbal hookah, water pipes and other hookah like devices) in all public places including hotels, restaurants, eatery houses, bars, pubs and discotheques.The city government has told the court that use and service of hookahs in restaurants and pubs is in contravention of State’s Fire Prevention & Safety Act.The court directed the petitioners to file their response in the matter, and the case was adjourned to November 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-on-hookahs-not-important-to-drop-guard-for-unnecessary-service-101635550541798.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Plots for new PM, V-P houses were not open to public: Centre to top court||The Central Vista plots sought to be made the new residences of the Prime Minister and Vice President have never been open for any public recreational purpose, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Friday in response to a public interest litigation that contended the change of land use led to a loss of recreational space for citizens.The government affidavit, filed by CPWD executive engineer Ashwani Mittal,was after a PIL by lawyer Rajeev Suri questioned the ostensible change of land use of Plot no 1 of the Central Vista from recreational and transportation to residential. “De facto, the area of Plot No.1 is currently being used as Government Offices (offices and hutments of the Ministry of Defence) for almost 90 years now….the place has not ever been open for the general public to utilize it for any public recreational purposes,” the Centre’s affidavit said.On Monday, the top court asked the Centre to respond on two issues -- the need to modify the public recreational space into a residential space, and how it intended to compensate the loss of recreational space.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre on Friday, informed a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar about the affidavit. Since the Court could not locate the affidavit on file, the hearing on the petition was adjourned to November 16, allowing the petitioner’s lawyer Shikhil Suri to respond to the Centre’s affidavit.The Centre told the Court that six plots on the Central Vista which the present petition was related to housed structures built as temporary barracks or stables during the World War 2 according to the needs and requirement of the time. These structures, occupy an area of over 90 acres, the affidavit said, adding that these “precious pieces of land on the Vista are highly underutilised” which include the L&M Block near North Block (Plot No. 1), A&B Block near South Block, Plot No.30 on Tyagraj Marg, Plot No.36 & 38, Jamnagar House, and Jodhpur House.Explaining why the Vice President’s residence was proposed for construction on Plot No. 1, the Centre said, “This will in turn help in easing the traffic situation in Central Vista as the movement of Vice President will be mainly to the Parliament when in session. This will be well facilitated by the proposed Vice President Residence being in close proximity to the Parliament.”By a notification of October 28, 2020, this plot was notified as residential.The petition argued that the land falling has the facility for transportation across nine acres, while recreational space is six acres, which will now be lost.The affidavit said that “considering the overall public purpose of the Central Vista” the Centre has not only compensated for the loss of public recreational space but has on its own added numerous facilities in the overall Master Plan of Central Vista Project for the larger benefit of the public.“The North and South Blocks which cover nearly 27 acres are proposed to be converted into National Museums showcasing ‘India in making’ prehistoric to present date. The museums will be open to the public at large and serve important public purposes,” the Centre said.In addition, “nearly 118 hectares of land on the Eastern and Western Bank of River Yamuna near Akshardham Temple on Eastern bank and near IP Thermal Power Station on Western Bank is being developed as AMRUT Biodiversity Park to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence fulfilling the recreational purpose aspirations of public at large,” it said.Seeking a dismissal of the PIL, the Centre said the question of change in character of the Master Plan was addressed by the top court in its January 5 judgment giving the go-ahead to the construction of the Vista project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plots-for-new-pm-v-p-houses-were-not-open-to-public-centre-to-top-court-101635548457572.html

30-10-2021||Delhi||Peace panel summons Facebook reps for Nov 2 hearing on Delhi riots||The Delhi assembly’s peace and harmony committee has issued a notice to Facebook, asking the company to send by October 31 the names and designations of representatives who will appear before it for a hearing on November 2 in connection with the February 2020 riots in the national capital.The notice, a copy of which HT has seen, added that the failure in complying with the notice could lead to proceedings for breach of contempt/privilege of the assembly. It could mark the next round in the confrontation between the Delhi assembly and the social media company on its role in Delhi in February last year in which at least 53 people were killed.“The committee is examining the communal disharmony that led to the violence in Delhi last year, with a view to recommending suitable measures to defuse the situation and restore harmony among religious communities, linguistic communities or social groups,” the notice said.Headed by Rajendra Nagar MLA and senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha, the panel justified the notice citing the Supreme Court’s July 8 order upholding the powers of the panel to summon both members and non-members including representatives of Facebook.In a tweet on Thursday, Chadha said: “The committee has decided to call upon Facebook India representatives to depose on November 2 on the important role of social media in curbing the spread of false and malicious messages which can fan disharmony and adversely impact peace.”He added that the proceedings will be live-streamed for greater transparency, because the matter is of “great public importance”.The panel is conducting an inquiry into the communal riots that hit Delhi in February last year, killing 53 people. This comes after the Delhi legislative assembly panel told the Supreme Court in October 2020 that it had summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on whether it contributed in any way to the build-up of the February, 2020 communal violence.The panel wanted to elicit suggestions on how social media platforms could be used to strengthen unity among citizens in the future and Facebook executives were summoned as witnesses, not as accused, an affidavit filed by Delhi deputy secretary Sadanand Sah said, adding that no coercive action was intended.Mohan and Facebook moved the Supreme Court on September 22 last year, challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the peace panel. The summons stemmed from the committee’s decision to look into Facebook’s role following several foreign media reports that purported to show that the social media company may have acted in a political partisan manner.Earlier this year, the assembly panel issued a fresh notice to Facebook India, asking that a “senior competent person” appear and testify before it.Mohan has previously questioned the jurisdiction of the panel.“Facebook cannot excuse themselves from appearing pursuant to the new summons issued to them on February 3, 2021... Facebook is a platform where political differences are reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their very business,” said the top court’s July 8 order.At the same time, the court clarified that the panel cannot become a “prosecuting agency” which can hold people guilty and order filing of charge sheets in the riot cases. The Facebook executive will be at liberty not to answer questions relating to law and order and police, while such a refusal cannot lead to any coercive step by the assembly, said the bench.Neither Facebook spokespersons nor Chadha responded to requests seeking comment.The panel, in February, asked for a “senior competent person” of Facebook to appear and testify before it and help in its inquiry into the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/peace-panel-summons-facebook-reps-for-nov-2-hearing-on-delhi-riots-101635545726475.html

But Giani Kartar Singh, a top Akali leader at the time, rejected the idea of Badal becoming a tehsildar (revenue officer). “You will recruit tehsildars,” he told the young man.After 11 stints in the assembly and Parliament, and five terms as chief minister, Badal remembers the initial days of the 1951 polls as “chaotic”.“All parties and politicians were trying to consolidate their space,” he said.A young political operative at the time, Badal used to take senior leaders in his Willys jeep to rallies and events, and even drove buses to political events.The SAD won four seats in the first general election — all of them in Punjab. “We contested on the Punjabi suba (state) and Sikh identity politics,” said Badal.He remembered the frenetic build-up to the 1951-52 elections due to the steep logistical challenges and the country’s first experience with universal adult franchise.“In the first election, ballot papers were used to cast votes, old ghee cans were used a ballot boxes and vote count was written on black boards,” he said.He recalled that Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, was a big name at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/politics-was-simple-but-the-challenges-huge-parkash-singh-badal-on-polls-70-years-ago-101635544431024.html

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Finally, Mohali to have local bus service from Jan 1 within MC limits||Residents in Mohali have a reason to cheer as the municipal corporation (MC) is all set to start a local bus service within the MC limits. It was proposed around a decade ago. The agenda pertaining to the local bus service will be tabled in the house meeting scheduled on November 2 for final approval and its service will begin from January 1. Initially, there will be around seven buses, which will run in areas under the MC limits. City mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said, “We had a meeting on Friday and finalised terms and conditions. We will be placing the agenda before the MC house on November 2. The buses will be run by a private company against the advertisements rights.” He said once it was approved in the house, it would be sent to the local bodies department for approval. “We will soon be finalising routes for buses,” he said. Deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said it would be a Diwali gift to the residents of Mohali. At present, the residents were relying on the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) that only covered select routes. Besides, over the last decade, the town had substantially swelled with several new sectors coming up. In 2016, the MC had passed a resolution for the same. However, the local bodies department did not give approval. At that time, the corporation planned to run 50 buses on the routes in question in the first phase. The MC had allocated a budget of ₹2 crore. Before the Punjab assembly elections, former cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had announced that the town would soon have its own bus service. A decade ago, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had also finalised routes for the bus service, but later the project was scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finally-mohali-to-have-local-bus-service-from-jan-1-within-mc-limits-101635542274998.html

Now, instead of ₹2.48 per sq metre a month, the RWAs will get ₹4.15 per sq metre a month for maintaining the neighbourhood parks. The cost for the MC for park maintenance through RWAs will increase to ₹5.66 crore per year against the current cost of ₹3.38 crore per year. The demand for increasing the quantum of payments being made to the RWAs was being made for a long time. In accordance with the requests of the area councillors and RWAs, a committee was constituted in September 2021.

Panchkula MC increased the rates for maintenance and development of parks from ₹3 per square metre month to ₹5 per square metre per month for parks with area less than an acre and for parks with area more than one acre, the rate was increased from ₹3 per square metre per month to ₹4 per sq m per month. Mohali MC gives ₹4.35 per square metre per month for maintenance of parks to RWAs.After analysis of rate on the present market rate of DC rate has been calculated for maintenance of the neighbourhood parks and its comes out to be ₹4.15 per sq m per month. The rate includes gardener charges, sanitation worker charges, tree maintenance costs, fuel costs, etc.The total cost of a park maintenance comes out to be ₹2,01,444 per park per year.Also, the MC horticulture division will use its own manpower and machinery once in a week to dispose the horticulture waste from the parks.

Diwan had sought discharge from the charges on the ground that the CBI had failed to take prosecution sanction. He had argued before the court that as per the amendment in the Prevention of Corruption Act, even for a retired public servant, sanction was a must to prosecute him which was not the case earlier. Seeking dismissal of the application, the CBI had argued that when the challan was filed, the accused had retired and there was no requirement of seeking sanction for a retired public servant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-toilet-scam-cbi-special-court-dismisses-former-superintending-engineer-s-application-101635540357256.html

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: MC House orders probe into delay in floating tenders for sanitation contract||After grilling civic body officials for the delay in floating a fresh tender for southern sectors’ sanitation contract, the municipal corporation’s general house ordered a “high-level” inquiry into the “deliberate delay”.The House also extended the contract of Lions Services Limited till March 31, which will accrue a payment of ₹15 crore in four months. Earlier on May 31, the House has decided against renewing the firm’s tender, so as to float a fresh tender and minimise the cost burden on MC.Passing a resolution requesting the Punjab governor and UT administrator to get an inquiry conducted over the delay, many councillors, particularly from the treasury benches, alleged there were malafide intention behind the delay. The House also demanded recovery of the loss to the MC from the officials, if found guilty.The present manual-sweeping contracts of Sectors 31-63 ends on November 30, 2021 while the mechanical-sweeping contract expires on February 14, 2022. It will now continue till March 31 next year. It was granted to Lions in 2016.Willful violation of MC resolutionQuestioning the delay in floating the new tender, senior deputy mayor and BJP councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, said, “Even after five months, the MC officials have failed to follow the House resolution. This has left the MC with no option but to go against its own resolution and extend the contract of the Lions Company.”Alleging intentional delay to benefit the current firm, BJP councillor Shakti Prakash Devshali said, “When we talk of zero tolerance on corruption, why are officers opening doors for it? What was the malafide intention behind not respecting the sentiments of 35 councillors. Who are the mischievous officers to favour the company?”In rare bipartisanism, opposition councillors too joined the ruling councillors in criticising the MC officials for the delay. Leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla, “We are paying nearly ₹5 crore per month to the firm, which has been in question since the begining. Even MP Kirron Kher had questioned the huge amount being paid to them.”When confronted, MC officials contended the tendering process would take three months, and in view of the scheduled imposition of code of conduct in November, this process couldn’t be completed.‘Only followed superiors orders’Scaling up the attack on MC officials, the councillors led by BJP state president and councillor Arun Sood called for the official files related to the calling of the tender.Sood, while reading from the file, stated that the preparation of a fresh bid document was completed in July but still, the MC officials didn’t proceed with the tendering process. “Instead, unnecessary information was sought from other departments to delay the process,” said Sood.MC medical officer of health (MOH) Dr Amrit Pal Warring faced the burnt of councillors’ anger. Standing in the well of the house, Warring, said, “It was done with the orders of superiors of that time.” But the councillors said it was his responsibility and he could not pass it on to others. He was questioned for his noting on the file seeking total road length in the city from the MC engineering department even after the final tender document was ready, which councillors alleged led to delay in calling fresh bids. In response, Warring also said he was only following the MC House directions for a comprehensive tender for the entire city. But councillors said no such resolution was passed by the house. Box: Kainth-Mitra face offThere was uproar in the house after Congress councillor Satish Kainth criticised MC Commissioner Anindita Mitra alleging non-delegation of powers. Kainth also alleged that files related to his works have been pending at the MC chief’s office for a long time, and her office was not giving him an appointment. Mitra rubbished the allegations and said, an appointment was given to Kainth, but it was he who left before meeting her. On the allegations of delay in clearing files, the commissioner submitted a timeline of the works indicating no pendency of files. As per the timeline report, rough estimate for work of green belt in Sector 56 approved on April 28, admin approval on May 19. File on work of desilting of sewer in Sec 56 was submitted for approval of commissioner on Sep 16 and approved on September 24. The BJP councilors lead by BJP city chief Arun Sood backed the commissioner and ridiculed Kainth’s allegations terming these as “lies”. Meanwhile, on the complaint of Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla who named an Xen (executive engineer) Dharminder Sharma for delay in allotment of works, the commissioner ordered to chargesheet the XEN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-house-orders-probe-into-delay-in-floating-tenders-for-sanitation-contract-101635539574875.html

The party leaders also questioned the role of chief minister (CM) Charanjit Singh Channi, alleging that he had “surrendered” before the Centre.The march led by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal saw the participation of thousands of people with scores of motorcyclists traversing the six-kilometre stretch from the Attari border to the Golden Gate in an unbroken line. “The electrifying atmosphere is there for you to see. People have formed a sea of humanity to send out a clear signal that they will not tolerate any dilution of the federal structure,” said Sukhbir. Earlier this month, the Centre issued a notification to allow the BSF to arrest, search and seize within 50 km from the International Border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Earlier, it was permitted to undertake such operations only up to 15km.Sukhbir said Punjabis had also displayed their resolve that they would not let the conspiracy to make the state subservient to the Centre succeed at any cost.Asking the CM to walk the talk instead of indulging in “photo ops”, Sukhbir said the Punjab cabinet should pass an executive order directing the state administration not to allow any interference by the BSF in policing duties beyond 15 km from the international border. “This is the time for firm decisions. Passing resolutions in the state assembly will not resolve this crisis,” he saidThe SAD president also condemned the BJP government for adopting a dictatorial attitude, be it on the three farm laws or on the present issue of extending the central jurisdiction in the state. Senior leaders, including Bikram Singh Majithia, Gulzar Singh Ranike, Anil Joshi and Virsa Singh Valtoha, were present on the occasion. Majithia said the BSF should be limited to guarding the border and should not be involved in internal security. He said its was not the first time the Congress government had colluded with the Centre, sharing that how the responsibility of manning the state jails was given to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-jurisdiction-row-sukhbir-leads-sad-protest-in-amritsar-101635539097662.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||SAD, BJP corner Congress over Tytler’s appointment||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday slammed Congress president Sonia Gandhi for naming Jagdish Tytler, one of the main accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, as a permanent invitee to Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee.“This is a brazen display of shocking insensitivity to the Sikh wounds by Sonia Gandhi and the Congress party. They have chosen the eve of the painful anniversary of the massacre of Sikhs to announce this decision. Could there be a worse way to rub salt into the deep, festering wounds of the Khalsa Panth than this decision and its timing?” said Sukhbir in a statement. October 31 will mark the anniversary of anti-Sikh violence that erupted following then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination in 1984. Sukhbir also dared Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and chief minister Charanjit SIngh Channi to show the moral courage to oppose the decision and get it rescinded. “Collapse of character stems from the compromise corner. Now come out of that corner, show the moral courage to at least speak the truth and prevent the collapse of your character,” said the SAD chief in his statement. “Will Punjab Congressmen, including Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Sunil Jakhar, now awaken their conscience, listen to it, and save the collapse of their character by opposing this decision?” he said.Decision regrettable: BJPPunjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said the Congress has reinforced that it stands behind leaders who had committed heinous crimes against Sikhs in 1984. In a statement, Sharma said it was regrettable that Channi and Sidhu have remained silent on Tytler’s appointment.Sharma said it was the BJP government that on coming to power constituted an SIT to give justice to the riot victims. “On the contrary the Congress safeguarded the guilty and is now promoting them,” he said.“Can one expect justice from a political party like the Congress on the sacrilege issue in Punjab? Unfortunately, no justice will be done under the Congress regime of Charanjit Singh Channi,” he said.Party must have consulted Soni, Channi: JakharFormer Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said that since Tytler’s appointment is a sensitive issue concerning Punjab, the party leadership would have taken Rajya Sabha MP Ambika Soni and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on board before deciding on it. “Both, particularly Soni who has donned the role of key interlocutor in deciding issues related to Punjab, are important party leaders and were in Delhi on Thursday. The two apparently had a long meeting on Friday. Their opinion must have been taken on this matter, which has wide repercussions in Punjab,” he said. Soni was the front-runner for the chief minister’s post last month, but opted out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-bjp-corner-congress-over-tytler-s-appointment-101635539096445.html

While the prosecution examined 15 witnesses, the defence counsel examined three witnesses. During arguments, defence counsel Vijay Verma said that Bains is an elected representative and he had received a call about certain agents duping people at the passport office. “It was in his capacity as an MLA that Bains had entered the office and met the assistant passport officer.

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Area under basmati rice shrinks by 25% this kharif season||Punjab’s diversification plan has suffered adversely as the area under the premium paddy variety basmati has shrunk by one-fourth this kharif season. According to figures released by Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC), basmati was sown over 4.4 lakh hectare this season, against last year’s area of 6 lakh hectares under cultivation, witnessing a steep fall of around 25%. For the past half a decade, the centre has been studying the cropping pattern, recording areas under different crops in kharif and rabi seasons. Basmati is the best bet for diversification as it consumes half the water required to grow parmal varieties, which consume 3,367 litres of water for a kilogram of rice. Adding to the glory, Punjab has the GI (geographic indication) tag for this aromatic variety, which makes it the native crop of the region and a favourite of rice eaters worldwide. The premium crop is cultivated in the border districts of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur, and some parts of Moga, Muktsar and Faridkot. Farmers shifting to parmalThe fall in area is attributed to poor economics attached with the premium crop, forcing the basmati growers to shift to parmal, which is covered under the system of minimum support price. This season, parmal varieties have been cultivated over 26 lakh hectares of area. “An acre of basmati gives a yield of 18-20 quintals, which sells for ₹2,400 a quintal making a total sale of ₹48,000. While the yield of an acre of parmal variety is 30-32 quintal, which sells at a fixed price of ₹1,940 per acre,” said an official of the state’s food and civil supplies department. He added that parmal fetches per acre value of ₹58,000-62,000, leading to ₹10,000-12,000 profit. According to officials, there needs to be a system to regulate prices offered to basmati growers by traders to ensure they don’t get fleeced. ‘Sanctions on Iran hit exports’Ashok Sethi, director, basmati exporters’ association, said the fall in prices is due to the closure of business with Iran, which used to import grain worth ₹12,000 crore from the state. “We are hopeful of an upward swing in the basmati market once the sanctions imposed on Iran by the US are lifted. The sanctions have disturbed the basmati trade in India, particularly in Punjab,” he said. Annually, basmati export from India is worth ₹34,000 crore (USD 4.66 billion), out of with Punjab contributes 40%. The quantum of Indian basmati rice consumed in Saudi Arabia is 50% of the total import to Middle East, which is 70% of the exports. Other countries and regions that import from India majorly include Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, North America and Europe. Harpreet Singh, a basmati grower from Batala, said basmati’s 1509 variety sold for ₹2,400 to ₹2800 per quintal this season. “Let us see how much price the late varieties, expected to arrive in mandis within 10 days, are able to fetch,” he said. He said the continuous fall in prices over two to three years has forced farmers to stop cultivating the premium grain and shift to water guzzling parmal varieties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabarea-under-basmati-rice-shrinks-by-25-this-kharif-season-101635539035982.html

Bains was appointed special public prosecutor on October 1 to speed up trial in these politically sensitive cases to appear before trial courts as well as in high court. Kullar’s counsel had argued that Bains has been a counsel and has appeared for the complainant and the kin of the victim in two separate petitions in high court and espoused their cause. As per settled law, the public prosecutor is to act in an independent and impartial manner. However, in view of previous engagements of Bains, there is an apparent and manifest conflict of interest, the court was told.It was also argued that even otherwise his appointment is in violation of Section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) as the fact of him representing the complainant was not considered in the decision making process of his appointment. The court was also told that on this appointment, there has been no consultation with the high court on administrative side, which is mandatory. Though detailed order is awaited, the high court while seeking response from Bains and the state government posted the matter for hearing on November 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sacrilege-cases-special-public-prosecutor-not-to-appear-before-trial-court-till-november-23-101635539034660.html

Circulars issued by the State of Karnataka cannot be interfered with by this court in the interest of larger public health. Therefore we see no reason to interfere,” the bench said.The apex court granted liberty to the petitioner to make a representation to the Karnataka government on the issue.Advocate Haris Beeran, appearing for a Kerala MLA, submitted that the people in Kasargod depend on Mangalore city for education, medicare, and other needs. It was also his contention that their travel to Mangalore daily has been inhibited by the circulars issued by Karnataka.Beeran referred to the guidelines issued by the Centre to the states and Union Territories (UTs) which asked not to place any restrictions on the intra-state movement of persons and goods by air, water, or road. The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Manjeshwar constituency MLA A K M Ashraf challenging the September 28 order of the Kerala High Court which had dismissed two pleas challenging the Karnataka government’s decision to restrict entry from Kerala at borders of Kasaragod and Mangalore only to those having a negative RT-PCR report, saying the neighbouring state was well within its powers to issue such directions.The high court had said it was an admitted fact there was no blockade of the roads from Kerala to Karnataka and the restrictions, like a negative RT-PCR certificate, were imposed within that state because of the unprecedented surge of COVID-19 pandemic prevalent in Kerala.“Therefore, going by the guidelines issued by the central government, it is clear that under any such circumstances, the states are given the power and responsibility to impose reasonable restrictions, to combat the disease.“Therefore, state of Karnataka was well within its powers to issue circulars, orders or guidelines under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in consonance with various guidelines issued by the central government,” the high court had said while dismissing the two PILs, one by Ashraf and the other by Jayananda K R, the Secretary of Rastrakavi Manjeshwara Govinda Pai Smaraka Samithi.The high court had said that the Karnataka government has the necessary leverage to issue circulars, taking into account the situations prevailing in the neighbouring states of Kerala and Maharashtra.“Viewed from that angle, it can never be said that a part of the cause of action for the writ petitions has arisen within the state of Kerala. This is more so when there is no absolute prohibition for the citizens of Kerala to travel to Karnataka by any means, but we can only view it as restrictions imposed by the state of Karnataka.“Whether the restrictions imposed within the State of Karnataka are reasonable or not, is a matter to be considered and decided by the jurisdictional High Court,” the bench had said.PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/supreme-court-refuses-to-entertain-plea-against-karnataka-govt-s-move-to-limit-inter-state-travel-due-to-covid-101635536815843.html

Shree Narayan alias Bhulai Bhai has been with the party since the inception of Jan Sangh, which later paved the way for the emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Bhulai Bhai was a Jan Sangh lawmaker from Naurangia assembly segment (present day Khadda assembly segment) in Kushinagar. In 1977, he was again elected lawmaker. Party leaders say that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken to him during the Covid surge. Only recently, defence minister Rajnath Singh too had met him separately after watching him stand in a queue of partymen waiting to see him. “He still tells how party ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya himself offered him food from his plate and blessed him with a long life,” a BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-meets-oldest-bjp-cadre-101635536695023.html

Bommai had then said the police have cracked some cases, but they were only the tip of the iceberg.The statement came months after the Karnataka police arrested 25-year-old Srikrishna, who had allegedly hacked into three bitcoin exchanges, multiple online poker applications and one government e-procurement website. Bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were recovered from him, which he had either stolen using data theft or through online extortion. He is also accused in the case of stealing ₹11 crore from the e-procurement portal.It was this case that prompted Bommai to give the police a new direction, which has now snowballed into a controversy where the Opposition is accusing the government of trying to cover up the case.Srikrishna was caught on November 18 after police arrested some drug dealers, to whom he had allegedly sold drugs procured from the dark web. Srikrishna graduated in computer science from a college in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 2017.A senior police officer said Srikrishna would encrypt data and demand payment from owners for the site to be unlocked by attacking the sites online. “After returning to Bengaluru, he could not find any job. He then started hacking gaming and other websites to steal data. He also used to create mirror sites and get information on credit or debit cards used by people who accessed the sites to steal money,” the senior officer said requesting anonymity.Police said Srikrishna used online gaming platforms with chat boxes to communicate with buyers of data but mostly, he would walk up to people on the road and ask if he could use their phone claiming he had lost his own. “He would tell them he had to get in touch with someone urgently and download Wickr app on the stranger’s phone,” the officer said. Wickr is an encrypted messaging app, which also has a ‘burn-on-read’ setting, where the recipient will have access to the message only for a limited time after receiving it.Police had to introduce new standard operating procedures since presenting bitcoin as evidence in court was a challenge. A senior police officer explained that a bitcoin account was opened in the police department’s name and the 33 bitcoin Srikrishna had in his possession, was transferred to that account. Though it seemed like a straightforward cybercrime, the enforcement directorate was involved to probe a possible money laundering angle, involving the hacker. ED probe has revealed that he had laundered the ₹11 crore stolen from the e-procurement portal to different bank accounts.Officers aware of the developments said that controversy over bitcoins started over the money laundering charges. The suspect despite having cases of serious financial crimes against him is out on bail. It is alleged that while the official records show that 33 bitcoins were recovered from him, in fact, the seizure was much bigger. “A tip-off from an international intelligence, which was tracking the hacker’s activity, had tipped off India’s central agencies. From the information available to us, now there is a probe into whether there was cover up and bribe paid in the form of cryptocurrency,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-opposition-attacks-bommai-govt-over-bitcoin-hacking-case-101635536574521.html

In the complaint, Gunkaran had alleged that he was wrongly arrested and implicated in an FIR on November 20, 2018. The allegation was that his arrest and the implication was done by her and the investigating officer, Mulak Singh. Gunkaran is the owner of the discotheque, F Bar. On November 19, 2018, shots were fired allegedly by the members of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in the bar during the birthday celebrations of Sahdev Salaria, an aide of MP Kirron Kher, leaving four persons injured. Gunkaran had claimed that he did not direct the security guard not to frisk guests, but was involved in the FIR.Senior advocate Chetan Mittal had told the court that a challan had been presented against him and the additional sessions court had framed charges against him while dismissing his discharge application. The summoning order under Section 211 of the IPC (false charge of offence with the intent to injure) could not have been issued on the private complaint as cognisance on such complaint is barred under Section 195 of CrPC. It was also argued that he was under custody on the orders of the court which could not be said to be illegal detention. Hence, there is no question of Section 342 of the IPC (wrongful confinement). The high court has stayed the proceedings and sought a response by December 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/f-bar-firing-case-punjab-and-haryana-hc-stays-defamation-proceedings-against-ut-inspector-101635536394480.html

Ask any question no matter how controversial, I will answer and you can write the same,” he told the waiting reporters, some of whom were nervous, knowing that he was the son of the biggest name in the Kannada film industry, Dr Rajkumar. This characteristic of the young actor made an instant impression on not just the reporters gathered to interview him, but to many whose lives he touched throughout his illustrious career. Not many doubted his acting prowess. After all, he made his first appearance on big screen when he was only six months’ old in the movie ‘Premada Kanike’, starring his father Dr Rajkumar. He even won the national award before his father, in 1985 for the movie ‘Bettada Hoovu’, when he was just 10 years’ old. He was also known to promote newcomers in the industry through his production house which produced films, TV serials among other content. Puneeth never used his status as Rajkumar’s son to promote himself or his films, however, directors and producers never shied away from using the star’s dynasty. Though out his illustrious career, spanning over 49 films — he missed the half century as ‘Dwitwa’ and ‘James’ are still under production —his attitude towards cinema and people in general never changed over the years. After each release, he would call me to get my opinion on his role and if there was anything he could have done differently. He would welcome criticism just the same as he would accept appreciation. I am sure he asked others for their opinions as well. He had some big hits under his belt, including ‘Appu’, ‘Arasu’, ‘Doddamane Huduga’, ‘Rajakumara’ and ‘Yuvarathna’. Almost all his movies focused to some degrees on social messages like rightful treatment of women, children and elders, which eventually became a sort of his signature style. His movies ‘Prthivi’ and ‘Ranavikrama’ were about the illegal mining in Karnataka’s Ballari district, which was at its peak in real life, as he played a deputy collector, taking the empire of bad guys head-on. Incidentally, Puneeth himself was into the granite business before his entry into cinema as the leading man. One day, his father called him and said there was no need to sell “stone and land” for a living as there was an industry that he could call his own, prompting a debut soon after. He had also written a book on his father (published in 2012) “the person behind the personality” and any earnings from this, he used it to fund government schools in the border districts of Karnataka. He was also a prolific singer who never took any remuneration for them. A significant chunk of his earnings went to old age homes and he had even adopted 45 Kannada schools. He never considered himself a hero, was a big fitness enthusiast and a humble soul. He would sometimes cycle to Mysuru, covering 125 km from Bengaluru. A director’s actor, Puneeth never discriminated between juniors and seniors. He stayed honest about everything in life: a trait that became one of his many loveable and adored characteristics, earning him not just a huge fan base for his reel life, but also in real life. (As told to Sharan Poovanna )(Muralidhar Khajane is a veteran journalist, who has covered cinema, politics among other beats for over 40 years. He is also the writer of book, ‘Random Reflections Kaleidescopic Musings on Kannada Cinema’)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kannada-superstar-puneeth-rajkumar-dies-he-never-considered-himself-a-hero-101635536334525.html

Even leaders who have staunchly opposed her entry have changed their mind to at least discussing the Sasikala factor even as she started her tour of the districts in a van used by J Jayalalithaa during election campaigns.“Why should we say that there won’t be any discussion? Clearly it seems like some people want her in the party especially now that we have lost two elections,” said a veteran party leader who did not wish to be identified. The leader who is a supporter of O Panneerselvam added that Pannerselvam had suggestion last week that the AIADMK leadership will discuss her reinduction.“After having the discussion we will abide by what the majority of the cadre want. So, it can either mean Sasiakla and her family will not be taken back or if the majority wishes for that so the party can be strengthened and we cannot deny that wish. We are a cadre-based party,” he said.AIADMK’s members have been speaking in different voices in public taking either a pro or an anti-Sasikala stance. On Thursday, AIADMK had expelled a senior party leader and deputy secretary for minorities wing, J M Basheer, for saying that he would expose former CM Edappadi Palaniswami on the issue of Sasikala’s return.On Friday morning, Sasikala is said to have used the same campaign van of late J Jayalalithaa in Madurai to garland the statue Muthuramalinga Thevar, a freedom fighter and an icon for the thevar community. Sasikala and Panneerselvam belong to the Thevar community which is predominant in the southern districts. She then made her way to his hometown in Pasumpon to pay tributes.On Saturday, chief minister MK Stalin, AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami, leaders from Congress and BJP will also pay tribute to Thevar’s statue in Pasumpom. As frictions are emerging to the fore in the AIADMK, the community support will play a significant role on the leader who can consolidate the party--a position currently occupied by Palaniswami; but is being threatened by Sasikala with the support of Panneerselvam. Another AIADMK leader said that channels of communication have been open between Panneerselvam and Sasikala. “We didn’t want to act hastily ahead of the elections but we were waiting for the right time to bring necessary changes to the party,” he said. Since Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, the AIADMK under the dual leadership of Panneerselvam and Palaniswami has lost three elections- 2019 parliamentary elections, 2021 assembly elections and the local body polls in nine newly carved rural districts. Political analysts say caste-factor played a role in AIADMK’s defeat in the recently held rural local body elections in nine districts. “AIADMK didn’t conduct polls to rural bodies during their regime because they are weak in this region,” said political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy. “Among the three castes who support AIADMK-vellala gounder, vanniyar and mukkulathor-- are not present much in these regions so in any situation AIADMK’s performance will be bad. This is unavoidable. Based on this, we cannot assess their performance in 2024 (general elections) and 2026 (assembly elections). That will depend on their alliance partners and situation.” Duraisamy said, adding despite the given developments Panneerselvam will not give up his right in the party. “He will continue to be in the dual leadership. Sasikala’s strength is still questionable but he can keep her close for his future growth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chorus-to-bring-vs-sasikala-back-in-aiadmk-grows-after-poll-debacle-101635535499324.html

A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said it would be open to the committee to review its decision about water level if the situation warrants it.

Moreover, Kadapa has been the bastion of YSRCP led by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and in the last elections, the party swept all the 10 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats in the district.Badvel, too, has been the stronghold of YSRCP, which has been representing this constituency for the last two terms. Naturally, it has the advantage over others in winning the by-poll to be held on October 30.Interestingly, the TDP, which initially announced the candidature of Obulapuram Rajasekhar who unsuccessfully contested the last assembly elections, for Badvel, but opted out of the contest after YSRCP announced the candidature of deceased MLA’s widow.“As per the tradition established by the TDP itself, we don’t want to contest the by-elections, if the spouse of a sitting MLA is fielded by the rival party,” TDP state president K Atchannaidu said.Jana Sena Party established by popular Tollywood actor Pawan Kalyan declared that it would fight the by-polls with the help of its alliance partner BJP, but it also dropped out from the contest on the grounds that it would follow the convention of not fielding candidate against the spouse of the deceased MLA.BJP, however, sprang a surprise on its alliance partner by jumping into the fray and fielding Panthala Suresh, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 election from Railway Koduru constituency. Similarly, the Congress also fielded former MLA P M Kamalamma, who represented Badvel from 2009 to 2014.However, both the BJP and the Congress have not been strong enough to fight against the YSRCP. The Congress has lost its ground in the state completely post bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh and has been drawing blank both in the assembly as well as Lok Sabha elections since 2014. Most of its leaders and cadre have already defected to the YSRC.Similarly, the BJP has little base in Andhra Pradesh, though it won a few seats earlier due to the alliance with the TDP in the past. Yet, it wants to put up the fight in Badvel as part of its long-term plan to grow as a political alternative to the YSRCP.Several BJP leaders including state party president Somu Veerraju, BJP national general secretary Daggubati Purandeshwari, BJP national in-charge of AP Sunil Deodhar, MPs C M Ramesh and G V L Narasimha Rao and BJP state secretary Satya Kumar have been campaigning for their candidate in Badvel for the last few days.Though Jana Sena has been the alliance partner of the BJP, it has stayed away from the campaign as a matter of principle. That is also a negative factor for the BJP. “But the Jana Sena Party cadres will vote for the BJP. Even the TDP cadres are expected to vote for the BJP candidate, as they definitely won’t vote for YSRCP candidate,” a state BJP leader said.As the YSRC is sitting pretty in the Badvel constituency, it is not sweating it out much in the campaign. Party president and chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy stayed away from campaign but wrote open letters to all the voters asking them to give a huge majority to YSRCP candidate in the by-election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ysr-congress-looks-set-to-bag-badvel-seat-in-andhra-pradesh-byelection-101635535316376.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||UP climate conclave: Time to plan energy conservation, say experts||LUCKNOW: With increasing urban sprawl, it was time to plan energy conservation and cut carbon emission in whatever one did, from making a building to having a meal, said experts on the second day of the ‘UP Climate Challenge Conclave-2021’ on Friday. “Carbon is emitted not only when you start making a building or start using lighting and cooling equipment, it starts from the point building material is made. There are 250 types of building materials,” said Vasudevan Suresh, chairman of the Indian Green Building Council, while addressing the technical session along with other experts. He said, “In all, 75% development is taking place in urban areas and factories, buildings and big offices are coming up. We need to think what components we use and whether we are focusing on making buildings sufficient with natural energy.” “We have green space of 2-sq mts per person but the WHO says it should be 9 sq mts per person. In fact, we need to see the present situation as an opportunity to work with abundance of sunlight in the country,” said Suresh. Vandana Sehgal, dean, department of planning and architecture, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, spoke on climate resilient infrastructure. “Mapping of the urban areas under development is now necessary to decide the energy needs,” she said. There were one billion air conditioners running in the country at present and data said by 2050 they would increase to 4.5 billion, said Anupam Bansal, an architect. Senior forest officials, including Manoj Singh, additional chief secretary, department of environment, forest and climate change, Pawan Sharma, and representatives of other organizations, including Mukesh Singh, state head and chairman of Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, Lucknow Chapter, were present in the programme. Faggan Singh Kulaste, Union minister of state for steel and rural development, said that commendable work had been done by the Yogi government since 2017, be it plantation or cleaning rivers. He requested to submit a detailed set of recommendations by experts during this two-day conclave. In all, 11 technical sessions were conducted in two days. Topics covered role of environmental legal framework in climate action, climate science-decoding 1.5 degree centigrade and climate vulnerability in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-climate-conclave-time-to-plan-energy-conservation-say-experts-101635535315143.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana farm leaders refuse to open side of highway at Tikri||The Jhajjar administration on Friday held a joint meeting with the Delhi Police officials, farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws at the Tikri border, and industrialists in Bahadurgarh over clearing one side of NH-9, which connects Delhi to Rohtak. The talks, however, remained inconclusive.A senior Jhajjar police official said the farmers raised objections to the proposal of clearing one side of the road near Tikri and allowing plying of non-commercial vehicles on the highway, citing security reasons.Farm leader Buta Singh said they have agreed upon giving a five-feet way to two-wheelers but refused to allow passage of four-wheelers as it may pose threat to the safety and security of the protesters who will stay put at Tikri along the highway, and have been here for around 11 months.“The issue will now be discussed at the Samyukt Kisan Morch (SKM) meeting scheduled for November 6,” he added.Jhajjar deputy commissioner Shyam Lal Punia said the farmers were given the proposal of allowing non-commercial vehicles on the highway as a large number of people travel to Delhi in their cars on regular basis, but they did not agree to this and sought time to discuss the matter with the SKM.The Delhi Police had removed at least six barricades on Thursday night giving hints to clear one side of the Rohtak-Delhi Highway soon. Now, only one concrete barricade remains to be removed on the border.“The Delhi Police had put up at least seven-layer barricading on the Tikri border to thwart the farmers and others entering the national capital. JCB machines worked the whole night to remove the concrete barricades and iron bars placed there but the work was stopped without removing the last barricade,” said Bablu, a protester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-farm-leaders-refuse-to-open-side-of-highway-at-tikri-101635535194778.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||More farmers shifting to mustard cultivation in Haryana||Eyeing a rich harvest in the next rabi season and amid skyrocketing prices of edible oils, more and more farmers from the wheat-growing belts of Haryana are shifting towards mustard cultivation.Mustard was earlier considered a main crop in non-irrigated southern parts of Haryana but as per reports, sowing of mustard is now on the rise in the northern parts as well.With the mustard prices reaching above ₹7,000 per quintal in the open market last year against the MSP of ₹4,650 per quintal, farmers are considering mustard a better option as compared to wheat. They said mustard requires lower input cost than wheat and has become more remunerative due to sudden rise in edible oil prices.“Last year, I had earned ₹50,000 from just one acre of mustard. This year I have sown the crop on five acres,” said farmer Jasvinder Singh, of Ladwa in Kuruksehtra district.Another farmer Ishwar Singh, of Karnal’s Indri block, who has sown mustard on six acres, said it is the best option for inter-cropping with sugarcane as it takes just three to four months for harvesting.Additional chief secretary (agriculture and farmers’ welfare department of Haryana) Sumita Misra believes besides last year’s price trends and higher MSP of mustard, the state government’s efforts for crop diversification have also pushed more farmers to go for mustard cultivation.Crop diversificationAgriculture experts, on the other hand, do not term it crop diversification as they believe the government wants to increase area under oilseeds and has given a push to its cultivation by increasing the MSP.They said MSP of mustard has witnessed over 31% hike in the past five years and has further been increased to ₹5,050 per quintal for the next rabi harvesting season from ₹4,000 of 2017-18.“Farmers are not sowing mustard for diversification. The good price of mustard is a major factor behind them shifting to oilseed farming. Farmers are ready to shift to other crops if there is an assured monetary benefit,” said agriculture economist Devinder Sharma.He said the increase in mustard acreage will bring down the prices of edible oils but if the government increases import of edible oils and cuts duty on import, that will also affect the prices of mustard.On whether the government will be able to procure the entire produce of the farmers if the area under mustard increases further, Haryana agriculture department director general Hardeep Singh said, “The government will procure mustard to ensure stability of prices even if the market prices in the open market come down. The government will support the farmers with the MSP.”Mustard sown on 4.73 hectare by Oct 28 Figures of the state agriculture department revealed a considerable increase in the area under mustard cultivation in Haryana. It has increased to around 6.10 lakh hectare in 2020-21 from 5.62 lakh hectare in 2019-20.“Till October 28, mustard has already been sown on around 4.73 hectare land and there is a strong possibility that it may reach around 8 lakh hectare this year against the set estimate of 6.50 lakh hectare,” said a senior official of the state agriculture department.In 2019, the Haryana government had procured around 5.19 lakh tone mustard from farmers who had registered themselves on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal. In 2020, the government had procured only 4.53 lakh tone mustard seed on MSP.But the sudden increase in mustard acreage may create a problem as government agencies will not be able to procure the entire produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-farmers-shifting-to-mustard-cultivation-in-haryana-101635534894600.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad all set for voting today||Stakes are high for the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), ruling BJP-JJP coalition and main Opposition Congress as voting will be held in the Ellenabad constituency of Sirsa district on Saturday.As many as 1, 85,873 voters, including 98,930 males, 86, 639 females and 304 service voters, will decide the fate of INLD candidate Abhay Singh Chautala, his former aide and Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal, and BJP’s Gobind Kanda, who are locked in a triangular contest for the Ellenabad seat.As many as 17 candidates are in fray but the real contest is between these three candidates, say experts.Meanwhile, on Friday evening, independent nominee Parthvi Sandhu extended support to Abhay, who is eyeing a fourth consecutive victory from his family bastion.The bypoll was necessitated after INLD’s lone MLA Abhay had resigned from the state assembly on January 27, after the Republic Day violence at Red Fort, in support of the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws.As per the Election Commission of India (ECI), the voting process on 211 booths in the Ellenabad constituency will start at 7am and continue till 6pm on Saturday.Of the 211 booths, 121 were considered vulnerable and most vulnerable. Ellenabad town’s booth number 116 and Mehna Khera’s booth number 9 have been established as model booths.Sirsa deputy commissioner Aneesh Yadav said they have made all necessary arrangements to ensure free and fair elections. Counting of these votes will take place on November2.Abhay hopes to retain seat; ‘golden chance’ for BJPThe Ellenabad bypoll seems crucial for the INLD and its nominee Abhay Singh Chautala because this was the only assembly seat of the 90 seats in Haryana from where INLD had won in the 2019 assembly polls.A decisive win from here would reassert INLD’s stature in the state politics and particularly in the Jat-dominated farming belt.On the other hand, BJP claims that the bypoll is a golden opportunity for them and a test for the INLD, which has been holding the agriculture dominated seat since 1996.Abhay has been representing the seat since 2010 while the BJP has never won from here. No member of the Chautala family has lost from here so far since 1966.This assembly seat includes 35% Jat voters, a majority of whom are dependent on agriculture. Hence, INLD’s Abhay Chautala is expecting their support amid the farm agitation. However, the BJP is trying to get majority of the non-Jat chunk of votes as it has fielded turncoat Gobind Kanda.Abhay said the bypoll is a referendum for the three farm laws and he is fighting for the farmers’ issues.“The BJP can make all attempts but it cannot buy the votes of Ellenabad residents. Result of the bypoll will depict BJP-JJP’s poor governance in the last two years and the farmers’ anger towards them and the three farm laws,” he added.However, BJP election in-charge for the bypoll and former state chief Subhash Barala said people need a dedicated MLA who can fight for their rights.“Due to Abhay’s attitude, INLD saw a vertical split and his party was reduced from 19 seats to just one being won by himself in the 2019 assembly polls. His estranged nephew Dushyant Chautala, who is the deputy CM, in an alliance with our party, and had proved in the 2019 polls that he is the heir of Devi Lal’s legacy by winning 10 seats. Our alliance nominee will win from here and Abhay’s dream of getting Devi’s legacy will be shattered,” Barala added.Rajender Sharma, political science professor at Rohtak’s MDU, said the bypoll will reflect the BJP-JJP’s two year rule and the farmers’ anger against Centre’s farm laws.“This bypoll is crucial for INLD to retain its place in the state assembly while will have no major impact on the BJP-JJP government. But if BJP loses, there will be a question mark on the coalition government as it had lost the Baroda bypoll last year,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-all-set-for-voting-today-101635534660367.html

But the government has not taken any step to grant financial assistance,” said Jethuke.Owing to the farmer agitation, public dealing at the secretariat was hit as the officials, including the inspector general of police, deputy commissioner and senior superintendent of police, were unable to step inside their offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-attack-bku-ugrahan-to-oppose-cong-leaders-in-villages-for-not-announcing-relief-101635534654474.html

30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan firing: Ex-SSP seeks probe into injuries suffered by cops||Former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma, who is an accused in the 2015 police firing case, asked the court to issue directions to Punjab Police to conduct further investigation with regard to the injuries suffered by the cops as well as damage to the public property during the Behbal Kalan firing incident of October 14, 2015. Sharma has been granted interim bail on health grounds in the case. Sharma filed an application in the court of additional district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi on Friday. The court has issued a notice to the state to file a reply on the next hearing on November 12. A list of eight police officers along with their medico-legal reports (MLRs) was submitted by Sharma claiming that they received injuries during the incident at Behbal Kalan. “The matter pertaining to injuries to the police officials as well as damage to public property is still unanswered. Even the probe commissions and Punjab police teams have no answer in this regard. Only one side of the case has been investigated by police teams, which is unfair,” he added. In his petition, the former SSP claimed that protestors started pelting the police party with stones and also firing on cops with intent to kill them. “Many shots were fired from amongst protesters and police was also attacked with sharp-edged weapons,” it reads. However, the special investigation team (SIT) probing 2015 police firing cases has claimed in the chargesheets that police opened fire on peaceful protesters and the former Moga SSP conspired with other police officers, including former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal to cover up facts relating to the firing, in which two Sikhs protesting over sacrilege incidents were killed at Behbal Kalan. The court also heard arguments on an application filed by Sharma challenging appointment of senior advocate RS Bains as special public prosecutor. However, the matter was adjourned after the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed Bains’ appearance in the trial court till further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-ex-ssp-seeks-probe-into-injuries-suffered-by-cops-101635534354495.html

Now, the proceedings of trial will commence against the dera followers after a gap of over six months. The local court has already framed charges against them. On November 4, 2015, torn pages of bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib were found scattered on the streets of Malke village, triggering statewide protests. The police had registered a case under Sections 295A and 295 of the IPC against unidentified persons at the Samalsar police station. On March 31, the court of additional district and sessions judge had ordered a stay on the proceedings of the trial court after the accused filed a revision petition demanding comparing of their fingerprints with that on torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib. The accused were identified as Prithi Singh, member of the dera state committee and a resident of Baghapurana, Mithu Singh and Ramandeep Singh, both residents of Malke village, Satnam Singh of Baghapurana and Davinder Singh of Hariye Wala. On October 29, 2018, the special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police led by deputy inspector general (DIG), Ludhiana range, Ranbir Singh Khatra, had arrested Pirthi, Mithu and Ramandeep while Satnam and Davinder were arrested on December 1, 2018. A court of judicial magistrate on July 31, 2019, had framed charges under Sections 295A (intended to outrage religious feelings) and 295 (intent to insult the religion) against the five accused. Special public prosecutor for the sacrilege case of Malke village Sukhdev Singh said: “The court of additional district and sessions judge has vacated the stay on trial against five dera followers.

30-10-2021||Gurugram||35 held for attempts to thwart namaz in Gurugram; being harassed, say devotees||At least 35 people associated with different Hindu groups were detained by Gurugram police for trying to disrupt namaz by Muslim devotees in Sector 12A on Friday afternoon. More than 500 officers were deployed at five designated namaz sites to ensure law and order. No violence was reported and prayers were offered peacefully, police said.Fellow members of the groups sat on protest around 7pm at the deputy commissioner’s office against the detention.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said, “Directions were earlier issued that anyone found shouting religious slogans or trying to disrupt namaz would be taken to the nearest police station. Police teams had been deployed since early morning at all five sites to check any unlawful activity and crime teams were deployed in plain clothes,” he said.Units of right wing organisations have been protesting against offering namaz in the open since September. Following a memorandum submitted to the administration by a consortium of Hindu groups on October 26, police were deployed again this week.The right-wing activists started gathering at the Sector 12A crossing and started protesting before people started offering prayers.They raised religious slogans and were seen holding up placards that asked the administration to take action against those offering prayers in the open.A group of people led by Kulbhusban Bharadwaj, a member of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, a consortium of 22 local units of right wing organisations, assembled at the crossing but before they could move towards the namaz site police caught hold of them and forced them to board a police bus and drove them away. After half an hour another group of people, mainly women residents of the area, assembled outside a medical shop at the crossing and started shouting slogans; the cops picked them up too and took them to the police station.Gurugram police had deployed more than 500 cops from all police stations, crime units, rapid action force (RAF) and other intelligence teams. Police barricaded the namaz area from all four sides to ensure no security or law-and-order problem arose, and all possible precautions were taken as the Hindu groups had threatened that they would not let the Muslims offer prayers.Prayers in sectors 47, 14, 56, DLF Phase 3, and other areas were peaceful, police said.Police said the residents of Sector 47 and other areas did not enter the prayer grounds and no one objected anywhere except in Sector 12A.Rao said a fringe group started staging protests earlier this year which intensified in September at a site in Sector 47. “Residents and locals joined the protest, chanting Hindu prayers at the time of namaz on consecutive Fridays over the past few weeks,” he said.Two memorandums were given by different groups to the district administration in the last few days demanding a complete ban on namaz in the open area and they have been threatening to not allow prayers in places other than mosques and Idgahs.At present, Muslims offer namaz at 37 different places on government land, identified by the district administration.The Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti had earlier carried out protests in May 2018. After that, the administration discussed the issue with both communities and designated 37 sites in the city for namaz.While being taken in the police bus on Friday, the protesters shouted slogans against Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and vowed to return once out of custody. “Police can arrest us, beat us but cannot keep us from protesting. We will return next Friday and until the open namaz is stopped, we will not stay quiet. It’s an open challenge and we will make sure no government land is used for open prayers. The government is providing protection to those encroaching on government land and we are being punished for taking steps,” said Bharadwaj.Ramesh Kumar, a Samiti member who has been a part of the protests, said, “The police are not ready to listen to us... This will lead to bigger issues and will take an ugly turn, resulting in violence.”Ankita Choudhary, sub-divisional magistrate of Gurugram who was deployed at the Sector 12A site, said some people assembled in the area and they were requested by police and the administration to not cause any disruption but they did not listen and started shouting slogans. “They were taken into preventive custody to maintain law and order and the site was cleared so people could offer prayers,” she said.Members of the Muslim community said they were being harassed by the protesters and they were being targeted for no reason. They demanded designated land so that they could set up mosques, after which they would not have to offer prayers in the open.Altaf Ahmad of the Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch said right wing groups have been making false allegations that Muslims offering namaz are outsiders. “All the people who come here to offer namaz are locals, why will anyone from other cities, districts or states come to Gurugram to offer namaz? We are being targeted unnecessarily and Hindu groups want to give it a communal angle and are provoking our men,” he said.Haji Shehzad Khan, chairman of the Muslim Ekta Manch, said if given space for a mosque they would not pray in the open. “Just because people are creating a ruckus, we should move to another spot is no justice to us. People offer namaz near their workplace and it’s a break for them, why should they travel to remember God? Spreading hate and lies, shouting slogans against Muslims and disrupting Friday namaz has become a focal point for right wing groups in Gurugram,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/35-held-for-attempts-to-thwart-namaz-in-gurugram-being-harassed-say-devotees-101635533934782.html
30-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Recover ₹23 crore for GIMS repair from officials, say activists||During a meeting with Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari on Friday, activists demanded that ₹23 crore required to reconstruct/modify the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) building in Kasna be recovered from officials of the Greater Noida authority for their alleged negligence with regard to the faulty design of the building. The move comes after concerns were raised about the building’s structure which has “major design faults”, which has raised safety concerns, said activists. “Officials of the Greater Noida authority, who were handling construction of the GIMS building, and the authority’s main administrative office should pay the amount needed to reconstruct/modify the unsafe basement structure, as they did not do their duties properly. The government must file an FIR against the officials involved in this. The building structure is unsafe according to the government report and the loss caused should be recovered from the officials responsible for it,” said Praveen Bharatiya, founder president of NGO Corruption Free India. Bharatiya, and another member Deepak Sharma went to Lucknow and raised the matter with Tiwari on Friday. “The chief secretary has assured that appropriate action will be taken in this matter without failure, or we will meet Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and approach a court if needed,” said Bharatiya.He earlier complained against the officials in the matter, following which the chief secretary inspected the hospital building and directed action.“Waterlogging and seepage is weakening the foundation of the building. But nothing has happened in this regard We want to know why no action has been taken so far,” said Alok Nagar, another activist. The foundation of GIMS was laid on the May 13, 2008 by then UP chief minister Mayawati and the hospital was named as Manyawar Kashiram Multi-Specialty Hospital. The state assembly passed the bill on December 4, 2012, and proposed to rename the institution as Medical University and Allied Hospital. The building was then constructed as per the university norms. On April 2, 2013, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated the hospital from Lucknow to start the services of the out-patient department. Emergency services in the hospital commenced from August 15, 2014. On February 15, 2016, the institution was rechristened as the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) by the Yogi Adityanath government. It handled Covid-19 patients quite well during last two years.The chief secretary did not take respond to calls seeking a response on this matter. “ ₹23 crore is needed to improve the faulty design of the building. We will soon start work after hiring an agency. We have taken action against the firm for faulty design,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of the Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-recover-23-crore-for-gims-repair-from-officials-say-activists-101635533575384.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police constable sacked for social media posts on farmer protests||A Delhi Police constable was dismissed from the force on Wednesday for allegedly using social media to criticise the government’s handling of the farmers’ protest, police officers in the know of the matter said on Friday. For nearly 11 months, different farmer groups from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country have been protesting at Delhi’s three borders points of Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu, against the three contentious farm laws passed last year. The constable, who was posted at the Sabzi Mandi police station in north Delhi, allegedly tagged Central government ministers and the Prime Minister in his posts and allegedly criticised them for their handling of the protest. Delhi police officers, privy to the details of the dismissal, said he was dismissed by police commissioner Rakesh Asthana under Article 311(2) (B) of the Constitution. According to that article, the authority (police commissioner in this case) is empowered to dismiss or remove a person or reduce him/her in rank for some specified reason, which has to be recorded in writing by the authority. The Delhi Police comes under the ministry of home affairs(MHA). The officers said the constable used derogatory language against Central government ministers. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said they followed “due procedure”. “After following due procedure of law, the constable has been dismissed under article 311(2) B of the Constitution of India,” he said.A police officer, who asked not to be named, said in the present case, the police headquarters received a complaint on October 7 from the special branch about the constable, who was regularly posting his views on social media and tagging the Prime Minister and other Central government ministers. The special branch is the police’s internal intelligence unit. “ An inquiry was conducted against the constable for posting such content. He was active for the last one or two months. His dismissal order reads that he had indulged in derogatory and inciting language against Central government and high dignitaries,” said the officer quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-constable-sacked-for-social-media-posts-on-farmer-protests-101635533335613.html

30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Robbers make off with cash from CR Park ATM after holding guard hostage||Armed men allegedly assaulted the security guard of an ATM kiosk in south Delhi and held him hostage for more than an hour while they used gas cutters to break open the ATM tray and flee with the cash on Friday morning, the police said.The ATM is located in the Masjid Moth Phase 2 market on Outer Ring Road, metres before the Chirag Delhi crossing.A case has been registered but police are yet to make an arrest till late evening. The ATM belonged to a leading public bank and its officials are yet to ascertain the amount of cash that was stolen, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaikar said the police control room received a distress call from a local who alerted them about the robbery around 6am.“The caller told us that there were about three to four persons who had arrived there in a car. The police rushed to the spot and the security guard told the officers that the robbers, carrying a pistol and knife, entered the ATM kiosk and broke into machine with the help of a gas cutter before fleeing with the cash. Bank officials are yet to ascertain the cash that was in the tray,” Jaikar said.The officer a robbery case has been registered at the CR Park police station.Investigating officials said the robbers held the guard hostage for at least an hour, while they cut into the cash tray below the ATM screen.Police said that preliminary investigation has revealed that the three men entered the kiosk around 4am.Police are examining CCTV camera footage from the market to identify the suspects.The robbers striking an ATM in the heart of south Delhi, on an arterial stretch, has prompted the Delhi Police to constitute several teams to arrest the robbers. Although there have been cases of ATM thefts and uprooting of machines in the past, most of these were reported from the outskirts of the city, police said.In the past two years, police have arrested over a dozen criminal gangs, mainly from the Mewat region of Haryana, for allegedly uprooting ATMs using SUVs and chains.Police investigations have revealed that the same gangs uprooted machines not just from Delhi but also from states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat.In Delhi, the gangs mostly targeted machines in poorly lit markets of outer Delhi, the police said, adding that they are checking to see if the present case is also the handiwork of criminal gangs from Mewat or a gang or gangs that have ties with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-robbers-make-off-with-cash-from-cr-park-atm-after-holding-guard-hostage-101635533111936.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Comply with order banning crackers: Supreme Court tells states, UTs||The Supreme Court on Friday told states and Union territories to strictly comply with its order prohibiting the sale, manufacture or use of banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali and warned that the chief secretaries, police commissioners, police district superintendents and station house officers will be personally liable in the event of violations.“No authority can permit the violation of the directions issued by this Court and permit banned firecrackers under the guise of celebration,” said a bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna. The Court clarified, however, that there is no blanket firecracker ban, because green crackers can be used during the festival.To be sure, despite this order, the use of firecrackers of all types (including the ‘green’ ones) will remain banned in Delhi and Odisha, where there is a total ban on the sale, storage or use of any kind of crackers.In Delhi, the ban is effective till January 1 next year in view of the worsening air pollution, and Odisha has imposed the ban in the interest of protecting general public health.Uttar Pradesh on Friday said it will permit the use of green crackers during Diwali for two hours, in areas where air pollution levels are ‘moderate’ or better.The Court’s order came on an application moved by a minor, Arjun Gopal, and two others. The case was argued by the minor’s father, senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan.The application cited a report by NGO Awaz Foundation, which tested “green crackers” and found them to contain the chemicals banned by the Court orders of September 2017 and October 2018. The report also found “fake QR codes” printed on the boxes of these crackers.The Court earlier prohibited the use of barium, lithium, arsenic, antimony, lead, mercury in firecrackers owing to its adverse impact on human lungs and eyes. It had also banned the use of joined firecrackers (laaris) owing to the huge noise, air and solid waste problem.The bench termed the violation of its directions as “unfortunate”.“It prima facie appears that the implementing agencies of the concerned states either lack the desire to implement the directions issued by this Court or they close their eyes for whatever reasons.”On October 23, 2018, the Court prohibited barium salts in manufacture of firecrackers but the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which undertook an investigation against fireworks manufacturers, recently submitted a report to the Court finding barium and other banned chemicals in firecrackers put on sale.“Celebration cannot be at the cost of the other’s health. Under the guise of celebration, nobody can be permitted to infringe the right to health of the others, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and nobody can be permitted to play with the life of the others, more particularly the senior citizens and the children,” the bench said,To ensure strict compliance, the bench said, “Any lapse on the part of the state governments/state agencies and Union territories shall be viewed very seriously and if it is found that any banned firecrackers are manufactured, sold and used in any particular area, the chief secretary of the concerned state(s), the secretary (home) of the concerned state(s) and the commissioner of police of the concerned area, district superintendent of police of the concerned area and the SHO/police officer in-charge of the concerned police station shall be held personally liable.”In its October 2018 order, the top court fixed the responsibility on district magistrates and police SHOs to ensure compliance of its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-asks-states-uts-to-comply-with-order-prohibiting-banned-crackers-101635533110895.html

The daughter died on spot in the attack while the son-in-law was injured and has been admitted to a government hospital in a critical condition, said police. Jagdish Chandra, superintendent of police (city) Haldwani said, “On Friday evening, a father, along with his son, attacked his daughter and son-in-law in Kathgodam area. The girl died on the spot while son-in-law has been injured in the incident.” Chandra said Salman, 24, resident of Kathgodam had an affair with Kainaat, 21, from the same neighbourhood. “Both got married one and a half months ago without informing their family members. On this, the families of both the boy and the girl were accusing each other. Once there was a fight in both the families wherein the boy’s mother got hurt. Police registered an FIR in the matter. Later, the two sides reached a consensus. After this, Salman started living in rented accommodation in the same locality,” he said. Chandra said on Friday evening, Salman and Kainaat were standing outside their rented accommodation. “Suddenly Kainat’s father Saleem and her brother Alam reached the spot with sharp-edged weapons. Before the newlyweds could understand anything, the father-son duo attacked them. The father stabbed his daughter repeatedly with a knife. At the same time, his son attacked his brother-in-law with blows. Hearing their screams, when the boy’s father and brother rushed to the spot, the girl’s father and brother fled the spot.” “The boy’s family members took him to the hospital by a tempo. Meanwhile, finding the girl alone, her father and brother came back and hit her on the neck. Due to this, the girl died on the spot,” the SP said. After getting information about the incident, the police force rushed to the spot. The girl’s body was taken into possession and sent for the post-mortem. Both the accused are absconding. The police have registered a case against the father-son duo on the complaint of the boy’s mother, said Chandra. He said they have registered a case against both the accused under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/man-stabs-daughter-to-death-for-marrying-against-his-wish-son-in-law-hurt-101635533108347.html

30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Organisers to arrange ponds for Chhath festivities, Yamuna out of bounds||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday prohibited Chhath Puja celebrations along the banks of river Yamuna and said all such festivities will be allowed only at designated sites in the national capital.Chhath, celebrated after Diwali by people belonging to Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, involves the offering of prayers to the sun god by fasting women, while standing in knee-deep water. Since these ritualistic prayers are not allowed on the banks of the Yamuna this year, communities will arrange ponds for devotees, after obtaining due permission from the district magistrate concerned.“The celebration of Chhath Puja during the month of November shall be allowed only at designated sites outside containment zones with requisite permission from the district magistrate. No site shall be designated on the bank of river Yamuna,” read the DDMA order, issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, on Friday.The authority further said designated sites shall be identified and managed by the respective district magistrates in coordination with the agencies concerned. The DDMA order also said at designated sites, the puja material offered by devotees should be collected by the municipal authorities and other relevant agencies for immediate and proper disposal in a scientific manner. “All devotees shall be strictly prohibited from throwing puja material like food grain, oil etc into river Yamuna. It shall be ensured that no such material is permitted to join the main stream of river at any point,” the DDMA order said.It also asked all organisers of Chhath Puja to submit an undertaking to the district magistrate, agreeing to strictly adhere to the guidelines of the National Green Tribunal and the Yamuna monitoring committee.Wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing, using hand sanitisers will be mandatory for all devotees at all times, the DDMA said, adding that both devotees and organisers will have to follow guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in October last year.Earlier, in an order dated September 30, the DDMA had prohibited Chhath celebrations in public places in view of the threat posed by Covid-19.But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged protests across the city and also outside the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, demanding that Chhath celebrations be allowed.Later, on October 14, Kejriwal wrote to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal requesting him to allow Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi, following which the DDMA, earlier this week, gave its nod for festivities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/organisers-to-arrange-ponds-for-chhath-festivities-in-delhi-yamuna-out-of-bounds-101635533035566.html
30-10-2021||Noida||With AQI at 321, Ghaziabad becomes ‘most polluted city’ for 2nd time in a month||Ghaziabad on Friday was listed as the “most polluted city” across the country with the air quality index (AQI) recorded at 321 under the ‘very poor’ category, according to the daily bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The city was listed as the “most polluted city” for the first time on October 16, following the implementation of the graded response action plan (Grap) on October 15 this year. The AQI figures released by the CPCB on Friday also showed that neighbouring Greater Noida and Noida recorded respective AQIs at 284 and 282 under the ‘poor’ category.It also revealed that all the four monitoring stations at Indirapuram, Loni, Sanjay Nagar and Vasundhara recorded the primary pollutants in the district at PM2.5. “The high levels of pollutants -- PM2.5 -- in the city indicate a high volume of vehicular pollution. Stubble burning also has a contribution of 20%, coupled with moderate wind speed which results in lesser dispersal of pollutants. All these factors have affected the AQI in the city,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh pollution control board.“According to the Grap protocols, we will now enforce steps to be taken to prevent the air quality being in the ‘very poor’ category. As directed by the CPCB, there is a ban on DG sets, and implementing agencies have been instructed to take care of it,” Sharma added.An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Stubble burning had a contribution of 20% to the existing situation, with fire counts at 1,112, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar).“As forecasted by the Safar, the AQI in the city is in ‘very poor’ category and is likely to deteriorate further during the daytime, until early Saturday. It is likely to improve marginally from Saturday evening, but will remain in the lower end of the ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category due to slightly improved ventilation coefficient,” said a Safar statement.It also said that the wind direction and speed in the city is favourable for transportation of stubble burning towards Delhi. Environmentalists said that the AQI has shown a “deteriorating” trend even before Diwali, which will be celebrated on November 4 this year.“The situation will worsen as the winter sets in. High levels of PM2.5 indicate high levels of vehicular emission. There is a heavy rush and movement of vehicles during the festival time, and it must be regulated with effective enforcement. Enforcement agencies concerned are rather lax in this context and are unable to control the unmanageable vehicle on roads,” said Akash Vashistha, a city-based environmentalist and lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-aqi-at-321-ghaziabad-becomes-most-polluted-city-for-2nd-time-in-a-month-101635532975570.html
30-10-2021||Chandigarh||Canada-based gangster Landa issues threats to cops in FB post||TARN TARANDays after being booked for demanding ransom and opening fire at a fuel station in Chohla Sahib, Canada-based gangster Lakhbir Singh, alias Landa, has reportedly threatened Punjab cops of dire consequences through a Facebook post.Landa, a resident of Harike in Tarn Taran, is also wanted in the Patti double murder case in which Akali worker Amandeep Singh, alias Fauji, and his aide Prabhjit Singh were gunned down allegedly by notorious gangster Daya Singh, alias Preet Sekhon. The killing was allegedly hatched by Landa, who fled to Canada in 2017.“Today, I want to say one thing to the policemen: don’t harass (my) family members or relatives. If any man is guilty, shoot him. When I was in India, fake cases were registered after calling me from my home, and now after four years, firing was opened in my house. You don’t register illegal cases and we will not unnecessarily harass anyone. But, if you continue harassing the family members and the relatives, it’s your wish. But, don’t think that your families are safe, whether your children are in foreign countries or in India, we know about everyone. We have four, but we will take forty of yours and the responsibility will be of the police,” the post reads.Landa and one Satnam Singh were booked under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (Act done by several persons) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Sections 25-27-54-59 of the Arms Act by the Chohla Sahib police on October 23. The case was registered on the complaint of one Jagjit Singh of Chohla Khurd. He had alleged that Landa had demanded ₹50 lakh ransom before opening fire at his fuel station.After the Patti shootout, Tarn Taran police had started the process to get Landa extradited from Canada. The police had written to the Union government for pressing the Interpol to issue a red-corner notice against Landa. According to the police, Landa had demanded ₹20 lakh ransom from a Patti-based person and Aman Fauji was opposing this. Landa had hired gangster Preet Sekhon to kill Fauji, who was a close friend of Gurmukh Singh Ghulla, political adviser of former Akali Dal minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon.Facing eleven criminal cases, including three of attempt to murder, Landa has been a headache for Punjab Police.

30-10-2021||Noida||Barricades come off at UP Gate site, farmers to decide on future course||Commuters on Friday continued to face traffic snarls on the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway even after the Delhi Police started removing heavy barricades from the UP Gate the same day, where farmers have been protesting against the three controversial farm laws since November 2020. Following the development, farmer leaders were non-committal whether they would vacate the roads near the UP Gate or not, and said that their umbrella body -- Samyukta Kisan Morcha -- will take a call on this.The UP Gate protest site has been occupied by the protesting farmers for almost 11 months now, as they have been demanding roll back of the three farm laws since November last year. They have been camping on the lanes of the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway, underpass area of the UP Gate flyover, with their temporary tents being lined up till Noida’s Khora Colony.On October 21, 2021, some farmers had removed a temporary tent below the UP-Gate flyover and claimed that the Delhi police blocked the road and not the farmers. In the next move, the Delhi police started removing heavy barricades using reinforced concrete boulders, iron spikes and barbed wires.In a statement issued on Friday evening, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha reiterated their stand over the blockades and said that the “stand of the farmers is vindicated”. “It is the police who have barricaded and blocked the roads and not the farmers, and this is something that the farmers have explained in the past too. The protesters had traffic movement in the past too, and will continue to do the same. We are talking about the protest site near the Tikri border and the Ghazipur border (UP Gate),” it said.“Police have fortified the morcha sites by placing huge cement boulders, multiple layers of metal barricades, sand trucks, and multiple layers of nails across the roads. In the latest narrative that they are trying to give a spin, partial removal of these barricades is being taken up, ostensibly to impress the Supreme Court of India,” it added.The UP Gate site is one of the several sites, including different borders of Delhi, where the farmers have been camping to protest the farm laws.On October 21 this year, the Supreme Court had said that the farmers have the right to protest, but cannot block roads indefinitely. The court was hearing a petition filed by a Noida resident, who urged the protesters to move away from the roads across the National Capital Region (NCR) as “their agitation takes a toll in daily commuting”.The court had also granted a three-week time period to the farmer unions to file their response, and listed the next date of hearing on December 7 this year.“Ultimately, a solution has to be found. We are not averse to their right to protest even when a legal challenge is pending, but roads cannot be blocked,” the court had said.Amid the scenario, the commuters feel that they are suffering the most as commuting on the DME did not resume yet. “The situation on ground remains as it is at the UP Gate as the road is still not open for commuting as the farmers are camping there. The courts must take a look at this and come to the rescue of the citizens. As a result of the situation at the UP Gate, thousands of commuters travel via Kaushambi, and the local residents are affected due to traffic snarls and pollution. It seems like resumption of commuting via those routes will take more time,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi apartments RWA.The DME stretch comprising the UP Gate sees movement of about 60,000 passenger car units per day, and it is also a key area for diversion of the Ghaziabad-bound traffic to different localities, like Vaishali, Kaushambi, Indirapuram and Sahibabad. “It has been almost 11 months since the commuters are suffering, and there is absolutely no respite for thousands of them who use the UP Gate route. The situation at the UP Gate also shows how easy it is to block the highway for 11 months, and get away so easily. With farmers occupying the area, removal of barricades will not solve the purpose. The highway was built for commuters and it should be opened for the commuters only,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of Federation of Association of Apartment Owners.Meanwhile, the Ghaziabad police has also put up barricades near Indirapuram and Pratap Vihar, and the traffic is diverted to Noida Sector 62. The stretch from Pratap Vihar to the UP Gate is about 10 kilometres and is not open for the commuters. “The barricades have been put up so that the commuters don’t reach the UP Gate where the farmers are camping. It may cause law-and-order problems. Commuting will not resume unless the framers vacate the site. For this, our officials are in touch with the farmer leaders,” said Ramanand Kushawaha, superintendent of police (Ghaziabad traffic police).Farmer leaders said that they were occupying the road as the Delhi police had put up barricades there.“The Samyukta Kisan Morcha will take a call on the removal of barricades by the Delhi police. The dismantling of barricades shows that it was the police who blocked the highway and not the farmers,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, UP Gate site spokesperson of Samyukta Kisan Morcha.Senior Delhi police officials, who reached the UP Gate site on Friday, said that it was their first action since the protest started. “We want that commuting on the highway be resumed. We are in touch with the protesting farmers, and we will request them to ensure that the way for commuters should be opened. We have started removing barricades from there,” Deepandra Pathak, Delhi’s special commissioner of police (law and order) told reporters at the UP Gate on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/barricades-come-off-at-up-gate-site-farmers-to-decide-on-future-course-101635532928955.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Coldest morning so far this season, AQI may worsen in Delhi||Temperatures continued to dip in the region on Friday, as Delhi recorded the season’s lowest minimum at 14 degrees Celsius in the morning, a drop which coincided with a season high farm-fire contribution of 20% percent to the city’s pollution levels, worsening its air quality further.Temperatures are expected to remain in a similar range over the next few days, even as the pollution is likely to worsen by Saturday morning, possibly dropping into the ‘very poor’ zone, agencies forecast.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) reading of 283 (poor) on Friday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, with at least 11 monitoring stations hitting the ‘very poor’ category in the evening.The Capital logged an AQI of 268 (also categorised as ‘poor’) on Thursday’s bulletin.
30-10-2021||Delhi||33 DPCC teams to enforce ban on diesel gensets in Delhi||A day after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) banned the use of diesel generator (DG) sets across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said 33 teams will soon be making the rounds of Delhi to identify violators and penalise them.Only emergency and essential services have been exempted from the ban and these included health-care facilities (for escalators and elevators), railway stations, airports, interstate bus terminals, the Delhi Metro, sewage treatment plants and national security related activities. Those found using generator sets without permission will be prosecuted under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, a violation of which could warrant a fine of ₹5,000 or a jail term of up to 18 months.DG sets have been banned across the Capital as well as NCR towns, following directions issued by the subcommittee on the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), which on Thursday enforced measures falling under the ”very poor” category of Grap.On Friday, Delhi recorded an air quality index of 283 (poor), according to the CPCB.KS Jayachandran, member secretary, DPCC, said so far, they have not received any request for exemptions from any individual, private company or housing society. “The use of DG sets will have to be shown as ‘essential’ if an exemption is to be granted,” said Jayachandran, adding that 33 teams have been deployed to work on two fronts – construction and demolition waste and to monitor industries which were not using PNG fuel.“Soon, the same teams will monitor the use of DG sets as well. The environment compensation charge imposed on a violator will depend on various factors such as its size, how long it had been violating the norms and what fuel type it uses – kerosene, diesel or petrol,” he said.Professor Mukesh Sharma from IIT Kanpur, who is part of the team that recently signed an agreement with the government to carry out real-time apportionment of pollution sources, said DG sets could contribute up to 2% of the overall emission load.A Delhi power department official said the city will receive uninterrupted electricity supply during winter, reducing the need for DG sets. “...each year DG sets are banned and Delhi faces no problems. This year will be no different,” the official said.Officials from Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam told HT that they were ready to give uninterrupted power to all Gurugram residents.Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the Uttar Pradesh PCB, said he had just received the CPCB order: “We will go through the order and ensure it is enforced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/33-dpcc-teams-formed-to-penalise-violators-of-dg-sets-ban-indelhi-101635532794928.html

30-10-2021||Noida||NHAI to assess damages on Delhi Meerut expressway before allowing vehicles||Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said on Friday commuting on the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) will be allowed only after they assess the condition of the expressway, which is currently heavily barricaded by the Delhi Police and is occupied by the farmers protesting against the three farm laws. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) on Friday night issued a statement, saying that the ‘morcha’ (protest site) will continue and also appealed to farmers to reach UP-Gate. The UP-Gate protest site falls under phase 2 of the DME and connects it with Dasna over a stretch of about 19.8kms. When HT team visited the expressway, it found cracks on the surface at the UP-Gate flyover. Officials of NHAI said they will assess the damage to the roads and also the infrastructure at UP-Gate. “The road will be open to commuters only after we assess the damages and take up road repairs and maintenance work. In the past, we have already apprised the Ghaziabad authorities in writing about the lack of maintenance resulting from the farmers protest at the expressway. The assessment will be taken up once the farmers vacate the roads,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. “There has been damage to electricity cables; there has been no maintenance and inspection of the UP-Gate flyover due to the ongoing protest. During monsoon, the roads were flooded due to blocked drainage system. It has been almost 11 months now that we are facing these issues,” said Garg. Earlier in September, the NHAI had raised concerns about the maintenance issues related to the expressway as a result of the ongoing farmers’ protest. NHAI officials sought urgent intervention from the district authorities and also shot a letter to the Ghaziabad district magistrate and requested that the farmers be removed from the expressway with the help of the police. “We are taking stock of the issues and also assessing the said loss/damage to the DME infrastructure. Suitable steps will be taken up,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate R K Singh. Farmers camping at the UP-Gate protest site have been demanding rollback of the three new farm laws introduced by the Centre since November last year. They also occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway since December and have put up their tents and dais at the site. On Friday, the Delhi police also started removing barricades from the expressway. Officials said other barricades will also be removed. Meanwhile, on Friday night, the BKU issued a statement appealed to farmers to reach the UP-Gate protest site in large numbers to strengthen the agitation.“We appeal to farmers to reach Ghazipur (UP-Gate) site and strengthen the protest. We make it clear that the ‘morcha’ (protest) will continue and there will be no change. The police blocked the road after January 26 and they are trying to correct their mistake. The protest site will continue... There have been conspiracies against the protest and we must be ready to fight these,” said the statement issued by BKU on Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nhai-to-assess-damages-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-before-allowing-vehicles-101635532621058.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police starts removing barriers at Ghazipur||The Delhi Police on Friday began removing concrete barriers, concertina wires, and spikes from near the farmer agitation spot in Ghazipur (Delhi-Ghaziabad boder) and also from Tikri (Delhi-Haryana border) where they started the process on Thursday, so that vehicular movement may be restored at both border points that have remained closed for the past 11 months. However, it was not immediately clear when the border will be fully opened.Farmers, mainly from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, have been camping in protest at the capital’s three border points of Singhu, Ghazipur, and Tikri since November last year.Leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella of around 40 farmer groups, said the removal of barricades by the police vindicated their stand that it was the police who blocked the movement of traffic at these key border points, and not farmers. The leaders said they will take a call on the next course of action only on November 6.“Police had fortified the protest sites by placing huge cement boulders, multiple layers of metal barricades, and sand trucks across the roads, apart from fixing spikes on the road. As part of the latest narrative that they are trying to spin, partial removal of these barricades has been taken up, ostensibly to impress the Supreme Court. SKM takes note of these development, and is watching the manoeuvres of the BJP government...,” said a statement issued by the group.On Friday, police said they have removed the barricades from NH-9 and NH-24 and were working with Ghaziabad police to restore traffic movement. DCP (east) Priyanka Kashyap said traffic movement will resume in the coming days. However, even after the removal of concrete barricades, restoring traffic to normal is unlikely as the main stage and several tents set up by farmers are still creating obstructions.“Delhi Police has taken an initiative towards restoring movement on the highway by removing barricades. We are in constant touch with farmers and have requested them to allow vehicular movement. If they try to move towards Delhi, we will deal with the situation as per procedure,” said Dependra Pathak, special commissioner of police (law and order, Zone 1)Farmers said they have allowed the movement of vehicles in the past as well and will continue to do so. Two farmer leaders from the Ghazipur site – Rakesh Tikait and Jagtar Singh Bajwa – said they will now move towards Delhi as the barricades have been lifted.When asked about their comments, a SKM member, requesting anonymity, said the next course of action will be decided at a meeting on November 6.“Farmers had already vacated one carriageway at the three protest sites for vehicular movement. Arrangements are being made to see that the one side is available to all commuters,” the member said.While the police began removing barricades from Tikri on Thursday, they started doing so in Ghazipur only on Friday morning. Farmers at the spot said police used earth movers to tear down concrete barriers, concertina wires, and spikes, all installed after the January 26 violence.The Supreme Court, on October 21, had observed that protesters cannot block public roads indefinitely and “some solution” should be worked out. The matter will be heard again on December 7.On Friday, most farmers in Ghazipur and Tikri said they were waiting for instructions from leaders. Jitender Singh, 32, a farmer at the Ghazipur site, said, “We hope we are able to take our voice to Delhi because that is what we came here for.”Farmer leader Bogh Singh Mansa, who has been leading the agitation in Tikri, said, “Not all barricades have been removed. The police are only facilitating removal of barricades because they want to have something to show the Supreme Court at the next hearing.”Delhi cop sacked for social media postMeanwhile, a Delhi Police constable was dismissed from the force on Wednesday for allegedly using social media to criticise the government’s handling of the farmers’ protest, police officers in the know of the matter said on Friday. The constable, posted at Sabzi Mandi police station, allegedly criticised Union ministers and the Prime Minister in his posts for their handling of the protest.DCP (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said, “After following due procedure of law, the constable has been dismissed under article 311(2) B of the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-start-removing-barricades-from-ghazipur-famers-say-they-stand-vindicated-101635532614382.html

The tax relief will be applicable to the categories of vacant land, non-residential rented properties, and commercial as well industrial (vacant) land. However, the order specified that tax payers who have already filed their returns will not be refunded.Irked by the clause, trader bodies said honest tax payers, who filed their taxes early, are being harassed. But officials argued that norms under Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act do not permit a refund in such cases. The rates were increased on August 27, 2020. Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman, said a large number of property tax owners will benefit from the partial roll-back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-north-civic-body-partially-rolls-back-property-tax-hike-enforced-last-year-101635532556527.html

Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC), a joint venture of the Maharashtra government and the Indian Railways, has begun a technical assistance study on improving universal access for people with disabilities (PwDs). The focus of the study would be on increasing facilities and how to make suburban railway stations more accessible for PwDs.Various amenities, including introducing wheel chair facility on stations, making ramps for wheelchairs at entrances and washrooms, and building platforms with wheelchair access to the ‘handicapped compartment’ of local train stations, are likely to be introduced. MRVC has invited tenders for the study at identified railway stations of Central and Western Railway under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP)-3A. “Over the years, we have been working on increasing the amenities for PwDs and on making the suburban railway stations disabled-friendly. The study will help us determine what amenities and facilities can be provided,” said a senior MRVC official.Churchgate station had upgraded its amenities in 2019 to become a completely disabled-friendly railway station by using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. The Central and the Western Railways have introduced braille signages inside local train compartments and on suburban stations. On Central Railway, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus(CSMT), Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), Byculla, Wadala and Panvel stations are disabled friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/study-to-make-mumbai-railway-stations-more-inclusive-for-pwds-101635532434710.html

Those arrested have been identified as Gurinder Singh, 29, and his woman friend Manjit Kaur, 40, who helped him in procuring a .32-bore pistol used in the crime. On October 4 this year, unidentified miscreant shot dead 32-year-old Varinder Singh of Bosar Kalan village when he was returning home after closing his shop in Patiala.Senior superintendent of police Harcharan Singh Bhullar said during investigation, a special team of the Patiala CIA zeroed in on Gurinder, who developed enmity with Varinder after knowing that his cousin was in a relationship with the latter’s relative. “On October 12 last year, Gurinder shot dead his cousin Harneet Kaur after he knew about her alleged relationship with Varinder’s relative Sehajpreet Singh. The case was registered under Section 302 of the IPC but after committing the crime, Gurinder concocted a story that he had committed suicide by jumping into a canal on October 22. He left a suicide note and his vehicle and other belongings were recovered from near the canal,” the SSP said. He added that Gurinder’s family considered him dead. “Gurinder fled and stayed in Madhya Pradesh. He visited Patiala on a few occasions to meet his female friend Manjit Kaur,” said CIA in-charge Shaminder Singh.During interrogation, the accused confessed that he was planning to kill another person named Laddi of same village over old rivalry. “We have recovered four countrymade pistols from Gurinder’s possession,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/double-murder-cracked-woman-among-two-held-in-patiala-village-101635532374512.html

30-10-2021||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar: Demand for e-vehicles rise; district got 6,937 such vehicles||The transport department in Gautam Budh Nagar has so far (approximately in two years) registered 6,937 electric vehicles and the demand for such vehicles has been gradually rising due to enforcement drives against polluting vehicles and rise in fuel prices, said officials on Friday.A K Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO - administration), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the total 6,937 electric vehicles include 5,938 electric rickshaws, 611 two-wheelers, 299 electric carts, 82 four wheelers, and seven three wheelers in the district.“We usually register 10 to 15 electric vehicles a day. Due to the rise in enforcement drives against polluting vehicles in the district, the demand has been increasing in the recent months. These electric vehicles are environment-friendly and do not need pollution under control (PUC) certificates,” Pandey said, adding that the district transport department has launched a drive to check pollution levels of vehicles, and a fine of ₹10,000 will be imposed against people crossing the limits, i.e., the violators.Md Irfan Azad, director of an electric vehicle showroom in Noida Sector 9, said that the prices for petrol and diesel have been rising and hence people are opting for electric vehicles. “These electric vehicles are environment-friendly and are very economical as compared to petrol/diesel vehicles. These vehicles are also fitted with smart charging cables and can be charged at home easily,” Azad said.Abhijeet Sinha, director, Ease of Doing Business programme of the Advance Services for Social and Administrative Reforms (ASSAR) -- which is developing an electric corridor on the Yamuna Expressway -- said that he has studied electric mobility of people living in Delhi-NCR. “We have found that most of the people living in Delhi-NCR travel to other cities frequently. Before buying a car, they consider if they will be able to drive the car in other cities. Since charging the vehicles is an issue, some people hesitate to buy electric cars,” Sinha said.Sinha also said that from November 25 to December 25, 2020, the ASSAR had conducted a trial run on the Yamuna Expressway, and found that 10 electric vehicle charging stations are required along the route -- one each in Greater Noida and Agra, and four on both sides each.

About 30,717 applications have been disposed of so far. “Of the 30,717 applicants, 10,650 have got conveyance deeds or registration slips -- they can now register their properties with the Delhi government,” said an official, requesting anonymity.Two years after the DDA started implementing the scheme, close to 438,000 people have registered on its website till October 22.Ahead of the Delhi assembly election in 2020, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government announced the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY) which aims to benefit the 4 million people living in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ownership-rights-for-over-10-000-residents-of-unauthorised-colonies-in-delhi-101635531354403.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||Amid buzz over VAT relief on fuel, UP government may have to assess financial situation||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government would have to weigh its options and evaluate the prevailing financial situation if it considers reviewing the rate of value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel in order to give any such relief in fuel prices to consumers before the 2022 assembly elections, experts have said.Although chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who presided over a high-level meeting to discuss the rate of VAT in the backdrop of the consistent increase in prices of petrol and diesel on Thursday, did not give any specific directives on the issue, his move to discuss the same has triggered a debate.“Yes, chief minister Yogi Adityanath convened a meeting to discuss the issue on Thursday. He has, however, not given any instructions in this regard after the meeting,” said a senior officer aware of the discussions there.The Uttar Pradesh government imposes VAT of 26.80% or ₹18.74 per litre (whichever is higher) on petrol. It imposes VAT of 17.48% or ₹10.41 per litre (whichever is higher) on diesel.UP finance minister Suresh Khanna, quoting the VAT in Uttar Pradesh via-a-vis other states, had recently asserted that the rate of tax was higher than Uttar Pradesh’s in many other states.Those aware of the prevailing situation on the financial front feel the timing of the decision on the issue would be crucial if the state government goes ahead with the move in the coming weeks.“If the state government goes ahead with the move to bring down the rate of VAT, it will certainly give some relief to the people. The timing may, however, be dictated by electoral compulsions. The state government has been claiming an increase in its revenue in recent months. This may give some elbow room to the state government to provide relief to the people,” said professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the economics department at Lucknow University.The state government earned VAT of ₹2200.40 crore, about 106% of the target of ₹2060.43 crore for September 2021 against ₹1653 crore earned in the same month in 2020. It earned ₹12137.27 crore as VAT in the first six months of 2021-2022, only 39% of the annual target of VAT collection of ₹31,100 crore. The state government’s likely VAT collection in 2021-2022 therefore shows that any cut in the tax rate will directly affect UP’s finances in the coming months.“Yes, the state government is bound to lose substantive revenue by giving relief to the people in VAT in the coming months. The state government will have to weigh all the options carefully before taking a call on the issue. It will be better if the Centre also complements the Uttar Pradesh’s move by reducing the excise duty on them to provide some relief to the people,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/buzz-over-vat-relief-on-fuel-up-government-may-have-to-assess-financial-situation-101635531294217.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: DDA earmarks ₹825cr to ease water, power access in Narela||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has approved projects worth nearly ₹825 crore in Narela, as part of its initiative to revive the area as the new residential, industrial and commercial hub in the Capital.According to a senior DDA official, the land-owning agency is focusing on upgrading the existing civic infrastructure in two important sectors, G2 and G6, where close to 20,000 flats have been constructed or are in various stages of construction. DDA plans to develop them as “zero waste” sectors.In a recent meeting, the DDA also approved projects related to construction of a 10-km-long road (20m wide) connecting the sectors, laying of water supply lines, stormwater drains and sewerage, among others.“We have sanctioned projects worth ₹824.73 crore of which ₹245 crore will be spent on water and sewerage, and ₹138 crore for setting up of an electric grid sub-station. In the days to come, new industries, institutions and residential areas will come up due to which there will be an increase in demand for electricity,” said a senior DDA official.Lack of water and transport services has been one of the main reasons why Narela, which is one of the three sub-cities planned by the DDA, could not become a popular residential hub.Earlier this year, the DDA decided to develop Narela as a priority area and made budgetary provisions to address water and transport related issues.The DDA has decided to pay ₹1,000 crore, in a phased manner, to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for the construction of Rithala-Bawana-Narela corridor, which is going to be the first Metrolite corridor developed by DMRC in the city. The two agencies are working on a proposal to construct a 5.6km-long line from the Rithala-Narela corridor to connect Pooth Khurd and Holambi Kalan areas.“We will pay ₹1,000 crore for the project. We have allocated ₹400 crore in next year’s budget for the Metro project. We are focusing on developing Narela in a big way,” said a senior DDA official.The National Highways Authority of India is soon going to start work on the 79km-long Urban Extension Road-II project, which will connect north Delhi areas, such as Narela and Rohini, with west and southwest Delhi, including IGI airport.A senior DDA official said, “UER-II will improve the connectivity between Narela and the rest of Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhidda-approves-825-crore-infra-projects-to-develop-narela-101635530934518.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Gogi gang sharpshooter shot dead, two policemen injured in gunfight||An alleged member of slain gangster Jitender Gogi’s gang was killed and two police personnel sustained injuries in a shootout on Friday morning in New Delhi’s Begumpur area.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said Deepak Sharma alias Bachi, 25, a resident of Jind, Haryana, had at least six criminal cases against him and was a sharpshooter of Jitender Gogi gang. DCP Tayal said Sharma was wanted in connection with the murder of a person named Deepak Singh, alias Radhe, on October 11.Radhe, a suspected member of the Tillu Tajpuria gang, was allegedly shot dead by Gogi’s accomplices on October 11, apparently because he had hosted a party to celebrate Gogi’s murder. In the last two weeks, police have arrested four people -- gangsters Rohit Moi, Gogi’s second in command, and Kapil Maan, both of whom were in jail, and two others Sahil Solanki and Naveen Sharma -- in connection with the case.DCP Tayal said that on Friday morning, police received a tip off about Sharma visiting his accomplice in Begumpur in Rohini. “Our team laid a trap in the area at around 5-5.15am. The team saw a man on a white TVS Apache motorcycle and signalled him to halt. But instead of stopping, he fired at the police team. One of our inspectors was hit on his bulletproof vest. He also fired at two constables who sustained bullet injuries. Our team also fired in self defense and Deepak Sharma was injured. We rushed him and the two constables to the hospital, where Sharma was declared brought dead,” said DCP Tayal.Police said Sharma had jumped parole in Delhi and Haryana and had been declared a fugitive.Gogi was shot dead by two gunmen inside a courtroom in Rohini district court when he was produced for a hearing on September 24. The gunmen posed as lawyers to enter the courtroom and waited for over half an hour for Gogi to show up, before opening fire on him. Police had earlier arrested Tajpuriya and gangster Sunil Maan, for Gogi’s murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhigogi-gang-sharpshooter-shot-dead-two-policemen-injured-in-gunfight-101635530874203.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up government over hawking plan||The Delhi high court on Friday pulled up the state government for not preparing the statutory street vending plan, saying that the city’s administration can’t be held at “ransom” by vendors.The court also questioned the formation of the Town Vending Committee (TVC) for the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area.“Please get down to some real work. Enough of politics. Where is the (street vending) plan?... Unfortunately, we are saying with a lot of pain that you people are not acting in the manner the Street Vendors Act was framed. People are taking advantage of it,” said a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh.It also pointed out that the NDMC TVC includes representatives of small markets but excludes the bigger stakeholders like shopkeepers of Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar, Khan Market, Janpath, Gole Market, and Bengali Market.The court was hearing a plea by the New Delhi Traders Association, through senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, seeking to strike down the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2019.While seeking the Delhi government and NDMC’s response on the plea, the court directed the Delhi government to specifically mention in the affidavit the justification for the constitution of the current TVC for the NDMC area.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra and standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi, representing the Delhi government, said, “It is festival period... if they are spared for a week, they will be able to earn some money during the festival and help their families... Kindly modify the order (of removal of illegal hawkers and street vendors).”The court said, “Till the time it is a no hawking zone...you have to implement it. If you have the power to amend the law, do it, but till the time law is there, you have to implement it,” it said.The matter will now be heard on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-pulls-up-delhi-government-over-hawking-plan-101635530456613.html
30-10-2021||Delhi||Amid protests, DU body passes hiring changes for assistant professors||Delhi University’s executive council (EC), the varsity’s highest decision-making body, on Friday passed a number of academic reforms, including changes to the recruitment process for assistant professors in the colleges and university departments, which drew protests from the teachers’ body.Among the changes include caps on the number of people to be interviewed for the post and a screening mechanism for shortlisting candidates for the interview, which some teachers claimed goes against a 2019 agreement promising all ad hoc teachers in the varsity a chance to interview for the assistant professor job. Three of the 20-member EC dissented on the proposal (item 5.1).Dissenting members sat in protest against the screening process, and sought absorption of all ad-hoc and temporary teachers.EC member Seema Das said that the vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh had promised discussion on the 2019 document in future meetings. “Interviews are not good enough as we have seen how they are discriminatory. We rejected the 5.1 annexure and registered our dissent,” said Das.Rajpal Singh Pawar, another EC member who dissented, said that it was important to do away with the point-based criteria for screening: “A number of people will be left out at the screening level itself if one goes by the current parameters and the assessment point index. There are people who have been teaching for years and don’t have a PhD.”DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president Rajib Ray said that teachers’ body will not tolerate any violation of the December 5, 2019, record of discussion.“Teachers gathered outside the VC’s office today to protest against the unfair screening process,” said Ray.However, EC member VS Negi, a member of the National Teachers’ Democratic Front, said all working ad-hoc teachers will get a chance to appear for the interview. “During the meeting, the VC assured that the December 5 letter will be examined...,” said Negi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-protests-delhi-university-executive-council-passes-asst-prof-hiring-changes-101635529795417.html
30-10-2021||Lucknow||‘300+ seats again’: Amit Shah sets pitch for 2022 UP||Union home minister Amit Shah set the tone for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, coining the slogan “ek baar phir se 300 paar (once more 300+ seats)” and urged the people of the state to re-elect the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power and Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister in Uttar Pradesh.UP goes to the polls early next year and Shah claimed his party has met “more than 90%” of the promises in its 2017 manifesto. “We need five more years to make UP the number one state in the country,” he added, emphasising the importance of the state to the party’s electoral prospects in 2024. If you want to see Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in 2024, he said “you have to make Yogi Adityanath UP CM in 2022”.In the 2017 assembly polls, the BJP and its allies won 325 of the 403 seats in the state. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party and its allies won 64 of the 80 seats in the state.Shah was speaking at the launch of the party’s membership drive ‘Mera pariwar, bhajapa pariwar (my family, BJP family)’ in Lucknow on Friday.Even as he lauded CM Adityanath’s handling of the Covid situation in the state, Shah lashed out at :Akhilesh and company”, “behenji”, and “Gandhi-Vadra pariwar” , the Samajwadi Party, Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress, the three other main players in the state.“We have done a lot in these five years. But these political parties have left such big holes behind that filling them would require some more time. UP will set the stage for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. I have come here to appeal to you to give another chance to Modi ji and help make Yogi ji chief minister again and that is why we are saying, once more, go past 300 seats,” Shah said at a well-attended public meeting in Lucknow.Twice during his address, Shah, who is expected to visit UP twice in November, urged the people to help make Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister again, an exhortation that did not go unnoticed within the party. Yogi Adityanath’s continuation, as the chief ministerial candidate ahead of the polls, was subject to much speculation in May-June.Shah’s address was sprinkled with remarks on the Ayodhya Ram temple and the exodus of Hindus from Kairana in western UP in 2016, something which has been stopped, he said . He said the temple issue got a clear resolution under the leadership of PM Modi. “Kairana palayan se mere khoon kholta tha… par ab palayan karane wale ab palayan kar rahe (my blood boiled at the Kairana exodus.. but those who forced the exodus have now fled themselves)” he said. “UP is the land of Baba Vishwanath, the birthplace of Lord Ram and Krishna but for the first time since the Mughal rule, the state seems to have got its identity back,” he said.Hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the “man of the match” for the party’s win in 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when BJP swept UP, Shah also launched the Modi 11 app, an online platform to help people connect with the party. He said that the BJP’s membership drive would continue till the end of the year. “We believe in family planning but we relax this definition when it comes to expanding our BJP family,” he added.“Governments are not meant for family benefits. They are meant to help the poorest of the poor. We are willing to give an account of our term in power but Akhilesh babu, I surely would like to ask you how much time did you spend in a foreign land, where were you during Covid-19 and floods? These politicians and parties have worked for themselves, their families or at the most, their caste. But, the Modi government has worked for the poorest of the poor, Dalits, tribals, women, backwards.”Reacting to Shah, Congress leader Zeeshan Haidar said: “In politics, one should be humble... The beauty of democracy is that people’s will is supreme. So one should not behave as if they are here forever...”Professor Manuka Khanna of Lucknow University’s political science department said: “Predicting a clear cut winner is difficult but BJP appears to be well prepared for the battle at the hustings at the moment.”Ajay Mishra shares stageUnion minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish Mishra is the main accused in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, also shared the stage with Shah at the event.While Mishra refused to comment on the case, he said: “That’s a satisfaction that none can say that I misused my position (to save his son).”Criticising Mishra’s presence at the event, Haidar said: “This shows the hollowness of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s claim that rule of law prevails in UP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-boosts-morale-of-bjp-workers-underscores-need-for-discipline-ahead-of-up-assembly-polls-101635528474062.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Enquiry against Sameer Wankhede; NCB vigilance team records statement of one more person||A four-member Mumbai Police team, headed by an officer of rank of assistant commissioner of police (ACP), has begun its probe into allegations of corruption against officers of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), including Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, the lead investigator in the cruise drugs raid case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was arrested earlier this month.“If the enquiry reveals commission of any cognisable offence, a First Information Report (FIR) would be registered against the concerned person/s and further investigation would be commenced as per due procedure,” an officer familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity.At least four police stations have received complaints against NCB officials and Wankhede after Prabhakar Sail, an independent witness in the drugs case, in an affidavit on October 23 claimed that investigators made him sign on 10 sheets of blank paper at their office on the day of the raid.Sail also alleged that he overheard his employer, Kiran Gosavi (another witness in the case) speaking on the phone about extorting ₹25 crore to settle the case and release Aryan Khan, which could be negotiated to ₹ 18 crore, with ₹8 crore purportedly for Wankhede.The affidavit further stated that Gosavi met Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, and a purported exchange of money took place between them on October 3. Aryan was arrested later that afternoon and released on Friday.Wankhede has denied all allegations made in the affidavit. “This is a malicious allegation to target my reputation. I condemn it,” he said.The Mumbai Police team, led by ACP Milind Khetle of Azad Maidan division, and comprising inspector Ajay Sawant (Colaba police station), sub-inspector Prakash Gawli (cyber police) and assistant inspector Shrikant Karkar (anti-narcotics cell), began examining call detail records (CDR), close circuit television (CCTV) footage at the locations where the alleged meetings took place and where a bag of cash was purportedly exchanged. It also began examining the phone call locations of NCB officials and other individuals who were part of the alleged extortion plan.“The focus of our inquiry is to ascertain how the money transactions, if any, took place. Sail said that there were cash transactions and proving that will be very challenging. We are in the process of identifying witnesses who were part of the alleged transaction or witnessed it. Only after finding strong evidence will we register an FIR,” another officer said on condition of anonymity. “Once we establish that money transactions were made for the purposes of bribery or extortion, we will try to ascertain whether Gosavi was acting on his own or whether he was following any NCB officer’s orders,” the officer added.The police team is being supervised by ACP Dilip Sawant and DCP Hemrajsingh Rajput.Sail, who was interrogated by Mumbai Police for several hours on October 27 and 28, filed an application seeking protection at Sahar police station on October 25. “He has shared all details to substantiate his claims,” Sail’s lawyer Tushar Khandare said.A separate enquiry is being conducted by a vigilance team, led by NCB deputy director general Gyaneshwar Singh, based on Sail’s allegations. The team, which is currently in Mumbai, has recorded the statements of eight people, including Wankhede and four other NCB officers, so far. It has also sought Sail’s participation in the enquiry. “[On Thursday] We requested the Mumbai Police commissioner also to convey our message to Sail, as we learnt through various media reports that he was being investigated by them, to join our inquiry. Surprisingly, Sail has not come forward. In the last three days, we have used all our sources to serve him a notice directly and also through his relatives and also contacted his advocate,” Singh told reporters on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/enquiry-against-sameer-wankhede-ncb-vigilance-team-records-statement-of-one-more-person-101635526793924.html
30-10-2021||Mumbai||Blacklisted contractors paid kickbacks to be eligible for bidding: Mumbai BJP MLA||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday alleged that the seven-year ban on two road contractors was reduced to three years, while the others were given a clean-chit following kickbacks to a minister. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had blacklisted the six contractors for their involvement in the 2016 roads scam, BJP said. BJP legislator Mihir Kotecha alleged that kickbacks of around ₹100 crore were paid for reducing the blacklisting period so that the tainted contractors could take part in the new tenders for road works worth ₹2,200 crore.“These road contractors were found guilty in the ₹975-crore road scam. They had been blacklisted for seven years and were not able to bid for any contracts till now. However, the blacklisting period for two of them was reduced to just three years in 2019 and the remaining contractors have been given a clean chit now, so that they can now bid in the current road tenders,” said Kotecha.Kotecha added, “This was done at the behest of a cabinet minister and the minister’s cousin.”The 2016 road scam came to light after incumbent mayor Snehal Ambekar alleged malpractices in repair works in a confidential letter to then municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta.Babasaheb Salve, director in-charge of BMC, who issued the orders to reduce the blacklisting period, refused to comment, stating that he was in a meeting. However, additional civic commissioner P Velrasu said, “The orders [to reduce the blacklisting period] have been issued in a quasi-judicial capacity. Apparently, the companies have already been blacklisted for almost six years. No Act or norm provides for six or seven years of blacklisting. There are strong high court and Supreme Court case precedents available. The Central government procurement manual does not provide for more than two years of blacklisting. So, I feel the orders by the director are logical and proper.” Meanwhile, Shiv Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “We deny all the allegations levied by BJP. They are stuck on one figure – ₹100 crore – and bring it up at every instance. This is BJP’s agenda for the upcoming elections as well as because we are exposing their scam in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-road-scam-blacklisted-contractors-paid-kickbacks-to-be-eligible-for-bidding-101635523853632.html

Hours after this meeting, Bandopadhyay was asked by DoPT to report for duty in Delhi but the CM refused to release him.The bench of justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Rabindranath Samanta on Friday set aside the CAT order and said the modus operandi of the Centre to get the case transferred to the principal bench of CAT in Delhi appeared mala fide.“The entire modus operandi adopted by the Union of India reeks of mala fides. It is unfortunate that the Principal Bench of the CAT nurtured such efforts by passing the impugned transfer order... Rather, the responsibility of meting out justice and serving the cause of justice is on a much higher pedestal for the Union of India than an ordinary individual litigant,” the bench said in its order. HT has seen a copy of the order.Bandopadhyay moved CAT after he was asked to appear before DoPT for framing of charges. He moved the high court after CAT, in its order passed on October 21, moved the hearing of his petition from Kolkata to Delhi.“The alleged recalcitrance of the writ petitioner on May 28, 2021 took place within the territorial jurisdiction of the Kolkata Bench, the articles of charge against the petitioner were levelled in the teeth of the communication of the Chief Minister herself from Kolkata, which could also be a potentially important piece of evidence,” said Friday’s order after the Centre’s counsel challenged the high court’s jurisdiction in the caseBandopadhyay was not available for comments on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/reeks-of-mala-fide-hc-scraps-cat-order-to-move-bengal-officer-s-plea-to-delhi-101635511552932.html

Prior to the 2018 state general assembly elections, the NDPP and BJP had a seat-sharing agreement. While the two parties with the support of one independent, along with two National People’s Party MLAs and one Janata Dal (United) MLA had formed the People’s Democratic Alliance, the latter three MLAs later merged with the NDPP. The old regional giant Naga People’s Front (NPF) had played the role of opposition until July this year when they moved to form an all-party government to push the long drawn-out Naga peace talks. Formation of the new opposition-less government under the nomenclature UDA was finalised in September.The bypoll to Shamatore-Chessore seat in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly was necessitated by the demise of the then sitting NDPP MLA Toshi Wungtung in July this year.Yimchunger was the sole candidate to file nomination papers to contest in the bypoll and following scrutiny of his documents, which were found to be valid and after the last hour for withdrawal of candidature on October 13, he was handed over the certificate of election-by-election officials.With Yimchunger’s uncontested victory, the NDPP’s total strength in the house of 60 now stands at 21, while NPF has 25 MLAs and BJP has 12, and two independent legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ndpp-retains-shamator-chessore-seat-uncontested-in-nagaland-bypoll-101635509320632.html
30-10-2021||Other||YSRC’s strategy to field deceased MLA’s widow gives them edge in Badvel bypoll||It’s advantage for ruling YSR Congress party in the bypoll to Badvel constituency in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district, with primary opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) opting out of the contest and two other contenders – Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress not having enough strength to fight the battle.The by-election to Badvel is necessitated owing to the sudden demise of sitting YSRC MLA Dr Gunthoti Venkata Subbaiah in March due to illness. The party has fielded Subbaiah’s widow Dasari Sudha, a practising doctor, to cash in on the sympathy factor. Moreover, Kadapa has been the bastion of YSRC led by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and in the last elections, the party swept all the 10 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats in the district.Badvel has been the stronghold of YSRC, with the party representing the constituency for the last two terms. Evidently, it has the advantage over others in winning the bypoll scheduled for October 30.Interestingly, the TDP initially announced the candidature of Obulapuram Rajasekhar, who unsuccessfully contested the last assembly elections, for the Badvel seat. He, however, opted out of the bypoll battle after YSRC announced the candidature of deceased MLAs’ widow.“As per the tradition established by the TDP itself, we don’t want to contest the by-elections, if the spouse of a sitting MLA is fielded by the rival party,” TDP state president K Atchannaidu said.Jana Sena Party established by popular Tollywood actor Pawan Kalyan declared that it would fight the bypolls with the help of its alliance partner BJP, but the party also dropped out from the contest on grounds that it would follow the convention of not fielding candidate against the spouse of the deceased MLA.But BJP sprang a surprise on its alliance partner by jumping into the fray and fielding Panthala Suresh, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 elections from Railway Koduru constituency. Similarly, the Congress also fielded former MLA PM Kamalamma, who represented Badvel from 2009 to 2014.However, both the BJP and the Congress have not been strong enough to fight against the YSRC. The Congress has completely lost its ground in the state post bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and has been drawing blank both in the assembly as well as Lok Sabha elections since 2014. Most of its leaders and cadre have already defected to the YSRC.Similarly, the BJP has little base in the southern state, though it won a few seats earlier due to the alliance with the TDP in the past. Yet, it wants to put up the fight in Badvel as part of its long-term plan to grow as a political alternative to the YSRC.Several BJP leaders including state party president Somu Veerraju, BJP national general secretary Daggubati Purandeshwari, BJP national in-charge of Andhra Pradesh Sunil Deodhar, MPs CM Ramesh and GVL Narasimha Rao and BJP state secretary Satya Kumar have been campaigning for their candidate in Badvel for the last few days.Though Jana Sena has been the alliance partner of the BJP, it has stayed away from the campaign as a matter of principle. That is also a negative factor for the BJP. “But the Jana Sena Party cadres will vote for the BJP. Even the TDP cadres are also expected to vote for the BJP candidate, as they definitely won’t vote for YSRC candidate,” a state BJP leader said.As the YSRC is sitting pretty in the Badvel constituency, it is not sweating it out much in the campaign. Party president and chief minister Reddy stayed away from campaign but wrote open letters to all the voters asking them to give a huge majority to YSRC candidate in the by-election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ysrcs-strategy-to-field-deceased-mla-s-widow-gives-them-edge-in-badvel-bypoll-101635506890492.html

Nearby residents' windows were smashed.Aden is the temporary home of Yemen's internationally-recognised government, which has as part of a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia been fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group for around seven years.But tensions have also for years simmered within Aden itself between the government and southern separatist groups.The government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) are nominal allies under the Saudi-led coalition.Earlier this month a car bomb in Aden targeting a convoy carrying the city's governor - an STC member - killed at least six people and wounded others. The governor survived.Instability in the south complicates United Nations-led peace efforts to end the war in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of people and left 80% of the population needing help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-near-yemen-s-aden-airport-kills-12-101635613274783.html
30-10-2021||World||Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia call for punishable measures against Lebanon||Lebanese politicians were in contact with foreign officials Saturday to try find a solution to a crisis between Lebanon and Gulf nations led by Saudi Arabia, triggered by comments of a Cabinet minister regarding the war in Yemen.Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates followed the Saudis with punishable measures against Lebanon, increasing pressure on the small, crisis-hit country badly in need of foreign assistance to help it ease a crippling economic and financial crisis.On Saturday afternoon, Saudi ambassador to Beirut Waleed Bukhari flew home after he was recalled by his government, according to airport officials in Beirut. Bukhari’s departure came a day after Saudi Arabia ordered Lebanon’s ambassador to Riyadh to leave within 48 hours and banned all imports from Lebanon.Saudi Arabia has for decades been a huge market for Lebanese products.The moves came as the Arab League chief expressed concerns about the deterioration of ties between Lebanon and wealthy Gulf countries over statements made by Information Minister George Kordahi.Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib said Prime Minister Najib Mikati is in contact with foreign officials who asked him not to think about resigning. The minister added that he is in contact with the Americans to help solve the crisis.Kordahi described — on a TV program filmed in August and aired this week — the war in Yemen as an aggression by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. He called the war “absurd,” saying it must stop because he is opposed to wars between Arabs.Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014, when the Iran-backed Houthi rebels captured the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north of the country. That forced the internationally recognized government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed by the United States, to try to restore the government to power. Despite a relentless air campaign and ground fighting, the war has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.On Saturday evening, Kordahi visited Cardinal Bechara Rai, the head of Lebanon's Maronite Catholic church, and discussed the matter with him. Kordahi did not speak to journalists after the meeting. He earlier refused to apologize, saying his comments meant no offense to Saudi Arabia.Earlier in the day, Kuwait followed Saudi Arabia and Bahrain by ordering the Lebanese charge d’affaires on Saturday to leave the emirate within two days. Later Saturday, the United Arab Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency said on Twitter that it would withdraw its diplomats from Lebanon in solidarity with Saudi Arabia.The tweet also said Emiratis would be ”prevented” from traveling to Lebanon. Travel bans have happened previously to Lebanon over politics in the past.In Beirut, several government officials met Saturday to discuss the crisis that is likely to have major repercussions on Lebanon. The meeting was briefly attended by the US embassy’s Deputy Chief of Mission Richard Michaels at the foreign ministry in Beirut, according to Bouhabib.“They can help in solving these problems,” Bouhabib said about the United States.Bouhabib canceled his visit to Glasgow, Scotland, where he was supposed to attend a UN climate summit, to deal with the crisis with the oil-rich Gulf nations. He said Mikati will go to Glasgow where he will discuss the crisis with foreign dignitaries.President Michel Aoun said in a statement Saturday that Lebanon wants the best relations with Saudi Arabia and its neighbors.On Friday night, Mikati and Aoun discussed the Saudi decision and asked Kordahi to make the “appropriate decision,” an apparent call for him to resign in hopes it will ease the tension.Kordahi, a former TV show host, made the comments on a TV program before he was chosen for the post in September. Kordahi is close to the Christian Marada Movement, an ally of the militant Hezbollah group.Marada leader Sleiman Frangieh told reporters Saturday that it is up to Kordahi to decide whether he will resign or not. He added that Kordahi contacted him and asked whether he should resign “but I refused because he did not make any mistake. Still I am with any decision he takes.”In Cairo, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit said the crisis caused by Kordahi’s comments has led to a “great setback” to Lebanon’s relationship with the Gulf countries.He urged Lebanon’s president and prime minister to take “necessary steps” to ease the tension, especially with Saudi Arabia. He did not elaborate which steps should be taken.Aboul-Gheit also called on Gulf officials to review measures that could have negative consequences on Lebanon’s already battered economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-uae-saudi-arabia-call-for-punishable-measures-against-lebanon-101635610681376.html

The incident happened after an argument broke out between the Islamist militant group and the guests over music being played at the party.Ariana News reported that Taliban forces barged into the wedding party and asked for the music to be stopped. However, they eventually resorted to firing at the guests.Taliban’s Nangarhar governor’s spokesman, Qazi Mullah Adel, confirmed the incident to AFP. Meanwhile, the group’s government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid although couldn’t confirm the matter, he promised that the Taliban’s policy is not to execute music lovers.“In the ranks of the Islamic Emirate, no one has the right to turn anyone away from music or anything, only to try to persuade them,” Mujahid told a press conference in Kabul, adding that probe into the matter is underway and it’s yet unclear how it happened.He further stated that if an individual kills someone on their own, “even if they are (Taliban’s) personnel, that is a crime” and the group will introduce them to the courts to face the law.Also Read | Taliban to cut hands of thieves, reveals punishment for 'illegal intercourse'This comes close on the heels of another incident on Tuesday when a man was injured after an armed Taliban man opened fire to disperse a crowd that had made a queue to buy air tickets at the Kabul airport, Sputnik reported.Quoting an eyewitness, the Sputnik report added that the Taliban man had his “finger on the trigger” when he dispersed the crowd at the airport, and that the group’s forces often have a cartridge in the chamber of the gun without the safety on."A man was injured. A Taliban man had his finger on the trigger when he dispersed the crowd, and they often have a cartridge in the chamber and the safety is off," Sputnik quoted an eyewitness as saying. This news comes at a time when the Islamist group is vying for recognition of their interim government in Afghanistan from the international community more than two months after recapturing the country. Although the European Union (EU) recently announced an aid package worth $1.2 billion for Afghanistan, the bloc had made it clear that the fund was meant for “direct support” for the Afghans and not the Taliban as it doesn’t recognise it.Also Read | Ensure Afghan territory is not used to attack any nation: India, US urge TalibanNotably, banning music was among the several diktats that the Taliban had imposed in Afghanistan during their earlier regime in the 90s. World leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden, among others, have repeatedly stressed that recognition of the Taliban government in Afghanistan will be decided on the basis of their actions and how accurately the group lives up to its promises of creating a peaceful environment in the country. Notably, soon after recapturing Afghanistan following the withdrawal of the US and other foreign-led forces, the Taliban had vouched for women and children’s rights to education and work, human rights and not allowing the country to become a safe haven for terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-open-fire-at-wedding-party-over-argument-for-playing-music-kill-2-101635608529025.html
30-10-2021||World||UK could trigger EU dispute over French fish row: Boris Johnson||Britain's Boris Johnson complained to EU chief Ursula Von Der Leyen on Saturday that French threats over fishing were "completely unjustified" as he held out the option of invoking a Brexit dispute tool for the first time.For her part, she tweeted that the European Commission was "intensively engaging for finding solutions" on both the fishing row and another linked row with Brussels over the Brexit pact for Northern Ireland.During talks on the sidelines of the G20 in Rome, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson "raised his concerns about the rhetoric from the French government in recent days over the issue of fishing licences", his office said.Johnson "stressed that the French threats are completely unjustified and do not appear to be compatible" with a pact governing Britain's divorce from the European Union.France is incensed that Britain and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey have not issued some French boats licences to fish in their waters post-Brexit.France has warned that unless licences are approved it will ban UK boats from unloading their catches at French ports from next week and impose checks on all products brought to France from Britain.Johnson earlier said that, in response to the deal, he has not ruled out invoking an as-yet untested dispute settlement process allowed under the terms of Britain's divorce from the European Union."No of course not, I don't rule that out," Johnson told Sky News in Rome, after Britain on Friday warned it may implement new checks on all EU fishing boats.However, Johnson has also emphasised his close personal ties with French President Emmanuel Macron -- and their body language at the G20 suggested friendly relations.At a side meeting Saturday on Iran with the US and German leaders, Johnson and Macron exchanged friendly pats on the back.As they arrived for the leaders' "family photo" at the start of the summit, Johnson gave Macron a mock-combative fist bump, although they did not appear to speak to one another.A brief tete-a-tete is intended at some point over the weekend."What I think everybody wants to see is cooperation between the European allies and Emmanuel Macron," Johnson said.Meanwhile, Macron said that Britain's "credibility" was on the line in the dispute, accusing London of ignoring the Brexit deal agreed after years of tortuous negotiations."When you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility," he told the Financial Times.In his Sky interview, Johnson retorted: "If there is a (French) breach of the treaty or we think there is a breach of the treaty, then we will do what is necessary to protect British interests."But in the buildup to COP26, he stressed that the fishing dispute "is quite frankly small beer, trivial, by comparison with the threat to humanity that we face".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-could-trigger-eu-dispute-over-french-fish-row-boris-johnson-101635607081029.html

Speaking at the 16th Group of 20 Leaders' Summit via a video link, Xi proposed a global vaccine cooperation initiative that included suggestions like encouraging vaccine companies to transfer technology to developing countries.“Treat all kinds of vaccines fairly, and promote mutual recognition of vaccines based on the World Health Organization's vaccine emergency use list,” Xinhua quoted the Chinese president as saying.Xi said that China has already provided over 1.6 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to more than 100 countries and international organisations and is working with 16 countries for joint vaccine production. He called for increasing the supply of vaccines to developing countries and implementing the global vaccination target set by the UN health agency.“China is willing to work with all parties to improve the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries and make positive contributions in building a global vaccine defence line,” Xi added.Of the all Covid-19 vaccines China has developed, two of them, one from Sinovac Biotech and one from Sinopharm, have been included in the WHO's emergency use list. The other Covid-19 vaccines approved for use by WHO are Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford/AstraZeneca AZD1222, Covishield, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Ad26.COV2.S.While China has administered Covid shots to about 1.07 billion of its 1.41 billion population, according to the national health commission (NHC) data, several provinces have reported fresh virus outbreaks.On Friday, Mainland China reported 59 new local cases of infection, its highest number of daily new cases since September 16.

Almost every other nationality, barring some like those holding Pakistani passports, can apply for an e-visa, Canadians still don’t have that option.A senior Indian official told the Hindustan Times the e-visa “suspension remains in place for Canadians in response to the testing restrictions” that Canada continues to subject travellers from India to. Canadian transport minister Omar Alghabra made a series of announcements on Friday in which he said that it was mandatory to be fully vaccinated to board a flight from Canada starting from October 30. He did not mention any relaxations for passengers arriving by air from India.For those taking direct flights, they still only have the option of getting a mandatory negative RT-PCR test result from a single laboratory at the international airport in Delhi before being allowed to board for a Canada flight. For those flying via a third country, the stipulation is that they will have to obtain the necessary negative result at the point of departure, which is the country where the connecting flight is leaving from.These restrictions came into place in September, even as Canada allowed direct flights from India, which had been suspended in April due to concerns over the surge in Delta-driven coronavirus cases in India. While that ban was finally lifted on September 27, the Canadian Government put in place the restrictive testing regimen.New Delhi has retaliated to the developments by retaining the e-visa suspension for Canada even as discussions continue over relaxations, including expanding the list of testing centres in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-tit-for-tat-move-india-retains-e-visa-suspension-for-canadians-101635596999854.html

Hafiz Mohibullah, Mullah Ghulam Rasool and Mullah Muhammad Abbas took charge of the consulates in Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi.This move by the Pakistan government to grant visas to the appointed “diplomats” comes despite the nation not recognising the Taliban as the legitimate government in Afghanistan.Sardar Muhammad Shokaib effectively is now the charge d’affaires in Islamabad.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has been without an ambassador since July. The former envoy under the government led by former PM Ashraf Ghani, Najibullah Alikhil, left because of controversy due to alleged abduction of his daughter Silsila Alikhil, news agency PTI reported.A report by Voice of America said that Shokaib was an ethnic Pashtun from Zabul province who served in the information and cultural department in southern Kandahar and was also part of a Taliban magazine. He also worked as a Taliban spokesman under the name of Qari Yousaf Ahmadi and was arrested in Pakistan. He was a resident of Peshawar for several years, the report highlighted.Pakistan said the appointment of the Taliban-appointed envoys was an ‘administrative matter’. “With regard to the appointment of new staff in the Afghan embassy, this is an administrative matter and is meant to enable the embassy to perform its functions, primarily the consular functions as you are aware there are millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and there are visa issues as well,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said while trying to play down the appointments.Most world leaders are sceptical about the Taliban fulfilling the promises it made when it took over Kabul forcing the Ashraf Ghani-led out.

The convict purportedly wrote a letter expressing his apprehension on the extension given to General Bajwa and asked for his resignation, ANI reported, citing The News International report which in turn relied on BBC Urdu Service.The military court convicted Hassan Askari, son of Maj Gen (R) Zafar Mehdi Askari, under treason charges for his criticism over the Pakistan Army chief's extension. Askari is a computer engineer and he reportedly wrote the letter in September last year.Askari was represented by an officer deputed by the Pakistan military court in a trial conducted in July this year, according to The News. During the trial, his father complained he was facing difficulties in meeting his son who was lodged at the high-security prison in Sahiwal.In January, the case was taken up by Islamabad high court which directed holding the treason trial in camera.According to a report by news agency PTI, there was no official announcement about the trial and the sentence, and the details came out in a petition recently filed by the father of the convict with the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court.In his plea, the father has challenged the sentence, asserting that his son was not provided a lawyer of his choice during the trial.

30-10-2021||World||China in dark over what damaged US nuclear submarine in South China Sea: Report||The Chinese military is still in the dark over what damaged the US nuclear submarine when it was on the prowl in the disputed South China Sea early this month, while satellite photos of the moored vessel showed that the sub may have had a head-on collision, rendering it “deaf and blind”, according to a media report on Saturday.A recent satellite image suggests that the damage to the American submarine, the USS Connecticut may have been caused by a head-on collision with a pint-sized submerged object in the South China Sea (SCS), according to Chinese military experts.The incident four weeks ago may have occurred in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands in the SCS controlled by China, indicating the Chinese Navy could have detected the American sub on its way to Guam but was not aware of its damaged condition, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.Earlier this month, media reports said that the US nuclear-powered submarine was damaged after it struck an object underwater in the SCS.Eleven sailors on board the USS Connecticut were injured in the accident. None of the injuries were life-threatening, an announcement by the US Pacific Fleet said.It is unclear what the Seawolf-class submarine may have hit as the US Navy’s announcement of the accident days later did not give further details such as the extent of the damage, what the sub had collided with or the specific location.Reacting to the incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on October 8 that “China is severely concerned about this accident” and asked the Pentagon to provide an explanation.“The US as the side involved in this incident should inform the relevant details including the location, purpose of this navigation, details of the accident and what did the submarine run into and whether any nuclear leakage has taken place and whether local maritime environment was harmed,” he had asked.After the incident, the submarine managed to travel to the US Navy’s base in Guam and the first publicly available image of the moored vessel showed that the sonar dome of the Seawolf-class sub’s nose had been taken out, suggesting its bow sonar system was damaged in the incident on October 2, the Post report said.The satellite photos of the submarine USS Connecticut were captured by the American private Earth imaging company Planet Labs on October 20, and published by American technology and military site The Drive.“It’s almost certain that the USS Connecticut was hit in a head-on collision that cracked its sonar dome, the most important sensor system, meaning the sub became effectively blind and deaf underwater and had to escape immediately,” Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Tong said.Twelve days earlier, Beijing-based maritime think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, posted a low-resolution satellite image on Twitter and said a suspected Seawolf-class submarine had been spotted sailing 43 nautical miles (80 kms) southeast of Paracel Island on October 3, the day after the apparent collision.Paracel Island of the SCS is called Xisha islands by China.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.Beijing is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.The US has been periodically sending its naval and air patrols through the SCS, challenging China’s claims of sovereignty over the area and also to assert the freedom of navigation.Cao Yanzhong, a researcher with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Science has claimed that the US warships and planes carried out over 2,000 close spying missions aimed at China this year as rivalry between the two countries heightened.The targets of these missions included Chinese controlled islands and reefs in the SCS as well as the coastal area of the Chinese mainland, Cao told the 10th Xiangshan forum, an annual Chinese military conference recently.Wong further said that information suggested that the collusion of the US submarine could have happened close to the exclusive economic zone claimed by China around the disputed islands, even if the US did not recognise such a zone when conducting freedom of navigation operations in what it says are international waters.“The collision may have happened less than 43 nautical miles from the Paracels, and a sub-operation is much more sensitive than those of surface vessels, pushing the US Navy to keep a low profile and avoid alerting their Chinese counterparts.“The fact that the American sub could stay underwater for so long suggests that the damage was not serious,” Wong told the Post.The resource-rich South China Sea is the world’s busiest waterway for military and commercial vessels. Beijing is building a massive underwater observation network, dubbed the “underwater Great Wall”, for maritime science and national security applications.Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie said that the Chinese Navy may have been aware of the American sub’s route through the region but did not establish where the incident occurred and just let it pass.The damage could have been caused by something the size of an underwater drone, rather than another submarine, the expert said.“This accident reminded the People’s Liberation Army Navy to further beef up China’s underwater surveillance capability, as well as its defensive strength in the region,” Li added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-dark-over-what-damaged-us-nuclear-submarine-in-south-china-sea-report-101635585573555.html

The government, meanwhile, assured that more vulnerable LGBT+ people from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the UK in the coming months.“Britain is a fierce champion of freedom and the right of all people to be themselves and love who they want free from persecution. We played a key role getting these people out and will continue to do all we can to help at-risk Afghans leave the country,” UK foreign minister Truss was quoted as saying by the official statement on Saturday.Safe houses are being established for Afghans who arrived on Friday, Sebastian Rocca, chief executive of Micro Rainbow, a charity supporting LGBT+ refugees, told Reuters.British gay rights group Stonewall and Canada’s Rainbow Railroad were a part of the evacuation efforts.“However, our work is not yet done. We will continue advocating for international support for LGBTQ+ Afghans, including those that remain in Afghanistan, and we will also continue to work with the UK Government to ensure that the LGBTQ+ Afghans who arrive in the UK are given the support they need to thrive,” Nancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, said.Under the UK’s Operation Pitting, which ended in late August, the government has assisted more than 1,300 people, including Afghan civilians and British nationals, to leave Afghanistan, the official also said.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-evacuates-first-group-of-lgbt-afghans-since-taliban-s-takeover-101635573945093.html
30-10-2021||World||US watchdog says Pentagon, State Dept concealing Afghanistan data||A US government watchdog on Friday accused the State Department and Pentagon of suppressing information that lawmakers and the public need to understand the collapse of Afghanistan's former government and military and the chaotic US troop pullout."The full picture of what happened in August - and all the warning signs that could have predicted the outcome - will only be revealed if the information that the departments of Defense and State have already restricted from public release is made available," said John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR).A State Department spokesperson said the department had requested "some reports be temporarily removed to redact identifying information from public records and protect the identities of Afghans and Afghan partner organizations" due to security concerns about the evacuation effort."The identifying information are the only details intended to be shielded," the spokesperson said, adding that SIGAR has the authority to restore the reports.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Addressing reporters, Sopko said that after the Taliban seized Kabul, the State Department asked him to temporarily suspend online access to certain reports he issued to ensure the safety of US-affiliated Afghans.The department "was never able to describe any specific threats to individuals that were supposedly contained in our reports," said Sopko, who added he "reluctantly" barred access to the documents.The State Department, he continued, recently sought redactions of some 2,400 items remaining on SIGAR's website.Some requests were "bizarre," such as excising former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's name from reports, Sopko said.After a review, his agency found only four items meriting redaction, and left the remainder accessible.Noting that Congress tasked him with investigating the collapse of the US-backed Afghan government and military, he said the Pentagon has since 2015 barred from public release a range of data purportedly at the former Ghani government's request.Most of that information, including casualty data and unit strengths, was "all you needed to know to determine whether the Afghan security forces were a real fighting force or a house of cards," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-watchdog-says-pentagon-state-dept-concealing-afghanistan-data-101635568569388.html

30-10-2021||World||12 states sue Biden administration over Covid-19 vaccine rule||Eleven states filed lawsuits Friday to stop President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors, arguing that the requirement violates federal law.Attorneys general from Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming signed on to the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court in Missouri.The states asked a federal judge to block Biden’s requirement that all employees of federal contractors be vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that the mandate violates federal procurement law and is an overreach of federal power.“If the federal government attempts to unconstitutionally exert its will and force federal contractors to mandate vaccinations, the workforce and businesses could be decimated, further exacerbating the supply chain and workforce crises,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, said in a statement. "The federal government should not be mandating vaccinations, and that’s why we filed suit today – to halt this illegal, unconstitutional action.”New Hampshire’s Republican Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that COVID vaccines are safe, effective and encouraged but that the benefits “do not justify violating the law."That lawsuit, along with one filed Friday by Texas and Thursday by Florida, brings to 12 the number of states challenging the Biden administration mandate in three federal courts.Biden has argued that sweeping vaccine mandates will help end the deadly pandemic, but Republicans nationwide have opposed the vaccination requirements and have threatened to bring similar legal challenges.Texas filed a similar lawsuit Friday in a federal district court in a federal court in Galveston, Texas, seeking to block enforcement of the mandate.“The Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed its disdain for Americans who choose not to get a vaccine, and it has committed repeated and abusive federal overreach to force upon Americans something they do not want,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, in a statement. “The federal government does not have the ability to strip individuals of their choice to get a vaccine or not. If the President thinks his patience is wearing thin, he is clearly underestimating the lack of patience from Texans whose rights he is infringing.”Another group of states led by Georgia announced Friday that they would file a similar federal lawsuit in that state to try to block the contractor requirements. Other states that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said are joining the case include Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, West Virginia and Utah, as well as South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.The suit had not been filed when it was announced, and Georgia officials did not immediately provide a copy of the complaint.“We will not allow the Biden administration to circumvent the law or force hardworking Georgians to choose between their livelihood or this vaccine,” Kemp, a Republican, said in a statement.The Democratic Party of Georgia called the lawsuit a “dangerous political stunt.”Florida filed a separate lawsuit against the federal mandate on Thursday. That lawsuit also alleged the president doesn’t have the authority to issue the rule and that it violates procurement law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-states-sue-biden-administration-over-covid-19-vaccine-rule-101635565225150.html
30-10-2021||World||US spy agencies say they may never be able to identify Covid-19 origins||US intelligence agencies said on Friday that they may never be able to identify the origins of Covid-19, as they released a new, more detailed version of their review of whether the coronavirus came from an animal-to-human transmission or leaked from a lab.The Office of the US Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a declassified report that a natural origin and a lab leak are both plausible hypotheses for how SARS-COV-2 first infected humans. But it said analysts disagree on which is more likely or whether any definitive assessment can be made at all.The report also dismissed suggestions that the coronavirus originated as a bioweapon, saying proponents of this theory "do not have direct access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology" and have been accused of spreading disinformation.The report issued on Friday is an update of a 90-day review that President Joe Biden's administration released in August, amid intense political infighting over how much to blame China for the effects of the global pandemic rather than governments that may not have moved quickly enough to protect citizens.China responded on Friday by criticizing the report."The US moves of relying on its intelligence apparatus instead of scientists to trace the origins of Covid-19 is a complete political farce," Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement."... It will only undermine science-based origins study and hinder the global effort of finding the source of the virus," the statement said.Former Republican President Donald Trump - who lost his bid for re-election as the deadly pandemic ravaged the US economy - and many of his supporters referred to Covid-19 as the "China virus."Some US spy agencies had strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. But there has been little corroboration and over recent months the virus has spread widely and naturally among wild animals.The ODNI report said four US spy agencies and a multi-agency body have "low confidence" that Covid-19 originated with an infected animal or a related virus.But one agency said it had "moderate confidence" that the first human Covid-19 infection most likely was the result of a laboratory accident, probably involving experimentation or animal handling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.US spy agencies believe they will not be able to produce a more definitive explanation for the origin of Covid-19 without new information demonstrating that the virus took a specific pathway from animals to humans or that a Wuhan laboratory was handling the virus or a related virus before Covid-19 surfaced.The report said US agencies and the global scientific community lacked "clinical samples or a complete understanding of epidemiological data from the earliest Covid-19 cases" and said it could revisit this inconclusive finding if more evidence surfaces.China has faced international criticism for failing to cooperate more fully in investigations of Covid's origins.The embassy statement also dismissed that criticism."We have been supporting science-based efforts on origins tracing, and will continue to stay actively engaged. That said, we firmly oppose attempts to politicize this issue," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-spy-agencies-say-they-may-never-be-able-to-identify-covid-19-origins-101635563447918.html
30-10-2021||World||Prince Andrew never sexually assaulted American, says lawyer||Lawyers for Prince Andrew asked a New York judge Friday to throw out a lawsuit accusing the prince of sexually abusing an American when she was 17, saying the prince “never sexually abused or assaulted” the plaintiff.In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, an attorney for Andrew said the plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, may well be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of financier Jeffrey Epstein.“However, and without diminishing the harm suffered as a result of Epstein’s alleged misconduct, Prince Andrew never sexually abused or assaulted Giuffre. He unequivocally denies Giuffre’s false allegations against him,” according to arguments signed by attorney Andrew Brettler.Brettler asked that the lawsuit be thrown out or that lawyers for Giuffre be required to refile the lawsuit with a more definitive statement of her allegations.“Accusing a member of the world’s best known royal family of serious misconduct has helped Giuffre create a media frenzy online and in the traditional press. It is unfortunate, but undeniable, that sensationalism and innuendo have prevailed over the truth,” the filing said.“Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense and at the expense of those closest to him. Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre does not justify her public campaign against Prince Andrew,” the written arguments said.The submission also challenged a temporary New York state law that has since expired that let survivors of sex abuse incurred during childhood to sue their alleged abusers no matter how much time had passed.Giuffre claimed in her August lawsuit that the prince abused her on multiple occasions in 2001. Andrew has said even before the court papers were filed Friday that he never had sex with her.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they choose to come forward publicly, as Giuffre has.An attorney for Giuffre, Sigrid McCawley, called Andrew's request to dismiss the lawsuit “outrageous" and credited Giuffre for helping to reveal Epstein's alleged sex trafficking that they say Andrew participated in.On the subject of money, McCawley said, "the only party to this litigation using money to his benefit is Prince Andrew."Brettler, who has called the lawsuit “baseless,” had included in the arguments a copy of a 2009 settlement agreement that he believes protects his client from being sued.According to the arguments on Andrew’s behalf, Giuffre’s 2009 settlement of sex trafficking and sexual abuse claims against Epstein included a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities.“To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit -- or lack thereof -- to any such claims,” the papers said.The pages of the settlement reached between Giuffre and Epstein were blacked out when they were included in Friday’s submission as “Exhibit A.” The financier was found dead at age 66 in his cell in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial at a New York federal jail. His death was ruled a suicide.Earlier this week, Brettler said in a written submission to the judge that the agreement “releases Prince Andrew and others from any purported liability arising from the claims Ms. Giuffre asserted against Prince Andrew here.”When he requested that the documents be filed under seal, Brettler said neither he nor lawyers for Giuffre believed that it was necessary to keep the 2009 settlement agreement secret except for the fact that it is under seal in another civil litigation in Manhattan federal court.A hearing in the case is scheduled for next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-never-sexually-assaulted-american-says-lawyer-101635563110433.html

This campaign started on October 16 in 14 Provinces. It started in the Southern region a day later," Al-Janabi said,He further stated that "In the remaining provinces, it will start in the next 2 -3 days. Currently, almost 40,000 people are being vaccinated daily. This massive campaign will continue until we utilize 1.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson available in stock."Afghanistan has received about 5.25 million doses of different types of vaccines both through Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility and bilateral donations, he added."According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 155,985 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 7,257 deaths in Afghanistan. As of October 23, a total of 2,925,490 vaccine doses have been administered," Sputnik reported citing the Al-Janabi as saying.The Taliban took over Afghanistan in mid-August and the US military ended its 20 years of military presence in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-40-000-people-inoculated-daily-against-covid-19-in-afghanistan-101635561296123.html
30-10-2021||World||US clears Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine was cleared by US regulators for children ages 5 to 11, a long-awaited pandemic milestone that opens a new phase of the immunization campaign. The emergency authorisation, announced on Friday in a statement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), brings the US a step closer to shots being administered at schools, pediatricians’ offices, and pharmacies around the country. The formulation for young kids is one-third the dose of the adult shot.Before youngsters can begin to receive the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization advisory committee will also meet to make more specific recommendations about who should get it and how to administer it. The panel is currently scheduled to convene on Nov. 2 and 3. The CDC director Rochelle Walensky will then need to sign off on the advisers’ guidance.The FDA’s action on Friday allows shipments of the doses to begin -- the first time the US has distributed anything other than the regular Pfizer dose for teens and adults. The shipments would position the shots at pediatricians’ offices, pharmacies, and other locations across the country so that inoculations can begin promptly after any CDC clearance.“Vaccinating younger children against Covid-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,” acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock said in the statement. “Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.”Pfizer shares rose 1.3 per cent at the close in New York. BioNTech’s American depositary receipts lost 1.9 per cent. Officials at hospitals and clinics have been discussing the rollout for children. In Washington, for example, health officials plan to make newly authorized doses for kids available at clinics and pharmacies such as those of CVS Health Corp. and Walmart Inc. The city will also host pop-up clinics at elementary schools and Children’s National Hospital plans to distribute the shots to children at its eight primary care locations and via a mobile unit canvassing the community.New York’s Westchester Medical Center has served as a coordinator for the distribution of vaccines throughout the Hudson Valley. Michael Gewitz, physician-in-chief at the center’s Maria Fareri Children’s Hospital, said the process of vaccinating 5- to 11-year-olds will be different from earlier campaigns. That means they’ll focus vaccination efforts on pediatricians’ offices in their network as well as at a small vaccine site on the medical center’s campus.“For the children in the 5-to-11 age bracket, we want to administer it in a more friendly, personal environment,” Gewitz said. “We think it will be a better environment for children, especially young children.”CDC ExpertsMany doctors are looking to hear what the experts on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend for the vaccine’s use, said Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program.“I think the desire is for pediatricians to begin having those conversations with families, answering questions that the parents might have, and then waiting for what the ACIP provides guidance on next week,” said Creech, who’s helped conduct a trial of Moderna Inc.’s Covid vaccine in children.Megan Ranney’s son Clark is anxiously awaiting his shot. Her 10-year-old is jealous of an elder sister who’s already been vaccinated and can do more socializing, said Ranney, an emergency physician and researcher at Brown University in Rhode Island.Sleepover Key“Our family rule is you could do sleepovers the summer going into third grade, and he missed that because of Covid,” she said. “He’s never done a sleepover and he really wants to.” She didn’t make the decision on immunization lightly, she said, given the risk of a rare form of heart inflammation called myocarditis that’s associated with the vaccine in some adults, particularly males. The data show the shot is safe, she said.“The risk of myocarditis from the vaccine, even for boys, is lower than the risk of myocarditis from Covid itself,” she said. “Covid is one of the top 10 leading causes of death this year in children. I do a lot of things to protect my kids from injury and illness that are less common than Covid. This seems like a no-brainer.”President Joe Biden’s administration has said they have enough vaccines for all 28 million kids in the 5 to 11 age group, and they’re ready to ship the shots.“Upon FDA authorization of the vaccine, millions of doses will be shipped immediately to tens of thousands of pediatricians, family doctors, children’s hospitals, community health centers, rural health clinics, and pharmacies –– providers parents and kids know and trust,” Jeff Zients, Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, said Wednesday at a press briefing. “We will be ready immediately following FDA and CDC’s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly, easily, and conveniently.”The recent surge in infections fueled by the delta variant and the return of in-person learning have increased calls for younger children to be immunized. While FDA advisers unanimously recommended approval of the shot, some expressed concern about a lack of data on side effects, the prevalence of Covid in children, and other issues.  The advisers supported the vaccine in part because so many children with Covid don’t show risk factors before catching the disease, said Peter Marks, head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, during a media briefing following the announcement.“Trying to limit it to just a high-risk group could create issues, including issues of making sure that the general population was protected,” he said. It may be a few months until authorities consider shots for children under age 5, Marks said. “As we get down to younger children the benefit-risk gets to be even more of a careful consideration because the youngest children are affected the least directly in terms of severe Covid-19,” he said. The US has been focusing on ways to bolster its defenses and prevent another virus surge. Just last week, the FDA paved the way for millions of recipients of Moderna Inc. and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to receive their Covid boosters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-aged-5-to-11-101635560978874.html

A report claimed that Beijing is making billions of dollars on the black market by forcibly harvesting the organs of its vulnerable minorities – an alarming allegation that, if proved true, would expectedly lead to a call for action from the international community.Also Read | No food, only bottlecaps to moisten lips: Ex-Chinese cop reveals Uyghur travel woes and moreThe recent report regarding the alleged Uyghur abuses was featured, according to the ANI news agency, in the Herald Sun – a morning tabloid newspaper based in Australia's Melbourne. As per the agency, the report contains many gruesome details about how a “healthy liver fetches around USD 160,000” in the organ shacks of the black market, and that this trade churns out an annual turnover of “at least USD 1 billion” for China.Notably, this is not the first time that allegations have been raised regarding organ harvesting in the detention centres of China. In June earlier this year, the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) said that its human rights experts were “extremely alarmed” by reports of “alleged ‘organ harvesting’ targeting minorities, including Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims and Christians, in detention in China.”The UN human rights experts said they have received credible information that detainees from ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities may be forcibly subjected to blood tests and organ examinations such as ultrasound and X-rays, without their informed consent; while other prisoners are not required to undergo such examinations. The results of the examinations are reportedly registered in a database of living organ sources that facilitates organ allocation.In its recent report, the Herald Sun daily elaborated on the procedures, including forced organ harvesting and sterilisation, that the Uyghur and other minorities are allegedly subjected to in China. The hospitals that carry out the organ transplant, the report said, are reportedly found not too far away from the detention centres. It revealed that the number of performed operations in the hospitals and the short waiting lists indicate there has been “forced organ harvesting” for a very long time on a large scale.Nearly 80,000 Uyghurs were trafficked to factories across the country between 2017 and 2019, the newspaper reported, citing a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). “In factories far away from home, they typically live in segregated dormitories, undergo organised Mandarin and ideological training outside working hours, are subject to constant surveillance, and are forbidden from participating in religious observances,” the ASPI report stated.Also Read | China: CPC leader sanctioned for violations in Xinjiang takes charge of TibetCiting an investigation published in the Taiwan News, the newspaper reported that the assets worth $84 billion were seized from the Uyghurs in recent years, real estate comprising the majority of such assets.According to the allegations received by the United Nations earlier this year, the most common organs removed from the prisoners are reportedly hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers. "This form of trafficking with a medical nature allegedly involves health sector professionals, including surgeons, anaesthetists and other medical specialists,” the UNHCR noted.UN human rights experts, however, pointed out the issue to the Chinese government in 2006 and 2007. The government, in turn, responded with statements that lacked data such as waiting times for organ allocation or information on the sources of organs. “In this context, the lack of available data and information-sharing systems are obstacles to the successful identification and protection of victims of trafficking and effective investigation and prosecution of traffickers,” the UN said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liver-on-sale-for-160k-uyghur-organs-harvested-in-china-s-black-markets-101635556908589.html
30-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Needle-free vaccine patches are on the way, say manufacturers||Effective vaccines, without a needle: Since the start of the Covid pandemic, researchers have doubled down on efforts to create patches that deliver life-saving drugs painlessly to the skin, a development that could revolutionize medicine.The technique could help save children's tears at doctors' offices, and help people who have a phobia of syringes.Beyond that, skin patches could assist with distribution efforts, because they don't have cold-chain requirements -- and might even heighten vaccine efficacy.A new mouse study in the area, published in the journal Science Advances, showed promising results.The Australian-US team used patches measuring one square centimeter that was dotted with more than 5,000 microscopic spikes, "so tiny you can't actually see them," David Muller, a virologist at the University of Queensland and co-author of the paper, told AFP.These tips have been coated with an experimental vaccine, and the patch is clicked on with an applicator that resembles a hockey puck. "It's like you get a good flick on the skin," said Muller.The researchers used a so-called “subunit” vaccine that reproduces the spikes that dot the surface of the coronavirus.Mice were injected either via the patch over the course of two minutes or with a syringe.The immune systems of those who got the patch produced high levels of neutralising antibodies after two doses, including in their lungs, vital to stopping Covid-19, and the patches outperformed syringes.The researchers also found that a sub-group of mice, who were given only one dose of vaccine containing an additional substance called an adjuvant used to spur immune response, "didn't get sick at all," said Muller.Easy to applyWhat makes them more effective?Vaccines are normally injected into our muscles, but muscle tissue doesn't contain very many immune cells needed to react to the drug, explained Muller.In addition, the tiny spikes cause localized skin death, which alerts the body to a problem and triggers a greater immune response.For the scientist, the logistical advantages couldn't be clearer.First, when dry-coated on a patch, the vaccine is stable for at least 30 days at 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and one week at 40C (104F), compared to a few hours at room temperature for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.This offers a major advantage, particularly for developing countries.Second, "it's very simple to use," said Muller. "You don't necessarily need highly trained medical professionals to deliver it."Burak Ozdoganlar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in the US city of Pittsburgh, has also been working on the technology since 2007.He sees yet another advantage: "Less amount of vaccine delivered precisely to the skin can activate an immune response similar to intramuscular injection," he told AFP. It's an important factor as the developing world struggles to procure enough Covid vaccines.Ozdoganlar can produce around 300-400 patches a day in his lab but hasn't been able to test them out on mRNA vaccines, which have come to the fore during the pandemic, because he hasn't been authorized by Pfizer or Moderna.‘The future’The patch used in the study published on Friday was made by Australian company Vaxxas, which is the furthest along. Human trials are planned from April.Two other American companies are also part of the race: Micron Biomedical and Vaxess.The latter, founded in 2013 and based in Massachusetts, is working on a slightly different type of patch, with microneedles that dissolve in the skin.They say this approach has the benefit of requiring fewer spikes per patch – just 121 – made of a protein polymer that is biocompatible.“We're working on a seasonal Covid-19 and flu combination product that will be mailed directly to patients' homes, for self-administration,” CEO Michael Schrader told AFP.The Covid vaccine they are using is produced by the company Medigen, already authorized in Taiwan.Vaxess has just opened a factory near Boston, with funding from the US National Institutes for Health. They aim to produce enough patches to vaccinate 2,000 to 3,000 people in clinical trials, which are to be launched next summer.The main challenge right now is production, with no manufacturers yet able to make enough patches en masse.“If you want to launch a vaccine you have to produce hundreds of millions,” said Schrader. “We do not have that scale as of today – no one really has that scale.”But the pandemic has given a push to the nascent industry, which is now attracting more investors, he added.“This is the future, in my opinion, it is inevitable,” said Schrader. “I think you're going to see over the next 10 years, this (will) pretty dramatically reshape the way that we get vaccines around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-needle-free-vaccine-patches-are-on-the-way-say-manufacturers-101635553513807.html

They take double benefits,” RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale informed at a press conference in Karnataka’s Dharwad.Hosabale further stated that the opposition to anti-conversion laws by the members of the minority community is an “open secret.” “Increasing the number by any methods, fraudulent or other such methods cannot be accepted,” he added, while speaking at the conclusion of the three-day Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM) meeting of the RSS in the southern state.Also Read | Marriage being used for unlawful conversion: UPThe Sangh top leader claimed that over 10 Indian states have passed anti-conversion bills in India. He alleged that the Congress government led by chief minister Vidarbha Singh had passed the bill in Himachal Pradesh when the party was in power before the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruling dispensation. “In Arunachal Pradesh, it was the Congress government who did it (passed an anti-conversion bill). Gegong Apang was the chief minister,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.Drawing reference to former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Hosabale said that the BJP leader had urged to initiate a national debate on religious conversion. The RSS general secretary also stated that while every individual has the liberty to change their religion, “what is happening today is not that.”Also Read | BJP government in Arunachal Pradesh plans to repeal anti-conversion lawNotably, three BJP-ruled states in the country – Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, have passed anti-conversion laws.

Bengaluru Archbishop recently termed the bill to be “unnecessary” and stated that it will disrupt the religious harmony in the state.However, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) had in February this year clarified in a response at the Parliament that the central government doesn’t plan to impose a nationwide anti-conversion law.The Supreme Court in April had also quashed a plea seeking for a stringent law to regulate religious conversion in India, saying such a direction is “very harmful” and that every adult is free to choose their desired faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disclose-if-you-ve-converted-can-t-take-double-benefits-rss-101635617260275.html
30-10-2021||India||India, Italy to collaborate on green hydrogen, gas sector||Rome/New Delhi India and Italy have agreed to explore development of green hydrogen, setting up renewable energy corridors, and joint projects in the natural gas sector as the two nations sought to strengthen partnership in energy transition.A joint statement issued after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held the first in-person meeting with his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rome, said the two leaders agreed to encourage joint investments of Indian and Italian companies in energy transition-related fields.They agreed to “initiate a dialogue to support the development and deployment of green hydrogen and related technologies in India” as well as to “consider working together to support a large size green corridor project in India to capitalize on India’s target to produce and integrate 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.” The two leaders also agreed to “encourage Italian and Indian companies to develop joint projects in natural gas sector, technological innovation for decarbonisation, smart cities and other specific domains (i.e.: electrification of urban public transport).” India set an ambitious target of building capacity to generate 450 gigawatts of electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind and more than double the share of natural gas in its energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 as its transitions to a low carbon emitting economy. It is also looking at scaling up hydrogen production from all sources, particularly green hydrogen as part of its energy transition pathway.The joint statement said a joint working Group established by the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the field of Energy, signed in Delhi on October 30, 2017, will be tasked to explore cooperation in areas such as smart cities; mobility, smart-grids. The group will also explore cooperation in electricity distribution and storage solutions; gas transportation and promoting natural gas as a bridge fuel; integrated waste management (waste-to-wealth); and green energies (green hydrogen; CNG & LNG; bio-methane; bio-refinery; second-generation bio-ethanol; castor oil; bio-oil –waste to fuel).The two leaders also agreed to “share useful information and experiences especially in the field of policy and regulatory framework, including possible means to facilitate the transition to cleaner and commercially viable fuels/technologies, long-term grid planning, incentivizing schemes for renewables and efficiency measures, as well as with regard to financial instruments for accelerating clean energy transition.” They acknowledged significant progress in bilateral relations since the adoption of the Action Plan for an enhanced Partnership between India and Italy (2020-2024) on November 6, 2020. They expressed their resolve to strengthen cooperation in the strategic sectors addressed by the Action Plan, including the cross-cutting issue of accelerating the clean energy transition to fight climate change, central to both the G20 Leaders Summit in Rome and the COP26 in Glasgow.They also recalled the India-EU Leaders’ Meeting held in Porto on May 8, 2021, where the European Union and India highlighted the urgency of addressing the interdependent challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Th two leaders agreed to deepen cooperation for accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, including deployment of innovative renewable technologies such as offshore wind energy and exploiting the potential of green hydrogen, promoting energy efficiency, developing smart grids and storage technologies, modernizing the electricity market.“In addition, both sides agreed on the utmost importance of cost effective integration of a growing amount of renewable energy into their respective power systems, as a key asset for an effective clean transition that generates jobs, GDP growth, reinforces universal energy access while eradicating energy poverty,” it said. “In this perspective, the two Prime Ministers appreciated India’s resolve to deploy 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 as well as Italy’s prompt ratification and active support to the International Solar Alliance, and agreed to launch a bilateral strategic partnership in the domain of energy transition.” Such a partnership could build on existing bilateral mechanisms, including by giving new impetus to the cooperation on renewable energy and sustainable development between the Italian Ministry of Ecological Transition and its Indian counterparts, namely Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Power and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-italy-to-collaborate-on-green-hydrogen-gas-sector-101635616743069.html

The deceased officer was a lieutenant while the soldier was a sepoy.“An officer and a soldier were critically injured in a mysterious explosion along the LoC around 4.30 pm in Kalal area of Nowshera. They were evacuated to Command Hospital in Udhampur in a helicopter but succumbed to their injuries,” said officials familiar with the matter.They were on a patrol near a forward post along the LoC when the blast took place, said people cited above.The deceased have been identified as Lieutenant Rishi Kumar and Sepoy Manjit Singh“GOC #WhiteKnight_IA and all ranks salute bravehearts Lt Rishi Kumar and Sep Manjit Singh, who made the supreme sacrifice in line of duty along the Line of Control in Naushera sector on 30 Oct 21 and offer deep condolences to their families,” the White Knight Corps tweeted.“On 30 Oct 2021, during an area domination patrol in Naushera Sector, District Rajouri (J&K), a mine blast occurred wherein two Indian Army soldiers suffered critical injuries and later succumbed to their injuries. Another soldier who received injuries was evacuated and is under treatment,” the Army said in a statement.With two more deaths, the army has lost a total of 11 soldiers, including three officers in October, in the twin districts of Rajouri and Poonch.Before India and Pakistan renewed the mutually brokered ceasefire pact on February 25, rogue elements in connivance with Pak Army and Pak Rangers used to plant IEDs on the Indian side of 744 km-long LoC and 200 km-long international border (IB) to inflict casualties on the Indian forces.On February 16, 2019, an army Major was killed and a soldier was injured in a similar mine blast along the Line of Control (LoC) in the Nowshera sector.Meanwhile, search operation in the Nar Khas forests near Bhata Dhurian in Poonch district entered its 20th day on Saturday.However, success continues to elude the security forces as terrorists hiding in the dense jungle are well trained in guerilla warfare tactics, using natural caves and poor visibility to their advantage.An arrested member of the terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was killed and three security personnel were injured when terrorists opened fire on a search team of the army and police in the same forests on Sunday.A total of nine soldiers, including two JCOs and an arrested terrorist, who was taken to the encounter site for identification of a hideout, have died in the ongoing operation.The operation in the forest areas in the twin border districts began on October 11 when terrorists ambushed a search party killing five soldiers including a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) in Surankote forest of Poonch.On October 14, four soldiers, including a JCO, were killed by the terrorists in Nar Khas forest in another gunfight.Drones and helicopters have been pressed into service to assist the marching troops, which includes para-commandos, in the jungle.Army chief General MM Naravane also visited the encounter site. According to DGP Dilbag Singh, two groups of terrorists came from across the Line of Control through the Rajouri-Poonch area and they are embedded somewhere in the jungle area.“Going by their sighting at three places and cross-fire between them and us at two places, I guess their number is 5 to 7,” he told a TV channel recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-army-personnel-killed-in-blast-along-loc-in-rajouri-101635607141370.html

30-10-2021||India||Ahead of Diwali, these states have put a ban on firecrackers in view of Covid-19||As Diwali is only a few days away, several state governments across the country have imposed guidelines and curbs pertaining to manufacture, sale and burning of firecrackers for the festival. In a latest update, Karnataka government has given nod to selling green crackers at designated places outside residential areas in the state between November 1 and 10, according to news agency ANI. “Six-meter distance between shops [is] a must,” the ANI report added, citing the government.A host of states and Union territories, including Delhi, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab have put restrictions on firecrackers ahead of Diwali this year. Referring to this, the Supreme Court said that the prohibition is not aimed to target any particular community or festival but to safeguard the right to life of the citizens of the country. “We are not against any particular community. We are not against any particular festival or celebration. But we cannot permit anyone to play with the right to life of others in the guise of celebration. We want to send [a] strong message that we are here for the protection of fundamental rights of the citizens,” justice AS Bopanna said.The court also cautioned against any violation of the firecracker ban, saying that chief secretaries of states and UTs, police superintendents, police district superintendents, and station house officers will be personally held accountable for the same.However, the apex court clarified that there will be no blanket ban on firecrackers because green crackers will be allowed. It said that only those containing Barium salts will be prohibited.Here’s a list of all states and UTs that have imposed ban on firecrackers for Diwali:1.     DelhiLast month, the AAP-led government in the national capital declared a blanket ban on the sale, use and storage of firecrackers in the city. In a series of tweets, chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal said that the decision was made in view of the deteriorating air quality level of the city.2.     PunjabOn Tuesday, the state government announced that people will only be allowed to burn green crackers on Diwali for two hours (between 8 and 10pm) across the state. Similar relaxation has been given for Gurupurab on November 19 with the timings being from 4 to 5am, and 9 to 10pm.3. MaharashtraThe Uddhav Thackeray-led government has although not put a ban on firecrackers, it has asked the citizens of the state to keep away from it and instead light lamps during the upcoming Diwali celebrations in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.3.     RajasthanCongress’ Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government has allowed the sale and use of only “green crackers” in the state. Furthermore, the crackers can be burst between 8pm and 10pm during Diwali and Gurupurab, between 6am and 8am on Chhat Puja, and from 11.55pm to 12.30am on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Use and sale of any other form of firecracker will be prohibited across the northern state.4.     HaryanaThe Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in September issued a directive banning the sale and use of firecrackers in the national capital region (NCR) on the basis of an advisory by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). Complete ban has been ordered in regions where the air quality falls under ‘poor’ or ‘more than poor’ category.6. Uttar PradeshYogi Adityanath-led government has like many states allowed the use of green crackers during Diwali but not more than two hours in areas where air quality falls in the ‘moderate’ or better category.5.     OdishaIn a bid to protect the health of the people of the state and to check the spread of Covid-19 infection, the state government had last month ordered a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers during the ongoing festive season.6.     West BengalThe TMC chief Mamata Banerjee-led state government has imposed a blanket ban on the manufacture, sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers, including green crackers, ahead of Diwali and Kali Puja celebrations across the state.7. AssamAssam government has also imposed a ban on firecrackers during Diwali, and has only permitted bursting green crackers for two hours between 8pm and 10pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-diwali-these-states-have-put-a-ban-on-firecrackers-in-view-of-covid19-101635598040088.html
30-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 31, 2011 — Sebastian Vettel is the champ, India the winner||Greater Noida- They came expecting the worst. They left dazzled. Not only did India offer Formula One a racing circuit rivalling the best in the world, it did so with typical Indian warmth. Good tracks these F1 fellows are used to but friendly, open people proved to be India’s greatest ambassadors.World champion and winner of the first Indian Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel’s take on the country after his race was a touch philosophical but insightful: “If you keep your eyes and ears open I think you are able to learn a lot (from) the way people handle things here. It is a big country, a lot of people… but they get along and are happy… even though peopledon’t have a lot here, in a way they are much richer than a lot of people back in Europe. It is a great race, great event.”Second-placed Jenson Button has been effusive in his praise for the facility ever since he got here. But on Sunday he went the distance: “In the years to come, we are going to think of it (the circuit) as one of the greats. It is a very special circuit.”F1 is the technical pinnacle of motorsports. The fastest machines on the planet can onlyrun in high-tech arenas built to exacting standards.There are jumbo-loads of communication equipment and track-monitoring systems thatneed to be laid out. Instant emergency response is mandatory.Drivers have to be confident of the safety features if they have to floor their foot. Theydid that with great regularity on Sunday as the 95,000-strong crowd screamed on.“The response here has been incredible. I am amazed and impressed,” said F1 boss BernieEcclestone. “I see it (the event) getting bigger.”Its people are anyway going to be India’s greatest asset as far as F1 is concerned. Thereis already a significant fan following to bring in the crowds.Then, most major brands associated with F1 are looking to exploit the burgeoning Indianmarket.Problems arose aplenty over the first two days but the best bit was that the same glitch did not surface again.By pulling off one of the most demanding and sophisticated sporting spectacles, the Jaypee Group has illustrated the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of our private sector.Of course, the moment the crowds poured out of the track and onto the roads controlledby our public authorities, the usual chaos surfaced. Huge traffic jams were the norm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-31-2011-sebastian-vettel-is-the-champ-india-the-winner-101635598380287.html

While the spree of raids, arrests, killings continue unabated, the level of repression and state intolerance has touched a new low.”Mehbooba Mufti said that they had expected that Union home minister Amit Shah’s recent visit to J&K would lead to a meaningful reach out.“Especially after his statement about engaging with the youth here. Instead, what followed was shocking and worrying. A friendly cricket match between India and Pakistan that was solely a source of entertainment for people here bruised by incessant lockdowns, Internet gag and restriction of the movement led to booking youngsters under the draconian UAPA for simply choosing to cheer the winning side.”Mehbooba Mufti said that even doctors are being targetted, a reference towards the cases registered against students of Medical College.“Our brightest young people pursuing professional courses like MBBS have been targeted and slapped with anti-terror laws. While within Kashmir, youth are no strangers to the state excesses, three students in Agra too have been arrested and charged with sedition for the same reasons. This despite the college’s own admission that they didn’t engage in any activity that might be construed as anti-national,” she wrote in her letter.Mufti in her letter further said that patriotism and a sense of loyalty have to be cultivated with compassion and can’t be forced by wielding the baton or by the barrel of a gun.“Such punitive actions laced with contempt will only further the sense of mistrust and alienation between the younger generation and rest of the country. Political parties and their fortunes will wax and wane over the course of time. But what matters most is the future generation that will have to carry the burdens of the past yet strive to fulfil the expectations of a better tomorrow. Especially, when it comes to a state like J&K steeped in its history of repeated betrayals and past wounds.”Mehbooba Mufti while seeking the PM’s intervention, said that wisdom deems it prudent for this government to engage with them, understand their aspirations and goals.“I fervently request you to intervene so that the future of these young bright minds is not destroyed,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-intervention-in-release-of-kashmiri-students-in-up-101635597660988.html

Ahuja asked the governments in the respective states to undertake a review of these parametres and take action accordingly.In her letter to Assam, Ahuja pointed out that there has been 41 per cent increase in weekly new cases since the past week (October 20-26) and that there have been early signs of rise in positivity since last four weeks from 1.89 per cent in the week of September 28-October 4 to 2.22 per cent in the week of October 19-25."The state has also witnessed decline in tests conducted from 1,64,071 in the week of September 28-October 4 to 1,27,048 in the week of October 19-25. Because of the rising positivity, the state needs to conduct enhanced testing while maintaining the required RT-PCR share as it will aid in early identification of infection in the state," PTI quoted her as saying.The additional secretary also identified Assam's Barpeta and Kamrup Metro as districts of concern due to the high number of Covid-19 cases and weekly positivity rate.Similarly, in West Bengal, Ahuja said two districts - Kolkata and Howrah - have been identified as districts of concern. The additional secretary noted that the state has shown approximately 41 per cent rise in weekly new cases since the past week, 6,040 cases in the week of October 20-26 compared to 4,277 cases in the week of October 13-19 and that there have been early signs of increase in positivity since the past four weeks from 1.93 per cent in the week of September 28- October 4 to 2.39 per cent during October 19-25.West Bengal has also witnessed decline in the tests conducted from 2,62,319 during September 28-October 4 to 2,61,515 in the week of October 19-25, she pointed out.“It has been observed that Covid cases surge exponentially where basic public health strategy (testing, tracking, treatment, Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination) is not followed rigorously,” PTI quoted her as saying in the letter.The officer has suggested possible measures to control the surge including proper implementation of containment-zones, increased focus on house-to-house search for active Covid-19 cases within these zones and strict and daily monitoring of cases under home isolation and their referral to hospitals.The officer also suggested strengthening contact tracing of Covid-19 positive people, and reviewing containment zones in Assam and West Bengal.Among other measures suggested by the additional secretary are a detailed district-wise and facility-wise analysis of deaths and strengthening the system for early and smooth admission of cases, along with a real-time public dashboard highlighting the available hospital or bed infrastructure.The officer also issued an advisory for super spreader events, asking the states to maintain strict surveillance and monitoring as per standard operating protocols (SOPs) of the health ministry and testing as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. It also stressed ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour: Mask-wearing and physical distancing must be strictly enforced.Further, both the states were encouraged to aim for 100 per cent first dose coverage of the 18-plus population, along with increasing the pace of the second dose of vaccination for the eligible lot.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-word-of-caution-for-assam-bengal-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-101635595030776.html
30-10-2021||India||Sanjay Raut doesn't agree with Prashant Kishor, says ‘BJP will stay but as opposition’||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the BJP rule in the country will be put to an end by a Congress-ruled coalition government in 2024 and that he does not personally believe what poll strategist Prashant Kishor has predicted about BJP. "No government can be formed without the Congress, which is a major and a deeply rooted party in the country. Congress is the main opposition party too. Others are regional parties," Raut said."BJP claims that it is the world's biggest party. If the world's biggest party loses elections they will become an opposition party. For example, in Maharashtra, the BJP is the main opposition party with 105 MLAs," Raut said amid Shiv Sena's 'mixed signals' to the BJP.Recently, poll strategist Prashant Kishor during his visit to Goa said the BJP will continue to be a force to reckon with in Indian politics for decades to come. “The BJP is going to be in the centre of Indian politics, whether they win, whether they lose - like it was for the first 40 years for the Congress. The BJP is going nowhere. Once you secure 30% vote at the India level, you are not going away in a hurry,” Prashant Kishore said.The poll strategist behind some spectacular poll results in the country also criticised the Congress and said Rahul Gandhi is the problem of the Congress. “That is where the problem lies with Rahul Gandhi. Probably, he thinks that it is just a matter of time when people will throw him (Narendra Modi) away. That’s not happening,” Kishor said.BJP's long-term ally Shiv Sena is in the power in Maharashtra with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, though the chemistry among the allies of the Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra remains on and off, with speculations often doing the rounds that the Sena might think of going back to its old partner BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-raut-doesn-t-agree-with-prashant-kishor-says-bjp-will-stay-but-as-opposition-101635596234114.html

30-10-2021||India||PM Modi meets Pope Francis, discuss ways to make ‘planet better’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pope Francis discussed a wide range of global issues, including the Covid-19 crisis, fighting climate change and alleviating poverty, during their maiden meeting at the Vatican City on Saturday. In a tweet, Modi described the meeting as “warm” and said he had invited the Pope to visit India. The visit to the Vatican was scheduled to last only 20 minutes but went on for an hour, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Modi and the Pope discussed a range of issues “aimed at making the planet better”, such as climate change and poverty, the people said. Modi was the first Indian prime minister to meet Pope Francis since he became head of the Catholic Church in 2013. It was also the first meeting between an Indian prime minister and a pope since June 2000, when late prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited the Vatican and met Pope John Paul II. Pope John Paul II also made the last papal visit to India in 1999, when Vajpayee was the prime minister. Modi was accompanied to the Vatican by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Modi also met Cardinal Pietro Parolin, secretary of state of the Vatican City, and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican secretary for relations with states. “Had a very warm meeting with Pope Francis. I had the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues with him and also invited him to visit India,” Modi said in his tweet. The external affairs ministry said the Pope granted Modi a private audience at the Apostolic Palace, and the two leaders discussed the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences for people around the world. They also discussed the challenge posed by climate change, and Modi briefed the Pope about India’s initiatives to combat the phenomenon and the country’s success in administering one billion Covid-19 vaccination doses. The Pope appreciated India’s assistance to countries in need during the pandemic, the ministry said. The Pope also accepted Modi’s invitation to visit India.A statement from the Vatican said, “During a brief conversation, the cordial relations between the Holy See and India were discussed.” The official Vatican News reported Modi gifted the Pope a silver candlestick and a book on the commitment to the environment. The Pope reciprocated with a bronze plaque with the inscription “The desert will become a garden”, volumes of papal documents, his message for World Day of Peace and the document on Human Fraternity, signed on February 4, 2019 in Abu Dhabi by the Pope and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar. Ahead of Modi’s meeting with the Pope, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla told reporters on Friday the Vatican had not set an agenda for the meet. Shringla had also said that issues covering a range of areas, including general global perspectives, Covid-19 and health issues, and working together to maintain peace and tranquillity were expected to figure in the discussions. Modi is in Italy to attend the G20 Summit during October 30-31. He will then travel to the UK to attend COP26 at Glasgow. He is set to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on the margins of the G20 Summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-meets-pope-francis-discuss-ways-to-make-planet-better-101635591542433.html

During the campaigning, the Congress leader was spotted taking a ride on Goa's so-called motorcycle taxi 'Pilot', in the state capital Panaji.The video of Rahul Gandhi taking the ride was shared by news agency ANI on its Twitter handle. In the video, Gandhi, wearing a mask and a helmet, is seen sitting behind another person who is riding the 'motorcycle taxi' as they take the ride together from Bambolim to Azad Maidan in Panaji.“How best to connect with our people? Reach out to them when they are in their comfort zone. Shri@RahulGandhi setting examples for all leaders in India to follow,” the Congress party, which also shared the video, said in the caption on Twitter, with a hashtag #RahulGandhiWithGoa.#WATCH | Congress leader Rahul Gandhi takes a ride on Goa's motorcycle taxi known as 'Pilot', from Bambolim to Azad Maidan in Panaji(Source: Congress party) pic.twitter.com/kCc0KVQsoYRahul Gandhi also interacted with members of the fishermen community at Velsao beach in South Goa following his arrival in the state. He asserted that the assurances that his party will give in its election manifesto in the state will not just be a commitment, but a "guarantee" as not keeping the word will dent his credibility.Gandhi added that his party will prepare the poll manifesto in an open and transparent manner after holding talks with different stakeholders in the state, and its focus will be environment protection.The Congress leader also attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging it indulges in hatred and divides people."I am not here to waste your time or my time. Just as your time is important, my time is important...The commitment that we will make to you in manifesto is not just a commitment, but a guarantee," he said."My credibility is important to me. Unlike many other leaders, when I say something here, I will make sure it happens. If I come here I say to you that we will not allow coal hub and I don't do it, next time I come here I will have no credibility," he added.The assembly elections in Goa are due early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watch-rahul-gandhi-takes-a-ride-on-goa-s-motorcycle-taxi-in-panaji-101635589999977.html

Mufti said that the cricket match between India and Pakistan was “solely a source of entertainment” for Kashmiri people but led to booking the youngsters under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act “for simply choosing to cheer the winning side.”“While within Kashmir youth are no strangers to the state excesses, three students in Agra too have been arrested and charged with sedition for the same reasons. This despite the college's own admission that they didn't engage in any activity that might construed as anti national,” the former J&K chief minister wrote.Earlier this week, three Kashmiri students were suspended by an engineering college in Agra for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans and sharing “anti-national” chats after India lost the World T-20 match on Sunday night. Police said that the students posted stories on social media praising Pakistan and disowned India as their country.In the letter to PM Modi, Mufti said that patriotism and a sense of loyalty have to be cultivated with compassion and can't be forced by “wielding the baton or by the barrel of a gun.” She argued that such punitive action, laced with contempt, against Kashmiri students will further the “sense of mistrust and alienation” between the younger generation and the rest of the country.“Wisdom deems it prudent for this government to engage with them, understand their aspirations and goals.

30-10-2021||India||Cruise ship drugs case: NDPS court grants bail to nine more||A special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court on Saturday granted bail to nine accused in the cruise ship drugs case including Aachit Kumar, arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for allegedly supplying drugs to Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and his friend Arbaaz Merchant. Others granted bail by special NDPS judge Vaibhav Patil include make-up artist Gomit Chopra, Gurgaon resident Nupur Satija and four persons associated with a Delhi-based event management firm, Canplus Trading Private Limited. They include directors Sameer Sehgal and Gopalji Anand, and employees Manav Singhal and Bhaskar Arora. Later in the day, the special court also granted bail to Ishmeet Singh Chadha, a new Delhi resident arrested for alleged possession and consumption of narcotics, and Shreyas Nair, whom the agency termed as a drug peddler. The court also granted their request for temporary cash bail, so as to ensure their quick release from the jail instead of waiting till sureties are arranged. In all, 14 out of the 20 people arrested in the case, have received bail, while six accused -- Vikrant Chhokar, Mohak Jaswal, Abdul Kadir Sheikh, Shivraj Harijan and Nigerian nationals Chinedu Igwe and Okaro Ouzamo -- have either not applied for bail or their bail pleas have yet not been heard. Aachit Kumar was arrested by NCB on October 6, purportedly on the basis of WhatsApp chats exchanged between him and Aryan and Arbaaz. NCB claimed that it had seized 2.6 grams of marijuana from his Powai residence. While the agency claimed that Aachit was a drug peddler, his lawyers refuted the claim and maintained that the young boy, studying in United Kingodom was innocent. He argued that the college student cannot be termed a drug peddler and that the seizure memorandum was fabricated. Also Read | Aryan Khan out of jail, but not allowed to do these things: The bail conditionsThe four event organisers argued that they had no role to play with the drug seizures on the cruise and had specifically and clearly warned the guests about the need to abstain from drugs or other illegal substances in view of their zero tolerance policy towards consumption and distribution of drugs. NCB claimed to have seized four MDMA pills from Nupur Satija and Gomit Chopra. Gomit argued that the mandatory procedure under section 50 of NDPS Act was not followed while seizing the contraband material and therefore the seizure itself was illegal. The panchanama was not done at the spot, as mandated by the law, his lawyer had argued said. The special NDPS court on October 26 granted bail to two Odisha residents – Manish Rajgaria and Avin Sahu, both of whom were arrested by NCB for alleged consumption after the holiday cruise returned from Goa on October 5. Besides, Bombay high court granted bail to Aryan, Arbaaz and model Munmun Dhamecha. Aryan came out of Arthur Road jail on Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cruise-ship-drugs-case-ndps-court-grants-bail-to-nine-more-101635587219464.html

Rakesh Rathore, a BJP MLA from Sitapur Sadar assembly constituency joined Akhilesh’s party along with six BSP rebel MLAs - Aslam Raini, MLA from Bhigna (Shravasti), Mujtaba Siddiqui (Pratapur, Prayagraj), Aslam Ali Chaudhary (Dhalauna, Hapur), Hakim Lal Bind (Handia, Prayagraj), Sushma Patel (Mungra Badshapur, Jaunpur), and Hargovind Bhargava (Sidhauli, Sitapur).BSP had suspended these MLAs after they opposed the nomination of BSP’s official candidate for Rajya Sabha polls last October.After inducting the seven MLAs, Akhilesh said: “After today, the chief minister (Yogi Adityanath) will change his slogan from ‘Mera Parivaar, BhaJaPa (My family, BJP)’ to ‘Mera Parivaar, Bhaagta Parivaar (My family is running away)”.

Akhilesh Yadav has been repeatedly saying that “any leader who wishes to join SP is welcome” and “SP will not ally with any big political party and will instead opt for strategic alliances with small regional parties”. Last week, Akhilesh Yadav stitched an alliance with SBSP (Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party)--a former BJP ally-turned-rival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-bjp-mla-6-rebel-bsp-mlas-join-samajwadiparty-101635585179350.html

30-10-2021||India||‘Won’t find 4 to 3 ticket seekers’: Akhilesh Yadav attacks Shah, BJP||The Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party and Union home minister Amit Shah in the run up to the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and said that the saffron party was “unlikely” to find ticket-seeking candidates due to people’s “anger” against the ruling party.He also took a dig at Shah, who was busy meeting BJP leaders, office-bearers, and cadres in Lucknow on Saturday, over Union minister of state Ajay Mishra Teni’s presence in Shah’s rally yesterday. “Even if the BJP announces 403 chief ministers in Uttar Pradesh, it will still not get even 4 to 3 ticket seekers considering the public anger against the party...How will the party get ticket seekers when it is visibly heading towards defeat. The public which is distressed because of the BJP will make it suffer for every vote...The BJP is finished,” Akhilesh tweeted on a day when 6 Bahujan Samaj Party and one BJP MLA switched over to the SP. Amit Shah ask BJP workers to set a target of winning more than 300 of the 403 seats in the upcoming UP assembly polls. He had also made it clear that the incumbent chief minister Yogi Adityanath will be the chief minister if the party wins the elections. He also attacked opposition parties and leaders, especially Akhilesh Yadav and his poll-related activities. “Earlier mafia and criminals ruled the state, now when I look through ‘durbeen’ then I can’t see them anywhere in UP.” Shah had said, making a binocular gesture by curling his figures over his eyes.Also Read | UP people suffering due to ‘loot’ of electricity bills: Priyanka GandhiAkhilesh launched a counter attack on Shah on Saturday and tweeted: “The search with the fake binocular was a drama while the culprit was right next (to Amit Shah)”.

Ajay Mishra is the father of Ashish Mishra, a top accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence incident in which eight persons including four farmers were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-find-4-to-3-ticket-seekers-akhilesh-yadav-attacks-shah-bjp-101635583019225.html

The officials have warned people against eating the fish found floating on the surface of Kameng river, the news agency further reported.The district officials have pointed towards the high content of total dissolved substances (TDS) as the reason for the river, situated in East Kameng district, turning black.PTI quoted district fisheries officials as saying that the TDS leads to breathing issues for aquatic species. The fish under the water are also experience reduced visibility due to high level of TDS, the officials further said.The TDS in the Kameng river was 6,800 mg per liter, much higher than the normal range of 300-1,200 mg per liter, said District Fisheries Development Officer (DFDO) Hali Tajo.Meanwhile, the residents of Seppa village, where the incident took place, have blamed China, claiming the TDS level went dangerously high due to the construction activities being carried out by the neighbouring country across the border.Watch: Is China's increase in Arunachal LAC activity new tactic after Ladakh jolt?Seppa East MLA Tapuk Taku appealed to the state government to immediately constitute a committee of experts to ascertain the cause behind the abrupt change in the colour of the Kameng river's water and the death of a large quantity of fish."If it continues for more than a few days, the aquatic life from the river will be totally eliminated," PTI quoted him as saying.Earlier this week, India picked up increased activities and intensified patrolling by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) in sensitive areas across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh.The data accessed by Hindustan Times showed that the Indian Army detected PLA's increased operational tempo in Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La, which are areas of historical significance in the context of Chinese aggression in the eastern sector. The army further told HT that counter measures have been taken.The army used satellites, long-range unmanned aerial vehicles, superior network of radars and hi-tech night vision systems to monito PLA's activities. The surveillance picked up increased vehicular movement due to infrastructure development activities and a large number of excavators and bulldozers to keep road axes open across the Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La sectors, an official told Hindustan Times.In 2017, a similar blackening of Siang river at Pasighat was reported. At that time, then Congress MP from Arunachal East Ninong Ering had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his intervention, claiming that it was the result of the construction of a 10,000-km-long tunnel in China, which diverted water from Siang to Xinjiang province in the Taklamakan desert.China had denied the allegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-river-turns-black-thousands-of-fish-die-locals-blame-china-report-101635579642411.html

Speaking at a TMC event in Goa, Mamata also accused the principal opposition party at the national level of not taking decisions, adding that the country is suffering because of that.Mamata's sharp critique of the Congress comes days after political strategist Prashant Kishor hit out at party leader Rahul Gandhi, saying he was probably under an illusion that it’s only a matter of time until PM Modi’s power wanes.Also Read | BJP will remain powerful for decades, predicts poll strategist Prashant KishorAddressing a group of media persons in Panaji on the last day of her three-day visit to the coastal state, where assembly polls are due early next year, Mamata said, “I cannot say everything right now because they [the Congress] didn't take politics seriously. Modi ji is going to be more powerful because of Congress… If one cannot make a decision, why should the country suffer for that?”“They [the Congress] got an opportunity in the past,” the PTI news agency quoted Mamata Banerjee as saying. “Instead of fighting against the BJP, they contested against me in my state.”The Trinamool supremo apparently sent a message to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, in her Saturday speech, saying that her state has had enough of Delhi's “dadagiri” (a Bengali colloquial term that roughly equates to “bullying”). “Delhi ka dadagiri amka naka (We don't want Delhi's bullying), enough is enough,” she said.She said that her party believes in distributions for the regional parties in elections. Speaking of the upcoming Goa elections, the Bengal chief minister said, “I want the regional parties to be strong, and we want that the federal structure of India to be strong. We should make the states strong. If states are strong, only then shall the Centre be strong.”Notably, the Trinamool Congress has announced that it will be contesting all the 40 seats in the upcoming Goa assembly elections. Prashant Kishor, whose profile as a poll strategist shot up after he helped the TMC retain power in West Bengal earlier this year by giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP a rare snub in the state elections, is also in Goa now, assisting Mamata in finding a foothold to contest the upcoming elections.Also Read | Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to visit Goa today, months ahead of 2022 pollsKishor, speaking at a private event two days ago, said, “The BJP is going to be the centre of Indian politics, whether they win, whether they lose - like it was for the first 40 years for Congress. The BJP is going nowhere. Once you secure 30 per cent of the vote at the India-level, you are not going away in a hurry.”Meanwhile, Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), a poll consultancy firm, has begun surveys on behalf of the TMC in Goa to help the party expand beyond Bengal.

30-10-2021||India||2022 UP Assembly Polls: Six rebel BSP MLAs to join SP today||Six rebel Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs are set to join the Samajwadi Party on Saturday in the presence of its national president Akhilesh Yadav at party’s state headquarters in Lucknow, people aware of the development said.The development comes a day after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav inducted two western UP Congress heavyweights Harendra Malik (former MP) and his former MLA son Pankaj Malik into SP fold. The BSP MLAs who are joining SP are: Aslam Raini, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Aslam Ali Chaudhary, Hakim Lal Bind, Sushma Patel, and Hargovind Bhargava. BSP had suspended these MLAs after they opposed the nomination of BSP’s official candidate for Rajya Sabha polls last October.The six MLAs had met Akhilesh Yadav then for the first time and now later in June this year.On Monday, former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar had announced that they will formally join the Samajwadi Party at a rally in Ambedkar Nagar district on November 7 in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav.Ramachal Rajbhar is the MLA from UP’s Akbarpur and Lalji Verma from the state’s Katehari constituency in Ambedkar Nagar district. “We worked hard for the BSP for very long but were expelled from the party on June 3,” Verma said, while speaking at Akhilesh Yadav’s press conference in Lucknow.BSP had expelled the two, accusing them of anti-party activities during the panchayat election earlier this year.Once considered close to BSP chief Mayawati, both Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar served as cabinet ministers during the BSP regime in the state. Before their expulsion, Verma was the state president of the party and Rajbhar the BSP Legislature Party leader in the UP assembly.Also Read: One of UP’s most wanted gunned down in Chitrakoot jungleThe six rebel BSP MLAs delayed their formal switch to the Samajwadi Party to protect their assembly memberships. The BSP has 18 MLAs in the UP assembly, but 11 of them are either suspended or expelled.Aslam Raini is an MLA from Bhigna in Shravasti; Mujtaba Siddiqui from Pratapur in Prayagraj; Aslam Ali Chaudhary from Dhalauna, Hapur; Hakim Lal Bind from Handia, Prayagraj; Sushma Patel from Mungra Badshapur in Jaunpur, and Hargovind Bhargava represents Sidhauli, Sitapur.Samajwadi Party, for the last one-and-a-half years, has been attracting leaders from other parties--largely BSP and Congress, and the switch overs have intensified as the assembly polls draw close. Akhilesh Yadav has been repeatedly saying that “any leader who wishes to join SP is welcome” and “SP will not ally with any big political party and will instead opt for strategic alliances with small regional parties”. Last week, Akhilesh Yadav stitched an alliance with SBSP (Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party)--a former BJP ally-turned-rival.Uttar Pradesh is likely to go to polls early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2022-up-assembly-polls-six-rebel-bsp-mlas-to-join-sp-today-101635577619286.html
30-10-2021||India||Karnataka revises its stand on Rohingyas in SC||In less than three weeks after the Karnataka government told the Supreme Court that it does not intend to deport or take any coercive action against Rohingya Muslims, the state government has filed a fresh affidavit, leaving it open for the court to determine the action to be taken against these refugees.The state filed its second affidavit in response to a petition filed by a lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay on October 26. The petition sought an order from the court to identify, detain and deport illegal immigrants and infiltrators including Bangladeshis and Rohingyas within a year.The new affidavit filed by KN Vanaja, under secretary in the state Department of Home disclosed that a total of 126 Rohingyas have been identified in the state who were not staying in any camp or detention centre. “This Respondent undertakes that whatever the order that would be passed by this court will be scrupulously adhered to and followed in its letter and spirit,” the affidavit said.This affidavit lacked the clear assertion made by the state in its previous affidavit filed on October 7 while responding to the same petition, where it was said, “72 Rohingyas identified in Bengaluru City are working in various fields and Bengaluru City police have not taken any coercive action against them as of now and there is no immediate plan of deporting them.” This affidavit was filed by YS Chandrashekhara, police inspector in the office of the director general and inspector general of police.The previous response by the Basavaraj Bommai-led government of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was at variance with the firm stand against the continuation of Rohingya immigrants in the country, taken by the Centre. In an affidavit filed in September 2017, in response to a petition filed by two Rohingya immigrants seeking refugee status, the Ministry of Home Affairs said, “Continuance of Rohingyas’ illegal immigration into India and their continued stay has serious national security ramifications and threats.”Also Read: Puneeth Rajkumar’s last rites expected today, says Bengaluru Police commissionerThe affidavit had then estimated presence of over 40,000 Rohingya Muslims in the country and disclosed that intelligence inputs pointed out their links with Pakistan-based terror organisations and indulgence in anti-national activities such as mobilisation of funds through hawala channels, procuring fake identities and involvement in human trafficking.It was for this reason that Upadhyay in his petition filed in 2017 demanded the Centre and state governments to amend laws to make illegal immigration and infiltration a cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. In addition, he sought directions from the court to declare the preparation of forged/fabricated PAN Cards, AADHAR cards, passports, ration cards and voter i-cards and such other identity documents a non-bailable, non-compoundable offence.The earlier response by Karnataka urged for dismissal of the petition by saying, “The Petition is devoid of merits. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed.” However, the recent affidavit has steered clear of this stand and has left it to the courts to decide the issue..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-revises-its-stand-on-rohingyas-in-sc-101635576058658.html

The federal agency has now come under fresh fire over how it is dealing with drug-peddling charges, a number of cases related to which were probed by it over one year. A recent media report claimed that not only has the NCB initiated as many as five drugs-related cases in a year, but only one witness – Adil Fazal Usmani – has been produced by the probe agency as ‘panch witness’ while investigating all of them.Also Read | NCB’s Sameer Wankhede asked HC for arrest shield, told he will get 3-day noticeThe Indian Express reported that the NCB has been using Usmani, who was among the 10 panch witnesses cited by the agency in the cruise ship raid involving Aryan Khan, in at least five drugs-related cases since 2020. The newspaper reported, citing records seen by it, that Usmani, a resident of the Jogeshwari area in Mumbai, was cited by the NCB as a panch witness in these five cases – two of them in 2020 and three in 2021.Apart from Usmani, two other panch witnesses cited by the NCB reportedly include Kiran Gosavi and Manish Bahubali. The Hindustan Times reported earlier this week that Gosavi was arrested in Pune in connection with a 2018 cheating case.Prabhakar Sail, a bodyguard of NCB witness Kiran Gosavi, earlier alleged that Gosavi took ₹50 lakh from an individual after the raid at the cruise ship. Gosavi however, has denied the allegations. Notably, Sail, too, has been listed as one of the 10 panch witnesses in the Mumbai cruise case. The other six, apart from Usmani, Gosavi, Bahubali, and Sail are – Aparna Rane, Prakash Bahadur, Shoaib Faiz, Aubrey Gomez, Muzammil Ibrahim, and V Waigankar. A few of these people, reported the Indian Express, are security staff in the Cordelia cruise luxury liner from which Aryan Khan and others were held during the drugs bust on October 2.A controversy erupted after Prabhakar Sail, one of the witnesses cited by the NCB for the raid, filed an affidavit sworn before a notary on October 23 alleging that he overheard his former employer Kiran Gosavi, also a witness in the Aryan Khan-cruise drug case, talking to a person about settling the matter for ₹18 crore and that amount of ₹8 crore would be required to be paid to NCB official Sameer Wankhede.Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha were arrested by a team led by Sameer Wankhede on October 3 after a raid on a cruise ship have all been in custody for 23 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-under-fire-5-drugs-cases-in-a-year-same-witness-in-all-says-report-101635570591979.html

The Bombay high court on Friday had granted Aryan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha bail in a drug case that made many raise issues of questionable proof and investigative overreach.They were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on October 3, along with several others, a day after the agency conducted searches at the International Cruise Terminal in Mumbai and a holiday cruise anchored at the terminal and purportedly seized multiple drugs from a number of persons.They spent first five days in NCB custody and were shifted to jail on October 8, a day after the Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court remanded them to judicial custody. The high court on Friday issued a five-page bail order and listed 14 bail conditions, including surrendering of passport, no influencing of witnesses or contacting co-accused, and presenting themselves in the NCB office every week.The court stipulated a personal bond of ₹1 lakh each with one or two sureties of the same amount, and said it will release a detailed order with reasons next week.Shortly thereafter, actor Juhi Chawla appeared before the special NDPS court along with Aryan’s counsel, advocate Satish Maneshinde, as surety for Aryan. No sureties were presented for Merchant and Dhamecha.But a Friday release for the 23-year-old was thwarted because the bail documents did not reach Arthur Road jail -- where Aryan spent 22 days for alleged consumption of drugs and conspiracy - in time.“As per the jail manual, the procedure is that documentation (for release on bail) should be completed by 5:30pm and his documents did not reach us. After due course process, he will be released from jail tomorrow (Saturday),” Nitin Vaychal, superintendent of Arthur Road jail said on Friday.Also Read | Extortion charges: Police begin probe against Wankhede, other NCB officersFor a prison inmate to get out on bail, the court papers have to be put inside a rusted steel letter box that is installed outside the jail. The box is opened four times everyday at 5.30 am, 9.30 am, 3.30 pm and 5.30 pm.Aryan’s legal team dropped his bail papers in the box late in Friday evening and the jail authorities collected the same at 5.30 am. Vaychal said the 23-year-old will be released along with other inmates lodged in the jail, whose bail papers were received and processed by the jail staff.Aryan and others were arrested by NCB on October 3, a day after NCB Mumbai zonal chief Sameer Wankhede led a raid on the cruise ship Cordelia, docked off the Mumbai coast. Wankhede said that 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of charas, 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), and ₹1.33 lakh in cash were recovered from the ship. He also claimed that Aryan was linked to a foreign international drug trafficker, and therefore needed to remain in custody.Dhamecha’s counsel, Kashif Ali Khan Deshmukh, said on Friday that they will approach the Bombay high court again. ”We are moving for cash bail as Munmun is not a resident of Mumbai and facing problems with surety for her release,” he said.The case turned on its head last Sunday, when a key NCB witness alleged that Wankhede was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket targeting Aryan. The witness, Prabhakar Sail, also alleged that he was forced to sign sheets of blank paper, prompting the anti-drug agency to set up a vigilance inquiry into Wankhede’s conduct.As delays mounted, experts doubted whether protocol was breached during the raid – private individuals like Sail’s employer Kiran Gosavi, who was arrested in Pune on extortion charges on Thursday, were seen assisting officials and walking into the NCB office despite holding no official position in any law enforcement agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-released-from-arthur-road-jail-101635573478762.html
30-10-2021||India||Villagers oppose opening up of Hasdeo Arand forest for coal mining in Chhattisgarh||The grant of stage II or final forest clearance to Parsa opencast coal mine in Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand region has led to widespread protests by the affected villagers. Ten villagers along with farmer and environmental groups are in Delhi to register their opposition to opening up of 841.538 ha forest land which supports their livelihoods and to the opening up of Hasdeo Arand forests.The groups met Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday, and plans to approach the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) against its decision to grant a final clearance to Parsa. The FAC in a letter dated October 21 granted the final approval for coal mining in 841.538 ha of forest land under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. HT had reported on February 10, 2019 that the FAC had granted stage 1 or the preliminary forest clearance to the mine despite finding that a part of the forest included “very dense” forest cover. The mine falls in one of the largest contiguous stretches of very dense forest in central India called Hasdeo Arand that spans 170,000 ha (hectares).The FAC had granted stage 1 clearance based on certain conditions like: State government shall reconfirm the presence/absence of very dense forest in the northeastern part of the proposed forest land and exclude it; state government will comply with an Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education biodiversity study of the Hasdeo Arand region including the Parsa block; legal status of the forest land will remain unchanged and many others. FAC’s letter granting stage II forest clearance suggests that these conditions may have been fulfilled.“The state government has forwarded the Draft Biodiversity Assessment Report which has been considered in the ministry as final report from the state government and the recommendations in the report have been considered to be accepted by the state government for their compliance. Therefore, in view of the compliance of Stage-I approval and submission of the Biodiversity Assessment Report, approval of the proposal has been considered by the ministry,” the October 21 final approval states.But villagers likely to be displaced have a completely different view of the forest diversion in Hasdeo Arand. Villagers of Fatehpur, Hariharpur and Salhi have alleged that gram sabha consent was forged for stage 1 approval. “First thing is gram sabha did not approve the diversion of this forest. It was forged. Secondly, for us tribals, the entire Hadeo Arand forest is like our bank account. We depend completely on it for food and fodder. We will be devastated if we are thrown out of our forest,” said Ramlal Karyam, who is in Delhi to meet Congress leaders. Also Read: Chhattisgarh’s Hasdeo Arand residents plan protest in Delhi against mining clearanceSonki Singh of Fatehpur said, “The forest gives us mahua, tendu, all kinds of fruits and fodder. The forest is being handed over for mining by force and not by consent. Our deities live in Hasdeo Arand. All villagers for Hariharpur, Fatehpur and Salhi and the entire Hasdeo region will oppose this move.” She is also travelling with others from Parsa region.“It’s a big lie that there are no dense forests here. Parsa region has very dense sal forests and presence of elephants, leopards, sloth bear, jackals, porcupines, sambhars and many other wildlife. First, they need to verify if a wildlife and biodiversity study was conducted at all. If yes, then how did they not find rich wildlife presence?” asked Muneshwar from Fatehpur.“If we don’t hear from the environment ministry, we will have to move the Supreme Court or the National Green Tribunal. We met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who has promised to intervene. We expect the Congress government in Chhattisgarh to cancel the final approval to the mine,” said Alok Shukla, convener of the Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the unions of farmers leading the agitation against the three new farm laws is also supporting Chhattisgarh villagers in the campaign against diversion of Hasdeo Arand forest. “We are farmers. They are indigenous farmers and their way of farming is unique. They depend on forests and protect forests like their own property. The government cannot take it away from them without following the due process. We have been told by villagers that gram sabha consent was forged. We will provide them whatever legal, political assistance needed in this case,” said Yudhvir Singh of SKM.HT mailed Adani Enterprises on October 26 regarding protests by villagers but did not receive a response until Friday. The mine is owned by Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL), which has handed over the mining operations to Rajasthan Collieries Limited, a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises.A senior member of the FAC and forest ministry official said: “Yes stage II clearance has been granted. We were not aware of these issues. We will check.” Villagers had raised these concerns in a letter sent to the ministry’s forest conservation division on May 3, 2021.“The call of the Hasdeo Arand Bachao Sangharsh Samiti is ‘Hasdeo Bachega to Desh Bachega’, signalling that protecting Hasdeo Arand symbolises much more than a localised struggle. It is a call to recognise the constitutional mandate of gram sabhas (village assemblies) and restoring faith in rule of law which has been seriously challenged in the case of land acquisition, forest and environmental approvals. Other than that, this is a call to foreground food security, nature-based jobs, biodiversity and water security in policy decisions, all of which are threatened in the case of Hasdeo,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-oppose-opening-up-of-hasdeo-arand-forest-for-coal-mining-in-chhattisgarh-101635572458456.html

30-10-2021||India||Bengal firm seeks Mamata Banerjee’s intervention; alleges kidnapping, extortion||Purti Realty, a well-known real estate group based in West Bengal, on Friday alleged that three of its engineers were kidnapped from Hooghly district after the company received extortion demands from a man who claimed to be a “close aide” of a Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator from the district. Mahesh Agarwal, managing director of Purti Realty, which is carrying out two projects worth about ₹1000 crore in Hooghly, wrote an e-mail to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday while she was on a political tour of Goa and sought her intervention. One of these projects is a logistics hub of online retail giant Amazon and the other is a resort of the Marriott group, Agarwal mentioned in his mail to Banerjee. Agarwal alleged that a man who identified himself as Rajib Basu Roy and claimed to be a close aide of a TMC legislator from the district, called up and demanded 50,000 T-shirts during the recent Durga puja. Agarwal wrote that Basu Roy hung up the phone when he was told that if one T-shirt costs ₹70, the company would incur an expenditure of around ₹35 lakh. “He instantly disconnected the telephone and messaged us for 5000 T-shirts,” wrote Agarwal. HT saw a copy of the mail and decided not to name the TMC legislator because the person in question could not be contacted for his comments despite several efforts. HT talked to Agarwal on Friday night. He said he had lodged a formal complaint with the police. “Yesterday (28-10-2021) he entered our site and asked for extortion amount and threatened [that] if not paid by 29-10-2021, he will enter our site and show us his muscle and political power,” wrote Agarwal. “Today, at about 9.00-9.30 am he entered our site in a white Scorpio and started beating our men with sticks and bamboos and kidnapped our three men (engineers) namely Piyush Kanti Poral, Tanmoy Barik and Sudip Sarkar and post which, he has sent information to us to bring money and take away our men,” Agarwal wrote in the mail. Also Read: One more held for murder of Kolkata corporate executive, driver; main accused still at largeHe said that the white SUV had a Jharkhand registration number and the alleged kidnapper wanted the ransom money to be sent to a hotel located on the Durgapur Expressway. The hotel’s name was mentioned in the mail. “Respected Madam, we, with folded hands, request your good self to look into the matter and save the investment environment of the state initiated by you. These type of local goons are spoiling the image and creating fear factor for West Bengal’s peace loving environment,” Agarwal wrote. Locket Chatterjee, the Bharatiya Janata Party Lok Sabha member from Hooghly district, took up the issue and targeted the chief minister. “A glaring example of how a businessman became a victim of extortion. His employees got kidnapped! It shows how Mamata Banerjee is running the extortion industry in West Bengal with the help of her MLA’s and party cadres. The prime reason why Bengal reeks of backwardness!” Chatterjee tweeted on Friday night. Headquartered in south Kolkata, Purti Realty has so far completed 24 residential and commercial projects in Bengal. These include some high-end housing projects and shopping malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-firm-seeks-mamata-banerjee-s-intervention-alleges-kidnapping-extortion-101635570838409.html
30-10-2021||India||China will take one-third of carbon space by 2030, India 7%, says CSE||China will take away almost one-third of the remaining global carbon space between 2020 and 2030 and India just seven per cent, says a new analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) based on trajectory of climate change causing emissions from across the world.The CSE said China with rich countries including Europe would occupy 70% of the world’s carbon space and very less carbon budget would be left for the developing world.The report comes two days before the start of climate conference of 192 countries in Glasgow, Scotland, to chalk out a plan to restrict temperature rise to less than 1.5 degree Celsius by the turn of the century. The CSE data analysis highlights the importance of carbon space for the developing world including India and Africa.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) in its sixth assessment report released in 2019, said starting 2020, the world was left with total carbon budget of 400 GtCO2 for all times to come. GTCO2 is short for gigatonnes of carbon dioxide.“As per IPCC, global emissions need to reduce by 45 per cent over 2010 levels by 2030 to keep the temperature rise to 1.5°C. In 2010, global CO2 emissions were 33 Gt (Gegatonnes),” the CSE said.“Therefore, the world needs to keep its annual CO2 emissions under 18.2 Gt in 2030 to meet this target. But, even if the world achieves the enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), it would be emitting 37.71 GtCO2 in 2030. This is more than double the amount of CO2 the world should be emitting in 2030…The world will emit 409 GtCO2 in 2020-30, against the available budget of 400 GtCO2,” the CSE said, in its analysis.And, the CSE analysis says that available carbon space would be occupied by 2030 even with the enhanced NDCs, the voluntary mitigation submission of all countries, which so far 142 countries of the total 192 signatories to the United Nations Climate Framework Convention have submitted. Sunita Narain, CSE’s director general, said that even with enhanced NDCs the world will cross the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature rise threshold since pre-industrial era by 2030 and in this a major contributor would be China.Also Read | COP26: Play both the good and bad cop“If we look at the emission data since 2000, China has been the foremost polluter,” she said. China accounts for 31% of the total global emissions and seven historical polluters --- United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Australia, Japan, Canada and European Union --- account for 34%. India, through the fourth biggest emitter in absolute terms, contributed just seven per cent. “So, the developed world and China is responsible for over 70 per cent of the carbon emissions so far,” she said.And, don’t expect China’s emissions to go down even though it has announced phasing out of coal by 2040 and achieving net zero emissions by 2060. “In the coming 10 years, China will take up 33% of the remaining carbon budget. Despite heavy reduction targets, the original seven big polluters, along with China will occupy 62%. The remaining world, with 66% of the population will be left with 38%,” CSE said.The arguments presented by the CSE advocated the concept of climate justice which calls for right of the developing world to grow to provide basic facilities to its people. In the past, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has explicitly spoken about climate justice saying any climate deal has been pillared on equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.Under these principles, the historical polluters have to take higher emission cuts and provide money to the developing world to adapt to the changing weather because of climate change whereas the developing world needs to take some mitigation measures. “There is a need to discuss the remaining carbon budget, necessary to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degree C, and how it should be allocated - not just appropriated. We cannot have an ambitious agreement unless it is equitable. So, CoP26 must not repeat the mistakes of the past by trying to erase equity and climate justice,” the CSE said.Chandra Bhushan, CEO, IForest, an advocacy group working in the area of environmental issues, said the debate on carbon space was unending. “China is now the new historical emitter and has replaced the United States in this debate on carbon budget. I don’t think there is any space left for this fight to go on. We need to think out of the box to reduce emissions and check devastating impacts of climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-will-take-one-third-of-carbon-space-by-2030-india-7-says-cse-101635569758446.html

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has said that they are looking at estimated losses to the tune of ₹50,000 crore on part of Chinese exporters this year due to Indians boycotting products from China in the domestic markets.That Indians are banning crackers and other cheap festive products from China this season directly equates to more profits for India's homegrown industries. In a statement issued on Friday, the traders' body said that India's domestic sales are expected to receive a major boost this Diwali in view of a surge in the number of customers in markets across the country ahead of the festive season. The Indian economy may see an inflow to the tune of ₹2 lakh crore through consumer spending during Diwali sales.Also Read | Diwali melas bring festive cheer in Delhi-NCR"Like previous year, this year too CAIT has given a call of 'boycott Chinese goods' and it is certain that China is going to suffer a business loss of about ₹50,000 crore in terms of stoppage of import of Chinese goods by Indian traders," CAIT stated in the statement on Friday.Another important change, observed recently, is that consumers across major cities in the country do not really seem interested in buying Chinese products, which is likely to increase the demand for Indian goods instead. CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said a recent survey conducted by the body's research arm in 20 ‘distribution cities’ showed that so far no orders for Diwali goods, firecrackers, or other items have been placed with Chinese exporters by Indian traders or importers.These 20 cities are – New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Nagpur Jaipur, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Raipur, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Ranchi, Guwahati, Patna, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Madurai, Pondicherry, Bhopal, and Jammu.Also Read | Diwali boom: Festive spirit is back, sales up in Chandigarh marketsFor context, during the five-month festive season from Rakhi to New Year's Day every year, Indian traders and exporters usually import goods worth about ₹70,000 crore from China. However, during the Rakhi festival this time, the Dragon was reported to have suffered losses to the tune of ₹5,000 crore and then again to the tune of ₹500 crores in Ganush Chathurthi.If the same trend continues for Diwali, it would clearly indicate that not only are Indian traders boycotting Chinese goods, but consumers, too, are losing the will to buy products made in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-aatmanirbhar-this-diwali-chinese-exports-set-to-suffer-rs-50k-in-losses-101635565987923.html
30-10-2021||India||Need to revive ridership in Covid-hit public transport||As cities plan for sustainable and resilient public transport systems, experts say ridership needs to return close to the pre-Covid levels, especially in metro rail networks, to minimise long-term impact.At the day-long 14th Urban Mobility India conference, organised online by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, experts deliberated on refashioning transport systems to ensure ‘Mobility for all’, which was the theme of the conference. They also stressed on the need for integrated planning, innovative measures and mobility audits while planning for capital intensive public transport infrastructure.Housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the country has 733 km of operational metro rail network in 18 cities. “It (metro network) provides a reliable and accessible transit medium for the vulnerable sections…With another 1,046 km of network in the pipeline in 27 cities, the ministry’s endeavours to connect 50 cities and towns with metro network by 2024,” said Puri.Durga Shanker Mishra, MoHUA secretary, said that the focus was on achieving ease of living with suitable urban mobility policies through innovation and technology in the sector.The Covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the public transport system including the Metro network that is incurring huge losses due to continuing travel restrictions, the experts noted.Mangu Singh, managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said that the ridership has decreased by 48% from September 2019 to September 2021. “But to ensure social distancing and Covid protocols, we decided to provide maximum services so that the space available for passengers is maximum… As on today, our ridership is around 27 lakh per day,” said Singh.Even private bus operators say that their business has been badly affected. At a time when the Centre is planning to introduce a scheme for operating public transport buses in second tier cities on Public Private Partnership model, bus operators say there is a need to provide financial support to tide over the losses incurred due to Covid. Also Read: BJP Kisan Morcha to hold national executive meeting in Delhi todayPrasanna Patwardhan, chairperson and managing director, Prasanna Purple Mobility Solutions, said, “Public transport should be treated as a priority sector.” He pointed out that in many states, payments are pending for the past one-and-a-half-years while fuel rates have increased without any revision of ticket prices. “All these aspects have to be looked into while planning for a resilient transport system,” he said.Experts say that there is a need to reassess the restrictions or re-strategise transport system planning to stop people from switching from public transport to personal vehicles.  “The drop in ridership in public transport systems, which are capital intensive projects, and revenue, will have a long-term impact as it will delay in fleet expansion and technology advancements if right interventions or financial assistance is not given to agencies,” said Laghu Parashar, deputy project head, SMART-SUT, GIZ India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-revive-ridership-in-covid-hit-public-transport-101635568318371.html
30-10-2021||India||Assembly by poll: Voting begins for 9 constituencies in northeast||Voting for bye-elections on nine assembly seats in three states of northeast including five in Assam, three in Meghalaya and one in Mizoram has begun on Saturday morning. The Bye-election to one seat in Nagaland was won uncontested earlier this month by the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) candidate. . A total of 796,456 voters (403,374 males, 393,078 females) are eligible to vote for Assam’s five assembly seats, apart from 3,165 service voters, to elect their representative from among the 31 candidates in the fray. In order to ensure free and fair voting, webcasting will be done from all 1176 polling stations in the five constituencies, where adequate security arrangements have been made along with implementation of Covid-19 containment protocols at all polling stations. Tamulpur and Gossaigaon assembly seats had fallen vacant due to deaths of opposition MLA from the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and ruling party MLA from the United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) due to Covid-19 related complications. The other three seats are going to polls since two Congress MLAs, from Mariani and Thawra, and one All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA from Bhabanipur, joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). At present, the BJP has 59 MLAs, UPPL 5 and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) 9, while opposition Congress has 27, AIUDF 15, BPF-3, CPM 1 and newly floated Raijor Das has 1 seat in the 126-member house. Bye-election to the Majuli seat, which fell vacant after union minister Sarbananda Sonowal resigned last month, will take place later.

The seats had fallen vacant due to deaths of sitting MLAs. Around 100,000 voters are eligible to vote in the by polls for the three seats. In Mizoram, ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) is taking on Congress, Zoram Peoples Movement (ZPM) and Bharatiya Janata Party in the bye-election for the Tuirial assembly seat. The bye-election was necessitated due to death of sitting ZPM MLA Andrew H Thangliana in August this year. In 2018, Thangliana had defeated MNF’s Sailothanga Sailo by a margin of just 204 votes. A total of 17,911 voters will decide the fates of the four prominent candidates including K Laldawngliana (MNF), Laltlanmawia (ZPM), Chalrosanga Ralte (Congress) and K Laldinthara (BJP). In Nagaland, the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) was declared winner on the Shamator-Chessore assembly seat where by polls were scheduled today as its candidate S Keoshu Yimchunger faced no challenge. Yimchunger, a newcomer in the state electoral politics, was the consensus candidate of the newly formed opposition-less United Democratic Alliance (UDA) in Nagaland where the NDPP, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Naga People’s Front (NPF) and two independent MLAs are partners. The by-poll to Shamatore-Chessore seat in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly was necessitated by the demise of the then sitting NDPP MLA Toshi Wungtung in July this year. Yimchunger was the sole candidate to file nomination papers for the by-poll and was declared winner after the last hour for withdrawal of candidature on October 13. The NDPP’s total strength in the house of 60 now stands at 21, while NPF has 25 MLAs and BJP has 12. There are two independent legislators in the house.

30-10-2021||India||BJP Kisan Morcha to hold national executive meeting in Delhi today||The Bharatiya Janata Party Kisan Morcha will hold its national executive meeting in Delhi on Saturday as the farmers' protest against the Centre's three new farm laws continues.People familiar with the matter told news agency ANI on October 13 that the likely impact of the farmers' protest on the elections to be held in different states next year might be discussed in the meeting. While BJP national president JP Nadda will address the morcha's meeting, the party’s national general secretary BL Santosh and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar will also be a part.ANI reported citing the people mentioned above said that the BJP may come up with further plans on the ongoing agitation, adding a political plan and a resolution on agriculture can be passed during the meeting.Other possible topics which can be discussed include measures undertaken by the Centre to double the income of farmers and measures undertaken by both the Centre and state governments in the interest of farmers, ANI further reported.The BJP Kisan Morcha meeting holds significance after the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 in which eight people, including four farmers' protesting against the three new farm laws, died. Thirteen people, including Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish, have been arrested so far in connection with the case.Farmers have been protesting against the farm laws since November last year.Till now, 11 rounds of talks have been held between the farmers' unions and the Centre to arrive at a consensus over the legislation but the discussions have remained inconclusive.The meetings between the unions and the Centre have not resumed after widespread violence erupted during the farmers' tractor rally on Republic Day this year.The farmer unions have repeatedly said that these new laws will eliminate the mandi and the minimum support price (MSP) policy, and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-kisan-morcha-to-hold-national-executive-meeting-in-delhi-today-101635557404855.html

He thanked the Indian government for its unstinted support and reiterated the shipyard's commitment to delivering the ships as per contractual timelines.India’s ambassador to Russia D Bala Venkatesh Varma highlighted the long-standing tradition of military-technical cooperation between the two countries.

30-10-2021||India||‘Good government is necessary for the happiness of a nation’||"Good government is no substitute for self-government,” said Campbell-Bannerman and Dadabhai Naoroji quoted it in 1906 at Calcutta. It is a very true statement.But the converse also is true. Good government is most necessary for the happiness of a modern nation and independence is no consolation in its place. A good administrative machinery, with just, industrious and honest people manning it, is a prime requisite for national happiness and progress.The machine should not be cluttered up with too many men and women, for that means waste in all directions. The object of an administrative machine is not either wholly or partially the removal of unemployment. Full employment must result from the policies of the government and from the enterprise, industry and integrity of citizens. To make the administrative machine itself a means of allaying unemployment would be a short-sighted and suicidal plan incapable of justification.The character of the administration must reflect the character of the people. But this cannot be a wholly limiting principle. It would be a vicious circle indeed, if the faults of a people were not to be mitigated but just reflected in the administration guiding and serving them. The better men must pull up the weaker ones, and the administrative machinery should be one of the agencies for the upward pull.Much more can be said and should be said on this subject. But I shall not attempt to do so here. All that I wish to emphasise on this day is that it is high time we campaigned for good administration as we did once for Independence. But this campaign should not degenerate into each one of us accusing ‘others’ of laziness or dishonesty or stupidity, all the while imagining that oneself is above blame.This will not help but only hinder by creating a general psychology of “ We are all worthless, there is no hope.” We should rather find ways for generating self-confidence, mutual trust, creative energy and just pride. We should not say to one another “ you are sinners“ and get into the habit of finding self-satisfaction in that process. We should rather try to remind one another that we are inherently good and should not allow ourselves to go bad. One school of philosophy holds that we are all pure and sinless. Another doctrine is that we are all born in sin. Swami Vivekananda used to say the former was the better thing to preach. The campaign of righteousness that I am deprecating is a third doctrine which says “Not I, but ‘you’ are sinners.” This, of course, is worse than what Swami Vivekananda deprecated.(The article appeared in the Hindustan Times on August 15, 1951.

30-10-2021||India||‘Elections in India are a modern innovation’||Elections in India, for all practical purposes, are a modern innovation, although it is stated that in ancient India there were sabhas and samitis and kin were elected, but all those traditions simply ceased to exist for centuries.The various Government of India Acts that were passed in course of the 19th and the 20th centuries gradually widened the franchise. A small beginning was made in the 80s of the last century. Then the India Council Act of 1893 brought peoples’ elected representatives in provincial as well as central legislatures. The Government of India Act of 1919 further widened the franchise. Under the Government of India Act of 1935, 10% of the population roughly was enfranchised. There was differential franchise both in terms of property and in terms of religion and sex. Three crores of people were enfranchised. Two general elections were held under that act--one in 1937 and the other in 1946. The percentage of people who exercised their right to vote hardly exceeded 50% in any province and the overall percentage was about 40%.The new Constitution of India provides for what is called adult franchise. In the opinion of many, this step is not merely revolutionary but is fraught with great danger. There are critics who think that India has taken a great risk. In the modern states of Europe and of America, the journey towards adult franchise has not been so sudden or so rapid as in India.In Europe this development is entirely modern. For, although the ancient world had its democracy, notably in Greece and, to some extent, in the Roman Republic, the forces which have determined the democratic trend of modern times were absent then. The older states have carried electoral reforms which have led to either adult or manhood suffrage; while the newly established states almost invariably wrote into their Constitution a clause bestowing universal suffrage irrespective of sex. India is thus following the example of all the modern states.It is evident that India could not have acted otherwise. The Preamble of the Constitution vests sovereignty in the people and it guarantees equality of status and of opportunity. There cannot be any discrimination between citizen and citizen.(The article appeared in the Hindustan Times on January 26, 1950. The writer was a freedom fighter and India’s first public works, mines and power minister.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elections-in-india-are-a-modern-innovation-101635543578524.html
30-10-2021||India||Tribals protest in Bijapur jungles to seek action on Edesmetta encounter report||Around 200 tribals are protesting in the jungles of Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region since October 9 to demand action on the judicial inquiry report about the Edesmetta encounter and seek compensation, police said.The protest is being held near Pusnar village under Gangaloor police station of the district.In September 2021, a judicial inquiry report on the Edesmetta encounter was submitted to the state cabinet, eight years after security personnel allegedly gunned down eight people, including four minors in Edesmetta village. The inquiry report said that the people killed in the encounter were not Maoists and the security forces ‘might have opened fire due to panic’.On Tuesday, hundreds of tribals of Edesmetta and nearby villages gathered in Pusnaar and started a protest.On Wednesday, the villagers also handed over a memorandum to a tehsildar and demanded an FIR against the accused and ₹1 crore compensation to each tribal who died in the encounter.Tribal activist of Bastar, Soni Sori also reached the spot, on Wednesday, and expressed her support. “We are demanding FIR against security personnel accused of killing innocent tribals,” said Sori.Human rights activists working in the region said the government should punish the policemen as soon as possible.“A judicial inquiry has little meaning if there is no follow up. The report has not yet been tabled in the assembly, as is the official procedure. The government is duty-bound to act on the findings of the report: punish the guilty policemen including the officials in command and compensate victim families. The government cannot go in hiding like any ordinary murderer,” said Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist who works in the Bastar region.Police officials said the government may issue necessary instructions based on the recommendations of the judicial commission.“The local administration and police are in communication with the villagers and explained to them that the Edesmetta judicial inquiry report is yet to be tabled in the Vidhan Sabha. After following the due procedure, the government might issue necessary instructions based on the recommendations of the judicial commission,” said Inspector General of Police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P.The IG further said that as far as the opposition for opening new base camps is concerned, villagers are aware of the benefits of security camps in their locality.“Each and every security camp opened in Bastar has acted as an integrated development centre and brought positive changes to the region. Because of compulsion from naxal cadres, villagers are forced to stage such protest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribals-protest-in-bijapur-jungles-demand-action-on-edesmetta-encounter-report-101635543501515.html
30-10-2021||India||An epic exercise in 4 months||How different was India’s first Lok Sabha election?Independent India’s first Lok Sabha election was unlike most that would follow. This is not just because of the challenges involved in holding an election for the first time in a country where an overwhelming majority was still illiterate. The nature of seats — the basic unit of contest in the election — themselves were unlike today’s seats. And while the nature of the contest and the result seems a given (at least in hindsight), there were some surprises. Here are three charts that detail India’s first Lok Sabha election.Multiple seat constituenciesIn the first two Lok Sabha elections, parliamentary constituencies (PCs) could have more than one seat. In the 1951-1952 election, there were 314 PCs with one seat, 86 with two seats, and the North Bengal PC had three seats. While only 10 seats in the single-seat PCs were reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST), the multiple seat PCs had equal representation for general and Scheduled Caste (SC) or ST categories. In the two-seat PCs, one seat was reserved for either SC or ST candidates. Of the 86 such PCs, in 71 the reserved seat was for SCs and in 15 for STs. In the three-seat PCs, one seat each was for SC, ST, and general category candidates. A 1961 law abolished such PCs by breaking them up into single-seat PCs of the kind we know today.The number of contesting parties was significantFifty two parties participated in the 1951-52 election. Then there were the independents. This number was not matched subsequently until the 1971 election when 53 parties contested the election. The number again dropped to the mid-30s until 1989. Since then, though, the number of contesting parties has always been above 100.To be sure, only the Congress contested a large proportion of the seats on offer. Since the Election Commission of India (ECI) has only published PC-wise statistics, it is only possible to count the number of unique candidates fielded by each party. The Congress fielded 479 candidates across all states except in the one-PC Bilaspur (located in present-day Himachal Pradesh). Jayapraskash Narayan’s Socialist Party (SP), which fielded the second-highest number of candidates, fielded only about half that number (254 candidates) across all big states. J B Kripalani’s Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP) fielded only 145. All other parties fielded less than 100 candidates. The Communist Party of India (CPI), for example, fielded 49 candidates, 25 of them in Madras and West Bengal. (Chart 1: Parties that fielded more than 10 candidates)
30-10-2021||India||‘I am from Brahmin family but…’: Mamata’s sharp counterattack at BJP in Goa||PANAJI: Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday vowed to take her fight to the BJP, accusing them of propagating a culture of bullying and hate, contrasting it with her party that she promises Goa “a new dawn”.Addressing multiple events during her packed schedule - she said it was the first of her many visits to the state in the future - the West Bengal chief minister said she was determined to fight what she called “the poison of communalism”.Referring to the events in Tripura where anti-Muslim violence was witnessed earlier this week, Mamata said: “Wherever the BJP government is there, they are not allowing people to go out, they are not allowing people to be in a peaceful manner... It is not only Tripura. Under the Assam BJP government, the same thing you will see, you come to Goa they will deface you, they will show you the black flags,” Banerjee said. “If I come to Goa they deface my posters. Go ahead and deface. One day you will be defaced from India then you will know. What they are doing we will not take revenge like this. We will work for the people,” Banerjee said.Many billboards, posters and banners put up by the TMC were defaced or ripped out allegedly by persons sympathetic to the local BJP ahead of Mamta’s visit. At the airport, a group of around two dozen people shouted slogans and waved black flags as her convoy passed by. “We don’t divide the people like Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isai (Christian) we unite the people. That is our motto. I may die but I will not divide the country. I am proud to say every drop of my blood is for unity. I don’t divide. Sometimes BJP says: ‘She’s anti-Hindu.’ I am Hindu. Will you give me [a] character certificate? That I am Hindu or that I am Muslim? Who are you to give the character certificate? First you decide your character certificate, then for others. I’m also from a Brahmin family but I didn’t say all these things,” she added.Mamata Banerjee also defended her party’s decision to enter the political space in Goa and rubbished claims that she was in Goa to split anti-BJP votes. “When other parties came here, did you ask them whether they were here to split the votes? Should only Delhi parties be allowed to come here?” Banerjee asked, an apparent reference to the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is taking its second shot at attempting to enter Goa’s political space.“You can trust that Dilli ka dadagiri nahi chalega (The bullying from Delhi will not be tolerated). Dadagiri amkam naka (We don’t want bullying),” she said.“Some are asking ‘I’m in Bengal, how can I go to Goa?’ I’m Indian, I can go anywhere. I came here because my brothers and sisters want it. We are a national party. If we go anywhere, you (BJP) will deface us, you will show us the black flag, you will not give us the permission, why? Because they know that TMC will die but they will never compromise. That is the thing they are afraid of,” she said.“We have also decided that we will work for Goa in a strong manner. It is not that we want to divide the vote. You have got so many opportunities for political parties, give one opportunity for other political parties. Give one opportunity to AITC. It is also a national party and simply we say TMC -- Temple, Mosque Church, that is our motto,” she added.Banerjee sidestepped questions on her party’s plans to enter into an alliance with regional or like-minded political parties, saying that it was too early to make a decision or to announce her party’s presumptive chief minister.“I cannot discuss details in this meeting because it depends on the situation and everything, local leaders, we have to discuss everything, it’s a collective decision. It is not an individual decision so I cannot tell you right now. If anybody is interested to work with us, we will be happy,” she said.Earlier in the day, Banerjee welcomed into the party former professional tennis player Leander Paes as well as actress and politician Nafisa Ali who back in 2004 had contested against her on a Congress ticket in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. “I was born in Bengal, but at the end of the day, I am a very patriotic Indian. For me, whether it is in Bengal or whether it is in Goa, or whether it is playing at Wimbledon. For me it is about making India proud and in that, now living in Goa I would like to make a difference in my roots,” Paes said after being formally inducted in the party.“The only leader today that can take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah’s brand of politics is Mamata Banerjee… The BJP needs to be addressed in all sincerity and Mamata has proved that she and she alone can become the tigress that can take on the likes of Narendra Modi,” Nafisa Ali said soon after she was inducted into the party at her home.Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said he was not worried by the increasing number of parties setting up shop in Goa.“In 2017 too, many parties both from within Goa and those from outside set up shop in Goa. After the election, they went away and now it is election season once again they are back. I believe that besides the BJP and Congress -- BJP will be in ruling and Congress will be in opposition -- other parties won’t have an impact. Finally, it depends on the voters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-from-brahmin-family-but-mamata-s-sharp-counterattack-at-bjp-in-goa-101635542874993.html
30-10-2021||India||Can’t go abroad with Covaxin, allow revaccination, said plea in SC. Declined||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said that it cannot play with the lives of people by directing persons who have received both doses of Covaxin to get re-vaccinated with Covishield pending the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to grant emergency use approval to the Indian-made vaccine.The wait for WHO decision on Covaxin has stalled travel plans of persons who were fully vaccinated with Covaxin.Representing their cause, a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer Kartik Seth said, “All the individuals fully vaccinated with Covaxin are being treated by all major countries as un-vaccinated individuals and are made to either quarantine or are not completely allowed within their borders.”Seth wished to take his aged parents to the United Kingdom but could not do so for this reason. He urged the court to pass an order allowing their revaccination with Covishield, which has received WHO approval in February this year. “Under the present scenario, a person is not permitted to get vaccinated with Covishield by registering on the official website of Government of India, “CoWIN” after having been fully vaccinated with Covaxin,” the petition said, seeking an order from the top court.“We cannot play with the lives of people,” said a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna as it asked the petitioner to await WHO’s decision. “How can we direct that those who had full doses of Covaxin should get Covishield. This involves scientific data.”The petitioner pointed to the delay faced by Covaxin in getting WHO approval and sought details on the material supplied by the vaccine manufacturer Bharat Biotech Limited to WHO. “How are you entitled to the data supplied by WHO,” the bench shot back, wondering if the petitioner was pursuing the cause of a rival vaccine manufacturer.“This is the reason we do not want to entertain such petitions. This is the danger that competitors can use this court to fight their battle,” the bench observed. Seth told the court that his interest was purely in the public interest as several students and professionals were unable to travel despite being fully vaccinated.The bench said, “Let us keep a watch on what is happening. We have read in the newspapers that Bharat Biotech has lately submitted additional documents to the WHO. If the authorization comes, your purpose will be served.” The court posted the matter after a week.According to the petitioner, till August, 70 million Covaxin doses were administered in the country ever since the vaccination process commenced in the country on January 16. The petition asked why the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave emergency use authorization to Covaxin at a time when its Phase-3 trial results were awaited. It came in only in July.“The respondents (Centre), at the time of rolling out of Covaxin for use in the market, failed to make the public aware that it was not approved by WHO and that it has not even submitted an application before WHO for approval which was submitted as late as in April 2021…. Another blemish in the vaccination drive was that only from May 1, (commencement of third phase of vaccination in India) that the public was allowed to choose the vaccine as per their wish,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-go-abroad-with-covaxin-allow-revaccination-said-plea-in-sc-declined-101635541734982.html

But the way he faced those challenges should be taught in management schools as a case study of effective leadership and efficient governance. A hundred years ago, Gandhi ji was advocating Swadeshi in this country. About sixty years ago, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay was talking about Swadeshi. In the nineties, the BJP also raised this issue in a big way. Now Modi has brought Swadeshi 4.0,” Singh said, while addressing a conference on “Delivering Democracy: Reviewing two decades of Narendra Modi as head of government”, organised by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-linked think tank, Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-governance-model-should-be-a-case-study-in-b-schools-rajnath-singh-101635541130716.html

30-10-2021||India||NGT stays Telangana govt’s ₹32,000 crore lift irrigation work||Hyderabad In a setback to the Telangana government, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday ordered a stay on the construction of the prestigious Palamuru Ranga Reddy lift irrigation scheme (PRLIS) being built on Krishna river on the grounds that it has no environmental clearance.An interim order to this effect was issued by the southern bench of the NGT at Chennai, after a prolonged hearing on the petitions filed by the Andhra Pradesh government and a couple of farmers.Senior counsel for Andhra Pradesh government in the tribunal D Madhuri Reddy told Hindustan Times that the tribunal had asked the Telangana government to stop all the works on Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift irrigation project until it obtained environmental clearance from the ministry of environment and forests (MOEF), Government of India.“The tribunal has also rejected the Telangana government’s argument that AP government has no locus standi in raising objections over the project five years after its commencement,” Madhuri Reddy said.The PRLIS is aimed at drawing 90 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) of Krishna river from the backwaters of Srisailam reservoir for 60 days during the flood season to irrigate 1.23 million acres in Nagarkurnool, Rangareddy, Narayanpet, Mahbubnagar, Vikarabad and Nalgonda districts, besides providing drinking water to en route villages and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, besides industrial use. The estimated cost of the project is ₹32,500 crore.In July this year, a couple of farmers - Kosigi Venkataiah from Mahabubnagar district and D Chandramouli Reddy from Kadapa district- filed petitions before the NGT, Chennai bench. The Mahbubnagar farmer opposed the project stating that the authorities were indulging in indiscriminate extraction of soil from lakes to build a huge bund for Udandapur reservoir. The Kadapa farmer contended that the PRLIS was being constructed in the name of drinking water scheme without obtaining environmental clearance from the Centre.Later, the Andhra Pradesh government, too, impleaded in the case, stating that there is no need to excavate huge canals, tunnels and construct six reservoirs, if the PRLIS is meant for drinking water supply purposes.Subsequently, the NGT constituted a joint committee consisting of a senior officer from the Union environment and forest ministry, a senior scientist from CPCB, Chennai, district collector, Mahabubnagar, director, mines and geology, and a senior scientist from National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to inspect the project works and submit a report by August 27.However, the committee failed to take up the inspection and submit the report as directed by the NGT due to the non-cooperation of Telangana government. Later, the tribunal appointed Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) chairman as nodal officer to get the inspection panel report.The joint committee inspected project works in September and submitted a report to the NGT in October first week stating that Telangana took up irrigation works in PRLIS, instead of permitted drinking water component works. Following this, the NGT ordered a stay on Palarmaru-Rangareddy project works.“The tribunal said the objections raised by the Andhra Pradesh government were valid and the responses given by the Telangana government were not satisfactory,” the AP government’s counsel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-stays-telangana-govt-s-32-crore-lift-irrigation-work-101635535376508.html

Israel accounted for 13% of India’s imports during 2016-20 after Russia (49%) and France (18%).The decision to form the task force to identify new areas of cooperation for the next decade was taken during the 15th JWG meeting co-chaired by defence secretary Ajay Kumar and the director general of the Israel’s Ministry of Defence, Maj Gen Amir Eshel (retd) earlier this week.“The two sides reviewed the progress made in military-to-military engagements including exercises and industry cooperation. The co-chairs were apprised of the progress made by the sub working groups (SWGs) on defence procurement and production and research & development,” the ministry said in a statement. India and Israel also agreed to form an SWG on defence industry cooperation for efficient utilisation of resources, effective flow of technologies and sharing industrial capabilities, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaisrael-to-work-on-10-year-roadmap-in-defence-sector-101635533935943.html

The government feels that some of the provisions are onerous and will not provide the state much flexibility considering the manner in which bill is presently structured,” one of the people mentioned above said.The Joint Parliamentary Committee, set up to look into the draft law since 2019 and submit its report, has been given several deadline extensions. The report drafted was yet to be circulated for final inputs by members despite their demands.As per the summary now shared, the report proposes to treat social media platforms as publishers -- a move that would make them liable for content posted by users -- and to add back the condition of “just, fair, reasonable and proportionate” in Section 35, which deals with exemptions that the government can claim in accessing personal data, one of the people cited above said.This was of particular concern because the bill cleared by the government allowed for the government to claim an exemption as long as it felt it was “necessary or expedient” to do so in a particular set of circumstances, such as those relating to national security.There has also been pushback against social media companies being treated as publishers and both the I-T department and UIDAI have sought exemptions under section 35.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-uidai-i-t-dept-flag-concerns-over-personal-data-protection-bill-101635533754592.html

On its part, the central anti-corruption probe agency will also pass information pertaining to any corrupt practices by contractors and agents to the concerned departments.A drafting committee, headed by chief vigilance commissioner Suresh N Patel and assisted by CBI special director Praveen Sinha, made public the updates earlier this week.The updated CVC manual is the eighth since 1968, and is a compilation of various rules, instructions and guidelines issued from time to time. It acts as a guidebook for government departments and enforcement agencies in vigilance matters.For the first time, the CVC has included in its manual the mode of keeping a secret watch on “gazetted officers of doubtful integrity (ODI)” in the “Agreed List”. An “Agreed List” is prepared by concerned government departments in consultation with the CBI.Similarly, the CVC has explained the procedure for adding or deleting names from the list of gazetted ODI, as well as the list of undesirable contact men (UCM), prepared by the CBI, who are suspected of resorting to corrupt or irregular practices in their dealings with official agencies. Another key addition in the latest document is preparing an “Agreed List of Points and Places of Corruption”, which will be prepared by the CBI after discussion with the concerned head of department or chief vigilance officers (CVOs) at its local offices in the beginning of the calendar year.“The latest CVC manual is comprehensive and has several new additions. The plan is to update it annually so that administrative authorities and vigilance officers/agencies empowered to investigate corruption matters have the latest information,” an official said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cvc-directs-depts-to-keep-eye-on-officers-of-doubtful-integrity-101635533334367.html
30-10-2021||India||US firm eyes trials for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin but delay in EUL a concern||Even as World Health Organization (WHO) will decide on the grant of emergency use listing for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on November 3, US biopharmaceutical company, Ocugen, has announced the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with USFDA to begin US trials of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Ocugen has the rights to commercialize Bharat Biotech’s inactivated whole virion anti-Covid-19 vaccine in the United States and Canada. “…submitted an Investigational New Drug application (IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BBV152, known as COVAXIN™ outside the United States,” Ocugen said in a statement on WednesdayThe Phase 3 trial proposed to be done in the US will be more like a bridging study.“We are hopeful that the study conducted under the IND, if allowed to proceed, will help demonstrate that the data from India will be applicable to the U.S. population,” said Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Ocugen.Bharat Biotech itself seems stuck in a regulatory loop, with WHO on Tuesday missing another deadline for the grant of emergency use listing. Independent technical experts of the UN health body analysing the data instead sought more clarification from the vaccine maker.Earlier, a decision on Covaxin EUL was expected on October 5, after WHO representatives sought additional information on September 27.“Let me say that Bharat has been submitting data regularly and very quickly, but they submitted the last batch of data on the 18th of October,” said Dr Mariangela Simao, assistant director general, access to medicines and health products, WHO, on Thursday. She was responding to a question on the delay.It is not yet clear, what data has been submitted to the WHO for grant of EUL, as neither the company nor the UN health body has made it public. Interestingly, the company has been claiming that Covaxin data has been ready for perusal since June, this year.Bharat Biotech did not respond to queries on the latest delay.WHO’s emergency use licences typically assess safety and efficacy, risk management plans, cold chain requirements, and sometimes extend to physical inspection of manufacturing sites. For instance, in the case of Sinopharm’s vaccine, which, like Bharat Biotech’s, is an inactivated one, WHO conducted onsite inspections of the manufacturing facility.Bharat Biotech is yet to publish the results of its Phase 3 trials in any of the peer-reviewed journals, and the clinical efficacy results against Covid-19 infection have made their way into the public domain through a pre-print study that was posted on medRxiv in July, this year, or press notes declaring 93.4% efficacy against severe disease, 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic disease, and 63.6% efficacy against asymptomatic disease.“Let me just clarify and without wanting to mention any specific manufacturer but saying that we have assessed an Indian manufacturer earlier in the year and it took 30 days… So, this is not about moving quicker with one or another vaccine…,” added Simao.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to WHO director general, said, “We’re committed at the organisation from the very top under the Director General to move these processes as rapidly as possible. But let’s be very clear, the timeline for EULing a vaccine depends 99% on manufacturers, the speed, the completeness with which they can get data to the independent groups that assesses for WHO. We just want to be very, very clear on that point.”The grant of emergency use authorisation to Covaxin by India’s drugs regulator on January 3, 2021, also was severely criticised as the company was yet to make public even interim efficacy results at the time. A government official directly involved in the process said “the vaccine data is robust”. He added: “These are procedural measures that need to be duly followed. Experts seek clarification on some points, which the company provides. Not too much should be read into it.”But WHO’s delay in granting an EUL to Covaxin has raised questions in some quarters, especially because the body has not delayed approvals to many of the other vaccines that are part of the vaccine drives of countries.“Look at vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, and one of the Chinese vaccines, they were cleared pretty fast. Bharat Biotech needs to present its case properly. And if there are data discrepancies, then what was the Indian regulator doing? Why haven’t the Indian experts asked similar questions? On what basis was the emergency use authorisation given?” asked a senior public health expert, requesting anonymity.But most experts believe that it is just a matter of time now before the approval is granted. “The technical expert group has to look at the data from various angles... therefore, you do need additional data at times. Whatever is causing the delay seems to be a minor issue,” said Dr Narinder Kumar Mehra, senior immunologist, and former dean, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.With inputs from pti||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-firm-eyes-trials-for-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-but-delay-in-eul-a-concern-101635533279027.html
30-10-2021||India||India’s stealth warship launched in Russia||The Indian Navy’s latest frigate was on Thursday launched at Russia’s Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, as Russia prepares to deliver two new warships to India in 2023, adding significant capability to the navy for projecting power in the Indian Ocean Region where the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is seeking to enhance its presence, officials familiar with the developments said on Friday.The warship’s launch marks a significant milestone in its construction and refers to the ship entering water for the first time.The warship, named Tushil, is part of an over $2.5-billion deal with Russia for four more Krivak/Talwar class stealth frigates for the Indian Navy, two of which are being constructed at the Yantar Shipyard and the remaining two will be built at the Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) with technology transfer from Russia, which is India’s top arms supplier, said one of the officials cited above. Tushil is expected to be commissioned into the Indian Navy in mid-2023 followed by its sister ship in 2023-end, said a second official.The construction of these ships is based on the Indian Navy’s specific requirements to meet the entire spectrum of naval warfare in air, surface and sub-surface domains. “The ships with a potent combination of state-of-art Indian and Russian weapons and sensors are equipped to operate in littoral (near the shores) and blue waters, both as a single unit and as consort in a naval task force,” the Navy said in a statement.The warships feature stealth technology and have low radar and underwater noise signatures, besides being equipped with Indian-supplied equipment such as surface-to-surface missiles, sonar system, surface surveillance radar, communication suite and anti-submarine warfare systems along with Russian surface-to-air missiles and gun mounts, the navy added.The navy currently operates six stealth frigates — three Talwar class and three Teg class — bought from Russia and inducted between 2003 and 2013.The new Grigorovich-class ‘Project 1135.6’ frigates will be powered by gas turbine engines supplied by Ukrainian firm Ukroboronprom’s Gas Turbine Research & Production Complex Zorya-Mashproekt.“The four new frigates will be armed with cutting-edge technologies, weapons and sensors that will pack a significant punch,” said former GSL chairman Rear Admiral Shekhar Mital (retd), who is now a member of the Public Enterprises Selection Board that advises the Centre on top appointments to public sector enterprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-stealth-warship-launched-in-russia-101635533277721.html
30-10-2021||India||‘Covid vaccination is currently very uneven’: Gavi deputy CEO Anuradha Gupta interview||The imbalance between demand and supply has led to protectionist measures by countries that are Covid-19 vaccine producers, frantic purchasing by richer economies, and profit-seeking by manufacturers, said Anuradha Gupta, Gavi ‘s deputy CEO, in an interview to HT. Gavi-the Vaccine Alliance leads the Covax facility that was created last year to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines across the world.How do you see the global Covid vaccination journey so far?Covid vaccination is currently very uneven. 80% of people in high -and upper middle- income countries have already received their first dose compared to only 20% of people in low- and lower middle-income countries. This means that despite Covid-19 vaccines having been developed at an extraordinary pace and despite vaccines proving to be highly effective in reducing serious disease and hospitalizations, the full benefits have not been reaped.mRNA vaccines have been a major breakthrough, signalling huge potential to combat other serious diseases in future. Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, trialled and approved at an unprecedented pace. These are major achievements.How many vaccine doses have been distributed under the Covax facility and to how many countries? And since when?Operating within a supply-constrained environment has been hugely challenging. Still, Covax has managed to deliver nearly 400 million doses across the world.Covax didn’t receive as many vaccine doses for distribution as initially expected.Covax has been steadfast in its goal to deliver 2 billion doses though the timelines have shifted depending on supply availability. Several countries have responded to the call to donate their surplus doses. All things going well, as many as 1.4 billion doses might be made available in 2021 itself.How much did Covax arrangement suffer because of India restricting exports. Since India has opened up exports again, how much is the Covax facility expected to get in the first lot from here, and by when?Our earliest and largest advance purchase agreements were with the Serum Institute of India ( SII). Gavi is the single largest procurer of childhood vaccines and SII is among our major suppliers, with a strong track record... So lack of timely supply from SII has severely impacted the ability of Covax to rapidly deliver doses to lower income countries.Though Covax now has a diversified portfolio comprising of 11 vaccines, SII supplies would greatly help to reduce vaccine inequity.This pandemic also found countries indulging in vaccine nationalism. What are the lessons learnt, and possible solutions to avert similar experiences in future?One of the key lessons we’ve witnessed is that a global mechanism like Covax can succeed in its mission only if all parties including country governments and manufacturers fulfil their commitments. If that doesn’t happen, institutions and leaders lose credibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gavi-deputy-ceo-anuradha-gupta-interview-covid-vaccination-is-currently-very-uneven-101635533034236.html

The child’s father, Ranjit Yadav, subsequently lodged a complaint with the police following which an FIR was lodged on Thursday night, said Mirzapur district magistrate Praveen Kumar Lakshkar.Vishwakarma was arrested on Friday and booked under sections 352 (criminal force or assault) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 75 of Juvenile Justice Act, an officer added.Vishwakarma, meanwhile, also tendered an apology to the child’s father, regretting his act.Basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), Gautam Prasad, said an explanation has been sought from Vishwakarma and a notice issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mirzapur-school-manager-arrested-for-dangling-5-year-old-student-101635532854355.html
30-10-2021||India||Extortion charges: Police beginprobe against Wankhede, other NCB officers||Mumbai A four-member Mumbai Police team, headed by an officer of rank of assistant commissioner of police (ACP), has begun its probe into allegations of corruption against officers of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), including Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, the lead investigator in the cruise drugs raid case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was arrested earlier this month.“If the enquiry reveals commission of any cognisable offence, a First Information Report (FIR) would be registered against the concerned person/s and further investigation would be commenced as per due procedure,” an officer familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity.At least four police stations have received complaints against NCB officials and Wankhede after Prabhakar Sail, an independent witness in the drugs case, in an affidavit on October 23 claimed that investigators made him sign on 10 sheets of blank paper at their office on the day of the raid. Sail also alleged that he overheard his employer, Kiran Gosavi (another witness in the case) speaking on the phone about extorting ₹25 crore to settle the case and release Aryan Khan, which could be negotiated to ₹18 crore, with ₹8 crore purportedly for Wankhede. The affidavit further stated that Gosavi met Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, and a purported exchange of money took place between them on October 3. Aryan was arrested later that afternoon and released on Friday. Wankhede has denied all allegations made in the affidavit. “This is a malicious allegation to target my reputation. I condemn it,” he said.The Mumbai Police team, led by ACP Milind Khetle of Azad Maidan division, and comprising inspector Ajay Sawant (Colaba police station), sub-inspector Prakash Gawli (cyber police) and assistant inspector Shrikant Karkar (anti-narcotics cell), began examining call detail records (CDR), close circuit television (CCTV) footage at the locations where the alleged meetings took place and where a bag of cash was purportedly exchanged. It also began examining the phone call locations of NCB officials and other individuals who were part of the alleged extortion plan. “The focus of our inquiry is to ascertain how the money transactions, if any, took place. Sail said that there were cash transactions and proving that will be very challenging. We are in the process of identifying witnesses who were part of the alleged transaction or witnessed it. Only after finding strong evidence will we register an FIR,” another officer said on condition of anonymity. “Once we establish that money transactions were made for the purposes of bribery or extortion, we will try to ascertain whether Gosavi was acting on his own or whether he was following any NCB officer’s orders,” the officer added.The police team is being supervised by additional commissioner Dilip Sawant and deputy commissioner of police Hemrajsingh Rajput. Sail, who was interrogated by Mumbai Police for several hours on October 27 and 28, filed an application seeking protection at Sahar police station on October 25. “He has shared all details to substantiate his claims,” Sail’s lawyer Tushar Khandare said. A separate enquiry is being conducted by a vigilance team, led by NCB deputy director general Gyaneshwar Singh, based on Sail’s allegations. The team, which is currently in Mumbai, has recorded the statements of eight people, including Wankhede and four other NCB officers, so far. It has also sought Sail’s participation in the enquiry. “[On Thursday] We requested the Mumbai Police commissioner also to convey our message to Sail, as we learnt through various media reports that he was being investigated by them, to join our inquiry. Surprisingly, Sail has not come forward. In the last three days, we have used all our sources to serve him a notice directly and also through his relatives and also contacted his advocate,” Singh told reporters on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extortion-charges-police-beginprobe-against-wankhede-other-ncbofficers-101635532733625.html

We don't have any data with us. We have read in newspapers that Bharat Biotech has filed an application with the World Health Organisation for recognition. Let us wait for the response of WHO. We will take up this matter post-Diwali vacation,” news agency ANI reported, quoting the top court.The petition, which was lodged by lawyer Kartik Seth stated that owing to Covaxin’s non-recognition by the WHO, several students and other people, who are willing to go overseas, are facing issues as they’re denied entry into the country.The WHO approval of Covaxin was delayed further on Tuesday after a meeting by the United Nations health agency on the same day. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has been asked for additional data by the WHO, and will meet again on November 3 to discuss the emergency use listing (EUL) of the indigenous Covid-19 vaccine.Bharat Biotech had applied for the WHO nod in late April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-says-can-t-play-with-lives-on-plea-to-allow-revaccination-with-covishield-101635532009757.html
30-10-2021||India||Will ensure a crime, corruption-free govt in Punjab: Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday intensified his pitch for the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, accusing the ruling Congress in Punjab of “patronising corruption”. He also promised to clear the pending VAT refunds of traders and businessmen in three-four months and provide round-the-clock electricity to the industries in the state, if the AAP is voted to power.“Our goal is to create a prosperous Punjab and lead it towards progress. We will provide a crime-free and corruption-free government,” he said, addressing a gathering of traders and businessmen in Bathinda on the concluding day of his two-day Punjab visit.Responding to the concerns of some traders about the alleged “goonda tax”, he said the AAP will ensure safety of traders. “After our government comes to power in Punjab, from April 1, 2022, it will be our responsibility to ensure the safety of every businessman,” he said.“We will give you an honest government in Punjab like in Delhi. We ended the Inspector Raj and the Raid Raj in Delhi.”“If voted to power, we will ensure prompt clearance of huge arrears of the obsolete VAT (value-added tax). We will ensure transparent governance and safety of businessmen.”Kejriwal also accused other political parties of thinking about the traders and businessmen “only at the time of polls because they need funds”. “But we do not need money from you. I have come to make you a partner in Punjab’s progress. We will create a conducive atmosphere so that trade and industry flourishes,” he said.Taking a dig at the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government in Punjab, which recently hosted an investors’ summit, Kejriwal said, “They invite big industrialists and say so much investment has come. But efforts are not made to save the existing industry, which is shifting out to other places.”Hitting back, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal said: “Is it the first time he (Kejriwal) has levelled charges of corruption against his political rivals?... It is typical of a coward. How does he get the right to become a certification authority?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-if-voted-to-power-aap-will-ensure-a-crime-corruption-free-govt-in-punjab-101635532315301.html
30-10-2021||India||Congress says Centre will have to 'remove' farm laws like Ghazipur border barricade||In an indirect dig to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre following the removal of police barricades from Delhi’s Tikri and Ghazipur borders, Congress took to Twitter to say that the “arrogant power” that was forced to remove the barricades will also “have to remove the black laws.”Scores of farmers from across India have been protesting at Delhi’s Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri borders since November 2020 against the three farm laws passed by the central government. The barricades were brought in after the Republic Day violence this year, following which the Delhi Police had even installed nails and barbed wire at the borders in an attempt to stop the farmers from entering the national capital.बेरिकेड हटाने को मजबूर अहंकारी सत्ता को काले कानून भी हटाने पड़ेंगे।The Delhi Police announced on Thursday that the blockades will be removed from the borders, following an order by the Supreme Court on October 21 stating that while the farmers have every right to protest, roads should not be indefinitely blocked for the purpose. The apex court made the direction while hearing a plea pertaining to the blocking of roads on the Delhi-Noida route due to the protests. Furthermore, the court said that it was the authorities that had stopped the traffic and not the protesting farmers.Traffic movement has been hindered on the Delhi-Ghaziabad route, and also on the Delhi-Meerut expressway with farmers setting up temporary tents and parking their tractor trolleys by the roads.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said that with the removal of barricades, which were stopping them from going to Delhi, the farmers will “sell their harvest” in the national capital and will also go to the parliament to sell their crop.“The PM (PM Narendra Modi) said that farmers can sell crops anywhere. Now we will tell the farmers where to sell the crops whose harvest remains unsold. If roads are open, we will go to Delhi. We will go to Parliament to sell our crop,” Tikait told news agency ANI.The farmers’ union later issued a statement as well wherein it clarified that the stir against the three farms laws, which has been active for nearly 11 months, will continue. The BKU said that there is no change in the agitation, and the removal of the barricades is Delhi Police’s move to “correct its mistake” following the order of the Supreme Court. Stressing that a large number of farmers remain at the Ghazipur border, the union also urged other farmers to join the stir by reaching the site. “Every day there is conspiracy against the movement. We have to be prepared against every conspiracy,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-says-centre-will-have-to-remove-farm-laws-like-ghazipur-barricade-101635531295473.html
30-10-2021||India||Fewer convictions in SC/ST cases due to ‘shoddy investigations’: Supreme Court||Atrocities against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) are “not a thing of the past”, lamented the Supreme Court on Friday, as it underscored that the conviction rates in SC/ST cases were low in India not due to the falsity of charges but because of shoddy investigations.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna highlighted that several members of the SC/ST community “face insurmountable hurdles in accessing justice from the stage of filing the complaint to the conclusion of the trial” and that they “specifically suffer on account of procedural lapses in the criminal justice system”.It noted that due to the fear of retribution from members of upper caste groups, ignorance, or police apathy, many SC/ST victims do not register complaints in the first place and when they do so, the police officials are reluctant to register complaints or do not record allegations accurately.“Eventually, if the case does get registered, the victims and witnesses are vulnerable to intimidation, violence, and social and economic boycott. Further, many perpetrators of caste-based atrocities get away scot free due to shoddy investigations and the negligence of prosecuting advocates,” rued the bench. “This results in low conviction rates under the SC/ST Act, giving rise to the erroneous perception that cases registered under the Act are false and that it is being misused. On the contrary, the reality is that many acquittals are a result of improper investigation and prosecution of crime, leading to insufficient evidence,” it added.Crimes registered under the SC/ST Act saw an increase of 9.4% (for SC) and 9.3% (for ST) in 2020 compared to the previous year, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). A total of 50,291 cases were registered for crimes against SCs last year. The number was 45,961 in 2019. Meanwhile, 8,272 cases were registered for crimes against STs in 2020 as against 7,570 cases in 2019. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar recorded the highest rate of crimes against SCs. Kerala, Rajasthan and Telangana recorded the highest rate of crimes against STs. Only 216 cases from the 50,291 crimes against SCs in 2020 resulted in convictions. A total of 3,192 cases resulted in acquittals.The bench expressed its views on the implementation of the SC/ST Act while setting aside the bail granted to one Satyanarayan in 2019 in a case of murder of a member of SC/ST community. The appeal against grant of bail was filed in the top court on the grounds that the Punjab & Haryana high court passed the order without hearing the complainant or witness even though the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities Act) makes it mandatory.Noting that all the courts must strictly follow the procedure mandated under the SC/ST Act, the SC held that a victim of a caste-based crime must be given due notice and an opportunity to be heard whenever proceedings relating to bail or trial are taken up.The court cited Section 15A of the SC/ST Act to point out that the legislation makes it mandatory to hear a victim or complainant when the courts hear the petitions by the accused.“Atrocities against members of the SCs and STs are not a thing of the past. They continue to be a reality in our society even today. Hence the statutory provisions which have been enacted by Parliament as a measure of protecting the constitutional rights of persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes must be complied with and enforced conscientiously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-convictions-in-sc-st-cases-due-to-shoddy-investigations-supreme-court-101635531834261.html
30-10-2021||India||PM Modi meets EU leaders over climate, economy||The G20 member-states have reached a “broad consensus” on the issue of recognising vaccine certificates for resumption of travel and economic activities to boost post-pandemic recovery, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said ahead of a meeting of the grouping in Rome, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached earlier on Friday.Modi began a series of bilateral meetings on the margins of the G20 Summit, beginning with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to review India-EU tiesGoyal, who is India’s G20 sherpa or personal representative of the head of government for preparing for the grouping’s summit, told a news briefing in Rome the country had made “significant interventions” in discussions on key issues such as mutual recognition of vaccine certificates, sustainable development and climate change that will figure in the declaration to be issued after the G20 Summit.He said there was “broad consensus” on mutual recognition of vaccine certificates because all the nations wish to resume travel and economic activity. The G20 members are working towards acceptable language to bring the matter within the grouping’s framework, he said.India and some other states pushed for inclusion of vaccine certificates into the health paragraph of the proposed declaration so that it takes centre stage for current and future pandemics. The declaration is expected to address the recognition of both vaccines and certificates, and the G20 is also looking at building capacity and strengthening processes for faster approval of more vaccines, he said.“We are quite confident that there is broad consensus and the language is being worked out on how we can bring it in. To bring in the sense and bring confidence to the world, that we are all committed to faster recovery, resilient recovery, yet at the same time ensuring that there is sufficient policy space for nations to protect their own national interests,” Goyal said.The G20 sherpas have held discussions over the past three days on the proposed declaration to be adopted at the G20 Summit during October 30-31. Goyal said India had spoken for developing and low and middle income countries at these talks, and most G20 states had endorsed the country’s position that “extensive Covid-19 immunisation is a global public good”.On climate change and environment, India spoke on the “need for critical enablers for galvanising global climate action”, including commensurate long-term concessional climate finance, access to affordable and sustainable technology, and a commitment to adopt sustainable lifestyles and responsible consumption patterns, Goyal said.As co-chair of the G20 framework working group on economic recovery, India is ensuring there is no premature withdrawal of financial support for the most vulnerable countries.In the realm of tax reforms, India pushed the G20 to address a “mismatch between the source of generation of profits and jurisdiction where profits are taxed” to ensure that large MNCs pay a minimum effective corporate tax in the country of operation, he said.In the field of digital economy, Goyal said India pushed the need for balancing the free flow of data with a “narrative for cross-border data flows and accommodating development imperatives of developing countries”.Goyal also said India was one of most responsible countries in terms of meeting its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Modi is set to hold a string of bilateral meetings on the margins of the G20 Summit.He met his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi and the two leaders are expected to discuss issues of bilateral and mutual interests. “Synergising the India-Italy Partnership! PM @narendramodi was received by the Italian PM Mario Draghi, as he arrived at Palazzo Chigi for their first in-person meeting. Both leaders inspected the guard of honour before proceeding for delegation level talks,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted.At the meeting with EU leaders, Prime Minister Modi reviewed cooperation covering trade and investment and the Roadmap 2025 agreed at the last India-EU Summit. “We had wide-ranging talks on deepening the India-EU friendship, particularly in areas such as trade, commerce, culture and the environment,” Modi tweeted.Bagchi added in a tweet after the meeting: “The leaders discussed ways to enhance economic as well as people-to-people linkages aimed at creating a better planet.” Von der Leyen said in a tweet that the India-EU strategic agenda was on the right track, and that the two sides “need to join forces to help vaccinate the world and beat the global pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-meets-eu-leaders-over-climate-economy-101635531236364.html
30-10-2021||India||Behind the con: How three men ‘sold’ a govt hotel in Puri||For years, Tapan Mohanty dreamed that he would one day own the ITDC Nilachal Ashok Hotel in Puri, a mere 4km from his home.For a decade, he prepared himself for it, leasing a lodge in the city, buying land for a hotel on the Puri-Konark highway, and dabbling in real estate. Then came the opportunity. In February 2020, Mohanty executed an agreement between his poultry company and “ITDC” for the sale of the hotel for ₹12 crore, which is to be disinvested as part of the Government of India’s national monetisation pipeline.A year-and-a-half later, Mohanty is debilitated, by a speech infirmity brought on by a stroke and three surgeries between December and February, and the knowledge that he was the victim of an ingenious, elaborate con, only just being unraveled by the Odisha Police. It’s a con that has cost him ₹50 lakh, and his dream.ITDC Nilachal Ashok, which Mohanty sought to acquire from Utkal Ashok Hotel Corporation, a joint venture of ITDC and OTDC, was set up in January 1989 after the state government granted it a lease for 99 years over the land where it sits. The hotel, though now dilapidated, is located on the Blue Flag beach of Puri, next to the Raj Bhawan. In 2004, the hotel was closed down as it was found unviable. Utkal Ashok Hotel Corporation then decided to lease out the hotel for a period of 40 years in 2005-06, but there were no bidders. In 2009, it was re-tendered, and a Kolkata-based company, AFR Paulmech Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, won the bid, but allegedly defaulted on its deposit payments and the lease agreement could not be executed. In 2013, the board of directors of Utkal Ashok Hotel Corporation decided to terminate the agreement, following which AFR Paulmech Infrastructure filed a writ petition before the Orissa high court in October 2013. In 2017, the Orissa high court dismissed the writ petition following which the company approached the Supreme Court, where the case is still pending.The hotel is among the eight ITDC properties that have been listed for monetisation in the National Monetisation Pipeline released by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in August.The man and the conMohanty grew up in Puri, and began his business enterprise, TK Egg and Chicken Centre, shortly after the 1999 Super Cyclone. Over two decades, the business grew to a formidable size, supplying eggs and broiler chicken to as many as 70 centres in Odisha, with the money allowing Mohanty to dabble in real estate. Yet his heart had always been set on owning a hotel. In 2015, he took a small lodge in Puri on lease, but it has not yet taken off, its interior decoration still incomplete. Even before that, in 2011, he purchased 1.2 acre land on the Puri-Konark marine drive, where he intended to build a resort. That land is lying fallow.In December 2019, an acquaintance of Mohanty, who worked with the Life Insurance Coporation of India (LIC), set up a meeting between him and three people for the proposed sale. The roles were well defined: 30- year-old Anikesh Sahu was the contractor who executed different projects of ITDC; Chandan Akash Mohanty, 32, posed as an ITDC official; a third person, yet to be named by the police, accompanied them as a clerk. Mohanty, perhaps blinded by desire, sensed nothing wrong, and fell hard for the con.On February 29, 2020, Mohanty signed an agreement on behalf of his company “TK Chicken and Egg Centre” titled “Expression of interest and qualification of the company” printed on non-judicial stamp papers of ₹90. Chandan Akash Mohanty signed the document on behalf of “ITDC”.“We confirm that our consortium/joint venture satisfies the eligibility criteria including the guidelines for qualification of bidders seeking to acquire the public sector enterprise through the process of disinvestment issued by the government of India vide Department of Disinvestment,” the agreement read. Even in this agreement, there were red flags. The Department of Disinvestment was renamed the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) on April 14, 2016.EOW officials said the trio made Mohanty deposit ₹20 lakh into ITDC’s SBI account in Delhi’s Lodhi Road branch on February 29. “As the final deal was not yet through, the three told Mohanty that he needed to pay another ₹30 lakh to process the agreement with different sections of ITDC before the hotel was finally sold [to him] for ₹12 crore. They even told Mohanty that he needed to pay a bribe of ₹3 crore for pushing the final sale through the bureaucracy of ITDC,” said Dilip Tripathy, superintendent of police of Economic Offences Wing.The confirmation from ITDC, of course, never came. “Mohanty paid ₹30 lakh in cash over a period of time to push his bid for the hotel deal,” said Tripathy.While investigations are still underway, EOW officials said they have approached ITDC to enquire about the ₹20 lakh that Mohanty deposited on February 29, but said that it was not rare for high-value deposits to be made to the ITDC account. “We will try our best to get the amount credited back to Mohanty,” the SP said. When HT reached out for comment, the chief financial officer of ITDC, SD Paul, said he would not be able to speak on the issue as the matter was under investigation by police.The strokeSoon after he signed the agreement, Mohanty told his daughter Tamanna, 20, to prepare for a course in hotel management, in anticipation that she would run the hotel in a matter of years.Instead, in a matter of days, Bijayini Mohanty, Tapan’s wife, says the family began to sense something was wrong. Covid-19 hit, and with normal business thrown out of gear, the three began dodging his phone calls. “Every time he would call Chandan Akash, he would say ITDC office is closed due to Covid-19. There was no way to disbelieve it. However, he stopped responding to my husband’s calls and I started believing that my husband was ripped off,” Bijayini said. In September, Tapan Mohanty contracted Covid-19, and recovered a month later. Calls became infrequent, but even when they were made, there was no response.Then, a bigger tragedy hit.In December, Mohanty suffered a stroke, and was admitted to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar. “Surgery was done in his brain, and a month later it was found that he developed a bacterial infection in his head. So a second surgery was done because his brain was swelling up. He was getting violent too,” said Mohanty’s wife. A third surgery followed soon after, and Mohanty lost the ability to speak. “A brain abscess had developed due to the bacterial fungal infection following the stroke in his brain. The surgery was necessary to evacuate the puss which was life threatening. The trauma has left him without the power to speak,” said neurosurgeon Dr Somnath Jena, who operated on him.Mohanty’s distraught wife kept making calls to the three men to return their money; the treatment cost the family ₹21 lakh, the medication and physiotherapy not included. The main accused even visited Mohanty in hospital in January.The unravelingOn August 21, the Economic Offences Wing of the Odisha Police announced the arrest of a self-proclaimed baba Swami Bijayanandaji Maharaj, also known as Bijayananda Choudhary, and one other accomplice for allegedly duping a contractor for ₹3 crore. Choudhary and the accomplice allegedly took the money from the contractor, giving him fake work orders for the renovation of two OTDC-run properties near Chilika Lake — one at Barkul in Khurda district and the other in Rambha in Ganjam district. The name of the accomplice was Chandan Akash Mohanty.Taking care of her ailing husband in Puri, Bijayini instantly recognised Chandan Mohanty when his name appeared in local newspapers on August 22. “When we arrested Chandan Akash Mohanty in August we found some official stamps of ITDC on him, and knew there must be other frauds too. Then Tapan Mohanty’s wife sent a letter to us complaining that her husband was also conned by the man. Our subsequent investigation led to the arrest of Anikesh Sahu on October 21. The third accused is still on the run, and we are investigating the involvement of more people as well,” said Tripathy, SP, EOW.Police officials said that Sahu worked with an event management company in the state. Chandan Mohanty is a civil engineer who briefly worked with the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation, and was the mastermind of the operation. “He is as polished as one can be, wears branded clothes, and speaks in a calm, gentle voice. He married last year and hosted a lavish reception in a renowned hotel in Bhubaneswar. He probably got the idea of posing as an ITDC official while working with the state-owned OTDC. The other accused, Anikesh Sahu, worked in a jewellery shop owned by his uncle,” said the SP. The accused have been arrested under sections 419 (cheating for impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonesty inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), and 471(using forged documents) of the Indian Penal Code.The two-storey Puri home of the Mohantys, constructed in 2012, is ornately decorated with a large television in the drawing room. Secured by steel gates, Mohanty lives on the second floor. Yet, this is a family sinking under the weight of a failed enterprise. Mohanty had begun making financial preparations, and planned to approach banks to finance the hotel deal.“He pawned my gold jewellery for about ₹4.5 lakh, took personal loans at high interest rates, and sold some of his land for the deal. Now people are calling me up asking for money that he borrowed,” said Bijayini Mohanty.“This hotel deal has ruined my family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-the-con-how-three-men-sold-a-govt-hotel-in-puri-101635531233672.html

If a girl is major one, then to have sex with her consent is not an offence, but certainly it is unethical and immoral and also not in consonance with the established social norms of the Indian society,”observed the court.The court termed the applicant’s act as highly deplorable and unbecoming of a boyfriend, stating that “he remained silent spectator when the co-accused persons were brutally sexually assassinating his beloved in front of him”.As per FIR, the victim, on February 19 this year, went to take stitching lessons at a stitching centre and had spoken to her boyfriend Raju over phone and planned to meet him. Later they meet at a secluded place near a local river. After some time, three other persons reached there, abused and beat the applicant and committed the crime.On February 20, an FIR lodged by the 15-year-old victim against four accused under sections 376-D, 392, 323, 504, and 506 of the IPC and Sections 5 and 6 of POCSO Act at Akil Sarai police station of Kaushambi district.After examining the material placed on record and the contents of the FIR, the court denied bail to the applicant, stating that it cannot be said with certainty that the applicant had got no association or connection with remaining co-accused persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/consensual-sex-with-a-major-girl-not-an-offence-but-immoral-and-against-indian-norms-hc-101635530814508.html

We demand an apology from Rai and the other co-conspirators and as far as their master is concerned, people will take care of him very soon,” party spokesperson Pawan Khera told reporters.The attack on Rai came a day after he tendered an unconditional apology to Congress leader and former MP Sanjay Nirupam in response to a defamation case filed by the latter following Rai’s claim that Nirupam was one of the lawmakers who sought to pressure him to keep Singh’s name out of the government’s audit report on 2G spectrum auctions. Rai did not respond to two calls seeking comment and a WhatsApp message seen by him. “Imagine a man who can lie to sell a book, what all can he do to push his own agenda and the agenda of his masters,” Khera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-attacks-vinod-rai-accuses-him-of-conspiring-to-discredit-upa-govt-101635502492494.html

Kolkata-born Nafisa Ali, meanwhile, has been living in Goa for the past few years. “For me, whether it is in Bengal or whether it is in Goa, or whether it is playing at Wimbledon...it is about making India proud and in that, now living in Goa I would like to make a difference in my roots... it is the largest and fastest growing democratic country in the world and I would like to be a part of it and make a difference as I can,” Paes said.Welcoming Paes, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said, “I was the sports minister of the country when I (first) met him (Paes)... I have got my younger brother in the TMC.”Ali said she joined the Trinamool to help it take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and that the TMC was best-placed to do so. “The only leader today that can take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and [union home minister] Amit Shah’s brand of politics is Mamata Banerjee… The BJP needs to be addressed in all sincerity and Mamata has proved that she and she alone can become the tigress that can take on the likes of Modi,” she said. Ali was earlier affiliated with the Congress, and took on Banerjee in 2004, contesting on a Congress ticket in the South Kolkata Lok Sabha seat.“The important thing today is that there can be a Nehru Congress, an Indira Congress, and this is a Mamata Trinamool Congress… When the nation needs us, it is important to unite…”“The Congress has let its voters down and Mamata Banjerjee is the new Congress of India. The TMC can fight against a hate-filled agenda that divides secular India,” she added.Reacting to the development, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said he was not worried. “I believe that besides the BJP and Congress -- BJP will be in ruling and Congress will be in opposition -- other parties won’t have an impact. Finally, it depends on the voters,” he said.The Congress, meanwhile, accused the TMC of being the B-team of BJP . “They are not here to win, but to ensure that the BJP wins. What other reason do they have for entering Goa. Their game plan is clear,” party spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leander-paes-nafisa-ali-join-trinamool-congress-as-mamata-eyes-goa-polls-101635497452297.html

The list also includes names of top academics and artists who won Sahitya Akademi awards.The J&K administration on Thursday said that its administrative council met under the chairmanship of Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, and approved the move to name schools, roads and buildings after “martyrs and eminent persons” as part of the Indian government’s Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav initiative aimed at celebrating the country’s 75 years of independence.“As a mark of respect and acknowledgement of the exceptional contributions towards the security and development of the Union territory, the identified infrastructure will be renamed after the martyrs and living legends from Jammu and Kashmir,” the spokesperson said.Those named on the list include late assistant sub-inspector Mohammed Akbar, who lost his life in an attack after militants stormed an army camp at Mohra in Uri in 2014, killing several soldiers and policemen.Also included in the list are former Kashmir University vice chancellor late Habibullah Bhat alias Hamidi Kashmiri and Padma Shri and playwright late Moti Lal Kemu. Welcoming the administration’s move, BJP leader Altaf Thakur said: “The naming of schools and roads after martyrs is a welcome step. They gave their lives to the nation and this is the minimum we can do for them.” National Conference spokesman Imran Dar said: “This government mainly is mainly concerned about optics.

30-10-2021||Today's||India’s adoption data: Intriguing, disturbing||According to an affidavit filed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, more than 3,600 children have been orphaned as a result of Covid-19 and other causes since the start of the pandemic. The official figure quoted by the women and child development (WCD) ministry is 600 orphans — this lacks credibility given the scale of Covid-19 deaths in the country. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), under the WCD ministry, regulates adoption of orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children. The average number of children in the CARA pool has hovered around 2,200 over the last five years. One would have expected a significant number of children impacted by Covid-19 to have found their way into the CARA pool. Even if we were to allow for the procedural delay in declaring children legally free for adoption — a process which usually takes anywhere between two to five months after a child is reported to an orphanage — the number of children in the CARA pool should have increased by at least couple of hundreds (going by official figures), if not by thousands (going by unofficial estimates). Surprisingly, the needle hasn’t moved one bit. On the contrary, the number of children in the CARA pool dropped, with a greater fall in percentage of healthy children within the already shrunk pool. A closer look at the data suggests some worrisome trends.Based on data from CARINGS, the system maintained by CARA, there were about 1883 children in the CARA pool in 2018. Roughly half of them were grouped under the special needs category. The most sought-after category of healthy children, below two years, accounted for only 11% children, then. Cut to 2021, and the number of children in the CARA pool actually dropped from 2,317 in March 2020 to 2,173 by October 2021. The percentage of healthy children (excluding siblings) shrunk from 40% in 2018 to just about 27% in 2021. The share of children in the special needs category has increased from 51% in 2018 to 66% in 2021. One wonders if our adoption agencies have simply become dumping grounds for children, if 66% have special needs that neither their families nor prospective adoptive parents wish to care for. A deeper analysis of the data suggests another trend. The share of siblings and healthy children below two years of age has remained by and large the same in last three years (8% and 4% respectively). The total number of children in the CARA pool has also remained around 2,200-2,300. Therefore, the increase in the share of the special needs category is directly at the expense of a drop in share of healthy children above two years of age. Though one understands that the pool is not static, and there is a net inflow and outflow of children, given the statistics of special needs and older children adopted by Indian parents (which is actually negligible), it won’t be an exaggeration to infer that many of our children above two are turning into special needs children, while in the institution.Otherwise, what else can explain the rise in the share of children under the special needs category, with an equal drop in percentage of healthy children above two years of age — when 85% of parents registered with CARA only adopt a healthy child below two years of age? It appears that neither CARA, nor the ministry, is looking at the big picture. CARA did not even have a fully functional chief executive for almost a year. There have been inordinate delays in getting children into the legal pool, referring children to parents, and completing adoption formalities during Covid-19. But what is unacceptable is not addressing the deliberate trafficking that is preventing deserving children from entering the adoption pool, administering proper care to children in adoption agencies, and being indifferent to the growing number of children in the special needs category, in an already shrinking adoption pool.CARA and the ministry must accord attention to the vulnerable and invisible community of children silently suffering in our institutions. They are not a vote-bank but they are our future.Avinash Kumar is founder-director, Families of Joy Foundation The views expressed are personal

30-10-2021||Today's||How to increase and retain more women in STEM||India’s figures for women graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are impressive at 43% as opposed to the United States (34%) and Canada (31%), and several other countries. But only 14% of Indian women in STEM are employed in research and development institutions. The pandemic has proved a setback for them, and the gains many of them have made could be lost without urgent action. Gender imbalances in STEM are likely to become more entrenched if nothing is done.The Australian Academy of Science (AAS) has come up with a report on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on women in the STEM workforce throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This report captures the lived experiences of women and highlights that essential gains in equality may be lost if action is not taken now.Prajval Shastri, a leading astrophysicist from Bengaluru, says that existing patriarchal barriers have further erased boundaries between work and home for women in science, affecting their productivity and limiting their intellectual space for work. She says, “In the case of scientists who work in wet labs, lack of mobility and the lockdowns have affected their work. Work in the field of science often requires a continuum which has been broken by the pandemic. Field research, especially for biologists, is often seasonal and this has been affected.”Women in STEM also face job insecurity as the monetary priorities of institutions, mostly headed by men, have changed with the pandemic. In addition, funding has also dried up for many women, again due to entrenched biases about the lack of importance of women’s work in this field. The AAS project found that more women in STEM are in mid-level positions and not represented adequately at the more senior levels. It also found that academic output in peer-reviewed journals was affected as women had to juggle the competing demands of their homes and work--they had to play the role of caregivers and teachers for their children with their professional responsibilities and priorities.A 2017 Niti Aayog report on women in science made some recommendations on best practices to promote women’s entry and retention, which are worth considering. It said, “Career breaks need to be accommodated, as women scientists have dual commitments. Seniority based on total number of years of work experience or service rather than continuous service may help to retain talent and experience by allowing for re-entry of women scientists, which would otherwise be lost permanently.”Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, says, “We now need to look to the future for women in STEM. We need to support them with child care, better leave policies, make positions moveable so they do not have to chose between their families and workplaces and try and facilitate the process of women getting more senior positions.”Shastri adds, “There is a hidden norm that a woman scientist, howsoever meritorious, but is a spouse of a scientist in an institution, will not be hired by it. Sexual harassment and micro-aggressions are common leading to attrition. Women are given fewer and less prestigious institutional responsibilities which block their career advancement.”It is clear that to increase and retain more women in STEM, the institutional leadership in science needs to monitor and survey their own environments and understand what might be going wrong and bring in diversity experts to correct gender imbalances. Hopefully, that day is not too far away.The views expressed are personal
