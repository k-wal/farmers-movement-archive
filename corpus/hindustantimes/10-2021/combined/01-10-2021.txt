Deputy conservator of forests Abdul Qayum, director of the department of animal husbandry and fisheries, Manish Kumar Lohan, and joint director Dr Kanwarjit Singh were present on this occasion. The Gambusia fish will also be released in other stagnant water points in the coming days.Speaking about how the fish work, joint director Dr Kanwarjit Singh said, “The Gambusia adult fish eat 100 to 300 mosquito larvae per day. The fish are small and inedible, which makes them an excellent biological tool for mosquito control. The larvae are consumed before they have a chance to develop into adult mosquitoes. This prevents the spread of diseases like dengue, malaria and chikungunya.”Call or visit fish farmThe department has already supplied the fish to those in northern sectors who have ponds or fountains in their houses. However, anyone can now approach them to get the fish free of cost.A call can be made to the joint director’s office at 0172-2700092 or people can directly go to the Government Seed Fish Farm, set up at the regulator end of the Sukhna Lake near the Garden of Silence. The fish farm, as per department director Manish Kumar Lohan, is the only such farm in North which breeds this rare fish and supplies it to other departments.“People must make sure that the water body is stagnant. The fish are not to be kept in aquariums. Someone from the department will visit the place before the fish are provided to ensure that they are not wasted,” Dr Singh said.So far in 2021, 78 cases of dengue have been reported in Chandigarh, with the health department claiming zero fatality due to the disease. Six confirmed cases of malaria were also logged this year against last year’s seven. No chikungunya case has been reported in Chandigarh in the last three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-control-get-free-mosquito-killer-fish-from-chandigarh-fisheries-dept-101633112978466.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Cotton: Poor farm practices led to bollworm attack in Punjab, say experts||Even as the Punjab government, following the pink bollworm attack, has ordered a probe to find whether farmers were supplied spurious BT cotton seeds, agriculture experts attribute the crop infestation in the state’s Malwa region to poor farm practices.  “There is not much merit in claims on seed quality,” said Vijay Kumar, principal entomologist at Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, while pointing to varied incidence of infestation in different districts. “Even as area affected by pink bollworm (PBW) In Bathinda district, where the infestation was first reported on a small patch in 2018, has been increasing over the years and extended to the adjoining areas of Mansa district as well, field surveillance has found that pest severity is limited to three blocks: Bathinda, Sangat and Talwandi,” said Kumar. Meanwhile, Fazilka has not reported any case, and in Muktsar it was found at only three to four spots, said Kumar, who has been engaged in containing bollworm attacks for the past five years.“Bollgard 2 (BG-2), a second-generation insecticidal technology for cotton, has now grown resistant to PBW. But chemical treatment is highly effective to control it,” he said.According to experts, other major cotton-growing states, such as Karnataka and Maharashtra, have been reporting PBW over large areas since 2015. It entered Punjab and Haryana more recently with the unchecked transportation of cotton from other states by the oil extracting mills and ginning units. ‘Cotton growers did not follow instructions’In June this year, the state agriculture department had cautioned about infestation and advised farmers to use low-cost pheromone traps in fields to contain pest attacks. A capsule in the trap lures male pests, and regular monitoring indicates pest population in the fields through the trapped pests.SK Verma, head of Sirsa-based Central Institute for Cotton Research, said field studies indicate that farmers did not follow the instructions that resulted in wide infestation in Punjab and Haryana.“Farmers must ensure that cotton residue, which is commonly used as firewood, is not kept in fields. This moth can survive in any climatic condition and lives only on cotton plants or its residue. Between sowing in April-May till harvesting in November, three generations of bollworm took birth at a huge rate,” he said.Verma said it is a myth that infestation can damage crops in the entire field. In case of pest attack, only those flowers or boll of a plant get affected that have its larvae, he said, adding that PBW can be controlled by ensuring that no crop waste is kept in or around fields.“Government should adopt an organised approach to curb bollworm with the same spirit that was adopted to control devastating whitefly infestation in Punjab in 2015,” said Verma.This year, 3.3 lakh hectare area is under cotton cultivation, an increase of 17% from the 2020-21 Kharif season.Rakesh Rathi, director, Indian Cotton Association Limited, said in spite of the pest attack, the industry is hopeful of Punjab reaching last year’s production of 50 lakh quintals.“Our assessment suggests a bumper crop this time and a good yield may overcome the loss incurred by farmers due to bollworm infestation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cotton-poor-farm-practices-led-to-bollworm-attack-in-punjab-say-experts-101633112864074.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM halts dairy shifting project in Patiala||Hanging fire for 17 years, the dairy shifting project in Patiala missed another deadline after chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday directed to halt the process till all necessary facilities are made available at the new site. The chief minister’s orders came after a delegation of dairy owners met him on Thursday night. In a phone call made to the Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit past midnight, Channi said the interest of dairy owners must be taken into consideration.“No one should be made to forcibly shift their business to the new site. The administration should put all facilities, including proper road network, water supply connections, sewage treatment plant and other requirements, in place before shifting the dairy owners,” said the chief minister (CM).The Patiala municipal corporation (MC) had set September 30 as the deadline to shift 141 dairy farmers operating within the city to a 21-acre site at Ablowal village on the outskirts.Presently, the site is without a biogas plant, sewage treatment plant and veterinary hospital, as proposed under the ₹13.5-crore project. The dairy owners also complained that they were offered only 150-square-yard plot, which would be not adequate to run their units.On Friday, the deputy commissioner met the dairy owners and listened to their grievances and demands. “All facilities will be provided according to the mandate. The dairies will be shifted only after the Patiala MC ensures all required facilities are available at the site,” he said. Meanwhile, Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said the dairy owners kept a one-sided story before the CM.“We will send a fresh presentation to the CM, briefing him about arrangements made at the site. The dairy owners are reluctant to shift their businesses and are creating unwarranted hindrances,” he said.The presence of dairies within the city limits has been leading to frequent choking of sewers and resultant waterlogging in Patiala. The project to shift them was initiated in 2003, but it gathered pace only after former CM Captain Amarinder Singh provided funds in 2017. In the first phase, of the total 257 dairies, 141 were to be shifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-halts-dairy-shifting-project-in-patiala-101633112857272.html

01-10-2021||Lucknow||From Gandhi to Mahatma: Documenting Bapu’s journeys by train||The spark for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to become the Mahatma was lit at the Pietermaritzburg railway station in South Africa on June 7, 1893 and the moment was etched in history when he was evicted from a first-class train compartment leading to the birth of Satyagraha. Despite that experience, he appeared to nurse a lifelong fondness for trains.Now, the railways is set to observe Mahatma Gandhi’s 152nd birth anniversary by making people aware of his attachment with trains.This exercise will be apart from paying floral tribute to the Father of the Nation or carrying out cleanliness drives this Gandhi Jayanti.The railways has directed all its zones, including North Eastern Railway (NER), North Central Railway (NCR) and Northern Railway (NR), to dig out all the archives related to Gandhi and his journeys to Uttar Pradesh via train. The three zones largely cover the entire Uttar Pradesh.Besides, the railways has asked all the station masters and station superintendents to take out detailed records of the trains, which Gandhi boarded while spearheading multiple freedom movements in the country.“We are looking for the archives. We are also looking for any (of) Gandhiji’s journey related pictures in our photo section, which is one of the oldest photo sections,” said Pankaj Singh, chief public relations officer (CPRO) of NER.Sharing one such instance, Singh said Mahatma Gandhi had arrived at the Gorakhpur railway station on February 8, 1921 from Nagpur. As his train touched the station, the Mahatma de-boarded and received a warm welcome amid the roars of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”.“Gandhi soon came out of the station and addressed the gathering. During his address, people also donated money that was collected in a white cotton cloth sheet spread out before him. He appealed to the masses to maintain Hindu-Muslim unity and the farmers of Awadh region to observe non-violence,” Singh said.He further said that Gandhi then addressed another rally at Bale Miyan Ka Maidan in Gorakhpur and around 1.5 lakh attended. Late in the evening, Gandhi departed for Varanasi.“We are still looking for some more information related to Mahatma Gandhi’s visit to any of the stations in our jurisdiction,” he added.Northern Railway officials are also on the job. Lucknow’s Charbagh railway station, too, had witnessed the arrival of Mahatma Gandhi about 105 years ago.As per the record, on December 26, 1916, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru arrived at Lucknow railway station from Allahabad and met Mahatma Gandhi in front of the Charbagh railway station. The place where this historic meeting took place still bears a plaque and the history of Gandhi-Nehru park. However, the officials said that they are yet to find out by which train the duo reached the state capital.Senior NCR officials said that, according to reports, Mahatma Gandhi’s Zenith watch got stolen at Kanpur Central Station while he was onboard. Officials said that according to the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, he wrote in a note dated May 28, 1947, about the theft at Kanpur railway station on May 25.“I may add that it had a radium disc... and also a contrivance for alarm. It was a gift to me. The cost then was over ₹40. It was a Zenith watch,” the Mahatma wrote.The footnote further stated, “The reference is to Gandhiji’s watch, a present from Indira Nehru, which he had been using for about 20 years, and which was stolen at Kanpur station on May 25.”Officials further said that the incident upset him. The thief felt remorse and returned it after six months. The officials are now trying to track more details.Officials said once collected, the information would be made available in the public domain in order to make the present generation aware of Gandhi’s journeys by train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/from-gandhi-to-mahatma-documenting-bapu-s-journeys-by-train-101633112559576.html

The AAP had entered the Chandigarh electoral scene in 2014 with a strong performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.After losing the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, AAP’s ranks had depleted, but in recent months, a slew of new joinings have taken place, particularly from former Congress leaders and workers; the most prominent being former city Congress chief and former mayor Pardeep Chhabra.“A more detailed manifesto will be released closer to the MC elections,” said Chhabra.To boost its chances in the MC elections, the party has brought back former MP Harmohan Dhawan to active campaigning. Dhawa, who was present during the launch of the manifesto, was politically dormant for nearly two years.Membership drive startedThe party also kick-started its membership drive from Sector 27. Singh and other party leaders including co-in-charge of Chandigarh AAP Pradeep Chhabra, convener Prem Garg and president of election campaign committee Chandramukhi Sharma, went door-to-door in Sector 27 and enrolled new members.Singh said, “We have resolved to reach out to lakhs of people in the city by running a membership drive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-elections-aap-manifesto-guarantees-free-24x7-water-supply-no-new-taxes-101633112497036.html

If the elderly are given time or are engaged in some work they (elderly) feel self-respect for themselves and keep away from mental illnesses such as depression,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, Head of the Aastha Centre for Geriatric Medicine and Hospice, where a programme was held on International Day for Older Persons (Oct 1).“Similarly, good oral/dental health will keep a lot of other illnesses such as poor digestion away. Youngsters should spend some time with the elderly instead of spending on medicines for them (elderly),” said Dr Pooran Chand, HoD, prosthodontics at the King George’s Medical University, addressing an event for elderly patients.“If the young generation has the energy to work, the elderly have the experience. So, use their experience and keep the elderly busy for their good health,” said prof Pooran Chand.During a programme at Aastha Hospice, several events including yoga, tambola and quiz were held to make the elders feel happy. Volunteers, who reached early in the morning, remained busy grooming the senior citizens, giving them haircuts and shaves. “The elderly should live healthier, purposeful and longer lives and they also have the potential to contribute to the younger generation in old age,” said Dr Shukla.“There are medicines available but we should not make the stomachs of the elderly a medical store. Instead, give them a chance to live an active and productive life as long as they wish,” said Prof Pooran Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/international-day-for-older-persons-take-out-time-for-the-elderly-at-home-say-experts-101633112437156.html

01-10-2021||Pune||Centre’s irregular supply caused syringe shortage in PMC: Ajit Pawar||Pune: Commenting on the shortage of syringes for the anti-Covid vaccination reported in Pune city a few days ago, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that disproportionate supply of the vaccine doses and syringes by the central government caused the situation. The Pune guardian minister said that syringe shortage is experienced at the vaccination drives conducted through CSR funds. He said that the situation has been resolved as local bodies have been instructed to purchase required number of syringes and funds would be made available. “Syringes come with vaccine doses supplied by the Centre. For the vaccination drive in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), vaccine doses were supplied but syringes did not come in that proportion. PMC decided to buy 0.1 million syringes and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) followed suit.

Addressing a press conference at party headquarters in Chandigarh on Friday, Sharma said shenanigans of Sidhu were his desperate attempt to bring the Gandhis to tow his political line. “He is feeling left out as he was not made the chief minister of the state,” said Sharma. The Congress is crumbling in the country due to the remote control-style of functioning and Sidhu did not resign, as claimed by him, over appointment of certain people. “He resigned because Charanjit Singh Channi was made the chief minister and his entire game plan got scuttled,” said Sharma. The state BJP chief declared that on coming to power party will give electricity at reasonable rates and there would be no power cuts. “The state will be rejuvenated by an economic policy which will take all segments of society together.

Further, he alleged that the chairman’s staff keeps the park entry gate locked from inside and no resident of the area is allowed to enter it. He has even kept two generator sets in the park, added Monga.“The chairman is the custodian of LIT properties and he is only encroaching upon the park by misusing his power. It is illegal and we have sought an FIR against him. Further, we have also demanded that the encroachments should be removed and the park be opened for the public,” said Monga.A copy of the complaint was also forwarded to the offices of the Prime Minister, the chief minister’s office, and the governor of Punjab, among others.Despite attempts made to reach chairman Balasubramaniam, he was not available for comments.

The MoU signed with Causis E-Mobility Pvt Ltd, a joint venture of United Kingdom (UK)-based Causis Group, is expected to help Maharashtra transform it into a leading state in terms of adoption of EVs in the country, officials said. The firm will make an investment of ₹2,823 crore and is expected to generate 1,250 jobs.The MoU was signed for phase-1 to manufacture three-wheelers for passenger transport. The facility will come up at Talegaon, Pune. In phase-2, the automobile firm will set up its battery Gigafactory to manufacture and supply batteries for EVs.In July, the state government had unveiled a comprehensive EV policy that aims to boost the demand for such vehicles and improve their supply through incentives. The government believes that incentives for automobile companies and subsidies for buyers will help in encouraging its manufacturing and increase demand among the buyers.The new policy aims to electrify 10% of all the vehicles by 2025. Also, public transport and last-mile delivery vehicles will see 25% electrification under this policy. From April 2022, all new government vehicles – be it owned or leased –operating within major cities will be EVs, stated the policy.“Taking our commitment to make Maharashtra the leading state in electric mobility in the country, the state government and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) have signed an MoU with Causis E-Mobility to set up an electric vehicle production unit in Talegaon.

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Proximity with Shah puts question mark on Capt’s secular credentials: Rawat||All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat on Friday hit out at former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, stating that his proximity with BJP leaders like Amit Shah puts a question mark on his secular credentials. Rawat, whose was part of a three-member committee set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to end the factional fight in the state unit, said that Amarinder is playing into the hands of people with whom he had no ideological ties. “He (Amarinder) should have stood with Sonia Gandhi leadership to save democracy,” he said, asking him not to walk into BJP’s trap and become its “mukhauta” (mask) in Punjab. Rawat is the first senior Congress leader to train his guns at the former chief minister after he met Shah and declared that he will end his 52-year-old association with the Congress. Amarinder was forced to resign from the CM’s post two weeks and his ouster was the culmination of his six-month long tussle with former minister (now Punjab Congress chief) Navjot Singh Sidhu. No humiliation, Cong gave him respect Rebutting the two-time former CM’s statement that he will leave the Congress because he has been humiliated, Rawat said the party always gave him respect, claiming that this (humiliation) theory is being furthered under someone’s pressure. “Amarinder was Punjab Congress chief thrice and chief minister twice. Is this humiliation? He should compare himself with other senior party leaders who had got much less than him in term of opportunities,” the former Uttarakhand CM said in a statement. Capt believed he needs no advice Raising questions over the former Punjab CM’s working style, Rawat said he (Amarinder) was of the belief that he does not need any advice from anyone, including his own ministers, legislators and party leadership. He was controlling both the government and the party from his farmhouse and never paid any attention to the suggestions given by the party committee, the former Uttarakhand CM said in a statement. Failed to keep election promises Rawat said that despite continuous reminders from his colleagues and the leadership, Amarinder failed to keep his promises on important issues such as Bargari, drugs and electricity. “There was a general perception throughout the state that Captain and the Badals are helping each other, and they have a secret understanding. I discussed these issues with him at least five times but with no result,” he said, adding the Bargari issue was not deftly handled by his (Amarinder’s) trusted lieutenants. He further accused the former CM of not implementing even one out of the 18-point agenda suggested by the party to him. Rawat said when there was a demand for a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), he sent the message to Capt through one of his (Singh’s) well-wishers, but there was no response from him. “He did not call me. It was then decided to call the CLP meeting. I then officially informed Capt Amarinder and requested him to attend the meeting. He called a separate meeting at his separate meeting at his residence. Before that, Congress president spoke to him about the complaints signed by 43 MLAs and the CLP. He himself offered to resign,” Rawat said, recalling the sequence of events that led to Capt’s ouster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/proximity-with-shah-puts-question-mark-on-capt-s-secular-credentials-rawat-101633110217456.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||4,273 MDR-TB patients benefit from Bedaquiline in Mumbai||Bedaquiline has given a new hope to hundreds of patients diagnosed with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Mumbai. Civic health officers said the drug has helped improve the recovery rate from 40% to 70% among TB patients with drug resistant strains since its launch in 2018. Till date, 4,273 MDR-TB patients have been given the drug in Mumbai. Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial used in combination with other anti-bacterials to treat patients with MDR-TB— when the TB bacteria develops resistance to a few medicines that are used for the treatment of TB. The government has a restrictive policy of giving Bedaquiline under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).Data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that since 2018, 4,273 patients with MDR-TB have benefited from Bedaquiline drugs. In 2018, only 273 MDR-TB patients were enrolled for the drug. In the following year, the number increased to 1,089. In 2020, amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, a total of 2,068 MDR-TB patients benefited from it. “Earlier, the recovery rate among the MDR-TB patients was around 40-50%. Now, with the introduction of the drugs, we have observed that the recovering rate has increased to 70%. This has also helped to fight against the fear that TB is incurable,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, in-charge of TB department in the BMC.Dr Jalil Parker, pulmonologist at Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, has also made similar observations. “We have seen better recovery among MDR-TB patients who are being given Bedaquiline compared to who aren’t part of the regime,” he said. India still hasn’t allowed commercial sales of Bedaquiline, fearing overuse could lead to drug resistance. Only public hospitals can write out Bedaquiline that is given free as a part of the Revised National TB Control Programme. In 2018, 5,594 patients of MDR were detected in Mumbai, followed by 5,673 in 2019, 4,367 in 2020. Health activists believe that the detection and treatment of MDR-TB patients has been affected due to the pandemic. “TB is one of the biggest killers in India. Despite this, the diagnosis of the TB patients was shelved away in the first and second wave of the pandemic. Many MDR-TB patients missed out on their medications due to its unavailability. It will be reflected on the anti-TB programme in the long run,” said Ganesh Acharya, a TB activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/4273-mdr-tb-patients-benefit-from-bedaquiline-in-mumbai-101633109016884.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||KEM Covid cluster: Samples sent for genome sequencing||A day after 30 undergraduate students from GS Medical College attached to the KEM Hospital tested positive for Covid-19, a few of their samples have been sent for genome sequencing at the Kasturba Hospital. Since 29 students were fully vaccinated and only one was unvaccinated, doctors said that genome sequencing may help identify if a specific variant had caused the cluster of infections. Nearly 200 samples of students and their close contacts were sent for testing after two students tested positive. “We had sent another 145 samples for testing but none of them returned positive,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital. “Since a majority of the students had breakthrough infections, we have sent some of their samples to the laboratory in Kasturba Hospital for genome sequencing,” he said. Infections that occur 14 days after full vaccination are known are breakthrough infections. A UG student who did not wish to be named said that all students have been asked to get tested as a precautionary measure. “While in the hostel, we have been asked to compulsorily use masks, even in the rooms,” he said adding that their classes are now being held online. He said that convocation was held on September 26 for students who have completed their internships, but UG students had not attended the event. A similar cluster of infections was detected in the TN Medical College attached to the BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central. “Nearly half a dozen UG students had tested positive and about six of them were fully vaccinated,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. “We had sent their samples for genome sequencing at Kasturba Hospital. We have not been informed if there was a specific variant that was responsible for the cluster of infections,” he said. Since the vaccination began in January this year, many senior doctors and resident doctors in the city have suffered from breakthrough infections. “All these cases have been mild or asymptomatic,” said a resident doctor from Nair Hospital. He said that some of the infections had surfaced after the centenary year celebration events. “Our convocation event was cancelled by the dean as a precaution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kem-covid-cluster-samples-sent-for-genome-sequencing-101633108656907.html
01-10-2021||Lucknow||Senior leaders leaving Congress ahead of UP polls||When Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) vice president and former MLA Gayadeen Anuragi, along with another former party MLA Vinod Chaturvedi, joined the Samajwadi Party here on Friday, he was not the first of the senior leaders of the present UPCC team to do so ahead of the Utttar Presh assembly polls His move came hours after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra left Lucknow for New Delhi, winding up her five-day visit to review the party’s poll preparedness. “I was not satisfied with the functioning of the Congress. My voice was not heard in the Congress,” said Anuragi, who had met Priyanka during her visit to Lucknow. Chaturvedi is also learnt to have met her this week. Besides Anuragi, those who left the Congress to join the SP include Manoj Tiwari, whose family member is chairperson of an urban local body in Mahoba. Laliteshpati Tripathi, another UPCC vice-president, former MLA and grandson of former chief minister the late Kamlapati Tripathi, had also resigned from the Congress early this month after he attended a meeting with the party general secretary. If those watching the Congress developments are to be believed, many others are weighing their options and may switch loyalties in the coming weeks. A number of other leaders have already left the party for greener postures. “Yes, the coming weeks will witness an upward trend in the “aya Ram- gaya Ram” phenomenon. Those who may not get the Congress ticket may also cross over while those who are denied tickets elsewhere may join the Congress,” said a Congress functionary on condition of anonymity. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) spokesman Ashok Singh said the Congress is fighting a battle for political ideology and to save the country. Anybody leaving the Congress would not make any impact and the fight will continue, he said. UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Congress is going through a phase of struggle and the party leadership is fighting for the cause of people. Only such leaders who are afraid of fighting under the prevailing scenario are leaving the Congress and the party will continue its fight with the support of its workers, he said. Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science (Lucknow University) commented, “If Priyanka continues to make efforts to strengthen the party organization and develop some local leadership, the party may find itself in better position. Those leaving the Congress may have many factors in mind like the party’s organisation, support base and financial resources. The Congress has financial resources, but there is a problem with its organisational structure. The Congress need not bother about some leaders leaving the party as such a phenomenon is common during any election.” “We understand the next lot of leaders to leave the Congress may be from western Uttar Pradesh. Senior Congress leader Imran Masood has already given indications that he is not satisfied with the prevailing state of affairs. Masood has pockets of strong support in Saharanpur and at least two Congress MLAs owe their allegiance to him. If Masood leaves the Congress, this will be a big setback,” said another Congress leader. Masood has, however, denied reports and said he was only in favour of an alliance with the Samajwadi Party for the 2022 UP assembly election. Former Union minister Jitin Prasada, ex-UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi and former minister Jagdambika Pal are among other prominent Congress leaders who have left the party to join the BJP in the last few years. Prasada, who joined the BJP about five months ago, has been recently inducted as a minister of Yogi Adityanath cabinet. Joshi, who was also inducted as a cabinet minister in Yogi Adityanath government after 2017 assembly elections, is now a BJP MP as is Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/senior-leaders-leaving-congress-ahead-of-up-polls-101633108476934.html

For the first time, two bar owners of the city have applied for licences to the state excise department for setting up microbreweries on their premises, according to senior state excise department officials. The applications for the licences have been made under a June 2019 state government’s decision, allowing hotels, restaurants and clubs to set up microbreweries for serving draught beer. The decision aimed at increasing revenues of the Uttar Pradesh government and also providing a boost to employment and tourism in the state, they added. “As soon as the plants get installed and become functional, licences for running them would be issued as per the set norms,” the officials said. Confirming the development, district excise officer, Prayagraj, Jitendra Kumar Singh said that so far cities having high tourist large footfalls or business centres in the state had applied for setting up microbreweries like Lucknow, Agra and Ghaziabad among others, but now for the first-time interest in this regard has been shown by two bar owners of Prayagraj city. “We hope that more will come forward in coming days wishing to make use of the state government’s initiative in this regard,” he added. Officials said that in stark contrast to various liquors for which “older the better” is the mantra, in case of beer “the fresher the better” is the buzz word. “Beer freshness has an immense impact on the brew’s flavour, which is why the beer poured from a keg is likely to be fresher and tastier than what you would sip from the bottle,” they explain. A microbrewery is a small unit that produces beer in limited quantity for captive consumption, and is found mostly in establishments such as hotels and restaurants located in tourist hotspots. The state cabinet meeting chaired by the UP CM had cleared the proposal for amending the UP-Brewery Rules-1961 with UP Brewery (6th Amendment)-2019 to incorporate relevant changes to facilitate setting up of microbreweries. Many states like Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh etc also have the provision of microbreweries in major cities and towns. So far, 12 licenses have been issued in UP. The economics of setting up beer plant Setting up a small beer plant requires ₹50 lakh while a bigger one can cost ₹90 lakh and one needs a minimum of 250 sq feet of space. In 2019, the state increased the annual license fee for microbreweries from ₹25,000 fixed in 1974 to ₹2.5 lakh and has also hiked the renewal fee. Besides, ₹1 lakh also needs to be deposited as guarantee amount. Current holders of licenses for hotel, resort, restaurant and commercial clubs are eligible to apply for microbrewery with the state excise commissioner through the respective district magistrate offices. The excise commissioner can permit microbreweries based on the recommendation of the district magistrate. Each microbrewery would, however, be allowed to produce only 600 litres of beer a day and taking 350 as average number of working days annually, 210,000 litres of beer can be produced each year. There is a penalty of ₹5,000 per day for violation of microbrewery rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-prayagraj-bar-owners-apply-for-licences-to-set-up-microbreweries-101633107037347.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab is in safe hands: Deputy CM Randhawa in veiled attack on Amarinder Singh||After former chief minister Amarinder Singh's repeated barbs over security concerns, Punjab's deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Friday reassured everyone that the state is “in safe hands” and that there was no need to create panic.Randhawa said that an "alarmist narrative" was being created by certain people with vested interests about peace and security in Punjab. Warning against such designs, he said that these statements only create an unnecessary sense of fear and insecurity among the people."Rest assured, Punjab is in safe hands," said Randhawa, dismissing concerns about threat from Pakistan amid a change of regime in the border state.The political crisis in Punjab took a worrying turn when long standing chief minister Amarinder Singh resigned on September 18, accusing the Congress leadership of humiliating him.Singh accused newly-inducted CM Charanjit Singh Channi's right hand Navjot Sidhu of having a close relationship with anti-India forces and said that “misgovernance in Punjab would give Pakistan an opportunity to create trouble in the state and in the country”. He had added that his meeting with National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and Union Home Minister Amit Shah after resigning had centred around this issue.Randhawa, who also holds the home portfolio, questioned why Singh's meetings in Delhi were not held earlier to raise state-related issues. "Whom are you trying to help or benefit with such alarmist hue and cry? Facing the challenge is one thing and creating panic and alarm is something else,” Randhawa told news agency PTI."And if Punjab is really in danger or trouble right now, then the seeds of that trouble must have been sown much before, certainly not within a week's time," he rebuked.Earlier, Randhawa conducted a surprise check at the Punjab Police Headquarters in Sector-9 of Chandigarh had a brief interaction with reporters subsequently.Terming Punjab as the sword arm of the country, the deputy chief minister further said: "It is a fact that Pakistan and its intelligence agencies are always trying to create trouble in India and Punjab being the border state is at a greater risk, at the same time, Punjabis are prepared to thwart any challenge with all their courage and might.""There is nothing new about this threat as it existed before as well and it will continue in future also. What has changed in the last two weeks?" he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-is-in-safe-hands-deputy-cm-randhawa-in-veiled-attack-on-amarinder-singh-101633103491270.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra home dept officials believe Param Bir in India, suspension process starts||Maharashtra home department officials on Friday said they do not think that former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh would have fled the country as the lookout notice against him was issued in July, which could make it difficult for him to escape out of India. The home department has asked for an official communication from the Ministry of Home Affairs about the Indian Police Service (IPS) officer whereabouts and has initiated the procedure of the suspension of the officer. Highly-placed officials in the home department have said that the lookout notice against Singh was issued in an extortion case filed against him by a businessman. “The central agencies have informed us unofficially that Singh has fled the country. Leaving the country after the issuance of the lookout notice is not possible. He must have either fled before it or might have adopted illegal means to slip out of the country,” an official said after a meeting of senior home department officials convened by state home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Friday. The state government has begun the procedure for his suspension but wants the case to be fool-proof to stand legal scrutiny. “There are multiple criminal cases filed against Singh in the past few months. He has not appeared before the state-appointed Chandiwal commission of inquiry. He has not intimated the state government after his medical leave was over 30 days ago. The suspension has been proposed but the director general of police has been asked to make the case fool-proof by giving reasoning that stand the legal scrutiny,” the official said. The decision over the suspension in expected to be taken in the next few days. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government has helped Singh flee the country. “It has come to the fore that Singh’s last location was Ahmedabad, which is under BJP rule and considered as the epicentre of the ruling party. The Central government under BJP has been using IAS (Indian Administrative Service) and IPS officers against the Opposition and their governments to defame them. In the Sachin Vaze (Antilia explosives scare) case, the investigation was taken over by central agencies, when the Centre realised that Singh could be arrested for his involvement in the Mansukh Hiran murder case and after the CCTV footage went missing from the commissioner’s office. By transferring the probe to central agencies, the Centre has saved Singh from arrest and covered up the fact that there was Centre’s hand behind the conspiracy to defame the state government.”Leader of opposition in state and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “Patole keeps speaking senselessly on sensitive issues. I don’t feel necessary to take his cognisance.” Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil had said on Thursday that investigating agencies were looking for Singh who was incommunicado for two months. “A civil service officer needs the approval of the Central government (to leave the country). The Union home ministry is also finding his whereabouts. We have no clue about his whereabouts and we, too, are searching for him,” he said. The minister said it was not appropriate of Singh if he has fled the country. “There will be action taken against him. It could be under the various provisions of the law. It could be disciplinary action for remaining absent from duty without informing the authorities. The action is not important, his appearance before the agencies is. The action against him by the state government is not owing to any vendetta but it is a routine procedure which will be followed,” Walse Patil said in Mumbai. Singh was removed as Mumbai’s top cop on March 17, following the Antilia explosives scare and the subsequent murder of Hiran. He was shifted to the Maharashtra home guards on March 22.On April 7, Singh appeared before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to record his statement in connection with the two cases. Later, he was summoned by the federal agency, but he did not respond to the summons. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole questioned whether the Centre had helped Singh to flee the country. “Had he been detained by the central agencies investigating Antilia explosive scare case, significant information could have been extracted from him. The investigating agencies have raised doubts about his whereabouts but the question remains unanswered if the Centre facilitated him to go out of the country,” he said. Singh had last attended his office on May 4 and went on leave from May 5, on account of health issues. It is believed that Singh had gone to his hometown in Chandigarh. In between, he had communicated with the Maharashtra government, requesting for extension of his leave due to health issues. He has also claimed that he had undergone a surgery. In mid-August, he requested an extension for the leave over health grounds. But, thereafter, no request has come from him, said a police officer requesting anonymity. An inquiry commission headed by retired Bombay high court judge, justice (retired) Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal in early September issued a bailable warrant against Singh for not appearing before it. A team of the state crime investigation department (CID) that went to three of his (Singh’s) known residences in Chandigarh and Mumbai did not find him there and could not serve the warrant. As he failed to appear before the commission, it re-issued the warrant on September 21. The next hearing of the commission is on October 6. The commission earlier had imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on Singh twice for not appearing before the commission. Three days after his removal as commissioner, Singh on March 20 had written an explosive letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, accusing state’s former home minister Anil Deshmukh of instructing Vaze and other police officers to extort monthly ₹100 crore from bars, pubs, hookah parlours and other establishments in Mumbai. Singh also approached courts with his complaint, following which the Bombay high court ordered CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-home-dept-officials-believe-param-bir-in-india-suspension-process-starts-101633106136665.html
01-10-2021||Patna||Cases of power theft emerge in eastern Patna||Eastern Patna has emerged as the hot spot of power theft and non-payment of energy bills, prompting the Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking (PESU), which maintains electricity in the state capital, to focus its attention on anti-theft drive, said officials. Most such cases are being reported from the six electricity divisions of eastern Patna, which includes Rajendranagar, Kankerbagh 1 (north of Patna bypass), Kankerbagh 2 (rural areas to the south of Patna bypass), Bankipore, Gulzarbagh and Patna City in Patna. The PESU, in the last two months, has lodged 1,521 FIRs, of which 1,062 have been against consumers for power theft in Patna east alone, said Dilip Kumar Singh, PESU general manager. Nearly 6.5% of the 11,421 households inspected in August were found to be pilfering power in PESU East circle. The figure dropped to less than 2% of the households inspected next month, as consumers became wary of the power firm’s spirited drive and its promptness to register police complaints against errant power consumers. “Patna City and Gulzarbagh divisions are vulnerable to power theft. These are narrow and congested areas, inhabited by old Patnaites, inclined to pilfering power. These are the areas having highest aggregate transmission and commercial loss,” said Singh. Instances of power theft were comparatively much less in PESU West circle, comprising the electricity divisions of New Capital area, Ashiana, Danapur, Khagaul, Dak Bungalow, Patliputra and Gardanibagh in Patna. Only 3.5% of the 9,041 households inspected in PESU west circle were found to be indulging in unfair means in August. The figure dropped to 2.19% next month, said Arvind Kumar, electrical superintending engineer, PESU West. “The Phulwarisharif area in Khagaul division, Digha locality in Danapur division and diara areas along the river Ganga are prone to power theft, but the magnitude is less as compared to old Patna in Patna east,” said Kumar “People have become cautious after our intensive anti-theft drive over the last two months. We find only around 2% of the households to be indulging in power theft now,” he added. Similarly, disconnections of energy connections, due to non-payment of bills have also been more in Patna east as compared to Patna west. Of the total 42,935 disconnections in PESU till September 25 this year, 23,753 were reported from Patna east and 19,182 from Patna west. With more number of power thefts and FIRs, the PESU East circle had realised ₹6.89 crore by way of penalty through FIRs, while PESU West contributed to ₹2.94 crore of PESU’s total realisation of ₹9.83 crore till September 25 this year. Of the total penalty realised, the PESU mopped up ₹8.77 crore in the last two months of August and September, with PESU east circle contributing ₹5.71 crore ( ₹3.82 crore in August and ₹1.89 crore in September) and PESU west ₹3.06 crore ( ₹1.97 crore in August and ₹1.09 crore in September).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cases-of-power-theft-emerge-in-eastern-patna-101633105902889.html

In 2020, Congress’s Ashok Kumar had contested Kusheshwarasthan seat and lost to JD(U)’s Hazari by a margin of over 7,000 votes. In Tarapur in Munger district, RJD’s Divya Prakash had lost to JDU’s Mewalal Chaudhary by a little over 7,000 votes. BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha said Congress had started its preparations to fight Kusheshwarasthan seat, which was allotted to the party in 2020 under the seat adjustment among the allies. “There will be no issue in seat allocation as long as the RJD chief Lalu Prasad or opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad doesn’t ask for it. Congress is preparing for Kusheshwarasthan seat following direction from our AICC in-charge Bhakta Charan Das,” said Jha.Senior Congress leader Kishore Kumar Jha said it was ridiculous on part of the RJD to stake claim on Kusheshwarasthan. “Former Congress legislature party leader Ashok Kumar is a towering scheduled caste (SC) leader, who lost the polls by almost an equal margin by which RJD’s Divya Prakash was defeated by JD(U) in Tarapur,” he said.In the 243-member Bihar Assembly, RJD current has 75 seats and Congress 19. The Opposition alliance, which comprise the two parties and Left parties, has a total strength of 110 in the House, 12 short of the simple majority figure of 122.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/allies-cong-rjd-set-for-face-off-over-assembly-bypolls-in-bihar-101633105176507.html

Tiawari said Kanhaiya, who recently switched from Communist Party of India (CPI) to Congress, was an “expert in the art of delivering speeches”.“At one point of time, leftists were seeing their future in Kanhaiya Kumar. Now Congress is seeing its future in them. Congress should make him (Kanhaiya Kumar) its president. For the last two years, there is no permanent president in the party,” he said. Tiwary trashed suggestions that Kanhaiya Kumar posed a threat to RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav. “During 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Kanhaiya worked to defeat the RJD candidate from Begusarai by helping BJP divide secular votes,” he said.Kanhaiya had lost to BJP heavyweight and union minister Giriraj Singh from Begusarai in 2019 parliamentary polls. RJD had finished third in the seat.Tiwary said he had full sympathy with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. “Congress trusts outsiders more. Party has not been able to choose its permanent president for the last two years. I myself want Congress to be strong. This will strengthen the Grand Alliance,” he said. Congress was quick to hit back, alleging that Tiwary “was being guided by RSS ideology”. “Instead of strengthening the Grand Alliance, he is trying to weaken it by toeing a different ideology,” said Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allies-rjd-congress-trade-barbs-over-kanhaiya-101633104817886.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||India’s air travel decelerated by 44.8% in August: International air transport body||Demand for India’s domestic travel fell by 44.8% in August but improved from July when it had declined by 58.9%, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Friday. IATA has attributed the improvement in passenger demand in August to growing vaccination rates and less stringent international travel restrictions in some regions. However, globally, air travel had decelerated in August from July. “India and Russia were the only large markets to show a month-to-month improvement compared to July,” IATA’s statement read.According to IATA, the global passenger traffic in August – measured in revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) – was down by 56% as compared to the same month in 2019. In July, it was 53% below the 2019 level. IATA said the domestic markets were down by 32.2% as compared to August 2019, while in July, the air traffic had declined by 16.1% as compared to the same month in 2019.According to the trade association of world’s airlines, the global international passenger demand in August was 68.8% below August 2019, which is an improvement compared to the 73.1% decline recorded in July.“August results reflect the impact of concerns over the Delta variant on domestic travel, even as international travel continued at a snail’s pace towards a full recovery, which cannot happen until governments restore the freedom to travel. In that regard, the recent US announcement to lift travel restrictions from early November on fully-vaccinated travellers is very good news and will bring certainty to a key market,” said Willie Walsh, director general, IATA. “But challenges remain; September bookings indicate deterioration in international recovery. That’s bad news heading into the traditionally slower fourth quarter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indias-air-travel-decelerated-by-44-8-in-august-international-air-transport-body-101633102476568.html
01-10-2021||Mumbai||NCP leader and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh now untraceable?||Former Maharashtra home minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh is said to be “untraceable”. He is an accused in a money laundering case and has skipped several summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the past two months. The central investigation agency had also issued a lookout notice against him last month. Deshmukh, however, has moved the Bombay high court (HC), seeking that the summons against him be quashed. He has also sought directions to ED to permit him to appear through video-conferencing.The NCP leader is facing charges of bribery, extortion and money laundering, which are being simultaneously probed by ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), following accusations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh has already claimed his innocence and maintained that the allegations were made only after Singh was removed from the Mumbai Police chief’s position. Ironically, Singh, who is faces extortion cases, is also missing now. Deshmukh could not be reached on his cell phone and or on the number of his office in his hometown Nagpur. His son Salil was also not available for a comment. NCP said that Deshmukh is trying to explore legal remedies provided by the Constitution to every citizen of the country. He is also ready to record his statements virtually, but ED is not doing so, alleged NCP. “I think Anil Deshmukhji is trying to get relief through the legal options available to him. Every individual has the right to explore legal remedies in the court of law and he is doing the same. As far as the investigation is concerned, he is ready to record his statement virtually. This will be more authentic as it can be recorded. ED should start the probe at least by recording his virtual statement. After that, they can proceed for action if they do not find it [the statement] satisfactory,” said NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik.Malik, however, said that he would not be able to answer on Deshmukh’s whereabouts as he is not aware of it.NCP state president Jayant Patil in Nashik said their leaders are being targeted to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “[Previous] BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) government had put (senior NCP leader) Chhagan Bhujbal behind the bars and he was exonerated by the court. Now, the BJP’s mechanism is after Deshmukh. Singh, who had made allegations [against Deshmukh], fled the country. In this scenario, why should ED and other investigation agencies believe him (Singh)?” Patil questioned.While there were reports on Thursday that Singh may have fled the country, BJP alleged that MVA government helped Deshmukh leave India. BJP state vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “Deshmukh did not appear before ED despite several summons. He is also not saying that he is unwell. A virtual statement can be recorded from any part of the world. He should disclose his whereabouts. It is a shame for MVA government if a former home minister goes untraceable like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-leader-and-former-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-now-untraceable-101633101937242.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||Naupada police in Thane arrest 5 incl 4 women for burglaries||The Naupada police have arrested a gang of five accused, including four women, who allegedly used to burgle commercial establishments late at night. The police said that the first crucial clue in the investigation was obtained after tracking the movements of the accused for four kilometres in CCTV cameras, leading to 100% recovery of the stolen valuables.According to the Naupada police, investigations in the matter were initiated earlier in September, when the accused broke into a store in Thane and stole 25 water pumps.“We checked CCTV footage in and around the spot and saw three to four women moving in a suspicious manner and an auto rickshaw parked near the store. However, it was raining at the time of the burglary and the footage was unclear. We were still working on the case when another burglary occurred at a store near Teen Petrol Pump, where industrial aluminium plates were stolen. CCTV footage once again showed three to four women and an auto rickshaw,” senior police inspector Sanjay Dhumal, Naupada police station, said.The investigating team checked for more clues on CCTV footage around the scene of the second burglary and tracked the auto rickshaw all the way to Shivaji Chowk in Kalwa, where they finally obtained a clear enough image of its licence plate.Using the registration details of the auto rickshaw, the police made inquiries with its owner, who said that he had employed Akash Kachchhi (27) to drive the vehicle. Kachchhi was subsequently picked up from his Kalwa residence and questioned at length, after which he allegedly confessed to being involved in both the thefts.Based on his interrogation, the police went on to arrest Kachchhi as well as his mother Suman (50), wife Sheetal (24) and two other women from the same locality, identified as Rukmini Kamble (35) and Nandini Gaikwad (32).“The accused have also committed more thefts in the Kalwa and Mumbra areas in the past. They purposely used women to move the stolen goods as they are less likely to be stopped in police checks. We have recovered all the stolen goods from their possession,” Dhumal said. All the five accused have been charged with burglary under the Indian Penal Code and remanded in police custody till Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/naupada-police-in-thane-arrest-5-incl-4-women-for-burglaries-101633099838838.html
01-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath distributes appointment letters to naib tehsildars||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath distributed appointment letters to newly selected naib tehsildars in Lucknow on Friday. “Today, appointments are not made looking at the caste, religion, region or the face of an individual. Employees are now appointed solely on the basis of talent, qualification and merit in a transparent matter,” he said at the programme at Lok Bhavan in the state capital. Fifteen of the 110 naib tehsildars received the appointment letters from the chief minister himself. “The state government has conducted the selection process fairly, so we expect all of you will also work with honesty and remain accountable to the common man. In the last four-and-a-half years appointment letters have been given to 4.5 lakh youths. The state is now getting the benefit of their talent and energy,” Yogi Adityanath added. He also said Uttar Pradesh, which was in the 16th or the 17th position in the national rankings earlier, was now second in the ease of doing business. It was also the second largest economy of India, Yogi Adityanath added. “We are committed to making Uttar Pradesh the country’s biggest economy,” he said. Calling for people’s support, Yogi Adityanath said the state government alone cannot take the state to new heights. He also said the role of naib tehsildars had become more important as most of the cases were first reported at the tehsil level. Earlier, people had to wait for many years for mutation of land in their name, but the present government ensured mutation of around 13 lakh plots of land in a special campaign, he said. Ninety per cent of disputes can be solved through mediation and tehsildars have a role to play in this, he said. Stating that five expressways were being constructed in Uttar Pradesh, he said these would form the backbone of the economy. Yogi Adityanath said , “Uttar Pradesh has the same system and the resources that it had before 2017, but the functioning of the government has changed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-distributes-appointment-letters-to-naib-tehsildars-101633098696531.html
01-10-2021||Mumbai||Daily positivity rate in Thane at 2.34% is more than Maharashtra state’s 2.10%||In the last ten days, Thane city has had a positivity rate of 2.34%, which is higher than the Maharashtra State’s daily average of 2.10%. Despite this, the city continues to conduct merely between 2,000 and 3,000 tests on a daily basis.The State Public Health Department has stated that although the weekly positivity rate has not increased in the state after two weeks of Ganesh Chaturthi, the number of daily testing should not reduce, especially in the days before Dussehra and Diwali.However, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has claimed that the response from individuals to come forward for testing is also less. TMC has not made testing mandatory unless one has symptoms. This probably seems to be the reason for increased positivity rate. Currently, the city is at an overall positivity rate of 6.98%.“The provision for testing continues to be the same in the city. Hardly a handful turn up at the testing centres. Only those who have symptoms or have come in contact with a positive patient are forced to test. All others can only be requested to come forward and test. This has led to less number of tests in the city. But, all through, we have maintained to conduct more than 2,000 tests on a daily basis,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.TMC was testing more than 4,000 till June. During the peak of the second wave, it conducted 10,000 tests on a regular basis. In February, just before the advent of the second wave, the testing was reduced to less than 4,000 when the number of positive cases saw a spike. Despite this, TMC is conducting fewer tests, while its neighbouring cities of Kalyan-Dombivli and Navi Mumbai have both increased their number of daily tests.Testing centres in the city have noticed an overall lack of interest among the people to get tested, especially after increasing number of people getting fully vaccinated.“High risk contacts, people who have to travel or those with symptoms recommended by the doctors are the only ones who visit testing centres. If we request some who have mild symptoms, many times they refuse saying they are fully vaccinated. We cannot force anyone to get tested but unlike earlier, there are less people who come forward to get tested,” said a pathologist at a testing centre in Kolbad.During the peak of the second wave, the overall positivity rate was 7.30%. Until February, the positivity rate had gone below 2%. However, at present, the positivity rate continues to be stagnant between 2% and 2.50%. “The number of daily positive cases and the positivity rate is consistent, and on some days goes lower too. Hence, we have not increased the testing within the city. Only if a considerable spike is noted will we increase the daily number of tests,” said a senior official from TMC.Currently, Thane district has an overall positivity rate of 2.40%. This is higher than the State average too. Thane comes under the nine districts in the State that are of a concern. In the last ten days, Thane district has had more than 2,000 new positive cases.Although plans for lockdown relaxations are going on, Thane district officials are conducting special meetings with the District Collector to discuss how to handle the festival period in a better manner. “We are working on further relaxations amidst the pandemic such that the number of testing and vaccinations are not hampered across the district,” said an officer from District Health Department. Santosh Kadam, president, Indian Medical Association, Thane Chapter, said, “Testing is essential to understand the growth rate of cases, especially with the festive season approaching. With further relaxations in rules, more people should be tested. However, Thane’s positivity rate continues to be steady. Hence, there is nothing to panic about. We are also well prepared with facilities in case of a surge in cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/daily-positivity-rate-in-thane-at-2-34-is-more-than-maharashtra-state-s-210-101633097322072.html
01-10-2021||Kolkata||‘This is a crime’: Mamata Banerjee’s shrill attack over floods in 9 districts||KOLKATA: At least two persons were killed and more than two million people across nine districts have been affected as West Bengal faces the second floods this monsoon season since July. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged that it was a ‘man-made flood’ as the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) authorities and Jharkhand government didn’t inform the West Bengal government before releasing huge amount of water from the barrages. “This is a man-made flood. Water was released without informing us. This is a crime. We condemn this. This is not the first time that such things have happened,” said Mamata Banerjee while speaking to the media. A low pressure system has triggered extremely heavy rainfall in some districts of south Bengal since September 29. Asansol in West Burdwan district and Bankura district received 434mm and 354mm rain, respectively, in one day - the heaviest rainfall the districts ever received in one day.“This is the second flood to hit the state this season. According to preliminary reports, more than 2.2 million people have been affected and around 400,000 have been evacuated. Around 200,000 people have taken shelter in relief camps,” said West Bengal chief secretary HK Dwivedi.The state government has deployed eight columns of army, 25 teams of NDRF and 24 teams of SDRF for relief and rescue operations.In July-end and first week of August, the same districts were hit by floods when there was heavy rain and water was released from the barrages. Banerjee had then also called it a man-made floods. At least 16 people were killed then. West Bengal government officials said DVC drastically increased the amount of water being discharged from the Panchet and Maithan dams into the Damodar river. They released around 49,000 cusecs on September 30 and by early October 1, this figure went up to 150,000 cusecs. Another 80,000 cusecs was also released from the Sikatiya barrage in Jharkahnd late on September 30, which was increased to 120,000 cusecs by Friday morning.“This huge volume of water gushed down the rivers Damodar and Ajoy inundating many blocks in multiple districts downstream. In some blocks, the water level of the last flood was yet to recede when this water came,” said a senior official.DVC, however, refuted the allegations that it acted unilaterally.“DVC alone doesn’t decide when and how much water would be released. The Damodar Valley Reservoir Regulatory Committee decides it. A chief engineer-ranked official from the West Bengal government is a member of the committee,” a senior DVC official said.He added that the committee was forced to release water since DVC area and the area downstream heavy rainfall on September 29 and 30. “The water released by the DVC together with the heavy rainfall downstream, triggered the flood. It was not in our hands,” the senior official said.The chief minister is likely to undertake an aerial survey of some of the flood affected areas on Saturday. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mounted a counterattack on the Mamata Banerjee government.West Bengal BJP chief Sukant Majumdar said: “The chief minister is making baseless allegations. The state was informed about the release of water and yet they did nothing. Actually the flood was made by the chief minister so that she can get some money from the centre. When the central funds come, she would use it to give doles to clubs”.Even though south Bengal has received heavy rains over the past few weeks, officials said there was a huge difference in rainfall across the states this year. While at least nine districts in Wes Bengal, including Kolkata, have received excess rain, seven districts received normal rain. Three districts – Malda, South Dinajpur and North Dinajpur have received deficient rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/this-is-a-crime-mamata-banerjee-s-shrill-attack-over-floods-in-9-districts-101633097316109.html

These families have now received a notice from the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) asking to evict the homes and demolish them in 24 hours.The notice was issued on Wednesday, and on Thursday, CIDCO and a team of police had reached the spot asking the families to vacate the homes.“After we spoke and negotiated with CIDCO officials, they gave us three more days for vacating. Our only demand was that CIDCO should give verdicts on the hearings that they had conducted before the pandemic. Many had issues with the compensation, some were identified as non-eligible. All of those had hearings conducted by CIDCO and people don’t want to leave their homes without knowing the verdict,” advocate Prashant Bhoir, a resident of Ulwe village, said.He added that CIDCO now has told them that it will apply the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act.“As per this, if we do not leave our homes and go, they would not compensate us with the land that we are eligible for and instead would only give the compensation money. Due to this, now people are literally forced to leave without waiting for the decision on the hearings,” Bhoir said.Meanwhile, another villager, Pundalik Mhatre, said, “We do not have an option now and we are slowly making up our minds to leave.

The only obstacle standing in the way of the proposed route is the Thakurdwara flyover, which is constructed on the median of Grand Trunk (GT) Road, said officials. The Red Line of the DMRC terminates at New Bus Adda metro station in Ghaziabad. Officials said they want to improve the connectivity of the last station on the Red Line with the Ghaziabad railway station, which is proposed for redevelopment and will unfold into a model city centre station at an estimated cost of about ₹1,000 crore. The proposed project will have all modern amenities for passengers, besides commercial facilities, said officials. “We have decided to extend the Red Line of the Metro to the railway station keeping in mind the future developments at the station. In this context, we have asked the DMRC to give us a feasibility report on whether the extension is possible, and if possible, whether the connectivity will be elevated or underground,” said Krishna Karunesh, the authority’s vice chairperson. Currently, the Red Line of the Delhi Metro has eight stations in Ghaziabad and constructed on an elevated section built on pillars at the median of GT Road. “The Thakurdwara flyover (also constructed on the median of GT Road) is standing in the way of extending the Metro till Ghaziabad railway station. Hence, a feasibility report has been sought. It is a point of concern that the point where the metro will terminate (after the extension) is at some distance, about 300-400 metres, from GT Road,” said the vice chairperson. Officials said the estimated cost of extending the Metro per kilometre will be around ₹300-400 crore while an urban passenger ropeway system would cost around ₹90-100 crore. “We are considering the ropeway system too as it has a deeper reach and will help passengers get down near the railway station. We are just waiting for the feasibility report from the DMRC,” said Karunesh. In September, the GDA also got a detailed project report prepared for installing the urban passenger ropeway system for connecting the Mohan Nagar metro station on the Red Line to Vaishali metro station on the DMRC’s Blue line. The ropeway system is estimated to cost about ₹487 crore for connecting the 5.1km route between the two metro stations. Officials said they were going ahead with the ropeway system as it is more cost effective than Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/feasibility-report-sought-for-extending-metro-s-red-line-with-gzb-railway-stn-101633096176271.html

This was a major boost for my confidence but at the same time, I realised that I could have earned much more if a part of my earning hadn’t gone to the middlemen and commission agents,” she said, adding that it was the turning point of her life.“I began thinking of ways to increase profits for artisans,” says the 30-year-old who used that payment to set off on her entrepreneurial journey. Now, almost a decade on, Gulzar is the proud owner of five handloom centres in south Kashmir. The centres train young girls in chain stitching and crewel work. At present, she employs around 100 girls. “Once these girls pick up the skill, we provide them work at their doorstep,” she says.Helping the young girls support themselves and their families makes Gulzar proud as she had once found herself in the same place.“I was the oldest of six siblings. My younger sisters and brother looked up to me. My earnings from stitching helped my siblings get educated. Three of them have now secured government jobs,” says Gulzar.“My youngest sister Nelofar pursued a course in fashion designing. She now helps me keep up-to-date with the latest trends in the market and also helps us expand our business,” she says proudly.She found an ideal partner in her husband, who supported her in her endeavours and later went on to set up his own business in Anantnag, inspired by her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/emblems-of-empowerment-stitching-together-a-legacy-of-independent-women-101633094796312.html
01-10-2021||Kolkata||‘He was sent show cause notice,' Suvendu Adhikari on Krishna Kalyani's exit||Hours after Krishna Kalyani, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Raiganj district of West Bengal, announced his resignation saying that he has decided to dissociate himself from the party, Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari on Friday said that Kalyani was sent a show cause notice for “abusing” the saffron camp’s leadership.Kalyani has said it was impossible for him to work for common people with former Union minister Debasree Chowdhury "running the show" in the region."Raiganj MP Debasree Choudhury has been conspiring against me for a long time now. She has called me a traitor, but in reality she is the one to have hatched a conspiracy to ensure my defeat from Raiganj as it suited her personal agenda," Kalyani was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. “It is in the fitness of things that I dissociate myself from the party,” he said, adding that the party had "disregarded" his grievances.In contrast to this, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari said that the saffron party does not compromise on its system and discipline for anyone.“A show cause notice was sent to Raiganj MLA (Krishna Kalyani). He was abusing the BJP leadership. The party will not compromise on its system and discipline, rest who stays and who leaves is not our priority,” Adhikari told news agency ANI.The TMC was quick to extend an invitation to Kalyani to join the fold but he said he has no plan to join the ruling Trinamool Congress as of now. He added that his only wish is to serve the people of his constituency, “which seems impossible in the BJP with that one person (Choudhury) running the organisation here”.Veteran Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Roy, reacting to the development, said that he has found out that Kalyani was not getting due respect in the BJP. "We would like to welcome him to our party," he said.Several known faces of Bengal politics have jumped ship from the saffron camp since mid-May to September, including Mukul Roy and Babul Supriyo, to join the Mamata Banerjee-led party. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee recently said that BJP leaders were queuing up outside the ruling camp’s office but there will be a thorough “screening” before the party inducts anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/he-was-sent-show-cause-notice-suvendu-adhikari-on-krishna-kalyani-s-exit-101633092974098.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Mirroring The City||As a water body, it is no more than a drop in the ocean of Mumbai’s concrete jungle, but perhaps through its many phases of ruin and restoration, degradation and development, splendour and squalor, the Bandra Talao reflects the story of the city itself. Spread across 7.5 acres, it was colloquially known as Lotus Tank and is said to have been constructed by a wealthy Muslim resident of the area, around 200 years ago, as a scenic spot where water lilies, boating and fishing were a common sight, and families with their kids would gather to feed geese or paddle languidly, while ardent anglers would congregate to catch guppy and fighter fish and the East Indian community would converge for their wedding ritual known as ‘Umbra cha Pani.’ Boating and fishing and traditional water rituals in the middle of the city? How very bucolic. And how very Bandra. Yes indeed, those were the days. Neighbourhoods and cities die gradually, through neglect and apathy, and no one can give you the exact date when things began to go pear-shaped for the Talao, but from a spot which had been regarded as a tourist attraction, it fell in to disrepute and neglect, attracting its share of drifters and drug users, derelicts and drunks. For many years, commuters passing through the junction of SV Road could tell you that the way in which they knew they were approaching the Talao was by its fetid acrid smell that would assail their nostrils while in its vicinity, and late night commuters coming off Bandra station would speak of how they would quicken their steps, their heads down, their collars up, hoping they would not be accosted by an unsavoury intruder on its borders. A sorry state indeed for a lake which had always been the first handshake that commuters on the city’s south-north axis used to make with Bandra, on their journey northwards: a muddy, stinky apology of a lake, mostly grey and dirty, awash with garbage – a symbol of the rot and the ruin that the city had fallen into… Recently, news of the restoration of Bandra Talao has been making the rounds. Said to have been egged on by local residents and environmental activists, the Grade-2 heritage is said to have finally witnessed beautification and repair through the intervention of BMC’s H-West ward, which took it over in a bid to restore it to its former glory. “It is one of the largest water bodies in and around Bandra, located as it is on the main SV Road, which is the arterial road of the suburbs, and there was a lot of demand from locals to develop it,” said three-term corporator from Bandra constituency and the person said to be instrumental in much of the improvements of the area, Asif Zakaria, when we spoke this week. “It was once a spot for boating and picnics, but as it was not being frequented by citizens, it had turned into a neglected space, with garbage dumped in the water and other nefarious activities around it,” he said, adding, “But recently, with active citizens’ participation, the Talao has been improved upon with walking pathway all around so that citizens can enjoy the open water front. The main idea was to connect it from all sides in order to create useable open space for people to walk, jog etc and enjoy the open water body. There are also better lighting, water aerators, security and regular cleaning of the floating material.” Initially, Zakaria says, BMC had faced many challenges in its maintenance, but with local citizens’ participation, it was able to get a grip on things. What’s more, according to Zakaria, the restoration of the Talao is no flash in the pan. “Bandra has a very vibrant citizens movement which has resulted in various other open spaces being improved like the Joggers park, Part 2 Gardens at Bandstand, the Prof Almeida Park, and the creation of the first urban square at St Stephen’s steps and Mount Mary – which was once a narrow pathway but has now been converted into a large open square for the community for various social cultural activities,” he said. “No, I haven’t seen the Bandra Talao recently. So I cannot vouch for its restoration,” said long-time resident of Bandra and one of the pillars of its community, Owen Roncon, adding, “But as someone who loves Bandra, I commend any initiatives that restore and upgrade it”. For Roncon, who along with wife and former Bandra MP Priya Dutt, is known to have worked hard to transform his beloved Bandra into one of the city’s most welcoming suburbs and a hub for F&B, there is another issue: that of too much of a good thing. “Bandra today is experiencing an unprecedented onslaught of visitors on weekends,” he rued. “If you see Hill Road on a Saturday night, it’s a circus: cars, crowds, shoppers, motorcycles. We Bandra residents don’t venture out on weekends because of the noise and chaos,” he said, adding, “ Yes, the government and authorities can and must improve things, but then it is up to citizens to behave responsibly too…” “The city is certainly witnessing rejuvenation as far as its aesthetics and civic-minded issues,” said industrialist Harsh Goenka, who is currently involved in the restoration of Banganga, another city landmark.” “I have enormous respect for [Maharashtra CM] Uddhav Thackeray and his government who have made the improvement of Mumbai and its facilities for ordinary citizens a key point of their agenda,” he said. “Perhaps it is due to the fact that for the first time we have people heading the state who have grown up all their lives in the city and have its interests at heart…” he added. “There remains much more to be done, but it is a step in the right direction…”I began this column by saying that in many ways, Bandra Talao could be said to be a mirror of the city itself: Once a place of old world glory and charm, then a symbol of its apathy and ruin and recently an example of how things can be restored and revived, with the collaboration of residents and authorities. But will it last? Weeks after its face lift, there are already reports of hiccups and setbacks. The water aerators, which were installed to keep the lake clean and free from algae, are said to have stopped working because miscreants had stolen the wiring according to news reports, and critics say the lake’s eastern borders remain neglected and could do with some trees and lighting so that families and kids could return. So will the recently restored Bandra Talao live up to its promise and remain clean and welcoming? And will it become a tangible symbol of how things can be restored and revived if people set their hearts and minds to the task? Who can tell? But as of now, the mood is of cautious optimism...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-mirroring-the-city-101633093599757.html
01-10-2021||Bangalore||Family evacuated after sinkhole appears due to metro work in Bengaluru||A family residing at a building in Bengaluru was evacuated on Thursday after a 30-feet sinkhole appeared on Tannery Road in the city’s metro network (Namma Metro) during tunnelling work, several media reports stated.The incident occurred at around 7.30am and nearly 100 metres away from Venkateshpura metro UG station where a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) namely ‘Bhadra’ of the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) was functioning.A BMRCL release reportedly said that the sinkhole was created after an open well had been closed earlier and a building was built on it. It added that the building, from where the family was evacuated, was beside the sinkhole, and the family has been given alternate accommodation near Nagawara to ensure their safety. A chicken shop on the building’s ground floor was also shut following the sinkhole discovery.The metro corporation has decided to close up the sinkhole with sand and concrete for now, and resume the boring process. It said that once the filling process ends, and the building is secured, the family will be brought back to the building.In August, a house in Bengaluru was flooded with water and mud slurry after it blew up from the ground owing to force implemented by the TBM Bhadra, the News Minute reported.Meanwhile, last month another TBM namely ‘Urja’ achieved a breakthrough at the end of the Shivajinagar station after beginning the tunnelling process in 2020, BMRCL said in a statement. As many as nine TBM are presently doing tunnelling work for the underground construction of the Pink Line of Namma Metro. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has also directed BMRCL officials to complete the phase 2 of the Namma Metro by 2024 instead of 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/family-evacuated-after-sinkhole-appears-due-to-metro-work-in-bengaluru-101633093067500.html
01-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugramwale: Portrait of a couple||Muhammed Shamshuddin stays forever rescued from wondering what might be in his lunch on any given day. “There’s never any suspense,” he says. It’s always the same dish—geeli aloo subzi with rotis. “My wife makes this every morning… it’s the cheapest thing to make.”A “reri walla,” Mr Shamsuddin is in his 50s and hauls grocery products on his wooden trolley in a Gurugram bazaar. “Sitara Begum, my gharwali, cooks it early in the morning, and she serves me the same for breakfast, too.”It is afternoon and the man has taken a break from work. He settles down under a tree, that is already sheltering a few other labourers. Some of them have taken off their shirt due to the heat, and are looking at ease in their vest. Mr Shamsuddin continues the food talk. “My wife used to be a good cook… but now we don’t care how the food tastes. We have grown old and when you will reach my age, you too will no longer worry about things like the flavour of subzi chawal.” The couple lives with their four sons and their families, “but each of us have a separate kitchen.” Despite being warned by a doctor to avoid strenuous labour following a critical surgery, Mr Shamshuddin continues to drag his cart “because I have to feed my gharwali (wife), and I also like to work and stay active.” He quickly rushes to defend his sons from any snap judgements concerning their responsibilities towards him and his wife. They are labourers like him, he explains, and they earn barely enough to support their own wives and kids.The couple married some 30 years ago in their UP village. “My woman didn’t wed a reri walla (at the time). I had a better job.” He was employed in a plastic factory that shut down later. “Since then I’m doing this work.”Now he opens his lunch box—aloo subzi and rotis. Mr Shamshuddin checks the time on his mobile, commenting, “She (Sitara Begum) must also be having this same khana.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugramwale-portrait-of-a-couple-101633090822299.html
01-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court issues process against Anil Deshmukh for not responding to ED’s summons||A metropolitan magistrate court on Friday issued process against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for failing to comply with the summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and has asked him to appear before the court on November 16.After the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader failed to appear before the agency despite several summons, ED has moved the court to prosecute Deshmukh for non-compliance under section 174 (non-attendance in obedience to an order from public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, which prescribes punishment of up to one month’s simple imprisonment or fine up to ₹500.ED’s counsel, advocates Arvind Aghav and Shreeram Shirsath, argued that the agency had summoned Deshmukh five times under section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, on June 25 and 28, July 2 and 30 and August 16.Except for the first summon, all others were for personal appearance, they said. They added that Deshmukh had himself received the first summons and the other summons were received by his family members and lawyer.“The accused, however, wilfully neglected and failed to appear before the agency and thus has contravened section 174 of IPC,” ED’s lawyers said.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate RM Nerlikar accepted their contentions. The court observed that considering the documents on record and submissions made, prime facie, a case was made out, and issued process against Deshmukh. ED has arrested Deshmukh’s personal assistant Sanjeev Palande and secretary Kundan Shinde in the money laundering case against the former home minister and filed a detailed charge-sheet against them, in which dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – now in jail for Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran cases – is also named an accused.The central agency has alleged that on Deshmukh’s instructions, Vaze had called a meeting of bar owners from Mumbai and demanded a monthly amount of ₹3 lakh from each of them. ED has stated in its charge sheet that Vaze had collected ₹4.7 crore from various bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021 at Deshmukh’s behest. According to the agency, Vaze handed over the extorted money to Shinde and subsequently, a part of the amount was routed to Deshmukh’s charitable trust in Nagpur through various shell companies.The agency claimed that its investigation began after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had directed Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments in Mumbai. Singh approached the Bombay high court (HC) and filed a petition in the matter. Based on HC’s order, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) initially conducted a preliminary inquiry and on April 21 registered an offence under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, after which ED started its investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-issues-process-against-anil-deshmukh-for-not-responding-to-ed-s-summons-101633087837856.html

01-10-2021||Mumbai||120 tree fall incidents this monsoon compared to 512 last year, says Navi Mumbai civic body||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has claimed that the tree fall incidents this monsoon have decreased by more than 76% compared to the previous year.According to the NMMC’s disaster management cell, between June and September this year, there were only 120 tree falling cases as opposed to 512 registered in the corresponding period last year.Last year, a man died after a tree fell on him in Airoli. However, no such incident was reported this year. Only four vehicles were damaged after a tree fell on them in Vashi in July.Jaydeep Pawar, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC (tree authority and garden department), said that the number of tree-falling cases is less this year as there were no cyclones in the four months of monsoon.“There were multiple cyclones between June and September last year and hence as many as 512 trees fell down. But there was no cyclone in the corresponding time this year. If you see, we lost 153 trees during Cyclone Tauktae this year too. But that was in May, much before the onset of the monsoon.”A survey conducted in 2017 revealed that there were 8,57,295 trees in Navi Mumbai. It also revealed that there were 1,88,000 Subabul trees in the city, the largest species found here. Dr. V Shubhalaxmi, an environmentalist and founder of iNaturewatch Foundation, Kharghar, said, “Normally, the shallow-rooted trees such as gulmohar and rain tree fall during monsoon. When the authorities dig up the soil near such trees for different civic works around that time, their roots lose grip and their chances of falling increase. This year, we have observed that there was not much digging work in the jurisdiction of NMMC and that could be a reason why the number of tree-falling cases is less this year. We also agree that had there been more cyclones during the four months of monsoon, more trees would have fallen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/120-tree-fall-incidents-this-monsoon-compared-to-512-last-year-says-navi-mumbai-civic-body-101633086040325.html
01-10-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Ola! (No, not the cab ride)... A dip into the lexicon of humanity||Sometimes it is not the right time for an idea or a direction. And sometimes, the time is just right, but we are not ready. But then, there are times when the time is right, the opportunity arises and we are open to revisiting an old idea and it sort of starts working out.Like my desire to learn Spanish, which dates back to … I don’t know: high school?The past two years have been a good learning experience, especially thanks to Netflix. And a good bit of what I have been watching has been in Spanish.As a general rule, I watch to learn about cultures and people rather than to just get entertained so the content has to be meaningful and engaging, which automatically rules out a bulk of regular and mainstream programming and movies. Spanish movies and serials have been a revelation for me in terms of quality of story-telling, performance and production value. When these three elements are firmly in place, language has never been a barrier.The thing about language is that it is spoken not with the tongue or throat or the lips, but with your whole body. The facial expressions, the gravity of sound, intonation, the depth of the gaze of the eyes, the body language... all of it are the true essence of the communication - the words we speak are the end result of a complex set of communication processes that the mind and the body constructs. And Spanish is a language that is as animated and immersed in human emotions as any other significantly evolved language: I imagine it is a very accurate reflection of the nature of Spanish-speaking people.I have limited direct experience with the people of Spain, and some limited direct experience with Spanish-speaking people from other parts of the world (South America and North America). But, I am fascinated with their passion, zest for life, and ability to connect with the world. My first direct interaction with Spanish came in 1989-90, when I started studying the language at the School of Foreign Languages in Mumbai. From the beginning, it always felt familiar, although I never persevered to achieve fluency.Then in the mid-2000s, my wife and I were on a trip to Ajanta Caves where we met a young Spanish photographer, Marcos Rebollos. Listening to them talk photography and art and travel, was mesmerising for me - it was the first time I had met a native speaker and it confirmed everything I had imagined about the language and the people: they were full of life and fascinating. Marcos was from Santander and I remembered Santander because they had a football club that was at that time in La Liga, Racing Santander. I kept an eye on the club’s progress for many seasons simply because we had met Marcos. And I think human beings are like that: we make connections and feel connected to their places and their lives and their cultures.I am not much of a traveller. In the sense that if life takes me somewhere, I go, but I don’t plan travel or have an intense desire to go and see places. My professional work has been centered around media, technology-based education, aviation and hospitality for the past three decades and it was work that took me to Orlando in Florida in the USA in 2008. Since then (till 2019) I had an annual trip to this delightful, delightful city where you see innovative emerging trends in all these industries thanks to the collaboration of industry, educational institutions, government and citizens. And: most of the locals I meet speak some dialect of Spanish (last I checked 37% of the population is of Hispanic origins).It was also work that eventually took me to Madrid in 2018 for a few days. And while I was staying mostly on the outskirts and didn’t see much because I was attending a trade show and conference, the three days were great because I was able to speak Spanish (haltingly) with the local people I met at the hotel, restaurant, conference and airport.I think I got on to Netflix at around the same time or a little earlier, and the first series I latched on to was Gran Hotel, watching Amaia Salamanca and Yon González. The series, which is set in the early 1900s, was shot on location at the Palacio de la Magdalena. And where is this Palace located? Near the city of Santander. I am a person who believes that there is more to the world and life than what we see and believe, and that it is not necessary that life is a series of coincidences - it is more inspiring to believe there is some reason why we meet the people we meet. Even if it is to feel that we are part of one world, made from the same fabric.In the last two years, I have discovered La Chicas del Cable, Tiempos de Guerra, Velvet, and 45 RPM, the last one about a young musician and the recording business. Music, love, pain, joy, failure, success, death, parting, anguish, food, relationships, disease, death, parting, suffering, recovery, hope ... Life is the same all over the world. Even in pandemic times.And while I am as inquisitive as ever about Spanish, I have realised we all speak one language all across the globe. It is the language of being human.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-ola-no-not-the-cab-ride-a-dip-into-the-lexicon-of-humanity-101633085855910.html

For developing the basement of the complex, they are now digging the plot and transporting the soil to different places. However, the soil often falls off trucks on the road. Ramesh Sankhe, 36, a resident of Vashi, said, “The condition of the roads becomes so bad during the rainy days that we cannot even walk on them properly. When there is no rain, the soil dries up and the entire area turns dusty. All the residents of Sector 9, 10, 11 and 12 are suffering from this issue.”Monali Salve, 24, another resident, said, “We understand that the NMMC is developing an ambitious project in our area and we are thankful to them for that. But at the same time, they should also ensure that we, the residents, do not suffer due to their carelessness.”A senior NMMC officer said, “We have asked our workers to be careful while transporting the soil. We are also getting the roads cleaned from time to time so that residents do not face any issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vashi-residents-complain-of-murky-roads-near-nmmc-s-ambitious-project-site-101633083818649.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Delay in paddy buying won’t affect growers in south Punjab||The Centre’s decision to put off the purchase of paddy in Punjab and Haryana till October 11 due to the recent rains is unlikely to impact farmers of south Punjab as officials in the Malwa belt say the bulk arrival of non-basmati varieties in the grain markets starts after that date in any case. Also read: Punjab CM Channi to meet PM Modi, Congress leaders in Delhi todayPunjab Mandi Board deputy general manager (DGM), Ferozepur division, Kuldeep Singh Brar said on Friday that a few farmers are expected to bring hybrid paddy in the first week, which is not bought by government agencies, but small quantities of parmal rice varieties start arriving in mandis from October 8. Peak paddy arrival after October 10 “Normally, heavy arrival of PR paddy begins from October 10 and peak arrival season lasts for the next 10 days. We are not expecting any major problem with paddy growers in the division due to the delay in procurement plans. The department has made elaborate arrangements for hassle-free purchase,” said Brar. Mandi board’s Ferozepur division covers six districts, namely Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Faridkot, Ferozepur and Fazilka. “There is no doubt that the recent rains in Punjab have enhanced moisture level in grains. Clear weather will bring the moisture content to the optimum level and make it a good quality foodgrain,” said a senior functionary of mandi board. Moga expected to top in paddy yield According to the deputy director of the state food and civil supplies department, Mangal Das, this season, south Punjab is expected to produce about 56 lakh metric tonnes of PR varieties. He said state agencies are expecting 14.5 lakh MT from Moga, the highest arrival among Malwa districts, followed by Bathinda (13.5 lakh MT) and Ferozepur (11.7 lakh MT).

01-10-2021||Mumbai||Barge tragedy: Court rejects bail pleas of director, employees of shipping firm||A Mumbai court on Friday rejected bail pleas of the director and two employees of a shipping company booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after one of the firm’s barges (P-305) capsized when Cyclone Tauktae hit in May and left 71 people on board dead. It said the offence was extremely grave. “The applicants, though highly positioned and responsible officers, were callous in duty to protect the life of their crew members who were working in highly dangerous and hazardous operation,” said the court. “Their negligence was culpable with awareness due to several warnings about the Cyclone that there could be a threat to life...”The police booked officials of Afcon and Papaa Shipping Private Limited for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after the tragedy.Lawyers Shrish Gupte and Girish Kulkarni, who appeared for the accused, Nitin Kumar Singh (Papaa Shipping director) manager Prasad Rane, and technical superintendent Akhileshwar Tiwari argued the accused were not on board the barge but at the base. They added the three did not have any weather reports, any alerts.The lawyers said the barge master, who was among those who lost their lives, and Afcons were receiving the reports. “It was the decision of the barge master to keep the barge stationed in high seas and they had no control or role to play in it. The barge could not have been moved without a tug and Afcons was under obligations to provide the same.” The lawyers said one of the accused even sent a message to the barge master to not take any risk while the other two sought help immediately. Assistant public prosecutor Seema Deshpande argued the accused knowingly did not perform their duties even as the cyclone was anticipated. “To save money and expenditure, the barge was not moved. There is evidence against the accused...”Additional sessions judge Deepak L Bhagwat rejected the bail pleas, observing there were continuous warnings from the weather department. “The barge master had taken a decision to stay stationed at the spot. However, it was the duty of the applicants to call back the crew members immediately after the alerts were issued. They can’t claim ignorance of the alerts issued as they were related to the operations.”The court said the barge master initially decided to return but after a meeting with Afcons officials, he changed his decision, which was an error of judgement. “When other barges had returned and only Papaa 305 was anchored in the high-sea, it was their duty to either move the barge or take its crew to safer areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-tragedy-court-rejects-bail-pleas-of-director-employees-of-shipping-firm-101633080096850.html

The strike will continue till all the demands are met, MARD said.The full waiver of academic fees is the protesters' primary demand, Dr Akshay Yadav, a member of the doctors’ body said. “Secondly, the hostel conditions should be improved as these are not good across Maharashtra. Third, TDS should not be deducted from the stipend of resident doctors of hospitals under the BMC. Government hospitals throughout the state are yet to receive Covid-19 incentives,” Yadav further said, according to news agency ANI.He also said that the higher authorities had called protesters for a discussion on the matter. “However, we want a written assurance but are yet to receive that. Doctors have sacrificed everything for the people of the country. So, we only want justice for Covid-19 warriors,” Yadav remarked. We want written assurance. We've not shut emergency services so that patient care isn't compromised. Academic fees should be waived off as less academics was going on during COVID.

The STF recovered 1000 cartridges of 315 bore, two country-made pistols of 7.65mm, two magazines, two motorcycles, four cell phones and ₹3.70 lakh. This huge recovery is significant because cartridges can’t be manufactured locally and are always stolen or smuggled. The arrested were identified as Anil Singh, a resident of Daudnagar in Aurangabad; Prabhat Kumar Singh (Nawada) and Bijay Kumar Singh (Rajgir). The accused have been booked under various sections of the Arms Act and would be sent to jail on Friday. Additional director general (Operations) SM Khopde said that interrogation is going on to know if these ammunition were being procured in view of ongoing panchayat election in Bihar or not. “The three arrested persons confessed that they used to supply arms and ammunition to criminals in Nalanda, Nawada, Patna and Jehanabad districts,” Khopde added.Police said that the kingpin of the racket, Anil Singh, procured ammunition from a Jharkhand supplier and was going to deliver it to conduits in Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura and Patna. Acting on a tip-off, the STF nabbed Anil Singh at Rajgir when he reached to deliver the ammunition consignment. During the interrogation, he revealed about Prabhat and Bijay. Police later raided their places and recovered firearms and magazines from their possession. The police are now looking for the person who was to deliver the consignment to Anil. The STF claimed that they have already identified the person and their teams were conducting raids in Jharkhand to nab him. During the interrogation, they disclosed that they are part of an illegal cartridges supply syndicate.

Covid-19 cases in September have seen a 46.64% decline from the previous month. The state logged 85,980 cases in September. In August, the state recorded 161,161 Covid-19 cases. In terms of fatalities, the state has registered a 61.21% drop. In August, Maharashtra reported 4,522 fatalities due to Covid-19, which dropped to 1,754 in September.Pawar, while speaking to media persons on Thursday, said that “gradually” the situation is getting better and the state is looking at reopening all remaining restrictions in the state. The state government started its graded unlocking of restrictions in August.“We will have a meeting after October 8 wherein we will decide whether to allow other activities as well... The chief minister has decided to reopen all activities gradually, like theatres, etc, which were not allowed so far. We are taking stock of the situation and taking steps [to reopen] and if the situation keeps improving then definitely we will see a different picture in Maharashtra,” Pawar said.Last week, the state government announced the reopening of schools and places of worship from October 4 and October 7, respectively. Later, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that the state will allow cinema halls, auditoriums to reopen from October 22. The state government, which is yet to issue guidelines for reopening theatres and cinema halls, is expected to allow it with 50% capacity and also keep it open only for double-vaccinated citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-decide-on-lifting-covid-restrictions-after-a-week-101633069715916.html

Police superintendent Awadesh Goswami said the registration of the case in the matter was delayed until Thursday as the girl was unable to explain to her mother about what had happened.Police said the minors aged between 15 to 17 have been held while the two other accused have been arrested and booked for rape and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act. Deputy police superintendent Sonali Gupta said the girl belongs to an underprivileged family. “She was taken to a secluded place...and raped.... The traumatised girl tried to share her ordeal with her mother but she did not understand. Facing health issues, the mother asked her to explain her problem.

01-10-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal witnesses huge disparity in monsoon rain distribution||At least two places in south Bengal – Asansol in West Burdwan and Bankura – received the highest ever rainfall in one day, even as officials from the meteorological department pointed out the huge disparity in the distribution of monsoon rain in the state since June.While Asansol in West Burdwan district received 434.5mm rain between Wednesday and Thursday morning, Bankura district recorded 354.3mm rain during the same time. Bankura received more than 30 times excess rain on a single day. “This is the highest rain the two places have received in any month till date. While the previous high in Bankura was recorded in June 1922 when it received 292.4mm rain, the previous high in Asansol was recorded in July 2018 when it received 192mm rain,” said an IMD official. Even though Cyclone Gulab, which hit the Andhra Pradesh coast on September 26, didn’t have much effect in West Bengal, a cyclonic circulation that intensified into a well-marked low-pressure system, triggered heavy rain in Kolkata and other districts of south Bengal this week.Last week, Kolkata received the heaviest September rain in 14 years. Large parts of the city have been inundated. At least 14 persons were electrocuted to death across the state in waterlogged streets and houses. “The disparity is because monsoon has been vigorous of late in south Bengal. Back-to-back cyclonic circulations are developing over the Bay of Bengal, which on intensifying and approaching the coast, are triggering intense spells of rain,” said a senior official from the meteorological department.Even though south Bengal has been receiving heavy rain over the past few weeks, officials pointed out a huge disparity in the cumulative monsoon rain the state has received this season since June. While at least nine districts in West Bengal, including Kolkata, have received excess rain, seven districts received normal rain. Three districts – Malda, South Dinajpur and North Dinajpur received deficient rain. According to meteorological parlance, rainfall is considered ‘normal’ if the amount is 19% below or above the climatic normal of three decades. In case it is 20% to 59% more, it is called ‘excess’ rain. Likewise, a shortfall of -20% to -59% is said to be ‘deficient’. “One of the primary reasons behind these intense spells is climate change. The water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by around 7% if there is a rise of one degree in temperature. Across India, incidents of heavy rain spells are increasing. This is just one consequence of climate change,” said KJ Ramesh, former director of the India Meteorological Department.Data available with the Union ministry of earth sciences reveal that while in 2016 around 1864 IMD stations across India recorded very heavy rain and 226 stations recorded extremely heavy rain, in 2020 at least 1912 stations had registered very heavy rain and extremely heavy rain was recorded in 341 stations. In 2018 and 2019 such events were even higher.The ‘Assessment of climate change over the Indian region’ – a report published by the Union earth sciences ministry in 2020 suggests that there has been a shift in the recent period toward more frequent dry spells and more intense wet spells during the summer monsoon season. The frequency of localized heavy precipitation occurrences has increased worldwide in response to increased atmospheric moisture content “Our analysis of 100 years of data of rainfall in West Bengal shows that the overall rainfall in the monsoon season has increased but the number of rainy days has dropped resulting in intense spells. What aggravates the situation is that while on one hand alteration of nature is going on in an unbridled way, we also lack the mitigation and preparedness,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University in Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/disparity-in-monsoon-rain-distribution-in-bengal-south-districts-register-heaviest-rain-ever-101633064436139.html

01-10-2021||Delhi||Can highways be kept blocked perpetually: SC on farmer stir||The Supreme Court on Thursday said public roads and highways cannot be “perpetually” blocked, taking a dim view of the Union and state governments’ inability to resolve the protracted problem of farmers blocking highways as part of their ongoing protests against the three contentious farm laws. Main highways into and out of Delhi have been partially blocked since last November inconveniencing local residents as well as travellers.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh emphasised that it is the “duty” of the executive to implement the law on ensuring agitations do not block movement on public roads before such protests start being viewed as an incentive by one section of society or another.“Courts have to lay down the law. We laid down the law and how to implement the law is the business of the executive. The court has no means to implement it. Now, you cannot tell us to do something. You have to implement the law,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general KM Natraj. The law officers were appearing for the Central government and the Delhi Police.As Mehta agreed with the court that it is the responsibility of the executive to implement the law, the bench continued: “On a lighter side, if we were to encroach upon your domain, you will say the judiciary is transgressing into the executive’s turf, but understand the problem at hand has several ramifications.”The bench added that while a section of society may have some feelings against a particular policy of the government, occupation of highways cannot go on forever.“It cannot be a perpetual problem. Let us assume they have grievances. Then there are some other sections which are stuck on the roads. They have their own set of grievances. Method of redressal of grievances can be through debate; or in the parliament; or even by way of protests; but if it is found to happen perpetually, where does it end?” it asked the law officers.The court pointed out that such protests also create financial issues such as loss of toll on the highways. “Tomorrow, you will have people saying that since you are giving such benefits to one section of people (protestors), we will also not pay toll etc,” it added.Thousands of farmers are camping on the borders of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and on highways along these states since November last year, protesting three controversial laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy. Traffic at many points have been diverted, adding to commuting times, besides affecting commercial activities along these routes.Petitioner Monicca Agarwaal, who works in an information technology firm and is a single mother, approached the top court, complaining it is taking her almost two hours, instead of 20 minutes, to travel from Noida to Delhi due to frequent blockades and protests. She contended that directions by the apex court in several cases to keep roads clear, including the Shaheen Bagh protest in 2019-20, are not being followed.During the proceedings on Thursday, S-G Mehta informed the bench that a three-member committee has been formed to resolve the logjam and it invited the farmers’ groups too but they refused to join on the grounds that they are not parties to Agarwaal’s petition. Mehta requested the bench to also make a few farmers’ organisations parties to the case on his oral request.But the bench asked the S-G to move a proper application in this regard, specifying how making these farmers’ groups parties to the case will facilitate resolution of the issue.Mehta agreed to do so and said that such an application will be filed by Friday. The court, on his request, agreed to hear the case on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/public-roads-can-t-be-blocked-forever-says-supreme-court-101633042372261.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Rural areas of Ambala to get ₹20-crore infra boost in health sector||The Ambala health department has proposed to strengthen the infrastructure in rural areas of the district through the central funds worth ₹20 crore. Under the 15th finance commission, Haryana will receive ₹310 crore for developing health services. The recommendations were presented before Ambala deputy commissioner Vikram, who chaired a meeting on Thursday to discuss proposals and agendas on developing the health infrastructure in the district. Civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said the department has proposed to develop more sub-centres in the district along with increasing the Covid testing facilities.“The report will be submitted by this week and we can provide these services within six months when funds are released,” he added.Ambala currently has a district-level hospital in the city, two subdivisional hospitals in cantonment and Naraingarh, four community health centres (CHCs), 18 public health centres (PHCs), six urban public health centres (UPHCs), one polyclinic and 106 sub-health centres (SHC).The department has recommended adding 15 sub-centres in rural and 16 in urban areas, Dr Sukhpreet, assistant senior medical officer at the civil surgeon’s office, said. “Two block public health units in the rural belt will also be developed that would provide services such as specialist doctors. At least 63 testing facilities on the lines of Ayushman Bharat Scheme will be provided at PHCs by adding at least 15 sub-centres at the block level. The testing facilities at PHC levels will be amplified by adding new machines, manpower and buildings. Focus is to consolidate health services in rural areas,” the doctor said.Construction of a new building of the 200-bed district civil hospital is also underway next to the existing one in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rural-areas-of-ambala-to-get-20-crore-infra-boost-in-health-sector-101633042832775.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sacking of Best Price employees: Farmers hold protest in Zirakpur||Members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta (Ugrahan) on Thursday held a protest in front of Walmart’s mega multi-store Best Price in Zirakpur over alleged sacking of its employees in Bathinda. The protesters did not allow any customer to enter the store. Addressing the farmers, BKU Ekta (Ugrahan) head Joginder Singh said all Best Price stores in Punjab would be closed if the company did not reinstate the sacked employees. He said the company ignored their previous warning and took action in just two days, accepted the resignations of employees and terminated their services permanently by depositing the gratuity and full and final amount in their bank accounts. It may be recalled that a stir was launched in front of Best Price in Bathinda, which caused huge financial loss to the company and forced it to close its Bathinda store permanently and cancel its entire wholesale membership. Company officials fired their local employees by fraudulently taking their resignations, Joginder said. He also condemned the top brass of the company for accepting the resignations by flouting rules. He said they would continue their struggle till the jobs of the employees were restored. If the company fails to do so, the struggle could extend for an indefinite period and the company will be responsible for this, he added. When questioned if any leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha should contest elections, Joginder said, “My organisation has no intention of contesting the elections and no leader has expressed such desire. The repeal of the three farm laws is the only goal of the leaders and once it is done, then anyone could do anything.” Indian Farmers’ Union Ekta (Ugrahan) state vice-president Jhanda Singh Jethuke, Manjit Singh Nial and Patiala district president Jaswant Singh were among those who also addressed the protesting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacking-of-best-price-employees-farmers-hold-protest-in-zirakpur-101633041753135.html

The complainant, Lovejyot Singh, had to fly to Canada to ‘save his life’, said his counsel. In September 2017, a murder case was registered in Banur pertaining to a contract killing wherein accused Nirmaljit Singh, alias Nimma, Sukhjit Singh and others had hired members of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang to kill Daljit Singh, alias Pinchi, uncle of the complainant . Lovejyot’s counsel Charanjit Singh Bakshi stated that the complainant was repeatedly threatened and forced to even file a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) for security. The same is still pending, he said, adding that due to continuous threat to his life, Lovejyot had to “flee” to Canada to “save his life”. The HC had directed the trial court to record the statement of the complainant on September 24, following which an application was moved before the trial court apprising it of the ‘severe’ threat to his life and his inability to come to India. The court, after perusing numerous guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court and other HCs about the recording of evidence through videoconferencing, held that this was a fit case for the complainant’s testimony to be recorded in such a manner. The court also perused the model rules on videoconferencing received from the apex court that have been duly circulated by the registrar general, Punjab and Haryana high court. A bare reading of the same provides as to how evidence of witnesses or accused is to be recorded through videoconferencing. The next date of hearing has been fixed for October 5, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2017-mohali-murder-case-witness-to-be-examined-through-videoconferencing-101633040912470.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||GMADA begins process to acquire 500 acres in Mohali’s Sector 101||The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has begun the process of acquisition of 500 acres in Sector 101, two months after a three-member panel placed the said sector in the ‘Red’ category. The development authority will also acquire 250 acres in Sector 103 in a phased manner. GMADA chief administrator Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said, “We have already issued the notice under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, inviting objections from the public. We are hopeful of land acquisition by the end of this year. We are also acquiring land in Sector 103 in a phased manner.” The criteria of categorisation of industrial sectors has been developed based on their pollution load. The ‘Red’ category industrial sectors, with a pollution index of 60 and above, are the most polluting ones. The other categories, in the ascending order of pollution load, are white (up to 20), green (21-40) and orange (41-59). In August this year, ruling out objections by residents of several villages near Sector 101, a three-member committee had decided to assign the sector to the ‘Red’ category while recommending strict adherence to norms set by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB).Another senior GMADA official said, “As Sector 101 is located near the airport, many multinational companies are interested in setting up their units there. The committee has recommended categorising the industrial sector as ‘Red’, as suggested by the PPCB, with strict adherence to all norms.” The GMADA has already started the social impact assessment to acquire 500 acres for industry in Sector 101. Social impact assessment is a process of identification, analysis and assessment of land to be acquired for development of industry. It analyses, monitors and manages the intended and unintended social consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, programmes, plans, projects) and any social change processes invoked by those interventions.Gurpreet Singh, sarpanch of Durali village, which is close to Sector 101, said, “We have already given in writing not to change the master plan of the area. Our village is quite near to the sector. The decision will impact the health of the villagers. As per the original master plan of 2005, both sectors 101 and 103 are under the green category.” Acquisition as per new land pooling policy For the first time on July 22 last year, the state government had introduced a land pooling policy for industrial sectors’ development, according to which for every one acre, landowners would get 1,100 square yards of industrial plots and 200 square yards of developed commercial plot, excluding parking, in lieu of cash compensation. Earlier, the land pooling was only for residential housing schemes.As per the new policy, the validity of the ‘Sahuliyat Certificate’ given to landowners opting for the land pooling policy and providing certain benefits to them during purchase of equivalent value of land would be counted from the date of allotment of plot to the landowner. The previous validity was two years from the date of announcement of award.Between 2001 and 2017, the GMADA acquired 4,484 acres, 2,145 acres of which were through the land pooling policy, which was introduced in the state in 2008 and has been amended from time to time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gmada-begins-process-to-acquire-500-acres-in-mohali-s-sector-101-101633040552587.html

The accused lawyer was identified as Sunil Arora, a resident Panchkula. Further probe is underway to arrest Rajiv Kumar, alias Rajiv Kumar Meherwal, assistant commissioner, CGST, Chandigarh. According to CBI, the complainant stated that their firm was allotted a tender for water supply and sanitation work by the Chandigarh municipal corporation, and the said works were exempted from service tax as per a central government notification. But the firm received a demand notice from CGST, Chandigarh, for service tax dues worth ₹11,44,898. The complainant alleged that Sunil Arora informed him that Rajiv Kumar could get the matter settled in exchange for ₹1 lakh. Investigators said a deal was settled at ₹80,000 and Rajiv asked the complainant to deliver the bribe amount to Sunil. The complainant instead approached CBI that laid a trap and caught Sunil red-handed while accepting the bribe in Panchkula. Following the arrest, CBI carried out searches at the premises of both accused in Panchkula, Delhi and Chandigarh, and is said to have recovered incriminating documents that are being scrutinised.

However, in the recent years, these are being sold floorwise to multiple owners, which will put additional burden on infrastructure. UT has maintained that it does not allow floorwise sale. After hearing all parties, the matter was reserved for final order by the high court bench of justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and justice Vivek Puri. For almost 10 days now, the matter is being heard on day-to-day basis.UT has argued that it does not issue NOCs mentioning particular floor on the basis of share of owner/co-owner, except in the cases which may have been considered on the basis of registered sale deeds executed as per the Chandigarh Apartment Rules 2001, scrapped in 2007. A survey conducted on an HC order had revealed that between 2016 and 2019, as many as 891 sale deeds were registered, where a part of a property was sold outside the family, which petitioners are against.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/multistorey-apartments-in-chandigarh-hc-reserves-judgment-on-2016-plea-101633039839273.html

However, Nazar stopped paying the rent after his father’s death and always gave excuses whenever asked to pay up. Rupinder said he had lodged a police complaint in this regard in 2018, but it was dismissed as a civil dispute. As the rent was still not paid, he lodged another complaint in July last year. He alleged that on March 18, 2020, Nazar’s wife filed a property dispute case in court, using a fake general power of attorney (GPA) and affidavit on his father’s behalf by forging his signature. Police sent this affidavit for forensic examination and a report in January confirmed that the signature was forged. Following legal opion, police have now lodged an FIR against the accused under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code.

However, health experts have cautioned that widespread complacency is an open invitation to another surge.Against 323 infections in August, the tricity logged 290 cases through September – a 10% drop. But the fatalities shot up by 66% with the toll rising from six to 10 in the same period.With 46,245 cases and 790 deaths, May had proved to be the deadliest for the tricity since the pandemic began in March last year.But following restrictions on public movement and businesses, the curve started winding downwards. In June, the tricity recorded 3,878 cases and 160 deaths, and the figures further slipped to 443 and 13, respectively, in July.Panchkula’s cases saw an uptickThough the tricity’s cumulative figures decreased in September as compared to August, Panchkula’s cases rose.In August, 154 cases were reported in Mohali, 124 in Chandigarh and 45 in Panchkula. A month later, the figure dipped to 128 in Mohali and 109 in Chandigarh, but climbed to 53 in Panchkula.Chandigarh recorded six of the 10 deaths in September, while four were reported in Mohali. In a major respite, Panchkula recorded no death in the entire month, for the first time this year.‘No place for complacency, especially during festive season’Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Mukta Arora said people should take precautionary measures, especially during the festive season. “There is no scope to lower our guard. Masks and social distancing are still crucial in public spaces,” she said.Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services Chandigarh, cautioned that immunity against the virus starts ebbing away after six months: “Therefore, immunity of those infected during the second wave will now start decreasing with each passing week. As public movement will increase during the festive season, people must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated to avert another surge.”Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur added that the health department was prepared to tackle another surge and testing had also been increased, but people must steer clear of complacency.19-year-old girl becomes Mohali’s latest fatalityA 19-year-old girl from Mohali’s Dera Bassi succumbed to Covid-19 on Thursday, pushing the district’s toll to 1,064.She was admitted at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh.No casualty was reported in Chandigarh or Panchkula, where 819 and 377 people, respectively, have died due to the virus so far.Meanwhile, after steady rise for three straight days, tricity’s daily Covid cases dropped to nine on Thursday.The daily infection count had reached 10 on Monday and climbed further to 14 on Tuesday, before shooting up to 16 on Wednesday.Among the nine fresh cases, six were reported from Chandigarh (Sectors 20, 31, 34, 43 and Daria), three from Mohali (Kharar, Dera Bassi and Mohali city), while Panchkula once again recorded no case, the ninth time in September.The active cases continued to remain over 100 for the second day in a row.

On UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit’s instructions, the administration has prepared a list of all issues that are awaiting the Centre’s approval and UT adviser Dharam Pal will be personally taking up the issues with senior officials and ministers of the ministries concerned.This week’s agenda pertains to the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of health. Confirming the development, Pal, said, “On Thursday, I met several MHA officials at Delhi and took up issues such as creation of posts in the police departments and allowing conversion of lease hold to free hold for commercial and industrial properties.”With officials of the health ministry, Pal will discuss upgrading the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, to a medical college, which has been pending for more than two years. Though the administration comes under the jurisdiction of the MHA, other ministries also play a key role on policy matters. “For Union ministries, issues related to Chandigarh are not the top priority. They have to deal with the entire country and more pressing issues. Sometimes there are differing views and a clarification is needed from the UT, which further delays the process,” said a UT official, requesting anonymity.Priority issues to be taken up“The recruitment rules have been awaiting the MHA’s nod for sometime now. The administration had taken up the issue with the MHA, earlier too,” said the official.Similarly, proposals for creating around 5,000 new posts in the administration are pending with the Union government. In 2019, the UT even sent out a composite list of pending proposals to the Cabinet secretariat.Most proposals are from the education, police and health departments. These also include proposals for the revival of posts that had been abolished earlier.“The health department has sent proposals to the ministry of health and family welfare for creating 1,720 posts, most of which are for GMCH-32. The police department has also sent a proposal for creating 1,355 posts to the ministry of home affairs. The education department has been awaiting creation of around 2,000 posts,” said the official. On allowing conversion of the commercial and industrial leasehold properties to freehold, the UT had decided to allow it earlier this year and had written to the Centre for approval, but there has been no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/awaiting-approvals-from-union-govt-chandigarh-admn-adopts-hands-on-approach-101633039775919.html

On an average, 12 to 15 mobile phones are recovered from inmates every month but there has been a significant increase in recoveries this September, when 18 cases were registered against 41 inmates. As per the police, September’s recoveries have already taken the yearly count past the 150-mark.In 2019, 98 phones were recovered from the inmates throughout the year, while the figure stood at 100 in 2020, when restrictions had been increased in view of Covid outbreak. Even as the number of recoveries has been going up, authorities have been unable to trace how these phones entered the jail premises.On September 2, as many as 17 mobile phones and accessories were seized from inmates during checking. On September 6, jail authorities recovered a mobile phone from the possession of gangster Navdeep Singh alias John Buttar. He was arrested by police after dramatic a shootout in Kharar last July. Buttar is accused in over 18 criminal cases, including murder, attempt to murder, dacoity and extortion. In March this year, jail authorities had recovered a mobile phone from a murder accused Prince alias Tutti. Police had claimed that Prince had planned to assassinate human rights activist Sushil Kumar Pandit inside the jail and hired two shooters to kill him. Pandit, a Kashmiri, is a prominent activist advocating the rights of Kashmiri Pandits. Prince was continuously in contact with the shooters through his phone from inside the jail. Last October, an assistant jail superintendent in Faridkot Central Jail was arrested by the vigilance bureau for accepting a bribe of ₹15,000 from a relative of a murder accused in lieu of not registering a complaint against the inmate after he was caught using a phone inside the jail. Jail superintendent Joginder Pal said that jail authorities are taking strict action against the violators. “The phones recovered from the inmates are mostly old. We have recovered the phones and lodged complaints to the police.

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal lease rules: HC issues notice to state govt over petition||The high court of Himachal Pradesh on Thursday issued a notice to the chief secretary and principal secretary (revenue), in a petition seeking abolition of the lease system in the state.A division bench comprising acting chief justice Ravi Malimath and justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a petition taken up suo moto by the court as public interest litigation on a letter written to chief justice by one Shri Rakesh Kumar of Kangra.The petitioner alleged that the state government had been leasing out its land for a period of 99 years in many cases and this practice was wrong and illegal, since grant of such lease would perpetually mean granting of ownership rights to the lessee for all intents and purposes.Kumar further alleged that it was also illegal that the legal heirs of the beneficiaries inherit the lease rights of the original lessee. If such a system continued, the entire land of Himachal would be taken over by outsiders and the resources belonging to the state would be captured and enjoyed by those who were not entitled to it, which would eventually lead to subjugation of the residents.Kumar also alleged that many people had turned such leases into a source of income as for instance one hospital at Palampur had been granted perpetual lease of ₹1 per year, while the extent of land with it was around 60 kanals.The petitioner stated that it needed to be ascertained that from such leases, how much income the government was earning, how much income was being generated by the beneficiaries, how much taxes were being paid by beneficiaries and how much of the leased land had been denuded of forest cover by the lessees.Further, it also needed to be ascertained whether there was any instance that the land had been reverted back to the Himachal Pradesh government after completion of 99 years.The petitioner has prayed that the practice and system of granting such perpetual lease of government land be discontinued and abolished immediately forthwith, so as to preserve the pristine glory of the “Land of Gods”.The court posted the matter after two weeks and also directed the respondents to file their replies by the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-lease-rules-hc-issues-notice-to-state-govt-over-petition-101633036835015.html

01-10-2021||Delhi||Boost for ration delivery scheme: Delhi HC allows govt to limit supplies to stores||The Delhi government’s ambitious door-to-door ration scheme received a shot in the arm, with the high court allowing the government to stop supplying foodgrains to fair price shops (FPS) for patrons who have chosen doorstep delivery over physical collection of ration.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh took note of submission by the Aam Aadmi Party government that supplies being made under the existing public distribution scheme (PDS) will have to be curtailed so that foodgrains could be distributed door-to-door for those who want it.Since the government said that “an overwhelming majority has opted for supply of rations at their doorstep,” the bench said that authorities could supply only such quantities of ration to FPS that are required for those who want to collect it from shops, while the rest can be held back by the government for door-to-door delivery.The court asked the government to share the details of ration cardholders who have opted to receive their rations at doorsteps instead of collecting it from shops with the FPS owners.It has also recorded an undertaking by the Delhi government that beneficiaries of door-to-door scheme will also have the option of reverting to the old scheme of collecting their rations from the shops.The Delhi government, in a statement on Thursday evening, said this meant that the scheme, which was being blocked by the Centre, was “greenlit” by the high court.“The Delhi high court has greenlit the Kejriwal government’s doorstep delivery scheme in a setback to Centre and the LG (lieutenant governor). Despite being a much sought after scheme, the Centre through the LG rejected the ration delivery scheme one week before its commencement. This court order came after an overwhelming majority opted for supply of rations at their doorstep,” the statement said.“The ration home delivery scheme ideated by the Delhi government was expected to be a game changer, which would have helped curb the theft of ration and harassment of the poor by the ration mafia syndicates. This scheme, however, was rejected by the central government through the LG a week before its commencement. The Centre never objected to the scheme in court, but it did not let the scheme through, citing frivolous reasons at various points of time,” it added.The high court order, dated September 27 but made public on Thursday, came on a petition by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh -- a body of the fixed price shop owners.The ration shop owners moved the court in February challenging the tenders issued for the doorstep delivery scheme. However, the petition was amended on March 18 to challenged the ration delivery scheme with the association demanding that it should be declared ultra vires (beyond the scope of legal power).On March 22, the court directed the Delhi government not to stop or curtail the supply of foodgrains or flour, to the members of the petitioner association, for operationalising the doorstep delivery.However, the court modified its order on September 27, allowing the government to stop supplying foodgrains to FPS to the extent of food grains for those who have chosen doorstep delivery over physical collection of ration.Appearing for the Delhi government, senior advocate Vishwanathan, argued that the scheme has not been stayed by the court. He submitted that the court had only passed an interim order of protection in favour of the petitioner association as it was pointed out that on March 8, the Delhi government had issued an e-mail communication stating that the supplies to be made to the existing PDS distributors was to be stopped, so that food grains could be distributed door to door by another agency.The LG’s office did not comment on the matter.The high court will now hear the case on October 27.Nearly 7.2 million people in Delhi are eligible for subsidised food, including 1.7 million ration card holders and nearly 3 million priority households, besides other food insecure categories identified by the Delhi government.The Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections— the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi government, on March 24, passed a Cabinet decision to remove the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013.In June, the government sent the file back to LG, contending that its provisions are in accordance with the NFS Act, and that it will simultaneously implement the Centre’s “One Nation, One Ration Card” scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/boost-for-ration-delivery-scheme-delhi-hc-allows-govt-to-limit-supplies-to-stores-101633035896413.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Indomitable spirit takes Divyang trekkers to Siachen||Eight differently abled trekkers, comprising four visually impaired members, three hand amputees and a leg amputee, created a world record for the largest number of people with disabilities scaling the world’s highest battlefield, Siachen Glacier, up to Kumar Post at the altitude of 15,632 ft. Meet the lone woman and three heroes from the region who found special mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat on September 26. ‘Can scale any mountain if you’re mentally tough’ Shimla: “People often judge you by your physical ability. But you can scale any mountain if you are mentally tough,” says Chongjin Ingmo, 25, the lone woman in the eight-member team of Operation Blue Freedom, a climbing expedition organised by Team CLAW (Conquer Land Air Water) of the Indian Army, that created a world record by trekking to the 15,632-ft Kumar Post in Siachen Glacier, the highest battlefield in the world. Born in Kinnaur, Ingmo moved to Ladakh for studies after losing her eyesight at the age of 8. After clearing her Class 12 from Chandigarh and graduation from Miranda House College, Delhi, she became a banker. Ingmo was preparing for a fashion show for the physically challenged in Goa and had even paid her fee when she came to know about the climbing expedition. “I decided to go for climbing for it was an opportunity to prove myself,” says the gritty woman, who is also an ardent cyclist and pedalled from Manali to the 5,359-metre Khardung La in 2018, one of the world’s highest motorable roads. She is an athlete, a swimmer, practises judo and is also a member of a cricket team for the blind in Delhi. The expedition was launched in Delhi on August 15. Intially, there were 16 members in the team, eight of whom, including Ingmo, were selected based on their performance during the training from August 19 to 29. “Yes, it was a tough challenge. The route involved crossing deep crevasses, icy glacial water streams, hard-ice stretches and undulating rocky moraines,” she recalls. “Life throws many challenges, and it is up to us how we overcome those difficulties. If we can do it, anybody can. There is too much stress in life, but one should not give up,”adds the youngster with a positive outlook. When her friends questioned her decision to take up the risky expedition, she told them that for her, life is boring if there are no challenges. Motivated to the core to create record, they did it Jammu: Lobsang Chosphel, 38, and Irfan Ahmad Mir, 24, from Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir, respectively, are blind since birth but they have nerves of steel. “My friend Tsering told me about the CLAW expedition by veterans from the army’s special forces that aims to rehabilitate people with disabilities through sports and adventure. I applied because I knew it would be an experience of a lifetime,” says Chosphel. It took the team five days to reach Kumar Post from the Siachen base camp. “The endurance training, including 20-km runs, came handy. We didn’t face any problem while climbing, but the descent was a bit difficult. We were motivated to the core to create this world record and we did it!” he says proudly. Chosphel says the differently abled need to be rehabilitated by the government with dignity. “For the past two years, I have no work due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier, I made candles and earned ₹7,000 a month of which ₹3,000 was deducted for accommodation,” he says. “We felt over the moon when the Prime Minister mentioned our names on Mann Ki Baat, but we should be given a dignified livelihood. I’m not educated but can be a productive part of society,” he adds. Blind eye to visually impaired hurts: Mir Irfan Ahmad Mir, 24, from Pampore near Srinagar agrees with Chosphel. “I’m a blind cricketer, who has represented the Indian team. The government is quick to recognise cricket players but turns a blind eye to us. We are not recognised for our contribution despite our physical handicap,” he says. “My family is sustaining me. There is no scholarship for me from the government,” he adds. An arts graduate from Delhi University, Mir pursuing a computer diploma from the Blind Relief Association in Delhi at present. Turning to his recent achievement, he says: “CLAW received 143 applications and eight aspirants were shortlisted after being through different stages of endurance tests.” Recalling the trek, he says the squad started its descent on September 13 and returned to the base camp on September 15. “The distance was 60 to 65 km from the base camp to Kumar Post. The temperature was minus 10 to 12 minus degrees Celsius. We had to rope up to cross glaciers, crevices and rivers. Para instructors were with us, and teamwork made this unbelievable feat possible,” he says. Fastest and fittest, soldier amputee battles the odds Chandigarh: True to his name, havildar Ajay Kumar is invincible. A native of Karoli village in Kosli tehsil of Haryana’s Rewari district, the 37-year-old is a proud gallantry award winner who suffered a below knee amputation in the left leg due to grievous injuries sustained in combat. But that didn’t stop him from becoming the fastest and fittest member of the team of differently abled trekkers, who conquered the world’s highest battlefield on September 11. Havildar Ajay believes dreams come true because his did. Two decades ago, he recalls how just four days before his Class 12 exams, the postman called out for him, insisting Ajay receives it himself. The letter was from the Indian Army, confirming his selection as a soldier. “My childhood dream had come true! I stuffed my books at one place and packed my bag to board the next train to report at the training centre,” he says. Cut to the present. His amputation did not deter him from pursuing his dreams. He turned out to be the fastest and the fittest on the expedition despite being the only leg amputee, an army officer organising the mission said. After three weeks of training and acclimatisation, the expedition started from Siachen base camp on September 7 to reach Kumar Post on September 11. The challenging terrain not only tested the physical endurance and mental stamina of the trekkers, but also their ice-craft skills. “We had to climb about 15 km in 8-9 hours on the glacier each day to reach the next camp, where we would halt for the night before resuming the march early in the morning,” Ajay adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indomitable-spirit-takes-divyang-trekkers-to-siachen-101633035939604.html
01-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The street masseur||Mark the scene carefully. You rarely see it these days. Here’s the low table. It’s covered with a mat. Six small glass bottles are arranged on the top, each filled with a solution of different colour.This is masseur Mangey Ram’s mobile stall. He roams about the Ghalib Street in central Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti, silently offering his services to passersby. Sometimes he’s sighted massaging the bare back of haleem cook Mustakeem. Sometimes he unrolls the mat on the pavement, and is seen treating a client’s tired limbs with a selection of his relaxing oils. Each potion, he says, has a unique characteristic.One early morning the moody Mr Ram, after having finished massaging the knees of vendor Abul Hasan, condescends to identify the various oils in his bottles. “This bottle has jaitoon, this bottle has amla, this bottle has ratan oil that gives thankdak, this one has sarson, and this bottle has noorani tel, which is good for knee pain.”That Mr Ram agrees to talk at all is something to be grateful about. He otherwise remains stubbornly quiet. If one approaches him with queries, he responds with an offended gaze. Even now he deigns to share only the bare essentials of his life. Speaking expressionlessly, like a head of state indifferently reading out a long speech without showing a dot of emotion, he says: “Mother died, father died, wife died…. father had some other occupation…. No, I never feel lonely.”He does open up about his early days as a street masseur. “At that time there were many maalish wale.” Mr Ram briefly describes the years-ago ambiance of this same Ghalib Street—the lane that ends with poet Ghalib’s tomb—as a place teeming with masseurs. “You would see men spread out on chatais in front of Ghalib’s mazar, each being massaged by a maalish walla.” Mr Ram’s face suddenly breaks into a cynical laughter. “All those maalish wale have gone… there was never much money in it.” Pointing to the table, he says he bought it years ago from Muzaffarnagar in UP.Mr Ram works from late evening to early morning—this part of the historic district remains crowded throughout the night. “In the day, I sleep.” Indeed, half an hour after this chat, the street masseur is seen lying sprawled on the pavement, just outside the walls of Ghalib’s mausoleum. His eyes are closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-street-masseur-101633034945808.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC to hire traffic consultant to oversee road infrastructure development||The municipal corporation will soon be hiring a traffic consultant to untangle the traffic snarls that have become commonplace in the city. The appointment process has already been initiated. The traffic consultant will oversee upgrade of the road and junction infrastructure to streamline traffic and reduce mishaps. The idea had been mooted last year when the municipal corporation had decided to develop certain junctions in the city under the Smart City Mission. A proposal for the same has also been included in the agenda of the next meeting of the finance and contracts committee (F and CC).The civic body’s quest for experts is not limited to traffic, the administrative cogwheels are in motion to appoint a horticulture consultant in the city. Punjab Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma said that there is a dire need to appoint a traffic consultant in the municipal corporation, especially when authorities are contemplating developing road infrastructure and decongesting junctions. “The engineers are not well versed with the traffic norms and requirements needed to make the roads safe for commuters. Sometimes, the MC creates bottlenecks by not building slip roads and other components required for the smooth flow of traffic. A lot of work regarding road safety, including installation of sign boards, and cat’s eyes (retro-reflective safety device used in road marking), needs to be done,” he said, adding that the expert will prepare designs for roads, slip roads and roundabouts to ease traffic congestionand will also help synchronise traffic lights to streamline the flow of vehicles. “There are a few points in the city, where the MC may need to acquire land for decongesting the junctions and intersections. This will also be decided by the consultant,” said Verma.Rainwater harvesting systems During the F and CC meet, which will be held next week, the committee will also deliberate upon the proposal to install rain water harvesting systems in all the four MC zonal offices. While authorities have been asking residents to opt for rainwater harvesting due to the depleting ground water levels, the civic body has been facing flak for not practising what it preaches.Repair of musical fountain The agenda also includes repairing the musical fountain at the Rose Garden, which has been lying defunct for a long time. The repair will cost around ₹16 lakh. A proposal for setting up floating barriers at different points of Buddha Nullah to stop the flow of solid waste into the Sutlej will also be discussed. Solid waste has also choked the drain at certain points. A memorial for the ‘Panj Pyare’ and naming different roads after them will also be discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-to-hire-traffic-consultant-to-oversee-road-infrastructure-development-101633034916155.html

The action came after probe found irregularities and negligence on the part of the officials. As per sources, large-scale illegal mining was being carried out in the area but DSP Dharamkot allegedly turned a blind eye to it. Senior officials of Moga police had even inquired with the DSP about it; however, he allegedly misled them. Later, when SSP Nimbale checked on his own, he found rampant illegal mining activities taking place in the area. Following this, police registered around four cases of illegal mining and arrested over a dozen persons and seized their vehicles from the area.In the two notices issued to him, the SSP has held the DSP responsible for letting illegal mining flourish in the area, and asked him to file an explanation on what corrective measures are being taken.In the notice to mining officer Garcha, pertaining to the theft case registered against MS and Rana Company Kot Ise Khan, the SSP stated, “Despite being the mining officer, you have taken the side of the contractor/owner of MS and Rana Company even as sand is being sold by violating and ignoring instructions of additional director general-cum-enforcement director mining and without weighing or issuing computerised slips.” Confirming the development, Moga SSP Nimbale said he had assigned a probe to SP (investigation) Jagatpreet Singh. “As per the ongoing investigation, I have issued notices to DSP (Dharamkot) and mining officer Jalandhar as the area of Dharamkot falls under his jurisdiction. Further action will be taken against them as per law after receiving their reply,” he added. DSP Shubeg Singh, said, “No illegal mining activity is being carried out in my area. The illegal mining activities which are mentioned are being carried out in the area of Jalandhar district and I am not responsible for the Jalandhar area. Besides, the investigation is already going on and it will clear everything,” Mining officer Jalandhar, Gurtej Singh Garcha, said, “The SSP has no authority to issue me notice or seek explanation from me. Only the deputy commissioner can do this. Besides, I did not take any side and no illegal mining activity was carried out in my area. Therefore, I informed the police and told them to conduct their investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/notices-served-on-2-officials-for-inaction-against-illegal-mining-in-sutlej-riverbed-101633033472073.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal’s guarantees hold no merit: SAD||Training their guns at the Aam Aadmi Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal leaders on Thursday called Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal an “opportunist” and said Kejriwal’s second guarantee to upgrade the health infrastructure on the lines of the Delhi model was mere lip service to fool the people in the run up to the assembly elections. Addressing a press conference at a private hotel on Pakhowal Road, a few hours after Kejriwal announced the second guarantee, the leaders including SAD core committee member and former Cabinet minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal, district president Harbhajan Singh Dang, said Kejriwal’s model had failed in Delhi, so it was unlikely that they will be successful in Punjab. Grewal said, “Kejriwal is trying to befool the Punjabis by making half-baked announcements. The people of Punjab do not want the Delhi model of health as the highest number of deaths due to shortage of oxygen took place in Delhi and the entire system collapsed during the pandemic. An announcement has been made regarding setting up Mohalla Clinics in every village, but nothing has been said as to how the funds will be arranged.” Grewal said Kejriwal wants to become the Punjab chief minister of Punjab, which is why the AAP has not yet announced their candidate for the top post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwals-guarantees-hold-no-meritsad-101633033051916.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Unemployed teachers end dharna outside minister Singla’s Sangrur residence after 9 months||Unemployed teachers associated with at least five unions on Thursday ended their dharna outside the Sangrur residence of cabinet minister Vijay Inder Singla after nearly nine months, expressing hope of getting their issues resolved amid a change of guard in the Congress government in Punjab. Members of various unions, who started the round-the-clock sit-in on December 31, 2020, called off the protest after the district administration assured them to take up their demand for a meeting with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi besides quashing of the FIRs registered against them Sangrur and Patiala districts during protests.The protesters are members of the BEd Teachers’ Union, the 873 DPE Teachers’ Union, the 646 PTI Teachers’ Union, the Unemployed Art and Craft Teachers’ Union, and the Unemployed Multipurpose Health Workers Union, Punjab. Over the last few months, they would also oppose the minister during his visits to villages in the Sangrur assembly constituency. Sukhwinder Singh Dhilwan, president, Unemployed BEd Teachers’ Union, said even as the dharna was called off, their struggle for jobs will continue till their demands are not met.“After changes in the state cabinet, the district administration appealed to us to end the protest as the education portfolio (which Vijay Inder Singla held earlier) has been given to Pargat Singh. We also demand that all FIRs registered in Sangrur and Patiala districts against youths during protests should be quashed immediately,” said Dhilwan.“If our demands are not met, we will hold a protest at the same place on October 10. Then we will take a call on whether we will stage protests outside the residence of the CM or the new education minister,” he added.Jagsir Singh, another protester, said in the past nine months they never allowed Singla to enter his residence. “We appeal to minister Vijay Inder Singla to take up our demands with the chief minister and play a key role in resolving the issue,” he added. Sangrur sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Amarinder Singh Tiwana said the protest remained largely peaceful and the activists did not damage government property. “We will take up their demands with the authorities concerned,” added Tiwana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/unemployed-teachers-end-dharna-outside-minister-singla-s-sangrur-residence-after-9-months-101633032751741.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu, Channi buy peace, agree on panel for better coordination||Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was upset over senior appointments made by the new government and resigned from his post two days ago, on Thursday agreed on constitution of a coordination panel for prior consultation on all major policy matters and decisions of the state government. Channi and Sidhu, who has been demanding removal of APS Deol and IPS Sahota from the post of AG and DGP, respectively, hashed out the agreement at a two-hour meeting held here to resolve the crisis created in the state Congress by the latter’s abrupt resignation. The committee is likely to be headed by a central leader – Harish Chaudhary, in all probability — with the chief minister and Punjab Congress president as its members for better coordination between the party and the state government, two persons familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. A senior party leader does not see much advantage in setting up the coordination committee at this stage with hardly any time left for elections. “It will not serve any purpose other than putting balm on someone’s ego and making the decision-making process more cumbersome. In January 2020 also, the AICC set up a coordination committee under the then general secretary but it did not conduct even a single meeting,” he added. Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat is also planning to come to Chandigarh to talk to the warring factions. “After the constitution of the new government, I thought my job was done but then this new situation developed. Things will be okay soon. It is just a matter for 5 to 7 days,” he told reporters. The announcement of the panel and other decisions agreed upon in the meeting will come from the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in the next 24 hours, the person quoted above said. “As for the two appointments, it has been decided that a panel of IPS officers will be sent to the UPSC as per the procedure laid down by the Supreme Court. Till then, Sahota will continue and the new DGP will be named from among the three names received from the commission. The issue of AG’s will be decided after a discussion in the coordination panel,” he said. Cabinet ministers Pargat Singh and Raj Kumar Verka, Punjab Congress working presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra and Pawan Goel, central leader Harish Chaudhary and Amritsar South MLA Inderbir Bolaria were among those present at Punjab Bhawan where the meeting took place. “Sidhu saab will carry on as the PPCC president. All issues raised by him and pending promises that are to be implemented before the elections were discussed in detail and both sides presented their views,” one of them said. The cricketer-turned-politician, who has been upset over not having much say or being consulted in several key decisions, had announced his resignation on Twitter on Tuesday, barely 72 days after he was appointed the state unit chief, plunging the Congress into a fresh crisis in the poll-bound state. Sidhu was particularly peeved as his recommendations for the posts of AG and DGP were overlooked. The induction of former minister Rana Gurjit Singh into the cabinet also riled him. Channi, who is battling his first major political crisis just 11 days after taking over as the chief minister, had on Wednesday invited Sidhu for a sit-down meeting to iron out differences. “Whoever is party president, is head of the family. I had told him (Sidhu) that the party is supreme and the government follows its ideology,” he said at a press conference while stressing on finding a resolution through talks. The chief minister had reached out to Sidhu who defiantly posted a video message on Twitter, announcing to continue his fight and willingness to make any sacrifice. Sidhu responded to his offer on Thursday morning and agreed to meet him in Chandigarh to resolve differences. “The chief minister has invited me for talks…will reciprocate by reaching Punjab Bhawan, Chandigarh, at 3pm today, he is welcome for any discussions,” he tweeted. However, minutes before reaching the venue of their meeting, Sidhu again targeted Sahota over the sacrilege case probe. “DGP IPS Sahota was head of SIT investigating Beadbi case under Badal govt, he wrongfully indicted two Sikh youth for sacrilege & gave clean chit to Badals. In 2018, I along with INC Ministers, then PCC Pres & present Home minister assured them of our support in fight for Justice (sic),” he posted on the microblogging website. Sidhu’s public criticism of the CM’s decision has not gone down well with senior party leaders. His bête noire, former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh hit out at him for trying to interfere in the state government. “Sidhu should run the party and let Channi run the government. There should be no interference. They can talk to each other, but it is the CM who runs the government. I was CM for nine-and-a-half years and had several state chiefs during that period. We used to discuss, but I never faced the kind of situation he (Sidhu) is creating,” he said. Taking to social media, former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar also said enough was enough. “Put an end to attempts to undermine the authority of the CM time and again. Aspersions being cast on selection of AG and DGP are actually questioning the integrity/competence of the CM and home minister to deliver results. It’s time to put the foot down and clear the air,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-channi-buy-peace-agree-on-panel-for-better-coordination-101633032691665.html

This had resulted in power outages in nearby areas and even though power is being supplied currently through the Dholewal sub-station, residents of nearby areas complained of frequent outages and low voltage.The heavy showers put a dampener on the plans of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) officials, who were reinstalling the tower and disappointed the affected residents and shopkeepers. Mridhul, who owns a shop nearby, said his work has been affected due to the power cuts.Senior PSPCL officials including Bhupender Khosla, chief engineer, Ludhiana; and Sanjeev Prabhakar, deputy chief engineer, west circle, Ludhiana, were also present at the spot to monitor the repairs.Khosla said that since the foundation of the tower has to be rebuilt, it may take a couple of more days .“Our teams are working hard to reinstall the tower as soon as possible, but rain definitely hinders the work. We are hopeful of repairing it in a couple of days,” he said.Prabhakar said, “We are managing to provide 60% load as the supply was taken from Dholewal sub-station. There may be low voltage or power cuts, but we are still supplying as much power as possible in the area.” As per the officials, the impact of the collision also damaged another 11kv tower and cable wires.The driver of the truck was arrested while he was trying to escape the spot after the accident. He has been identified as Jagsir Singh of Sangrur.He was booked for rash driving following a complaint by sub-divisional officer Gurpratap Singh at Division Number 6 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-rain-hinders-repair-of-electricity-tower-residents-complain-of-power-outage-101633032332040.html

On Thursday, farmers gathered outside the Amritsar DC office to press for their demands, including loan waiver. The farmers were called for a meeting with Amritsar DC Gurpreet Singh Khaira and inspector general (IG), border range, SPS Parmar. “During the meeting, the IG informed deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa about our demands. The IG also assured us that the government was willing to listing to our demands. We have also been assured of a meeting with CM Charanjit Singh Channi within the next 20 days,” said KMC’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher. The meeting was also attended by KMC president Satnam Singh Pannu. Pandher said: “If our demands are not met at a meeting with the CM, we will launch our rail roko stir.”The demands include repeal of three farm laws, a new law ensuring minimum support price (MSP) of 23 crops, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, waiving of farmers’ debt, and government jobs and compensation of ₹5 lakh to the families of farmers who died during the agitation at the Delhi border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-defer-rail-roko-stir-after-assurance-of-meeting-with-channi-101633032272821.html

I have no intention of quitting,” said Preneet, the four-time MP. She, however, justified her husband’s decision, saying, “He is the senior-most leader of the Congress in the country. He brought the party back to power in Punjab when it was losing one after another state. He was humiliated and thus decided to leave the party. It is wrong to maltreat a leader who brought historic victory for the party.” Amarinder on Wednesday met Union home minister Amit Shah, giving rise to speculations that he may float his own party or join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).On plans to join Amarinder in future, she said, “I won’t comment about that, but as of now every worker is upset about whatever is going on in the party’s Punjab unit.” Till her husband was CM, the Patiala MP was taking care of nine assembly constituencies, including Patiala Urban that Amarinder represents in the Vidhan Sabha, and her writ ran large over matters concerning these segments. Some Congress MLAs from Patiala district have also decided not to leave the party. “I will remain in the Congress,” said an MLA close to Amarinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wont-leave-congress-or-resign-as-mp-says-preneet-kaur-as-amarinder-announces-to-quit-party-101633032091446.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Waste collectors block road for six hours during protest||Irked over shifting of the secondary dump site behind Vardhman mills, garbage collectors in large numbers protested against the municipal corporation on Thursday and blocked Tajpur Road for around six hours. Even though diversions were created by the traffic police, movement of vehicles was hit on Tajpur Road and surrounding areas.The garbage collectors opposed the shifting of the dumpsite behind Vardhman mills to a point near Central Jail on Tajpur road and rued that it is difficult for them to pull their cart to that point. They demanded that MC allow them to continue dumping waste at the old site. Leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also joined the protest and slammed MLA Sanjay Talwar for failing to deal with problems being faced by garbage collectors and residents of the constituency. As per the information, most of the garbage collectors were MC Class-4 employees. AAP leader Daljit Singh Grewal (Bhola) stated that door-to-door collection of waste has been affected in atleast 15 wards due to the ill-planned decision. They demanded that the MC find a solution for the problem at the earliest.Police and MC officials tried to pacify the protesters but to no avail. They finally lifted the agitation after getting assurance from MLA Sanjay Talwar in the evening that an alternative site will be finalised for dumping of waste.Talwar stated that the site behind Vardhman mills is surrounded by hospital, religious places and residential area. Further, a school and community centre is also being constructed in the area and they have also proposed a Ravidas auditorium at the site where garbage was being dumped earlier. He said the opposition is trying to gain political mileage by misguiding the garbage collectors.“A meeting has been scheduled with MC officials on Friday and we will finalise an alternative site for dumping of garbage, so that no one faces any problem,” said Talwar. On September 28, waste collectors had staged a protest in the Dugri area over shifting of secondary dump site. Waste collected from houses is dumped at the secondary dump sites, from where it is transported to main dump site on Tajpur Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-waste-collectors-block-road-for-six-hours-during-protest-101633032032322.html
01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly polls: Lying low for days after SKM diktat, parties start holding political events again||Political parties in Punjab, which were lying low for days following a diktat of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on September 11 against organising mass electoral programmes, have started holding meetings and rallies again in view of the upcoming state assembly elections. The SKM, an amalgamation of 32 farm organisations leading the protest against the Centre’s three controversial laws, had asked the state’s ruling Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to desist from holding political events till dates for the forthcoming polls are announced to honour the sentiment of the protesting farmers. However, the SAD and the AAP have organised five large public programmes in different places of the state in the last one week. Unlike previous occasions, the SKM activists did not try to stop the parties from holding political events. The SAD had taken a lead in mass contact with voters by organising rallies from March 15 under the “Punjab Mangda Jawab” campaign while announcing party candidates from Fazilka’s Jalalabad. Then, party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal launched a 100-day yatra programme ‘Gal Punjab Di’ from Ferozepur’s Zira on August 18 to cover all 117 assembly segments.But the party had to suspend the yatra events after SKM activists created a ruckus at Sukhbir’s rally in Moga on September 3. The Akali leaders have been at loggerhead with farmer unions over holding political activities since.On Thursday, AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a well-attended political rally in Ludhiana. The previous day, he addressed a large gathering of industrialists and traders in the industrial city of Ludhiana.Sukhbir on Wednesday led a tractor march in Mohali to demand more compensation for farmers whose land was acquired by the government to develop various road projects.He on September 25 visited about six villages of Bathinda and Mansa that were hit by pink bollworm. Though a group of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) showed black flags to Sukhbir’s convoy at Sekhpura, no effort was made to disrupt his meeting with a number of cotton growers.Besides, he held interactions with industrialists and professionals at various places in Ludhiana on September 26. The SAD has already announced a protest rally in Bathinda on October 3 to demand a compensation of ₹50,000 per acre after pest infested the cotton-growing belt.On Thursday, supporters of the newly inducted transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring organised celebratory programmes at 16 places to welcome their MLA in his constituency of Gidderbaha.Though a group of farmer activists surrounded Warring, no effort was made to disrupt the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-polls-lying-low-for-days-after-skm-diktat-parties-start-holding-political-events-again-101633031793882.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal promises free treatment at govt hospitals if AAP voted to power in Punjab||Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced a health bonanza for residents of Punjab if the AAP is voted to power in 2022. Addressing halqa in-charges across the state and the media in Ludhiana, Kejriwal announced six guarantees for health for Punjab residents on the Delhi model. The six-point health agenda includes “pind” or village clinics and ward clinics in urban areas of the state. He said that today barring Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh, all government-run health institutions in the state are in a pitiable condition, forcing the common man to go to private hospitals. “These private hospitals loot people, while in the government sector, there is a serious shortage of staff and infrastructure,” he said. Expanding on the six guarantees, he said: “Firstly, every Punjab resident will get free and best treatment. Secondly, all medicines, all tests, all operations will be free of cost in government hospitals in the state,” he said. “We will ensure all medicines are available and we will ensure all machines are functional. Even costly operations costing ₹15 lakh will be free,” he said. Kejriwal also said that every Punjab citizen will get a health card. That card will have all the information and reports pertaining to the person. Making the fourth promise, Kejriwal said that on lines of mohalla clinic, they will be opening ‘pind clinics’ at every nook and corner while ward clinics will be opened in cities. As many as 15,000 such clinics will be opened in the state, he said. Kejriwal added that infrastructure of all government hospitals in state will be improved and these will be made fully air-conditioned with all facilities readily available. Lastly, if anyone has a road accident, he be rushed to the nearest hospital and the cost will be borne by the Punjab Government irrespective of whether it is a private or government hospital, he said. When questioned as to how the cash starved state will generate funds for free treatment and other policies announced, Kejriwal said they faced the same situation in Delhi when they announced mohalla clinics. “Funds will be generated. The mohalla clinics in Delhi are now an example for everyone while when we first took the initiative, Delhi also had similar funds problem, but we did it” he said. “His idea is good but free treatment for all Punjab residents means catering to over 3 crore population. Free medicines for all also seem a distant reality. Promises made should at least look convincible. Even yesterday, the industry had big expectations that Kejriwal will announce tax reforms that will benefit the industry, but he never announced any. Even electricity rebates promised are not enough as the power tariff for the industry in Punjab right now is almost the same as that of industry in Delhi. There were also not many representatives from prominent industries present. The AAP failed to utilise the opportunity fully,” said Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, Chamber of Commercial and Industrial Undertakings (CICU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-promises-free-treatment-at-govt-hospitals-if-aap-voted-to-power-in-punjab-101633031631249.html

01-10-2021||Chandigarh||In Punjab, FCI to start ‘age test’ on grain to check mixing of old rice with new stock||With a view to checking the malpractice of mixing of rice from the previous years with the one shelled from the recently procured paddy, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has decided to introduce “age test” on the grain this kharif season in Punjab before shipping it to the outside states for public distribution. The system will be made operational in December when the state procurement agencies will start handing over rice to the FCI, which drives public distribution across the country, after shelling of paddy procured in the upcoming kharif season. The paddy procurement in Punjab starts from October 11 and will continue till November. Also, the state food and civil supplies department has decided to analyse data of mandi-wise arrival of paddy in the last three seasons and install CCTV cameras in grain markets and rice mills to maintain vigil on arrival of grain. Besides, there will be physical verification of the existing stock before the onset of the procurement season. Why test the grain?It emerged in the last 4-5 years that rice purchased from outside the state at cheaper rates was being mixed with the newly shelled grain in Punjab and was sold to the central procurement agency to earn higher profits. Officials say it caused losses to the tune of crores of rupees to the state exchequer though the exact figures were not ascertained. The role of arhtiyas (commission agents), rice millers and traders — who allegedly run the illegal trade in connivance with the staff of state food and civil supplies department and state procurement agencies like Markfed, Pungrain, Punsup and the State Ware Housing Corporation besides the FCI — is under scanner. In recently conducted raids at the rice mils, at least 35,000 bags of recycled rice were recovered from Fazilka, Nurmahal, Moga and Bathinda. During his last week’s visit to Punjab, Union food and public distribution secretary Sudhanshu Pandey stressed on checking the malpractice, to which the state official promised to take stringent measures. “We are ready with the new system and every lot of rice handed over to the corporation depots by the four state procurement agencies will undergo the test,” said a senior FCI official. The test involves chemical examination, he added.Hefty penalty will be imposed in case a rice miler is found mixing old rice with the new and the state food and civil supplies department has framed rules for this, it is learnt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-punjab-fci-to-start-age-test-on-grain-to-check-mixing-of-old-rice-with-new-stock-101633031438748.html

The court allowed him to join probe through video conferencing but made it clear that in case he failed, the police would be at liberty to move an application for re-calling the order. Maan was booked under Sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code at Nakodar city police station in Jalandhar on August 26. Earlier, Maan had told court that he tested positive for Covid and would join the investigation as soon as he recovers. But he had volunteered to join probe through video conference, if investigating agency so desires. State’s counsel had told court that no recovery is to be made from him and it was also confirmed that he has tested corona positive and that custody is not required. During a religious fair in Nakodar on August 24, Maan described Ladi Shah of Dera Baba Murad Shah as a descendant of the third Sikh master, Guru Amar Das. When a social media campaign started against his statement, Maan had put up a video on social media, offering an apology for his statement. However, an FIR was registered. In plea before the HC, he had argued that no offence under Section 295-A of the IPC can be said to be made out against him. It has to be demonstrated that an act has been committed with deliberate and malicious intention, in order to outrage the religious feelings of any class of citizens and such act insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class. In the present case, the FIR prima facie fails to disclose that the essential ingredients of offence, were made out, he had argued. “As a humble Sikh and the sensitive citizen, the petitioner made a widely circulated public apology. His words ought to be interpreted in the total background of his lifelong devotion to venerable Sikh Gurus and to the principles of Sikhism,” it was pleaded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-and-haryana-hc-gives-gurdas-maan-five-weeks-to-join-investigation-101633031431603.html

Taking on Kejriwal who was on a two-day visit to Punjab, Soni told reporters that with the arrival of Delhi residents to take treatment in government and private hospitals in every district of Punjab during the second wave of Covid-19, it was clear Kejriwal was putting out fake advertisements about health facilities while the reality was that Delhi residents were not getting satisfactory treatment in their home state. The deputy CM, who held his maiden meeting with all the civil surgeons, directed them to prepare a 100-day plan for further improving health services in the state, stating that he would himself monitor their efforts. Chairing the meeting, Soni, while reviewing the various ongoing works of the health department, said special focus would be laid upon improving healthcare services in rural areas. Applauding the efforts made by the health staff in fight against Covid, Soni said that in view of the coming festival season, all arrangements should be put in place in time, especially the preparations for the possible third wave of Covid. He instructed them to ramp up the health infrastructure and carry out required procurement as per expected caseload.

Farmers have no other option but to sell their crop below MSP,” he said.He slammed the government for not buying the entire crop of bajra in state.“Earlier, the government had encouraged farmers to leave paddy and grow bajra and now it is not buying bajra. This is an anti-farmer decision,” he said.“The government is promising to protect bajra farmers under the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’ but the scheme has pushed vegetable growers to the brink of ruin,” he added.“With this scheme, neither farmers can get Bhavantar nor will their losses be compensated. The government should buy bajra and every grain of all crops according to its promise,” he said.Hooda said waterlogging remains a major problem for farmers as crops have suffered extensive damage due to excessive rain.“Farmers have not received their compensation till now. There are many fields in state that continue to be waterlogged and no arrangement has been made to drain out water from these areas,” he said.“The government should compensate the damaged crops and make arrangements for drainage so that farmers can prepare their fields for the next crop,” Hooda added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hooda-accuses-haryana-govt-of-not-buying-paddy-101633030953280.html

Paddy procurement for 2021-22 kharif marketing season in Punjab was to commence from October 1, while in Haryana it officially started from September 25. The procurement operation is undertaken by the central government’s nodal agency Food Corporation of India (FCI) along with state agencies. “It has been reported that due to recent downpour in Punjab and Haryana, the maturity of paddy has been delayed,” Union food ministry said in a statement. Keeping in view the interest of farmers and to avoid any inconvenience to them, the ministry has decided that the procurement of paddy under the minimum support price would commence from October 11 in these two states, it said. All the agencies have been directed to take necessary action to undertake procurement of paddy with the effect from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana, it added. The Centre has fixed minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,960 per quintal for grade ‘A’ paddy, while ₹1,940 per quintal for common grade paddy for 2021-22 kharif marketing season. Punjab is a major contributor to the central pool as on an average over 100 lakh tonne of rice is procured from this state. From Haryana, less than 45 lakh tonne of rice is purchased during a kharif marketing season. Channi seeks PM’s intervention Taking prompt cognisance of the letter of the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution regarding postponement of paddy procurement, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday sought the personal intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to advise the ministry to withdraw its letter forthwith, allowing the state to start paddy procurement from October 1 instead of October 11. The CM said the state is all set to start procurement of paddy from October 1 as scheduled earlier and now these instructions would unnecessarily create confusion and uncertainty in the minds of farmers, who will start bringing their crops in various mandis across the state from Friday.

As the name of Chattopadhyaya is being strongly pushed by the state Congress chief, the decision to send panel late in the night as it was the IPS officer’s last day to stake his claim for the top post in the state police. The Supreme Court orders mandate that name of any officer having less than six months of service cannot be considered in the panel for the DGP’s post. Chattopadhaya, a hot-favourite of Sidhu, is scheduled to retire on March 31 next year and if the names were not sent on Thursday, he would have been out of the race for the top post.Same is in the case of Rohit Chaudhary, who is also scheduled to retire on March 31 next year.

The government has made up its mind to replace incumbent DGP Dinkar Gupta, who has proceeded on a month’s leave after which the charge of the office was given to IPS Sahota.

As per data, while the virus took 249 days to hit peak in November 2020 during the first wave, it took just 93 days to peak during the second wave this May, primarily due to the virulence of the highly-contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.The decrease in transmission of the droplet viral infection began in the second week of May and the dip has continued since then. In fact, the per week infection count has seen record low from time-to-time.Last week (September 20 to 26), for instance, the state registered a record low of 85 infections surpassing the 88 infections recorded in successive weeks before (September 6-12 and September 13-19), the health department statistics show.The number of persons infected with the virus was 137 in the first week (August 2-8), 129 (August 9-15), 139 (August 16-22) and 109 (August 23-29).As on Thursday, there are eight districts having not a single active case while 12 districts have less than 10 active cases.

The apex court had only directed the Centre and states to give passage to the common man,” he said.An apex court bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on Thursday ordered that the matter be listed for October 4 as solicitor general Tushar Mehta has made a request to enable him to move an appropriate application to implead some parties.Following the August 23 observations of the apex court, the Sonepat deputy commissioner had held a meeting with the farmers’ representatives.Later, a committee headed by additional chief secretary (ACS), home, Rajeev Arora had invited office-bearers of 43 farm organisations to attend the meeting on September 19. However, no headway was made as the farmers failed to turn up for the meeting.The apex court, on a petition filed by a Noida-based woman, Monicca Agarwaal, had said that the solution lay in hands of central and state governments concerned. The bench said they should coordinate to ensure that if the protests are on, at least the inter-state roads and national highways are not blocked in any manner whatsoever so that to and fro on those roads does not cause inconvenience to other people who use the roads.Agarwaal had petitioned the apex court contending that though she stays and works in Noida, she has to travel to Delhi as she is in a marketing job. Aggarwal told the court that she is a single parent and has some medical issues. It has become a nightmare to travel to Delhi where it is taking two hours instead of normal 20 minutes, she had said.She had contended that despite directions passed by the apex court to keep the to and fro passage clear, the same still does not happen.Meanwhile, a delegation of over 20 villages around the Singhu and Tikri borders on Thursday met Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to apprise him of the problems faced by them due to closed border roads.An official spokesperson said Khattar told them that the government is making every possible effort to reopen the borders. “The villagers told the CM that there is resentment among people of the area over the blockade. The business has suffered, patients requiring emergent medical attention have died, kids have been unable to attend school and there have been frequent brawls,” the spokesperson said. The CM said the state government intended to open the roads by maintaining peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/blockade-at-delhi-borders-farmer-unions-to-be-made-party-in-sc-case-101633029936267.html

The Union home ministry is also searching for his whereabouts. We have no clue about his whereabouts and we too are searching him,” he said.The minister said it was not appropriate if Singh has fled the country. “There will be action taken against him. It could be under various provisions of the law. It could be a disciplinary action for remaining absent from the duty without informing the authorities. The action is not important, his appearance before the agencies is important. The action against him by the state government is not out of any vendetta but it is a routine procedure which will be followed,” he said in Mumbai.Singh was removed as Mumbai top cop on March 17, following the Antilia explosives scare and subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. He was shifted to the Maharashtra home guards on March 22.On April 7, Singh appeared before the National Investigation Agency for recording his statement in connection with the two cases. Later, he was summoned by the federal agency, but he did not respond to the summons.State Congress chief Nana Patole questioned whether the Centre had helped Singh to flee the country. “...The investigating agencies have raised doubts about his whereabouts but the question remains unanswered if the Centre facilitated him to go out of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-untraceable-minister-says-agencies-trying-to-find-whereabouts-101633029674702.html

The nomination filing exercise begins on Friday and October 8 is the last date to file papers for the bypoll.“The BJP convening the meeting of its election committee on October 3 is a clear signal in itself... the candidate (for Ellenabad bypoll) will be from BJP,” Haryana BJP president Om Prakash Dhankar said, when contacted over the phone.Among leaders of the 11-member panel meeting on Sunday will be Haryana BJP affairs in-charge Vinod Tawde, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, state BJP chief OP Dhankar, former state BJP chief Subhash Barala, former cabinet ministers Ram Bilas Sharma and Captain Abhimanyu.On Thursday, Dhankar held a meeting of Sirsa district core group of the party to seek feedback and prepare the strategy. Barala was appointed in-charge for the bypoll and Dhankar said alliance partners BJP and JJP will contest the Ellenabad bypoll jointly.The Ellenabad slugfest will be a keenly contested tussle where the challenge before the ruling BJP-JJP is how to reach out to the electorate in view of the farm agitation.The Jat-dominated assembly seat in Sirsa district had fallen vacant after Abhay Singh Chautala, the lone MLA of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) resigned in January from the assembly in protest against Centre’s three farm laws.During October 2019 Haryana assembly elections, Abhay Singh Chautala had won the seat by nearly 12,000 votes as he got 57,055 votes of 1,49,947 valid votes polled.His nearest rival in the fray BJP’s Pawan Beniwal was polled 45,133 votes and Congress’ Bharat Singh Beniwal had received 35,383 votes.But the worry of the BJP is that its nominee Pawan Beniwal had deserted the party to support the ongoing farmers’ agitation and joined the Congress recently.Another major concern of the ruling BJP-JJP alliance partners is the opposition they are facing from the restive farmers who have been stopping the ruling party leaders from holding government as well as party functions.Meanwhile, Haryana Congress leaders will also go into a huddle in Delhi on Friday to discuss bypoll-related issues. Haryana Congress affairs in-charge Vivek Bansal will chair the meeting in which Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and a battery of other leaders will also be present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypoll-joint-nominee-of-bjp-jjp-to-be-from-saffron-party-101633029693206.html

He said police teams were making efforts to track down these people and recovery of more trucks is likely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/trucks-impounded-for-defaulting-on-emis-sold-by-forging-details-stf-arrests-two-101633029451691.html

01-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Tariffs same, but power bills to go up marginally||Electricity bills in the national capital will increase by 2 percentage points from October 1, as the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) on Thursday announced the new power tariff order for 2021-22.In its order, DERC, like last year, kept all other rates such as per unit energy cost and fixed charges on the sanctioned load of every household constant. However, the pension trust surcharge was increased from 5% to 7%.Delhi has at least 5.5 million domestic power consumers.Apart from the goods and services tax, two surcharges are levied on every electricity bill in Delhi. These are the pension surcharge, which goes towards paying pension to former employees of power utilities before the electricity sector was decentralised, and the regulatory assets surcharge, which goes to power distribution companies (discoms) to make up for their revenue deficits. Both surcharges are levied on the fixed charges and energy charges of every electricity bill. Under the new order, the regulatory asset surcharge will remain unchanged at 8%.
01-10-2021||Pune||Ahead of elections, all parties except Congress oppose Taljai hill development plan||PUNE: The Taljai Hill Development Project submitted to the standing committee by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for approval has caught the attention of all political parties ahead of the civic polls even as the Congress finds itself cornered. Besides residents and environmentalists, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) too have opposed the project. Earlier on Wednesday, residents met and requested state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray to save the Taljai hill as PMC plans to execute the hill project at a cost of Rs120 crore. The minister promised to study the project and take necessary action. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Subhash Jagtap, who has been opposing the proposal for past two years, said, “I took steps to develop the hill and will not allow PMC to execute the plan and ruin the green belt. The 107-acre land was acquired during my tenure and we carried out extensive plantation on the hill.” On the other hand, Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “The project is presented by the municipal commissioner. Post the inauguration of Sa Du Shinde cricket stadium, the project proposal report has been put up at various spots on the hill and nearby area. Even as the plan awaits PMC’s approval, yet some people are saying that many trees will be cut. The work at Pachgaon Parvati hill is carried out by the forest department and not PMC.” The stand of Congress has not convinced other parties and residents. Sensing growing opposition from locals, MNS submitted a letter to municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar urging him not to execute the project. BJP corporator Mahesh Wable has also opposed the proposal and joined a signature campaign carried out last week by citizens. He said that while carrying out any work, citizens and local members should be taken into confidence.” The land mass The land protected by fence is owned by the forest department. The area in front of Taljai temple, including the temple, Sa Du Shinde stadium, Taljai water tank is falling under the 107-acre acquired by PMC. How the land got acquired According to NCP member Subhash Jagtap, there were 130 bungalow plots and 66 amenity plots approved in the 1942 layout. In 1982, this area was declared as hilltop hillslope (HTHS) with permission of four per cent construction. Jagtap said, “When I was the PMC standing committee chairman, I put up a proposal to acquire this HTHS land by PMC and make it Taljai hill to keep the area green. The then district collector Madhukar Kokate was not ready to publish the order. Guardian minister Ajit Pawar instructed Kokate to acquire the land and issue the order.” PMC started land acquisition process in 2003 and completed it in 2005 by paying Rs27 crore as compensation as per the HTHS rule. However, seven plot owners went to court. Later, PMC developed an oxygen park reservation on the plot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ahead-of-elections-all-parties-except-congress-oppose-taljai-hill-development-plan-101633028551758.html

The move came after two cases of sexual assault on children by autorickshaw drivers drew the attention of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar; home minister Dilip Walse-Patil and opposition members including former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.In the wake of the Wanowrie case, Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta ordered that all modes of passenger transport, including autorickshaws, strictly implement the existing rules. Action was taken against autorickshaw drivers through September for violating a set of rules namely, not displaying uniform and buckle number, riding without permit, not having passenger vehicle registration, violating traffic rules and using vehicles beyond the scrap lifespan among others. The traffic branch single-handedly focused on enforcement in terms of documentation and discipline. Till September 28, as many as 9,573 cases were registered against autorickshaw drivers for not wearing uniform; 1,822 for not possessing a driving licence; 747 for not displaying badges; and 28 for riding without licence; according to traffic department officials. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Rahul Shrirame, said that the drive is aimed at inculcating discipline among autorickshaw drivers. “We have been receiving numerous complaints from citizens regarding the autorickshaw drivers’ menace. Action is being taken to send a message to them that they are being scrutinised very carefully by citizens, the police and RTO. Our drive is aimed at disciplining autorickshaw drivers where they will have to strictly abide by the law and ensure that they have a licence, uniform, buckle etc. when they ferry passengers. Special attention is being given to those autorickshaw drivers who are engaged in rash and negligent driving,” Shrirame said.Earlier, RTO officials had seized many autorickshaws, compounding a number of violations stacked against the vehicles, later handing them over to the Bund garden traffic police division.On wrong side of lawWithout uniform: 9,573Without licence: 1,822No license: 28No entry: 1Front seat: 1Fitness: 4Badge: 747No parking: 115Signal jumping: 23RTO: 582Police warning: 6Number plate: 1No paper: 15Unauthorised passengers: 2Blocking roads: 32Others: 208Total: 13,160||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/september-sees-13-160-cases-against-errant-auto-drivers-in-pune-101633028011757.html
01-10-2021||Pune||Electric two-wheelers have shown a higher growth rate in Pune as compared to four-wheelers: RTO data||State tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray announced in Pune on Wednesday that from April 22, 2022, all government offices will only purchase electric vehicles, specifically electric four-wheelers. Data with the Regional Transport Office (RTO) shows that while demand for electric vehicles is picking up in the city, electric two-wheelers have shown a higher growth rate in Pune as compared to four-wheelers. The RTO data covers a four-year period and the lack of charging stations is being cited as one of the reasons for electric four-wheelers not faring as well as the two-wheelers in Pune. This year, from January to September, a total of 131 electric cars have been registered, while in the same duration 1,952 electric two-wheelers were registered in Pune. Over the last four years, the number of electric two- wheelers registered has been steadily increasing - in 2018 it was 510, in 2019 it was 844, and in 2020 it doubled to 1,672. For registration of electric cars, in 2018 it was 21, then in 2019 it was 29, last year it went up to 151 and now this year, 131 have been registered as of September 30. “There is good registration and sale of electric two- wheelers in Pune and over the last four years the number is going up. Many people prefer to buy electric bikes due to the increase in fuel prices. At the same time, electric cars are not many,” said Sanjeev Bhor, deputy region transport officer at Pune RTO. “One of the main reasons behind electric cars not selling is the number of electric charging stations in and around the city. Not everyone who buys the car has a personal charging point at home, so they have to depend on a service centre or some other private charging station. Once the number of charging stations increase, sales will pick up,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/electric-two-wheelers-have-shown-a-higher-growth-rate-in-pune-as-compared-to-four-wheelers-rto-data-101633027893477.html

The statement further said 11 teams were deployed to carry out inspections in areas such as Connaught Place, Connaught Circus, Khan Market, Pandara Road and Janpath in New Delhi as well as Munirka, RK Puram, Mahiplapur, Rangpuri, Mayapuri, Naraina Vihar and Naraina, Vasant Kunj, Vasant Vihar, Nangal Raya, Sagarpur East in south Delhi. Officials said of the 47 sites inspected, violations were found at 23 of them. The DPCC also proposed an environment cess of ₹16.40 lakh on offenders. “Normally, environment cess ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹5 lakh is imposed, based on the plot area, against the violating project proponents or contractors,” the statement read. Senior DPCC officials said taking note of the deteriorating air quality every winter in Delhi-NCR, the monitoring agency has prepared an action plan to mitigate pollution this year. “Dust pollution due to construction and demolition activities is one of the major contributors towards pollutants entering the ambient atmosphere. DPCC had already started issuing public notice in print media periodically for creating awareness among stakeholder project proponents, agencies such as municipal bodies, the public works department (PWD), the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), central public works department (CPWD), Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and flood and irrigation department, including smaller size construction and demolition sites,” the DPCC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dust-norms-violations-found-at-23-construction-sites-during-inspection-in-delhi-101633027771299.html
01-10-2021||Pune||Central Maharashtra sees fourth wettest monsoon since 1901||Pune: With erratic rainfall breaks and intense downpour this year, central Maharashtra has reported 17 per cent excess rainfall. Since 1901, this is the fourth wettest monsoon season for the region as per the data released by India Meteorological Department (IMD). Scientists from the Indian institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) have noted that heavy and intense rainfall events in central Maharashtra are likely to see an increase in the coming years. In 2021, central Maharashtra reported 869.1 mm actual rainfall against the normal rainfall of 746 mm between June 1 and September 29. Roxy Mathew Koll, senior climate scientist, IITM, said that the changes in central Maharashtra are similar to large-scale changes in the monsoon pattern. “Monsoon rainfall patterns from Gujarat to Odisha have shown changes. These changes are consistent with what is happening in central Maharashtra. We have observed that between June and September, which is the monsoon season, there are more long dry spells intermittently with three to four days of intense heavy rainfall. The pattern we are seeing in Maharashtra and central Maharashtra is also the same,” said Koll, adding that as per the total rainfall recorded in the last two decades, the total monsoon rainfall has decreased. “With increased temperature, there is moisture available. Which is also one of the reasons why we have dry spells. It is likely to pour more. Also, there is an indirect response of monsoon wind patterns from the Indian ocean to land. This circulation has been weakening, because of which there is less rainfall. There is a possibility that decrease in rainfall may continue. However, there is no clarity as of now. Models are yet to give a clear indication as to what will happen,” said Dr Roxy Mathew Koll. He said that even though monsoon rainfall may decrease, the number of heavy rainfall events will increase. “This has increased landslides and flooding. The change in rainfall pattern is due to climate change and urbanisation. What we can further see is that there are more heavy rainfall days and an increase in heavy rainfall intensity. Along with this, arial cover has increased that larger areas are now witnessing heavy rainfall events,” said Koll. He shared the Chiplun floods as a perfect example of climate change and urbanisation. “For extreme weather conditions, it is important that each district comes up with a climate projection plan to address extreme weather events. As different districts have different topography, every district must have a plan ready,” said Koll. Downpour count Central Maharashtra has reported above normal rainfall since 1901. The rainfall between June 1 and September end is 746 mm. Year-- Rainfall (in mm) 1914--851.4 1933--766.7 1938--755.3 1969--782.3 1988--762.8 2005--820.7 2006--935.2 2007--773.2 2017--852.3 2019—1,166.9 2020--967 2021--869.1 Wettest monsoon season for central Maharashtra since 1901 Year--Rainfall (in mm) 2019—1,166.9 2020--967 2006--935.2 2021--869.1 Between June 1 and September 29, Maharashtra received 19 per cent excess rainfall with all districts receiving normal to above normal rainfall in the monsoon season. Central Maharashtra has reported 17 per cent more than normal rainfall. Whereas drought-prone Marathwada has reported an excess rainfall of 49 per cent. Vidarbha has reported three per cent more than normal rainfall. Konkan and Goa have reported 23 per cent in excess rainfall this season.

It will become very difficult,” the judge remarked.Among the 21 accused in the larger conspiracy case are former JNU student union leader Umar Khalid and former councillor Tahir Hussain, who have been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to orchestrate the riots in February 2020.During the hearing, advocate Rizwan, appearing for Hussain, claimed that this was the “only trial in the country where the prosecution has objections to pleas filed under Section 207 CrPC and they are filing replies”.Section 207 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure pertains to the supply to the accused copies of the police report, recorded statements of all prosecution witnesses and other documents that they may seek through the magistrate/judge hearing the case.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, objected to this remark and asked Rizwan if he had filed any such application yet.To this, Rizwan said, “I (Hussain) am the accused. I have the right to evidence that they (prosecution) are not relying upon. It has been more than a year now. If it is still stuck at this stage, the trial will take ages,” he said.The court told the prosecution to file replies only for those documents which can’t be given and give reasons why they can’t be given. “This is to expedite the trial,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-trial-will-be-delayed-if-prosecution-doesn-t-speed-up-says-court-101633027591256.html

The Pune Housing and Area Development Board has been pushing for the redevelopment of these layouts, however not many developers are coming forward for the redevelopment.The Pune division is currently holding a series of meetings with developers and housing societies to understand their views and design a policy framework. Nitin Mane, additional chief executive officer and chief officer of the Pune board, said, “We are talking to developers to understand what their problems are and what they expect from these redevelopment projects. Also, we have gathered inputs from tenants as well. Very soon, the policy will take final shape. The redevelopment of MHADA projects will change the face of the city.” The recommendations will soon be submitted to the state government for approval.Sources said that though the Maharashtra government has approved a floor space index (FSI) of 3 for the MHADA properties in Pune, developers are not happy with it and have demanded more FSI. Developers have also highlighted the lower per square foot rate in Pune as compared to Mumbai. The tricky task for the officials is to devise a policy that will please both developers and residents.In June, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting with the urban development and housing department to discuss the redevelopment of MHADA properties in Pune. Pune city has various MHADA buildings that were erected in 1965 and are now in bad condition. A senior official from the Pune board accepted that the redevelopment process should begin before any casualty related to these buildings occurs.MHADA buildings are located at the following places in the city:Lokmanya nagar (Sadashiv peth), Agarkar nagar (Bund Garden road), Bhamburda (Gokhale nagar), Laxmi nagar (Parvati), Maharshinagar, Phule nagar, Maharashtra Housing Board Yerawada, Netaji nagar (Wanwadi), Swami Vivekanand nagar (Hadapsar), Hingne mala (Hadapsar) Golf Club road, Kothrud, Bavdhan and Wadgaonsheri||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/26-mhada-colonies-up-for-redevelopment-separate-pune-policy-in-the-works-101633027532467.html

The results of the study were published this September. “The study has been published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research and was carried out by conducting in-depth telephonic interviews with 967 HCWs involved in Covid-19 management across 11 cities- Bhubaneswar, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Noida, South Delhi, Pathanamthitta and Kasaragod (Kerala), Chennai, Jabalpur, Kamrup and East Khasi Hills,” said Dr Shalini Singh, director of ICMR-National Institute of Cancer Prevention & Research (NICPR), Noida. Of the total subjects, 54% were females and 46% were males with most respondents falling in the 20-40 years age group. The ICMR-NICPR and the department of psychiatry, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, carried out the study in Gautam Budh Nagar by randomly selecting subjects from government hospitals. Some participants concealed information related to their duties to avoid distressing their family members. The study details the experiences of stigma and rejection that HCWs faced for caring for Covid patients. The study has found out that the neighbours, friends and relatives of the HCWs made them feel they were the spreaders of the infection and avoided them, made hurtful remarks and also showed reluctance to interact with them. “Some HCWs reported that they also had to conceal their identities to prevent any social harassment... There were also some who reported stigma from their own families,” said the study. “This attitude was mainly because they were considered as vectors for transmission of the virus and not perceived as those whose primary service was to prevent infection and help those infected,” it said. Dr NK Sharma, president of the Indian Medical Association (Noida) recalled such incidents that happened in Gautam Budh Nagar.“There were instances of doctors facing rejection from society during the first few months of the Covid outbreak. A number of healthcare workers, who were living in rented accommodations in Noida, were asked to move out by their landlords. Some doctors approached the IMA for support and we protested against such behaviour. In some cases, doctors were ridiculed and subjected to bad behaviour. As representatives of doctors in the district, we had to get police protection at some hospitals in the city,” said Dr Sharma.According to the study’s findings, HCWs reported major changes in the work-life environment. The issue most reported was the long duration of separation from families. Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent at the community health centre in Bhangel, Noida said, “It was a huge challenge to be separated from my family after the Covid outbreak. My son was just one-and-a-half-years old when Covid struck and I had to stay away from him for months as I was on Covid duty. While on one hand, I wanted to hug him, on the other hand, there was the fear of infecting him with the virus.” said Singh.Along with the pressure of separation from families, researchers also found out that excessive workload, erratic working hours, challenges of working in a personal protective equipment (PPE) for hours, fear of infection, sleep deprivation, disruption in eating habits contributed to the mental trauma of the HCWs.“Recent reports indicate that health personnel struggled with higher workloads and a swiftly changing workspace milieu that differed greatly from the familiar day-to-day reality while dealing with the social changes and emotional stressors of Covid-19. The longer working hours with erratic timings reported in the present study resulted in sleep deprivation as well as unhealthy eating patterns, which could have long-term consequences,” said the study.In fact, the researchers have found out that female caregivers were more affected than male counterparts as along with their workload, they also had the responsibility of managing their homes. As medical staff struggled to work in PPE kits at Greater Noida’s GIMS, Dr. Abhay Singh Tomar, a psychiatrist at the facility thought of a novel idea to cheer up workers.“I could see HCWs getting suffocated under the PPE kits and this, in turn, affected their mental health. Moreover, in such a glum environment, it was difficult for the staff in PPE suits to exude positivity among their patients. As a result, we came up with the idea to scribble positive notes on the suits like ‘StayPositive!, ‘Faith in, Fear Out!’. This way, each medical staff was greeted with a smile as the patients read the positive notes,” said Dr Tomar.HCWs are already suffering from burnout. The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) conducted a survey among 3,083 HCWs across India. They published their findings in April this year in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry, which revealed that 26.6% and 23.8% of the respondents had anxiety and depression respectively.Against this backdrop, ICMR conducted his study to find out the main reasons for the mental health crisis among the HCWs and make recommendations to the central government.The study concludes that there is a need for psychological support for healthcare workers and their families to allay fears and prevent stigma associated with Covid-19 infection or transmission.Dr Beena E Thomas from the department of social and behavioural research, National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai, who is the main correspondent of the study, said there is a need to sensitise the public. “The stigmatisation adds to the mental health of the already exhausted and burned out HCWs. More focus should be laid on educating people,” she added.The ICMR has suggested improving the working environment, allowing them breathing space and filling the staff crunch to ease the workload on HCWs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/healthcare-workers-face-stigma-after-covid-outbreak-icmr-study-101633027352495.html

Most of them are from farmer community and they have been struggling to pay college and hostel fees in the past due to the Covid pandemic. We have made a Google form for students to fill and mention the help they need,” said Kuldeep Ambekar, president, Students Helping Hand. “Once the data is collected, funds and other necessary things like groceries and study material will be collected from donors and given to students.” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/student-body-comes-forward-to-help-affected-students-from-marathwada-vidarbha-101633027233935.html
01-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s south corporation launches cashless parking lot in Dwarka||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday operationalised its first cashless parking lot in Dwarka Sector 14 which will see parking fees being automatically deducted through the RFID-based Fastags used for toll tax collections.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti explained that the parking fee will be deducted automatically when the vehicle exits the parking lot. “Our goal is to significantly reduce the time taken to park a vehicle,” he said.A senior municipal official overseeing the parking management in South Delhi said that the Dwarka facility will be able to accommodate 140 cars, 50 two-wheeler and 20 buses. “The land near Dwarka sector 14 Metro station was handed over to us around a year back by DDA. This is a pilot project for cashless parking system and the same will be replicated in the closed sites run by SDMC where access can be easily controlled at one point. The integrated system will also act as an incentive for adopting RFID tags,” the official said. The south corporation operates 145 surface parking sites and eight multi-level parking sites.The official said that the cashless fee collection system can help in significant reduction of the average time taken to park a vehicle. “We are also developing an android based parking application which will be used by parking lot users to pay the fee digitally. All 153 parking sites will be covered by either an RFID-based collection system or the parking application-based collection. Paper slips will be provided to only those users who demand it,” the official stated.While inaugurating the operation of the RFID parking lot, the south corporation mayor Mukesh Suryan said this is the first parking lot where the Fastag system will be implemented so that people do not face any difficulty while paying parking charges. “This will encourage online payment of parking fees. SDMC has authorised NHAI’s IHMCL Indian Highways Management Company Limited to collect parking charges from this facility and the agency will remit the revenue with the civic agency,” Suryan said. According to the agreement, the SDMC will reimburse the operation charges to the agency at the rate of 1 percent of the transaction value.Leader of the SDMC House Inderjeet Sehrawat said that the cashless parking system will now be replicated in major parking lots and multilevel parking facilities. “The IHMCL will incur expenses related to setting up of structures for fee collection and the SDMC will not bear any cost related in this regard,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-corporation-launches-cashless-parking-lot-in-dwarka-101633027232697.html

Friday’s vaccination drive will comprise 98 vaccination centres. While 54 of them will have both online slot booking and walk-in facilities, the rest will only have a walk-in facility but registration on the Co-WIN portal will be mandatory. The Bisrakh block will have 39 vaccination centres, Dadri 22, while Jewar and Dankaur will have 17 each. “The health department has a list of the people--identified in the survey--who are yet to take the first shot. The local Asha workers have been tasked to get them vaccinated,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.The last mega vaccination drive was held on Monday, wherein 137 vaccination centres administered jabs to 29,775 beneficiaries. The health department held another drive on Thursday with a target of vaccinating 22,500 beneficiaries at 81 camps. “Against a target of inoculating 22,500 beneficiaries, 16,920 people were vaccinated on Thursday. Of them, 6,648 were given the first dose while 9,642 received the second dose. The drive was aimed at vaccinating beneficiaries in the 45+ age group. Around 70% of the beneficiaries vaccinated on Thursday belonged to this category,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.During a door-to-door surveillance conducted from September 7 to 16, the health department identified 56,489 beneficiaries over the age of 45 who had still not taken the first dose. The district health department has been instructed to ensure this age group gets vaccinated on priority basis.“After the door-to-door survey found that over 50,000 people above the age of 45 have not taken any jab, a meeting was held with district health department officials and a strategy was chalked out to ensure this group gets the first dose within a week. Hence the two vaccination drives on Thursday and Friday,” said Dr Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-aims-to-inoculate-over-22k-beneficiaries-in-the-45-age-group-101633027231277.html

This comes in the aftermath of an IS-linked suicide bombing outside Kabul international airport late August that targeted evacuation efforts of the United States. The blast, one of the deadliest attacks in years, had killed 169 Afghans and 13 US service members.Speaking to The Associated Press, Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said that Friday's raid was conducted in the city of Charikar in Parwan province, located north of Kabul. However, he did not provide more details.Subsequently, the Taliban arrested two IS members linked to a roadside bombing that targeted their vehicle and wounded four fighters, Karimi said. The arrested militants were interrogated and based on the information the Taliban identified the hideout, he added.The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has certainly increased the attacks by IS militants on Taliban members, widening the conflict between the long-time rivals.Although, the Islamic State is dominant in eastern Nangarhar province, the terror group has ramped up attacks across the nation ever since the fall of the Afghanistan government and the Taliban takeover. Taliban fighters have been killed in IS attacks in the provincial capital of Jalalabad, while in response, the ruling group have carried out crackdowns on the IS in Nangarhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-raid-is-hideout-in-afghanistan-s-parwan-province-several-militants-killed-101633108687046.html

She was born on Sept. 18 at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, weighing in at 6 pounds and 2 ounces (2.78 kilos).Beatrice, 33, is already stepmother to Mapelli’s son Christopher Wolf, who is known as Wolfie, from a previous relationship.“We are all doing well and Wolfie is the best big brother to Sienna,” Beatrice said.Beatrice is 10th in the line of succession to the British throne, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York.After a whirlwind romance, Beatrice and Mapelli tied the knot in July 2020 in a private wedding ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, after their initial wedding date in May was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Sienna’s arrival has come at a time when Andrew is facing a U.S. civil sexual assault lawsuit.The duke, who stepped down from royal duties in 2019, is being sued by Virginia Giuffre for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She claims she was trafficked by Andrew’s friend — convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — to have sex with the duke when she was aged 17.Andrew, who denies all the allegations, was pictured driving from the queen’s Balmoral home in Scotland this week, prompting speculation that he was on his way to meet his newest grandchild.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-princess-beatrice-names-first-child-sienna-elizabeth-101633109262737.html

01-10-2021||World||Amazon records least September fires in 20 years||The number of fires in Brazil's Amazon during September dropped to the lowest for the month in two decades, according to data from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.September is historically Brazil's worst month for forest fires and, while the data is positive, environmental experts question whether the trend will be confirmed by coming months.The number of Amazon fires was just over half the level recorded in September last year, according to the data. That helped push down the nationwide total, along with a sharp drop in the amount of fires in the Pantanal wetlands. Fires in September retreated to the lowest number for the month since 2018, several months before President Jair Bolsonaro took office.Since taking office, Bolsonaro has encouraged development within the Amazon and dismissed global complaints about its destruction as a plot to hold back the nation's agribusiness. His administration also weakened environmental authorities and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections, emboldening land grabbers.More recently, he has sought to demonstrate heightened environmental commitment in the face of criticism from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and troubled institutional investors. At the United Nations this month, he credited his administration's redoubled efforts for the plunge of Amazon deforestation alerts in August, which followed a year-on-year decline in July. September results will be released in the coming week.Environmentalists roundly dismiss his shift as disingenuous and say his deployment of the military to the Amazon is ineffective for preservation; an Associated Press investigation last year found the same results.Márcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups, welcomed September fire data, but said he would need to see lower figures through at least year-end before declaring it a trend, particularly given still-elevated deforestation levels and limited enforcement.“As government action in the Amazon is very weak, even with these variations, it's hard to say it will be maintained. Why would it be maintained?" Astrini said. "The government isn't there, there's no repression. So it depends on the will of the people who are deforesting, setting fires.?Severe drought and early data at the start of the forest fire season had raised widespread concern that this year's blazes would reach the same destruction recorded in the past two years.But rainfall in the Amazon during August was significantly above average. That was the main inhibitor keeping ranchers from setting fire to felled trees in September, which seemed “almost divine intervention,” said Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute.By contrast in the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands, there has been a shift in behaviour from last year leading to far fewer fires, despite the ongoing drought that has rendered the area a powder keg, Alencar added.Fires are down by more than two-thirds in the first nine months of 2020 after last year's explosion brought ruin to the local tourism industry.“The disaster of last year served to help people better organize firefighting and prevention this year,” Alencar said. “The economic losses last year had an important impact in making people think more about their actions and, with peer enforcement, reduce the use of fire.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-records-least-september-fires-in-20-years-101633107056568.html
01-10-2021||World||Australia looking to diversify trade ties amid difficulties with China: Trade minister Dan Tehan||Australia is seeking to diversify its trading relations with countries such as India against the backdrop of difficulties in its economic ties with China, Australian trade and investment minister Dan Tehan said on Friday. A day after India and Australia agreed to reach an interim trade deal on goods and services by December and to conclude talks on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) by the end of 2022, Tehan said the two sides had also seen a “lot of movement” on cooperation in rare earth minerals. “Australia currently has some difficulties in our economic relationship with China; they’ve been very well documented. It’s one of the reasons why we’ve been looking to diversify our trade relationships,” Tehan told reporters at a media roundtable at the Australian high commission. “We obviously want to have a very constructive engagement with China but we also understand, given the difficulties that we are facing at the moment, that there is a need for us to diversify,” he said. While China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, relations between the two sides have been hit by a trade war. China has imposed stiff tariffs on Australian barley and wine exports and created barriers for products such as Timber and coal. Tehan said the focus of his discussions with commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday was the economic partnership between Australia and India, and the ambitious interim and final trade agreements. Though both sides were going into the negotiations with a “win-win spirit”, he acknowledged it would be hard for the two sides to pull off an interim trade deal within just three months. The current level of bilateral trade, which stands at about $25 billion trade, does not represent the capacity of the two economies to grow and work with each other, he said. Tehan said there has been a “lot of movement” in cooperation with India on rare earth minerals, and a key development was an announcement last week by Prime Minister Scott Morrison about Export Finance Australia establishing an Australian $2 billion critical minerals facility to help with exploration and processing of minerals and development of supply chains for exports to countries such as India. “This will help us be able to develop that partnership between Australia and India in the critical minerals space. There is also a clean technology agreement that has been agreed between Australia and India, and that also will help in the critical minerals space,” he said. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, the two countries had been exploring the possibility of cooperation in mining and processing rare earth metals such as lithium, neodymium and dysprosium, of which Australia has the world’s sixth largest reserves. India, which imports more than 90% of the rare earth metals it needs from China, has been looking to diversify sources. In 2016, imports from China were worth $3.4 million. Tehan said his discussions with Goyal had also taken in e-commerce, the use of merino wool for manufacturing textiles in India, phyto-sanitary measures for the export and import of fruit and vegetables, and Australian investments in India’s food processing sector. He said negotiations on e-commerce will have to wait till India passes important legislation on the issue, though it will be part of the final trade agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-looking-to-diversify-trade-ties-amid-difficulties-with-china-trade-minister-dan-tehan-101633107517025.html

The employees have also raised concerns regarding the toxic working culture at the company and claim that it doesn't adhere to proper safety protocols.However, Blue Origin has rejected the charges, saying it has "no tolerance for any kind of harassment or discrimination" and that it stands by its safety record.The allegations were outlined in a blog post that has signatures from 21 employees including Alexandra Abrams, the company's former head of employee communications.In the essay, employees stated that "numerous senior leaders have been known to be consistently inappropriate with women". They also claim that many company leaders were "unapproachable" and showed clear bias against women."Workforce gender gaps are common in the space industry, but at Blue Origin they also manifest in a particular brand of sexism," the employees stated in the blog.It also mentioned an incident where a senior executive reported sexual harassment "multiple times," but it remained within the "loyal inner circle" of CEO Bob Smith.The blog mentions a former executive employee who frequently referred to women as "'baby girl,' 'baby doll,' and 'sweetheart.'"The employees stated that Blue Origin company was more focused on beating billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk in the space race rather than addressing the safety issues that would have slowed down the schedule.On July 21, Bezos blasted off to space in a spaceflight developed by his company Blue Origin. However, he was defeated by Bezos in the race by nine days by Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson who pushed ahead and travelled to space in his own flight from New Mexico."Some of us felt that with the resources and staff available, leadership’s race to launch at such a breakneck speed was seriously compromising flight safety," the employees said.Refuting the allegations, Blue Origin said it believes "New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-employees-accuse-blue-origin-of-sexist-toxic-culture-company-denies-101633102585102.html

The move comes as several nations among Covax’s 140-plus beneficiary states are still inoculating the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine when other developed countries have moved on to administer booster shots.“For the October supply we designed a different methodology, only covering participants with low sources of supply,” Reuters reported quoting WHO assistant director-general for access to vaccines, Mariangela Simao during a conference presentation last week.Displaying slides during the conference, Simao showed that among over 90 poorer countries served by Covax, nearly half had administered Covid-19 vaccine doses to less than 20 per cent of their eligible population, the Reuters report added. Meanwhile, several richer countries have already achieved 70 per cent vaccination coverage. As many as 49 countries, identified as the least covered beneficiary states, will be provided with nearly 75 million Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca. However, the names of the countries were not revealed by the WHO.The Covax initiative has overseen the allocation of more than 500 million coronavirus vaccine doses, of which around 300 million have been shipped to recipient countries.  The requirement for Covid-19 booster doses has been a topic of controversy since August when the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on the same, even as several nations including Canada decided to do otherwise. Last month, he stressed on his viewpoint yet again, saying that he “won’t stay silent” when firms and nations in-charge of the global supply of vaccines “think the world’s poor should be satisfied with leftovers.” According to a latest BBC report, more than 50 countries have missed the deadline set by the WHO to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of their population with both doses of Covid-19 vaccines. The list includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Myanmar and Yemen, among others. US President Joe Biden on Monday took the booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine, encouraging his fellow country people to follow suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccines-via-covax-to-be-sent-only-to-least-covered-nations-in-oct-who-101633093559084.html

The decision comes as nearly 80 per cent of the population aged 16 and older have been fully vaccinated, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday. However, no official date has been announced yet welcoming international tourists back.Australians have had to argue for rare exemptions from the travel restrictions, among the most stringent any democracy in the world imposed on March 20 last year. Many people failed to reach relatives' death beads, missed funerals and weddings simply because Australia was trying to keep the Covid-19 disease at bay.The only exceptions to the travel ban were government employees and essential workers but tourism was never accepted as a reason to cross the border.“We've saved lives. We've saved livelihoods, but we must work together to ensure that Australians can reclaim the lives that they once had in this country,” Morrison said, as quoted by Associated Press.New South Wales is expected to become the first state to reach the 80 per cent vaccination benchmark while Sydney's airport will be the first to resume international flights, the Australian prime minister said. Sydney-based Qantas Airways has already announced that international flights to London and Los Angeles would resume from November 14.“We'll be working towards complete quarantine-free travel for certain countries, such as New Zealand, when it is safe to do so,” he said.Australia had earlier imposed a cap on the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed to return each week to reduce pressure on two-week hotel quarantine, amid reports of the highly contagious delta variant. The cap would only apply to the unvaccinated under the new regime. At the same time, those fully vaccinated will be able to quarantine at home and for only a week.Australia has also added Indian-made Covishield and China's Sinovac to a list of Covid-19 vaccines recognised by the country.Travel restrictions will remain in place for Australians who chose not to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, those who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons or children too young to get the jab have been exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-lift-travel-ban-from-november-international-flights-to-resume-soon-101633084960746.html
01-10-2021||World||China releases Galwan valley video marking death of PLA soldiers||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has released a new video filmed at the site of the 2020 Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed to mark the country’s Martyr’s Day on Thursday.The video uploaded on China’s social media by the PLA’s Western Theatre Command is part of Beijing’s continuing push to blame India both for the ongoing tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the Galwan Valley clash in June last year.The Western Theatre Command is the largest PLA command and is responsible for the Sino-India border, stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to fully resolve the tension with disengagement of troops pending at more than one place along the friction points.The video shows hundreds of PLA soldiers from unit 7895 of the Xinjiang military command standing in rows and shouting military slogans on the rocky banks of a river, flowing through a ravine, between sheer, gray cliffs.“On the National Martyr’s Day Officers and soldiers of a regiment in Xinjiang Military Command went to the place to remember the heroes and to inherit their legacy,” the report accompanying the video said.“The Galwan Valley remembers. You gave up your lives to defend the dignity of your country. We sacrifice our youth to make a promise that is as heavy as a mountain,” the report added.Condolences were extended to the four PLA soldiers killed: Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuran.In one sequence, PLA soldiers are shown bowing their heads in silence in front of what appears to be machine guns.Another aerial sequence, possibly shot by a drone, shows the personnel standing in a row on a narrow pathway on the side of a cliff.Etched in Chinese on a cliff in the background are the words: “Never give up an inch of the beautiful motherland”.Towards the end of the video, the new leader of the squad, who took over after the death of Xiao Siyuan, is shown pledging to carry forward the “Dagger squad spirit”, comprising qualities like hard work and defending the territorial integrity of the country.Chinese media outlets have released several videos this year that have sought to portray Indian troops as trespassers and aggressors since the PLA death toll was made public in February this year.China’s official English channel, CGTN, had uploaded a video on one of the four PLA soldiers who died, Chen Hongjun, on social media and its website to mark the armed forces’ founding day on August 1.Besides interviews of Chen’s family members including his wife, the video showed edited footage of the clash between the two armies; Chinese equipment on the banks of the fast flowing river, soldiers, mostly Chinese, precariously wading in knee-deep water and personnel from the two sides charging at each other.The video, evidently pitched as a propaganda piece aimed at a domestic Chinese audience, begins with a one-sided introduction to the 2020, June 15 clash.“Indian army violated the bilateral consensus and crossed the Line of Actual Control on June 15, 2020,” it claimed, a claim repeatedly dismissed by India.The videos, which purportedly portrayed the build-up to the Galwan Valley clash, identified the Indian soldiers only as “foreign” troops and the accompanying commentary painted them as trespassers - an allegation consistently denied by India.In February, several versions of a video, ranging in length from a little more than a minute to eight minutes, were released by outlets such as CGTN and the Global Times, showing troops from the two sides negotiating and jostling with each other. The background comprises ravines, a flowing river, and steep cliffs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-releases-galwan-valley-video-marking-death-of-pla-soldiers-101633086696205.html

Dave Butler said.General Milley and Mrs Milley, ahead of the meeting, welcomed CDS Rawat during an Armed Forces full honour arrival ceremony on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. He also thanked CDS Rawat for contributing to the strengthening of the defence partnership between the US and India.“The US and India share a strong military-to-military relationship under the US-India Major Defence Partnership, which supports a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Butler added.According to the White House fact sheet, the US aims to further strengthen its defence partnership with India, continue the progress made as Major Defence Partners. The fact sheet also highlighted US' to bolster its relationship with the Indian military and said that the US-India Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) agreement signed between both nations in July this year points towards that commitment.Under the DTTI, both nations will co-develop air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles. It currently encompasses four working groups. Another meeting will take place later this year to expand defence industrial collaboration.Both nations, during the meeting between PM Modi and US president Joe Biden, also committed to ensuring a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military power in the region. China continues to claim nearly all of the disputed South China Sea despite Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claiming parts of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cds-rawat-meets-us-counterpart-general-mark-milley-discusses-regional-issues-101633085712019.html

All Nobel prizes, except the peace prize, are awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm, Sweden. A committee elected by the Norwegian Parliament awards the Nobel Peace Prize. Last year, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) forced the Nobel Prize ceremony to go virtual. While the pandemic isn’t over yet, the large-scale vaccination drives around the world, especially in rich nations, have helped the ceremony return to Sweden. However, it will a “mixture of digital and physical events”.Since 1901, the Nobel prizes are awarded to individuals and organisations for work that has led to great advances for humankind after Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament. He gave the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.Here are some facts about Nobel Prize you need to know:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hitler-was-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize-10-facts-about-the-coveted-award-101633084011071.html

Some had glued their hands to the ground and chained themselves together using bicycle locks.Their protest brought traffic at a roundabout near the M4 motorway's Junction 3 to a standstill.Police eventually cleared the road, dragging handcuffed activists away from the site."Officers arrested 13 people for obstruction and conspiracy to commit public nuisance," London's Metropolitan Police said on its Twitter account.Insulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes in an effort to curb fossil fuel use and fight global warming.The group said on Friday that it also blocked a roundabout near the M1 motorway at Junction 1, its latest action after it stopped traffic on London's M25 orbital motorway multiple times over the last three weeks, and blocked the Port of Dover.In an attempt to stop the disruption, the transport ministry has sought injunctions from the High Court which mean that the protesters may face jail time for repeating their actions.But Insulate Britain says its actions will continue until Britain makes a meaningful statement to insulate the country's homes, which it says are the most energy inefficient in Europe.Britain, which aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, will host the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson will push world leaders to commit to ending reliance on fossil fuels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-climate-activists-arrested-for-blocking-heathrow-airport-access-road-police-101633082680187.html

Announcement on Monday||Scientists behind COVID-19 vaccines could be in the running to win the Nobel Prize for Medicine even though the pandemic is far from over. Some scientists say it is just a matter of time: If the work that went into developing the vaccines is not recognised when this year's prize is announced on Monday, it will win the award in years to come.More than 4.7 million people have died from COVID-19 since the first cases of the novel coronavirus were registered in 2019, and many countries still live under severe restrictions intended to curb its spread.But COVID-19 vaccines have helped some wealthy states return almost to normality while others are yet to receive vaccine doses in large quantities.Among those seen by other scientists as potential winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine are Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko and American Drew Weissman for their work on what are known as Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines.The mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have revolutionised the fight against the virus. They are quick to produce and highly effective."This technique will get the prize sooner or later, of that I am sure," said Ali Mirazami, professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. "The question is when."Traditional vaccines, which introduce a weakened or dead virus to stimulate the body's immune system, can take a decade or more to develop. Moderna's mRNA vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.The mRNA carries messages from the body's DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes including digestion or fighting disease.The new vaccines use laboratory-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus' spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus. DECADES OF WORKThe mRNA was discovered in 1961 but it has taken scientists decades to cure the mRNA technique from problems such as instability and causing inflammatory conditions.Developers now hope it can be used to treat both cancer and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in the future."In addition to the fact that they have been shown to generate a very effective immune response, you do not have to tailor the production every time you make a new vaccine," said Adam Frederik Sander Bertelsen, Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen and chief scientific officer at vaccine company Adaptvac."It has actually saved countless thousands of people due to its speed and efficiency, so I can well support that."Kariko, 66, laid the groundwork for the mRNA vaccines and Weissman, 62, is her long-time collaborator."They are the brain behind the mRNA discovery," said Mirazami. He added: "They might be too young, the (Nobel) committee usually wait until the recipients are in their 80s."Kariko, with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, made a breakthrough by figuring out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive.The Nobel Prize was founded by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel and is awarded for achievements in Medicine, Chemistry, Literature, Peace and Physics. This year's winners are announced between Oct. 4 and 11, starting with Medicine.

In addition, more than 15,000 people are estimated to have crossed the border into India. A further 7,000 people crossed into Thailand, all of whom have returned and remain internally displaced in Myanmar,” the Secretary-General said in the report, which covers the period from August 15, 2020 to August 14, 2021.Myanmar shares an over 1,600 km long unfenced and porous land border with India as well as a maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. Four North-Eastern states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram share the international boundary with Myanmar.Guterres said in the report that since February, tensions have increased throughout the country, including in areas covered by the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement and where there was relative peace before February 1, when the Myanmar military seized power and detained top political figures, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint.“Mostly in states and regions along the borders with Thailand, China and India, armed clashes have erupted between the Tatmadaw, ethnic armed organisations and newly formed civilian people’s defence forces, raising concern about regional implications of the crisis and the potential for a large-scale armed conflict,” the report said.The UN chief notes in the report that Rohingya continue to undertake risky journeys across the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.“In June, a boat carrying dozens of Rohingya refugees reached Aceh, Indonesia, after leaving Bangladesh or Myanmar – engine failure caused it to remain adrift in the Andaman Sea for several months, leading to the deaths of some refugees. Another boat was rescued by the Indian Coast Guard in February,” he said.The report added that brutality by the security forces against people opposing the military takeover and the self-declared State Administrative Council, including those participating in the civil disobedience movement, has been wide-ranging.“Those expressing opposition to the military and joining democratic movements, as well as their relatives and associates, have been subject to arbitrary killings and detentions, disappearances, night raids, intimidation, and torture,” it said.There have also been numerous reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by the security forces as well as numerous reports of acts of violence targeted at the security forces, such as the killing of individuals suspected of collaborating with the military.“The Secretary-General has called for maximum restraint by all sides,” the report said.Guterres said he has repeatedly called on the military to respect the will of the people, to refrain from violence and repression, and to act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country.The UN Security Council has expressed deep concern at the arbitrary detention of members of the Government, including President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and others, and called for the immediate release of all those detained arbitrarily, while condemning the ongoing violence.“Neighbouring countries could leverage their influence over the military and call on it to respect the will of the people and to act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country and region,” he said.Guterres voiced concern that Myanmar is facing a prolonged period of insecurity and instability and it is important that concerted efforts are made among domestic, regional and international actors to enable fully civilian rule in line with the will of the people.“The risk of a large-scale armed conflict requires a collective approach to prevent a multi-dimensional catastrophe in the heart of South-East Asia and beyond," he said."Grave humanitarian implications, including rapidly deteriorating food security, an increase in mass displacements and a weakened public health system compounded by a new wave of COVID-19 infections require a coordinated approach in complementarity with regional actors,” Guterres said.He said that the United Nations will focus its efforts on further strengthening a system-wide coherent approach to providing humanitarian and life-saving assistance to support the people of Myanmar and help to prevent further regional ramifications.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet had said last week that more than 1,120 people have been killed since the coup and military authorities have also arrested over 8,000 people, including elected officials, protesters and journalists during arrests and raids.At least 120 people have reportedly died in custody, and some have been denied access to medical treatment, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-over-15k-may-have-crossed-the-border-into-india-says-un-chief-101633067673025.html

The development was first reported on by Fox News, which cited US defence officials who identified the terrorist. Later, the US Central Command (Centcom) told the Military Times that Abu-Ahmed was killed in the September 20 drone strike near Idlib in Syria, adding that there were zero civilian casualties this time.Centcom spokesperson Major John Rigsbee said while speaking to the Military Times that Salim Abu-Ahmed was a notorious al Qaeda leader responsible for “planning, funding, and approving” a multitude of ‘trans-regional’ attacks. “There are no indications of civilian casualties as a result of the strike,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the United States will continue to target international terrorist networks abroad whose actions risk its interests and allies across the world.On September 20, the Associated Press reported, citing rescue workers and a war monitor, that the US drone strike in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria hit a vehicle travelling on a rural road; and that at least one person was killed in the incident. White Helmets, a civil defence team, told AP that the “unidentified body” was lifted from the car along the Idlib-Binnish road east of the Idlib province in Syria. The charred vehicle, split in the middle, lay on the side of the rural road in an orchid.The US central command later said that American forces had conducted a “kinetic counterterrorism strike” near the Idlib province targeting a senior leader of al Qaeda. In a statement at the time, US navy lieutenant Josie Lynne Lenny said that “initial indications are that we struck the individual we were aiming for, and there are no indications of civilian casualties as a result of the strike.” No additional details were released officially thereafter.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that the vehicle carried “a militant from one of the radical groups operating in the province,” adding that it was “linked to al Qaida” but stopped short of identifying the group.Notably, Washington has earlier carried out attacks in the Idlib region before targeting al Qaeda terrorists and the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was hiding in the province after fleeing from eastern Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-al-qaeda-leader-salim-abu-ahmad-killed-in-us-strike-in-syria-reports-101633062335213.html

Meanwhile, the news outlet CTV News reported that Jag Sahota has retained a law firm to file a motion before a court to annul the results of the election. That is likely to be moved next week.Constituent Glenn Pennett had earlier released security camera footage on Facebook that showed Chahal, better known as George, personally removing Sahota’s flyer from his doorstep and putting his own campaign material there. That could comprise a contravention of the Canada Elections Act, according to Canadian media. CTV News also reported that Pennett has filed a complaint in this regard with local police.While the CCE does not confirm its investigations into individual cases, Sahota’s representatives have said that the office has approached them in this matter as part of its investigation.George Chahal’s campaign has maintained that the flyer he removed had the wrong information about the polling station for Pennett. However, that has been refuted by Pennett who has said the flyer George Chahal placed instead had incorrect information.A statement from the Liberal Party said “Chahal and his team will always be available to respond to any inquiries with respect to this recent election”.Following his victory, George Chahal was considered a certainty for inclusion in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s next Cabinet. However, emergence of the footage showing him removing election material has jeopardised that possibility.Justin Trudeau is expected to name the Cabinet this month and till date has announced that only Deputy Prime Minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland will retain her portfolios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-chahal-case-canada-conducts-inquiry-into-violation-of-election-rules-101633066056472.html

Here’s how||A 24-year-old motorcyclist was taken to a hospital just in time after his smartwatch called for help following an accident. Mothership, a community news service, reported that on September 25, Muhammad Fitri was hit by a van in Singapore and he was knocked out and left stranded in a desolate street in the Ang Mo Kio area. Fitri was wearing an Apple Watch Series 4, which has a fall detection feature that notifies its wearers’ emergency contact and local emergency services if they are not responsive. The users can respond to the fall alert and if they are not in the condition to dismiss it, the watch calls for help.According to Mothership, Fitri’s Apple Watch detected a hard fall late in the evening and after he failed to respond to the hard fall alerts, it alerted his emergency contacts as well as emergency services who rushed to the spot and took him to the hospital. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) told Mothership that they were alerted to the accident at around 8:20pm and Fitri was taken to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.In June this year, a 78-year-old man from North Carolina in the US fell unconscious after a fall and his Apple Watch detected that he had fallen and was immobile. It called for help after 60 seconds later. A month later, a 25-year-old man was rushed into surgery after his Apple Watch's fall detection feature recognised the fall and alerted emergency services. He underwent brain surgery after subsequent CT scans revealed a fractured skull and multiple hematomas that were growing in size.The fall detection feature was introduced with Apple Watch Series 4 and is part of a biometric monitoring suite that covers heart health, blood oxygen levels, mobility, fitness among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/an-apple-watch-saved-a-singapore-motorcyclist-s-life-here-s-how-101633055625226.html

In a news briefing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that Pakistan must remember to uphold its equities and responsibilities with respect to terrorism in “that part of the world”. Kirby added that the United States is well within its rights to conduct airstrikes in Afghanistan as a means to curb the terror threat, even though its ground troops left the country over a month ago ending a 20-year war.Also Read | Pakistan involved in harbouring Taliban, must 'line up’: Blinken“We've been very honest about our concerns with Pakistan for a long time, about the safe havens that exist on their side of the border along that spine. And those concerns are still valid today,” Kirby was quoted as saying by the PTI news agency. He said that US leaders are keeping on their “candid conversations” with their Pakistani counterparts to make sure that as Afghanistan's neighbour, Pakistan continues to uphold its own “equities and responsibilities”.“I think it's important to continue to remind that the Pakistani people, likewise, have been rendered victim by terrorist threats that emanate from those groups and along that same border,” the Pentagon press secretary said.For context, Pakistan has for many years been under fire from political quarters across the globe for providing a safe haven to terrorist outfits, including al Qaeda, among others. Most recently though, the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan, backed by the United States, raised its concerns about Islamabad providing the Taliban terrorists with a safe haven and even medical help when needed.The Taliban later swept Kabul in a lightning-fast offensive and seized control of the state apparatus. Soon after, top military and intelligence personnel from Pakistan were seen scheduling meetings with the Taliban leaders, and many believed that Islamabad had no less of a role to play in the blitzkrieg, a move rendered in the hope of cutting a piece of the pie in Kabul and discomforting India in the process.Also Read | After Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, terror attacks in Pakistan highest in 4 yearsBut for all its ambitions, the Afghanistan manoeuvre could very well prove fatal for the Pakistani leadership; a recent report showed that terror attacks in Pakistan have increased to their highest level in more than four years after the US military withdrew from the war-torn land of Afghanistan and the Taliban seized power. According to data compiled by the South Asia terrorism portal, Pakistan saw at least 35 terror attacks that killed 52 civilians in August alone, the highest since February 2017. Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, now alleges that Afghanistan harbours the anti-Pakistani group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan—the Pakistani Taliban—and also the secessionist Balochistan Liberation Army.In its Thursday news briefing, the Pentagon took note of the rapidly evolving situation in the frontiers of Afghanistan and said that the US will continue to conduct drone strikes inside the war-ravaged country, in order to “protect the nation”. “We believe we have the authorities that we need to continue to protect the nation,” he said. “We have the authorities that we need to continue to defend our interests and the security of the American people there and around the world, and we're going to do that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-honest-concerns-about-pakistan-being-a-safe-haven-for-terrorists-101633051342709.html
01-10-2021||World||North Korea claims it test-fired new anti-aircraft missile in 4th round of weapons firings||North Korea said Friday it had test-fired a newly developed anti-aircraft missile in the fourth round of weapons firings in recent weeks, even as it pushes to reopen dormant communication channels with South Korea in a small reconciliation step.In September, North Korea resumed its first missile tests in six months but still offered conditional talks with Seoul in what some experts say is an attempt to extract concessions in its nuclear diplomacy with the U.S. Earlier this week, North Korea leader Kim Jong Un expressed his willingness to restore communication hotlines with South Korea in coming days to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.The Korean Central News Agency said the anti-aircraft missile test is “of very practical significance in studying and developing various prospective anti-aircraft missile system.”It said the test was aimed at confirming the practicality of operation of the launcher, radar and battle command vehicle as well as the combat performance of the missile.South Korea, Japan and the United States typically publicly confirm North Korean missile launches soon after they occur, but did not do so for Thursday's test, indicating it may not have been a major weapons test.While Kim said he intended to reopen inter-Korean hotlines during his speech at parliament, he also shrugged off U.S. offers for dialogue as a “cunning” concealment of its hostility against the North. He also reiterated the North's demands that South Korea abandon a “double-dealing attitude” over the North’s missile tests if Seoul wants to see the resumption of talks and major cooperation steps.South Korea has said it would prepare for the restoration of the hotlines, which it called necessary to discuss and resolve many pending issues. The cross-border phone and fax lines have been largely dormant for more than a year.Some experts say North Korea wants South Korea to persuade the United States to ease punishing economic international sanctions on it. Other say North Korea is pressuring South Korea not to criticize its ballistic missile tests, which are banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions, as part of its quest to be recognized internationally as a nuclear power.North Korea also recently has test-fired a new hypersonic missile, a newly developed cruise missile and a ballistic missile launched from a train. South Korea’s military assessed the hypersonic missile to be at an early stage of development, but experts say the two previous missile tests displayed the North’s ability to attack targets in South Korea and Japan, both key U.S. allies that host U.S. troops.The North's recent tests were in line with Kim Jong Un's earlier vows to introduce sophisticated weapons and enlarge his nuclear arsenal to defend itself against U.S. hostility — a reference to U.S.-led sanctions on the North and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul that North Korea believes are an invasion rehearsal.Nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington has been largely deadlocked since early 2019.North Korea hasn’t tested a long-range missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland for about four years, an indication it wants to keep alive its chances for diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-claims-it-test-fired-new-anti-aircraft-missile-in-4th-round-of-weapons-firings-101633051598706.html

The K-8 school was placed on lockdown and students were taken by bus to a nearby church to be reunited with frantic parents.Memphis police identified both the victim of the shooting at the Cummings School and the alleged shooter as 13-year-old boys, Assistant Police Chief Don Crowe said. Both were students at the school.The wounded child underwent surgery at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital and was expected to recover, officials said. Crowe said the shooting took place in a stairwell. Video footage showed there were no other students in the stairwell when the shooting occured, Crowe said.The suspect fled the school after the shooting, but later surrendered at a police precinct. He was expected to be charged with criminal attempt of first-degree murder and taken to juvenile court, Crowe said.Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, where the alleged shooter got the gun, and where on his body the wounded child was shot. School officials said Cummings performs random metal detector scans on students.“We also have to think, ‘How did a 13-year-old get their hands on a gun?'” Crowe said. "It's a question we all want the answer to. I'm not sure we'll ever find the full truth. But certainly, it begs of everyone to keep their guns secure."After the shooting, parents held umbrellas in a light drizzle and talked with each other as they waited for children to arrive at the church. Ebonnie Hayslett rushed to the school to make sure her two nieces were safe.“The worst news you could receive is a shooting at a kids school," she said. "My main concern was the kids being OK, the teachers, the faculty. No one wants to go pick up their kids and be surrounded by SWAT cars and police officers.”A school resource officer who was inside the building responded to the shooting and informed police about it, said Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray. A school nurse applied pressure to the child's wound to help stop the bleeding, Ray said.Students were lined up and taken out of the school into buses, which brought them to the church.Tempers flared briefly as parents lined up outside the church, demanding information about the shooting and pushing for the release of their kids. When the students were dismissed, some of them were crying and hugging their parents as they left the church.Ray said emergency procedures were followed closely. He praised teachers and staff for keeping the children calm and safe, and for using training from an active shooter drill held in early September.Ray became emotional while speaking with news reporters outside Metropolitan Baptist Church.“We’re doing all we can to keep our students safe,” Ray said. “We can’t allow our children to hurt from gun violence.”School board president Michelle McKissack acknowledged that the relatively young age of the detained student, 13, was shocking.A former TV news reporter, McKissack recalled covering the 1998 Westside Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas, which was committed by two boys ages 13 and 11. Four students and a teacher were killed, and 10 others were wounded.“It was very shocking today to find out that this was happening at a middle school,” McKissack said.The shooting is the latest in a rash of incidents in the past two years in which children in Memphis have been shot, some fatally.Dr. Barry Gilmore, chief medical officer at Le Bonheur, said more than 100 children have been treated for gunshot wounds this year at the hospital. He added that Le Bonheur was expected to surpass its single-year record of 135 child gunshot patients, set last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boy-shot-and-critically-wounded-at-tennessee-school-juvenile-detained-101633047513780.html
01-10-2021||World||Ecuador declares prison emergency after 116 killed in riot||Ecuador's president has declared a state of emergency in the prison system following a battle among gang members in a coastal lockup that killed at least 116 people and injured 80 in what authorities say was the worst prison bloodbath ever in the country.Officials said at least five of the dead were found to have been beheaded.Dozens of police and military vehicles, as well as ambulances, entered the prison eompound on Thursday. Helicopters flew over the area.There could be more bodies or seriously injured people in the prison, said Col. Tannya Varela, the national police commander.Hundreds of people gathered outside the crime lab in Guayaquil, hoping to collect the bodies of relatives they believed were killed in the prison. The prosecutors’ office said on Twitter that police were working to identify bodies.Henry Coral, a police official, asked family members to help speed the identification of bodies by telling authorities about any tattoo, scar or other distinguishing feature of prisoners believed to have been killed. Some bodies were mutilated or burned, making identification harder.President Guillermo Lasso decreed a state of emergency Wednesday, which will give the government powers that include deploying police and soldiers inside prisons. The order came a day after bloodshed at the Litoral penitentiary in Guayaquil that officials blamed on gangs linked to international drug cartels fighting for control of the facility.“It is regrettable that the prisons are being turned into territories for power disputes by criminal gangs,” Lasso said, adding that he would act with "absolute firmness” to regain control of the Litoral prison and prevent the violence from spreading to other penitentiaries.Images circulating on social media showed dozens of bodies in the prison’s Pavilions 9 and 10 and scenes that looked like battlefields. The fighting was with firearms, knives and bombs, officials said. Earlier, regional police commander Fausto Buenaño had said that bodies were being found in the prison’s pipelines.Outside the prison morgue, the relatives of inmates wept, with some describing to reporters the cruelty with which their loved ones were decapitated and dismembered.“In the history of the country, there has not been an incident similar or close to this one,” said Ledy Zúñiga, the former president of Ecuador's National Rehabilitation Council.Zúñiga, who was also the country's minister of justice in 2016, said she regretted that steps had not been taken to prevent another massacre following deadly prison riots last February.Earlier, officials said the violence erupted from a dispute between the “Los Lobos” and “Los Choneros” prison gangs.Col. Mario Pazmiño, the former director of Ecuador's military intelligence, said the bloody fighting shows that “transnational organized crime has permeated the structure" of Ecuador's prisons, adding that Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels operate through local gangs.“They want to sow fear,” he told The Associated Press on Wednesday, urging the government to temporarily cede control of the prisons to the National Police. “The more radical and violent the way they murder,” the more they achieve their goal of control, he added.Luis Hernández, an analyst on political and military affairs who was a general in Ecuador's army, said imprisoned gang members extend their control from prisons to the streets, managing debts, deliveries and other aspects of the illegal drug trade.Ecuador is a key transit point for drug trafficking organizations because of its good road infrastructure, three international maritime ports and two international airports, Hernández said.Ecuador's president said that care points had been set up for relatives of the inmates with food and psychological support. He added that a $24 million program to address the country's prisons will be accelerated, starting with investments in infrastructure and technology in the Litoral prison.The former director of Ecuador's prison bureau, Fausto Cobo, said that inside penitentiaries authorities face a “threat with power equal to or greater than the state itself.” He said that while security forces must enter prisons with shields and unarmed, they are met by inmates with high-caliber weapons.In July, the president decreed another state of emergency in Ecuador’s prison system following several violent episodes that resulted in more than 100 inmates being killed. Those deaths occurred in various prisons and not in a single facility like Tuesday's massacre.Previously, the bloodiest day occurred in February, when 79 prisoners died in simultaneous riots in three prisons in the country. In July, 22 more prisoners lost their lives in the Litoral penitentiary, while in September a penitentiary center was attacked by drones leaving no fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ecuador-declares-prison-emergency-after-116-killed-in-riot-101633047036094.html
01-10-2021||World||Joe Biden signs government funding bill to avert a shutdown||President Joe Biden on Thursday signed a nine-week stopgap funding bill that averts a government shutdown but fails to resolve the threat of a US default linked to the debt limit.The legislation was hastily passed by both chambers of Congress earlier in the day, and keeps funding levels for government departments and agencies flat until Dec. 3. Had it not been approved, parts of the US government would have begun suspending operations on Friday.The measure, however, doesn’t include a provision sought by Democrats to suspend the nation’s debt limit, after Republicans in the Senate blocked a version of the bill that included the debt provision. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that if lawmakers fail to raise the debt limit by about Oct. 18, the government may not be able to pay its bills, posing a dire risk to the US economy. The bill passed both chambers after Democrats dropped an earlier attempt to attach a debt-ceiling suspension to the bill in face of implacable Republican opposition to that measure. GOP senators blocked a version of the bill containing the debt ceiling language on Monday. The federal government would be kept open through Dec. 3 under the legislation. The bill also contains $28.6 billion for states recovering from hurricanes and wildfires as well as $6.3 billion to resettle refugees from the US war in Afghanistan.Republicans said the last minute stopgap vote was the fault of Democrats who had tried to tie the bill to the debt ceiling last week.“We did not need to be in the place just hours before the deadline,” said Appropriations Committee top Republican Kay Granger of Texas said on the House floor, noting she had voted against the bill last week over the debt issue.House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said Republicans are threatening the economy to play politics on the debt ceiling.“This is not about as some of colleagues would like to say about paying for spending going forward. This is about paying for the past,” she said. “Now is the time for us to raise the debt ceiling in order to do that.”Biden, in a message accompanying the White House announcement that he had signed the bill, thanked Granger, DeLauro as well as Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, “for their leadership.”Democrats urged GOP senators to consent to passing that via a simple majority with only Democratic votes. So far Republicans have rejected that, trying instead to force Democrats to undertake a weeks-long budget process to do the same thing. “Why do the Republicans refuse the raise the debt limit?” said Leahy, the Senate Appropriations Chairman.  “Why are they willing to make us look like idiots in front of the rest of the world? Why are they willing to put so many people out of work?”A stopgap spending bill is needed because none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for fiscal 2022 have been enacted into law amid a dispute between Democrats and minority Senate Republicans over spending levels for the military and domestic programs. Leahy said Wednesday he plans to unveil draft spending bills soon to jump-start the process of negotiating a solution before the new deadline. The stopgap bill did not include a proposed $1 billion for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system despite widespread support for the provision. The House has passed a standalone bill providing that funding, and the Senate may take that bill up soon according to senators in both parties. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, held up the provision over aid going to Afghanistan that he argues will benefit the Taliban government. Paul has said the assistance should instead be used to offset the cost of the Iron Dome system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signs-government-funding-bill-to-avert-a-shutdown-101633046436349.html
01-10-2021||India||Punjab government ropes in human rights lawyer RS Bains as special public prosecutor in sacrilege violence cases||Chandigarh: Human rights lawyer, senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains, has been named as special public prosecutor by the Punjab government to appear before trial courts and the Punjab & Haryana high court in the politically sensitive sacrilege violence cases of 2015, according to a government notification on Friday.The move appears to be part of the steps being taken to assuage state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu by newly appointed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi because it effectively keeps the state’s advocate general, APS Deol, out of the sacrilege cases.On September 27, Sidhu objected to the appointment of Deol because the senior advocate had in the past appeared for some of the accused in the matter, including former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini. Sidhu cited Deol’s appointment as one of the reasons for his sudden decision to quit as Punjab Congress president on September 28, only to change his mind after a meeting with CM Channi on Thursday. To be sure, Deol could not have represented the state in the matter in any case because of his previous appearances for some of the accused.Bains, son of former Punjab and Haryana high court judge Ajit Singh Bains. is a well-known criminal and constitutional lawyer and has appeared in cases from across the political spectrum, including cases of human rights violation in Punjab’s terrorism days in the 1980s. Bains has also been appearing against former DGP Saini in the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case of 1991 and for Ajit Singh, the main complainant in the Kotkapura firing case. Multani, a Chandigarh administration employee, was kidnapped and murdered in Chandigarh. The FIR was registered in May this year and now Saini is accused in the case. “It (the appointment of Bains) will ensure speedy justice in unfortunate sacrilege and firing incidents,” a government spokesman said adding, that the notification comes into effect with immediate force.However, former SIT member and AAP leader Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh questioned the appointment. “Another big fraud with Punjab and Punjabis by Congress government. Appointment of Special Public Prosecutor in Kotkapura -Behbal Kalan cases is only an eyewash. The intention of the government is very clear, to continue with the present advocate general,” he said.In 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhs, were reported from Punjab’s Faridkot. Days later protesters broke out in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan, where two people were killed in police firing. Three FIRs were filed over the desecration and two (one in August 2018, after the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission) over the police firing.The then Parkash Singh Badal government handed the cases to the CBI. But in 2018, after Congress came to power, the Assembly withdrew permission to the agency and formed an SIT from state police. In April, the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed that SIT’s report. The order triggered strong reactions from Navjot Singh Sidhu and other Punjab Congress leaders, who accused Singh of “incompetence” and declared him to be “hand-in-glove with the culprits”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-government-ropes-in-human-rights-lawyer-rs-bains-as-special-public-prosecutor-in-sacrilege-violence-cases-101633112799757.html

It is a commitment that we will work here - elections or not. We have now decided that we will fight 22-25 seats. In Goa, we used to opt for alliances that is why we could not expand,” said Rajya Sabha member and Shiv Sena spokesperson.“Even if we are sitting in the opposition, that will do. It is not a bad thing to be sitting in the opposition,” he added. Sanjay Raut said that the party, which used to contest a handful of seats in Goa each election without any success was held back because of coalition compulsions and hence could not expand its base both within Maharashtra as well as now in Goa. The Shiv Sena has contested assembly elections in the past, but the party performed poorly. In the 2017 assembly polls, Shiv Sena contested on three seats in alliance with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and the Goa Suraksha Manch. It lost all of them.The MGP was the only party among the alliance to win any seats.“All this while we focussed on alliances. In Maharashtra, our leader and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had to concede that we could not expand our base (in Maharashtra) because of the alliance for 25 years,” the visiting Shiv Sena leader added.Earlier the party claimed it had as much of a right to contest from Goa as some of the other parties with ‘national’ aspirations. “If Trinamool Congress from Kolkata can contest in Goa, then Maharashtra is right alongside. You have seen how well we have performed in Maharashtra,” Raut said, a reference to former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro’s induction in the Trinamool Congress, who has announced the decision that the TMC will contest on all 40 seats of Goa assembly in elections early next year.“The kind of work carried out by the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, we will work in the same way in Goa. Shiv Sena and Goa share an emotional bond,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-tmc-from-kolkata-can-fight-shiv-sena-outs-its-plan-for-goa-elections-101633111897129.html
01-10-2021||India||Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda expresses concern over multiple desertions||Chandigarh, Sep 30 (PTI) Senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Thursday expressed deep concern over recent developments in the party’s Punjab unit and multiple desertions, and said the party leadership should hold deliberations on these matters. Hooda, who is part of the G-23 group which wrote a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi last year seeking organisational overhaul, said weakening of the Congress is also not in national interest. “Why are such things happening? The party should do ‘manthan’. Efforts should be made to find a solution to these issues,” Hooda told reporters in Rohtak. When asked to comment on former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s emphatic statement that he will quit the party, Hooda said it is his personal decision. Commenting on multiple desertions recently, Hooda, who is also the leader of opposition in the Haryana Assembly, said not just in Punjab, in Goa too, a senior leader has left the party. “I am very much concerned about the future of my party. Weakening of the Congress is also not in national interest,” Hooda told a news channel. Former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro, who recently quit the Congress, had joined the Trinamool Congress on Wednesday and called for uniting various factions of the grand old party under the leadership of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to fight the BJP. Hooda said many others, including some senior leaders, have left the party. Amarinder Singh had resigned as the chief minister of Punjab on September 18 after accusing the Congress leadership of humiliating him. Earlier in the day, while some senior leaders of the party came out in strong defence of the top leadership and attacked Kapil Sibal and other G-23 leaders, Hooda came in Sibal’s support. Referring to the protest by Congress workers outside Sibal’s Delhi residence a day before, Hooda said this is not in line with the party’s culture. “If anyone has any difference of views, it should be brought up and discussed at the party forum,” he said. Sibal said at a press conference that the G-23 grouping is “not a Jee Huzur 23” and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands. Carrying ‘Get Well Soon Kapil Sibal’ placards and raising slogans against Sibal, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) workers had protested outside his Jor Bagh residence, saying they were “hurt” by his remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-bhupinder-singh-hooda-expresses-concern-over-multiple-desertions-101633111778515.html

This comes as the Punjab chief minister held a courtesy meeting with the Prime Minister earlier today.In an official statement following the meeting, Channi said that the Prime Minister told him that he would soon get this issue addressed in consultation with the Union ministry of food on the "top priority".Channi also said that the maiden visit to the national capital was "quite positive as it was held in a congenial atmosphere."The Centre on Thursday postponed the procurement of paddy in Punjab and Haryana till October 11 as the crop maturity is delayed owing to recent heavy rains. The announcement immediately sparked unrest among farmers in the two agrarian states and prompted CM Channi to ask PM Modi to intervene in the matter.Paddy procurement for 2021-22 Kharif marketing season in Punjab was to commence from October 1, while in Haryana it officially started from September 25.The Centre has fixed a minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,960 per quintal for grade ‘A’ paddy, while ₹1,940 per quintal for common grade paddy for 2021-22 Kharif marketing season.Punjab is a major contributor to the central pool as over 100 lakh tonnes of rice is procured from this state. From Haryana, less than 45 lakh tonnes of rice is purchased during a Kharif marketing season.Meanwhile, at the meeting, CM Channi also discussed the issue of farmers' protest with PM Modi and asked him to resume talks with the protesters. He asked PM Modi to open the Kartarpur Corridor at the earliest. The visa-free border crossing that connects the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan to the border with India is shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-row-pm-modi-assures-cm-channi-of-early-resolution-101633110761176.html
01-10-2021||India||Sunil Jakhar posts about truce, ceasefire amid Punjab row, says tweet is about LAC||Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Friday posted a cryptic tweet and requested people to not infer anything from the two line he wrote. "Is it finally truce now, armistice sealed? Or is it only a temporary ceasefire?" Sunil Jakhar posted adding that he was referring to the situation at the Line of Actual Control after the recent Chine intrusion into the territory. "No inference please," he added.Sunil Jakhar was replaced to make Navjot Singh Sidhu the chief of the Punjab Congress though the elevation did not solve the crisis and Captain Amarinder Singh resigned from the post of teh chief minister. Though Sunil Jakhar's name was doing the rounds as the next chief minister, he was ruled out for several reasons and one among them was his equation with Sidhu. Is it finally truce now, armistice sealed ? Or is it only a temporary ceasefire ? PS. I’m referring to situation at LAC after the recent Chinese intrusion into our territory. No inferences please.But making Charanjit Singh Channi the CM could not save the situation either as Sidhu resigned in protest against Channi's appointment decision. Following a meeting with Channi on Thursday, Sidhu has reportedly agreed to continue in his post as Channi is believed to have yielded to Sidhu's demands. With this, the immediate problem in the Punjab Congress has been addressed, while a bigger dissent in the Congress needs attention.A day before, Sunil Jakhar slammed Sidhu without naming him and said there has to be an end to the attempts of undermining the authority of the chief minister again and again. " Aspersions being cast on the selection of AG & DGP is actually questioning the integrity/competence of CM and Home Minister to deliver results. It’s time to put the foot down and clear the air," Jakhar said.When Sidhu announced to resign from the post of the party president in Punjab, Sunil Jakhar said it was not cricket. "What stands compromised in this entire ‘episode’ is the faith reposed in the (outgoing ?) PCC President by the Congress Leadership. No amount of grand standing can justify this breach of trust placing his benefactors in a peculiar predicament," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunil-jakhar-posts-about-truce-ceasefire-amid-punjab-row-says-tweet-is-about-lac-101633107598479.html

01-10-2021||India||Top court refuses to interfere with closing of Delhi’s private liquor vends under new policy||The Supreme Court on Friday closed the doors upon 260 private liquor vends in the Capital seeking a last-minute indulgence to remain operational beyond September 30, the cut-off date prescribed under the Delhi Government’s New Excise Policy for private liquor vends to shut shop.As per the new policy that will come into force from November 17, the Delhi Government had required all existing liquor vends to close by September 30. For the period from October 1 till November 16, only government liquor vends were allowed to remain open to cater to the festive season rush. After November 17, even the government liquor vends were to close.Demanding parity with government liquor vends to operate till November 16, the private liquor vends, mostly operating in malls, told the Supreme Court that during Diwali there would be chaos at the government liquor vends and to avoid this, it would be fair and just in public interest for private liquor vends to meet the Capital’s liquor demands.The Court was hearing separate appeals filed by Radinton Tradex Private Limited and one Harish Chauhan against interim orders passed by the Delhi High Court which had refused to stall the rollout of the new Excise Policy. The Delhi Liquor Traders Association had approached the Delhi High Court against the New Excise Policy which is still under consideration.The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “We are not inclined to entertain these petitions” and asked, “What larger public interest will be served if the private liquor vends are allowed to operate till November 16”.Senior advocates Vikas Singh and Sidharth Luthra appearing for the private liquor vends told the Court, “The rush outside government liquor vends is huge and this can be avoided if we are allowed to operate. Also, the state will earn revenue as we sell top quality liquor for which the customers in the Capital will go to neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.”The Delhi Government appeared on caveat and was represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi who argued that the old policy was meant to expire on September 30 to ensure smooth, seamless transfer to the new excise policy. In all, there are 849 liquor stores in Delhi of which more than 260 are privately-run, holding L7 and L10 licenses.

The state disaster response force (SDRF) also joined the search operation in the mountains. The 20-member naval expedition to Mount Trishul, located at a height of 7,120 metre, was flagged off from Mumbai on September 3. “Ten climbers had started their approach on the final leg to the summit this (Friday) morning, but they were caught in an avalanche short of the summit. While 5 of the 10 climbers are safe, search and rescue of the remaining five is in progress,” the official said. The 15 remaining members of the expedition are also involved in the search and rescue operation. Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral R Hari Kumar flagged off the expedition from INS Trishul. The event is part of the ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’ celebrations to commemorate 50 years of the victory in the 1971 war with Pakistan. The theme of the expedition is “Trishul Yudhpoat Se Trishul Parvat Tak” (from Trishul warship to Trishul Mountain). “The team assembled at Mumbai on August 15 and underwent physical fitness sessions, endurance training and trekking practice at Bhimashankar (in Maharashtra) to hone its physical condition and technical skills,” the navy said in an earlier statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-search-on-for-five-navy-climbers-after-avalanche-hits-expedition-in-uttarakhand-101633101877817.html
01-10-2021||India||India gives it back to UK, makes 10-day quarantine must for its nationals||NEW DELHI: UK nationals travelling to India will have to undergo 10-day mandatory quarantine even if they are fully vaccinated under reciprocal measures to be enforced from October 4, marking an escalation in the vaccine certification row between the two countries.The Indian side made the decision on Friday as the UK has not yet taken a call on accepting India’s vaccine certification more than 10 days after the conclusion of technical discussions that were expected to resolve the matter.The row erupted because Indians travelling to the UK will have to undergo a 10-day quarantine under new British travel rules that come into force from October 4. The UK’s failure to recognise Covishield, the Indian variant of the Britain’s AstraZeneca jab, had also given rise to allegations of vaccine racism. Though the UK recently included Covishield in its list of approved vaccines, the process for accepting India’s vaccine certification is expected to take more time. “India has decided to impose reciprocity on British nationals arriving in India from the UK,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. “Our new regulations will come into effect from October 4, and will be applicable to all UK nationals arriving from the UK,” the person said, adding that the measures will be enforced irrespective of the person’s vaccination status. The mandatory quarantine will have to be done at home or at the destination address. All UK nationals travelling to India will also have to undergo a pre-departure Covid-19 RT-PRC test within 72 hours before travel, another RT-PCR test on arrival at the airport, and a RT-PCR test on the eighth day after arrival. The health and civil aviation ministries will take steps to implement the new measures.The Indian move reflected the growing anger in New Delhi over the vaccine certification issue and appeared to be aimed at pressuring the British side to act for the speedy resolution of the matter.At the moment, British nationals flying to India have to undergo tests before their travel and on arrival, and undergo quarantine for seven days. However, people familiar with developments said the quarantine wasn’t being strictly monitored or enforced at many places, and the onus was largely on individuals to comply with a declaration signed at the airport. From October 4, the 10-day mandatory quarantine will be strictly monitored. The new measures will not apply to Indian nationals flying in from the UK. People familiar with developments said the British side was considering the issue and a resolution was expected soon. The British high commission spokesperson said the UK is continuing to work on expanding its travel policy to countries and territories in a phased approach. “We are continuing to engage with the government of India on technical cooperation to expand UK recognition of vaccine certification to people vaccinated by a relevant public health body in India,” the spokesperson said. Britain’s decisions on vaccine recognition are made by ministers, taking into account public health factors. The UK is looking at ways for people who have been fully vaccinated elsewhere to enter the country, and British visa rules are constantly reviewed to keep borders open while safely restarting travel. Visa applications from all categories of Indian travellers continue to be processed and they don’t need to be vaccinated to travel to the UK. A decision on the British side regarding acceptance of India’s vaccine certification requires further consultations between several ministries, including the Department of Health and Social Care and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The inclusion of the complete date of birth in vaccine certification done through India’s CoWIN platform has met a key requirement of the British side, the people said.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has asked states and Union territories that have international airports to enforce the restrictions on arriving UK nationals, and also alerted Integrated Disease and Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officials to monitor the home quarantines and the mandatory test on the 8th day. It has also alerted all Airport Health Organisations and Port Health Organisations that are in charge of screening arriving passengers.

British high commissioner Alex Ellis met the chief executive of the National Health Authority, RS Sharma, on September 2, and the second meeting was held on September 21 between the technical teams.Sharma has said the British side had made it clear that the “certificate process is not the issue”.The discussions focused on certification through the CoWIN app, the security of the system, data sharing between the two sides, and reconciling the CoWIN system with the NHS Covid Pass developed by Britain’s National Health Service (NHS).Ellis and Sharma also met on September 23, and the envoy described those talks as “an important step forward in our joint aim to facilitate travel”.The vaccine certification row has come at a time when overall bilateral ties are on the upswing and the two sides are working towards a trade agreement. It has become a problem as growing numbers of Indians, especially students, are travelling to the UK.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had warned on September 21 that India could consider imposing “reciprocal measures” against nations that don’t accept the country’s vaccine certification.India is currently in the UK’s so-called amber list of countries because of cases of Covid-19. The UK will phase out the red, amber and green lists when its new travel rules come into force on October 4.(Rhythma Kaul contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-orders-tit-for-tat-rule-for-uk-passengers-says-10-day-quarantine-is-must-101633100196496.html

The parcel train was operated by the Northern Railways. The train took off from Sanehwal in the Ferozpur division to Yeshwantpur in the south-western division.Indian Railways said this is the first time that the air-conditioned carriages which carry passengers were used for transporting cargo. “This is for the first time that AC passenger-carrying conventional ICF coaches have been utilised for transporting cargo,” the Railways said.The first AC parcel express train consisted of 20 2nd AC and 3rd AC coaches. “The first AC parcel express train consisting of 20 2nd AC/3rd AC coaches, carrying refrigerated cargo departed from Sanehwal, Ferozpur Division for Yeshwantpur today in South-Western Railway. This is for the first time ever that AC passenger carrying coaches (ICF/ Conventional passenger coaches) have been utilized for transporting cargo” the Railways said.The seats were removed from the passenger coaches to accommodate the cargo. It was done as a part of an experiment where the railways planned to use coaches which were sitting idle. Railway officials said that the cargo contained food items like edible snacks and chocolates. It also contained shipments of Maggi noodles, sauce as well as raw material needed for making chocolates. It also carried textile in the train coaches. The officials said that the total weight of the cargo was 121 tonne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-runs-first-ac-parcel-train-using-passenger-coaches-101633099885144.html
01-10-2021||India||Army chief takes stock of security in Ladakh sector amid LAC row||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh to carry out a security review in a sensitive sector where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a border standoff for almost 17 months and both sides are carrying out negotiations to cool tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), officials familiar with the development said on Friday. Naravane visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh where he was briefed on the prevailing security situation and the army’s operational preparedness, the army said in a statement. The army chief interacted with the troops and complimented them “for their resoluteness and high morale”, it added. The two-day visit came barely two months after the rival armies carried out the second round of disengagement in early August when both sides pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the friction points on the LAC. The breakthrough came after the 12th round of military talks held on August 2. Earlier, India and China wrapped up the disengagement process in Pangong Tso area in mid-February, with their armies pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the LAC after 45 years. (The last recorded incident when bullets were fired at the LAC was in October 1975, when the PLA ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead). Problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff. Even after the disengagement from Pangong Tso and Gogra, the two sides still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre. The dates for the 13th round of talks to discuss the other friction points along the LAC are yet to be announceThe visit also came a day after the army chief said at an event in Delhi that developments along the LAC in Ladakh added to challenges faced by the Indian military on the “active and disputed borders” in the western and eastern fronts. The “unprecedented” military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, he said while addressing the annual session of the PHD Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) on Thursday. Naravane’s Ladakh visit also came barely a month after multiple PLA patrols consisting of around 100 soldiers crossed the LAC in the central sector in Uttarakhand and damaged a foot bridge before they went back to the other side. The army chief also visited the Rezang La War Memorial in eastern Ladakh and paid homage to the bravehearts killed in action during the 1962 India-China war. The historic Battle of Rezang La, fought at heights of more than 18,000 feet, saw 124 Indian soldiers repel attack after attack by a numerically superior and better-equipped enemy in November 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-takes-stock-of-security-in-ladakh-sector-amid-lac-row-101633098276574.html

While UK's travel rules are for all and the differential treatment is only for India, it is the first time India has announced a mandatory quarantine for the vaccinated passengers of a country, people aware of the development said. Here is what the new travel rules mean> As of now, vaccinated Indians travelling to the United Kingdom will have to undergo a mandatory quarantine for 10 days, even if they are fully vaccinated by Covishield.> Covaxin, the other vaccine being administered in India, is yet to receive WHO approval and has not been approved by the UK. But the UK travel rules have made Covishied, Covaxin and no vaccine all equal as everyone will have to undergo the 10-day quarantine in the UK.India makes 10-day quarantine must for all UK travellers, despite vaccination> Covishield is a formulation of Oxford University's vaccine against Covid-19, manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India. India exported the vaccine to the UK which means many people in the UK got vaccinated with Covishield.> The UK side said it has no problem with Covishield and also mentioned the vaccine in the list of UK-approved vaccines. It said the problem lies with the vaccination certificate given in India.> India said its vaccine certificate has no problem and also agreed to add the full date of birth to the certificate.> India earlier said it will take reciprocatory measures to countries which will refuse to recognise its vaccines.> The new rules announced only for UK travellers starting from October 4 indicate that similar measures will be taken for travellers from other countries too if they refuse to recognise India's vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-what-india-and-uk-s-new-travel-rules-making-quarantine-must-mean-101633097255430.html
01-10-2021||India||BJP’s rebel north Bengal MLA quits party; more to follow, says TMC||Krishna Kalyani, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Raiganj in the North Dinajpur district of north Bengal announced on Friday that he was leaving the party, triggering speculation that he may join the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). Kalyani, an industrialist who stepped into politics by joining the BJP in January this year, had been speaking against the leadership for quite some time. On Friday, he held Debasree Chaudhuri, former Union minister of state and BJP Lok Sabha member from Raiganj, responsible for his decision. “She is conspiring against me. I came into politics to serve people. And now, I am being stabbed in the back. This is unacceptable. It is not possible for me to work with her. I am leaving,” Kalyani said. This was the second time in a month that he spoke against Chaudhuri. Kalyani made the announcement hours before the Bengal BJP felicitated its new state president Sukanta Majumdar, who represents the Balurghat Lok Sabha seat in the adjoining South Dinajpur district. Though Kalyani kept mum on switching sides, TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “He was unhappy in the BJP. There are more like him who are ready to quit. We don’t prefer indiscriminate induction but I think Kalyani will be welcomed if he wants to join TMC.” “Picture abhi baaki hai (there is more to the film),” quipped Roy, using a one-liner from a popular Hindi movie to indirectly refer to the four saffron camp MLAs who have joined the TMC since June. The last one to join on September 4 was Soumen Roy who was elected from the Kaliaganj seat in north Bengal. With this, the BJP’s tally in the 294-member Bengal assembly came down from 77 to 71. For the record, BJP outperformed the TMC in north Bengal in all recent polls. In the March-April assembly polls, the BJP bagged 30 of the 54 seats in the eight north Bengal districts although the TMC won 213 seats across the state. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats. In north Bengal, it secured seven of the eight seats. Debasree Chaudhuri could not be contacted but Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya countered Kalyani. “Unlike Chaudhuri, who is into politics for three decades, Kalyani is a newcomer. She has no reason to conspire against a novice. The BJP wants its members to stay together but if Kalyani wants to leave, he must do so after resigning from the assembly. People elected him as a BJP candidate,” said Bhattacharya. BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly, said, “Kalyani has been speaking against Chaudhuri and top state leaders for a long time. He is free to leave. The number of MLAs is not important to us. It is allegiance to the party that matters.” Kalyani had shocked the leadership after BJP national president JP Nadda appointed 41-year-old Majumdar as state president on September 18. Majumdar became the youngest state leader to hold the post that Dilip Ghosh, 57, had to vacate after a six-year stint. “Is he (Majumdar) mature enough to run the party across the state? I have doubts. The BJP would have benefitted if an experienced person was given the responsibility. The appointment should have been discussed. Not a single MLA was aware of the decision till it was announced,” Kalyani said on September 19. The BJP’s tally in the assembly came down from 77 to 75 immediately after the polls as two MLAs from north Bengal did not take oath to retain their Lok Sabha seats. The tally climbed down to 71 after four MLA joined the TMC. Three of them are from south Bengal districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-rebel-north-bengal-mla-quits-party-more-to-follow-says-tmc-101633096055959.html

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut during a press conference also promised that if voted to power the party will shut down the casinos in the state.Responding to the entry of the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party in Goan politics, Raut said that the coastal state is witnessing a ‘political carnival’. “Have heard that TMC is also fighting the polls in Goa. The political parties from Delhi and West Bengal are contesting in Goa. So many leaders are switching sides. What we are currently witnessing in Goa is a political carnival,” Raut was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Speaking of his party’s chances, Raut said that the Shiv Sena is connected to Goa, emotionally as well as culturally, and has a strong base in the state. Raut was also confident that Sena will be able to win majority seats due to its base in the state. “We are emotionally and culturally connected to Goa. We have our own base and we are sure to win majority seats with it,” Raut said. He added that the Sena has been present in Goa for the last two years.Regarding any alliances with Congress similar to Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi, Raut said that the politics of both states are different.Among other promises Sena made, one was to reduce the working hours of Goa’s women police officials.Raut, however, said that Sena’s electoral move will not cause any division of opposition votes.Goa’s elections which are due in February next year will see a multipolar contest with the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) gearing to give the BJP a tough fight. Goa’s veteran Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro announced that under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, the TMC will contest on all 40-assembly seats. AAP chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also promised free power up to 300 units per month and 80% jobs for locals if his party is voted to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-elections-shiv-sena-to-contest-22-25-seats-will-shut-down-casinos-if-voted-101633095519280.html
01-10-2021||India||Amarinder Singh hits out at Congress Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat||Former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday rejected Congress Punjab in charge Harish Rawat’s statement that the former was not humiliated. “Three weeks before stepping down as chief minister, I offered my resignation to... (Congress chief) Sonia Gandhi but she had asked me to continue,” said Singh. He added the humiliating manner in which he was pushed into resigning just hours before the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) meeting that was “clearly convened” to oust him was a matter of public record. “The world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet Rawat is making claims to the contrary,” he said. “If this was not humiliation then what was it?” He said Rawat should put himself in the former’s shoes. Singh added then perhaps Rawat would realise how insulting the entire affair was.He recalled that Rawat himself publicly stated after meeting him that he was satisfied by his government’s track record vis-a-vis the 2017 poll promises. Singh said Rawat categorically said, as recently as September 1, that the 2022 elections would be fought under the former’s leadership and the high command had no intention of replacing him. “So how can he now claim that the party leadership was dissatisfied with me, and if they were, then why did he deliberately keep me in the dark all this time?” He rejected Rawat’s remarks that the former seemed to be under pressure. Singh said the only pressure he had been under for the past few months was that of his own loyalty to the Congress because of which he continued to tolerate insult after insult. “If the party did not intend to humiliate me then why was Navjot Singh Sidhu allowed to openly criticise and attack me on social media and other public platforms for months? Why did the party give the rebels, led by Sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? Why was no cognisance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins I handed over to the party through the four and a half years I was in the saddle?” Singh questioned why Congress was allowing Sidhu even now to hold the party to ransom and continue to dictate terms. “What is the pressure he exerts on the party leadership that they are so defenceless against him and are allowing him to have his way even to the cost of the Congress’ future in Punjab?” Responding to Rawat’s comment regarding his secular credentials, Singh said even his worst critics and enemies could not doubt his integrity in this regard. “But I am no longer surprised that a senior and seasoned Congress leader like Rawat is questioning my secular credentials. It is quite evident that I am no longer trusted and respected in the party that I have served loyally all these years.”Singh denied Rawat’s claim the former refused to meet his successor Charanjit Singh Channi after the latter’s swearing-in. He added Channi called him up on the day of his swearing-in and was supposed to come over but failed to turn up.As for not taking Rawat’s calls, Singh said it was all humbug. “We spoke just a day before the CLP meeting was called. Rawat told me then there was nothing in the works and even claimed he had not seen any letter sent by 43 MLAs. I am shocked at the blatant way in which he is now lying about this.”Singh said as a chief minister twice and state Congress chief thrice, he worked with stalwarts like Pranab Mukherjee, Moti Lal Vohra, Mohsina Kidwali, Meira Kumar and Shakeel Ahmed as Congress in-charge for Punjab. “I never had a single problem with any of them. I fail to understand Rawat’s behaviour and actions.”He dismissed as “total nonsense” Rawat’s remarks that he was “circulating the theory of humiliation” after meeting Union home minister Amit Shah. Singh pointed out he clearly said on the day of his resignation that he was being humiliated.As for the implementation of poll promises, Singh said contrary to “Rawat’s lies”, he fulfilled nearly 90% of the pledges made in the 2017 election manifesto. He called it a matter of record that could not be negated with “frivolous and baseless” statements.He said Rawat’s “outrageous claims” and allegations were clearly prompted by the pathetic situation the party now found itself in the state after being on a winning spree for four and a half years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-hits-out-at-congress-punjab-in-charge-harish-rawat-101633094556124.html
01-10-2021||India||Domestic flights of GoAir, 3 other airlines to operate from Mumbai Airport Terminal 1 from Oct 20||The domestic flight operations of four airlines are likely to shift to Terminal 1 of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) starting October 20. Adani Airports Holding Ltd., which took over the management of CSMIA from the GVK Group in July, has informed the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and other stakeholders regarding the decision.However, a spokesperson for the Mumbai airport said that the operations will be shifted only after the pending approvals are cleared. Once the required approvals are received, GoAir, AirAsia, TruJet and Star Air will shift their operation to Terminal 1.The domestic flight operations were herded to Terminal 1 in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and subsequent restrictions, which led to a decline in footfall. But the Covid-19 vaccination drive and relative control over the pandemic has boosted air traffic with the rise in demand.On Thursday, International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a statement that India and Russia were the only large markets to show a month-to-month improvement compared to July 2021."India’s domestic traffic reversed the trend, as demand fell 44.8% in August, improved from a 58.9% decline in July versus July 2019, owing to positive trends in new cases and vaccination,” the IATA said.Adani Airports Holding Ltd. has also mentioned the substantial increase in domestic passenger numbers in August as compared to May, HT has learnt. It said that the number of passengers at the Mumbai airport has increased due to confidence-building measures and the vaccination drives undertaken by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flights-of-goair-3-other-airlines-to-operate-from-t1-of-mumbai-airport-101633093569989.html

With 277 new fatalities, the death toll stands at 4,48,339, the ministry data revealed.The MHA on Tuesday issued a warning to all states and Union territories (UTs) against any reluctance over enforcing strict measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, and also extended the guidelines till the end of October. “Utmost vigil has to be maintained in respect of mass gathering events, so as to avoid any possibility of surge in Covid-19 cases,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote in a letter.India has so far vaccinated more than 89 crore eligible beneficiaries, including achieving the feat of administering Covid-19 vaccine shots to over 1 crore individuals in a single day, five times in a month. According to an earlier report by Hindustan Times, Union health ministry officials stated that the central government is planning to reach the nationwide vaccination coverage of 1 billion people by early October.Despite such developments, the delay in emergency approval of Covaxin – India’s indigenous coronavirus vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech, by the World Health Organisation (WHO), has caused concerns. However, Guleria on Friday said that they are “hopeful” the approval should happen soon “rather than…late” because all data have been submitted and studies have also been done.Also Read | Working with WHO to get emergency use listing for Covaxin: Bharat BiotechEmphasising the need for the approval, the AIIMS director told ANI that the move will “make travel easy…encourage people, especially those who have taken both shots of the vaccine to be able to travel abroad.”He added that the emergency approval of Covaxin is also required when the world has started moving out of the pandemic in order for those jabbed with the doses not needing to “quarantine or isolate at any place.”Guleria’s statement comes hours after Australia declared Covishield as the “recognised vaccine” for international travellers as part of its move to reopen the world. The announcement was made via a statement issued by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and several of his ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-6-8-weeks-are-important-as-guleria-on-how-covid-cases-can-drop-101633092372237.html

During the meeting, the chief minister raised various issues concerning Punjab, including the farmers' protests that will complete a year in November. He urged the Prime Minister to resume dialogue with the farmers who are agitating at Delhi borders against the Centre's three agriculture laws."I asked the prime minister to resolve the matter of farmers' protest and resume dialogue with the protesting farmers. I demanded that the three laws should be withdrawn," Channi said, speaking to the media after the meeting.Channi also asked PM Modi to start paddy procurement after the Centre postponed it till October 11 over delayed crop maturity owing to recent heavy rains. "Procurement season usually begins in Punjab on October 1, but this year Centre has decided to begin it on Oct 10. I have requested him to start procurement now," Channi said.He requested the Prime Minister to open Kartarpur Corridor for devotees at the earliest. Kartarpur Corridor is a visa-free border crossing that connects the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan to the border with India. It is closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Dedicated to the 550th Parkash Gurpurb (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak, the corridor was inaugurated by the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in 2019. The corridor remained operational for only four months before governments of both countries closed it to curb the virus spread.The meeting between Channi and PM Modi comes in the backdrop of bitter infighting in the Punjab Congress. Early this week, Navjot Singh Sidhu stepped down as the chief of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, though reports said he will continue in the post as he has been placated.On Thursday, Amarinder Singh who resigned from the post of chief minister in September said he will leave the party due to the mistreatment by the high command. The Congress' veteran leader also clarified that he will not join the BJP.The crisis comes as the state is set to hold legislative assembly elections next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-meeting-with-pm-modi-cm-channi-asks-centre-to-resume-talks-with-farmers-101633092735611.html

The court said that all the restrictions it imposed in 2020 will remain this year.“This means the ban on the entry of visitors inside the Durga Puja pandals remains. The court had mandated putting up barricades outside the pandals while putting a cap on the number of puja committee members who can enter a pandal,” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee, an advocate.Durga Puja is the biggest festival in West Bengal. Even though the five-day Puja starts this year from October 11, the festival extends for more than a week every year. Mahalaya this year would be held on October 6 and the immersion process would continue till 17.Advocate general Soumendra Nath Mookherjee said the state government has no objections if the court imposes last year’s restrictions.Ruling Trinamool Congress leader Tapas Roy said: “Last year too, West Bengal celebrated a muted festive season. Several restrictions were imposed, and everyone abided by them. (Chief minister) Mamata Banerjee has said whatever measures were introduced last year would be enough and may be followed this year too.”Abhijit Chowdhury, a health expert who is a part of the state’s Covid-19 advisory panel, welcomed the court order. “We are still not out of the Covid-19 situation. Any lapse could trigger another wave. The government, puja committees, and citizens should all work together and maintain the protocols to prevent any surge.”The government on Thursday announced relaxation in the night curfew in the state between 11 pm and 5 am in view of the puja celebrations. It also said the existing restrictions in place to check the spread of Covid-19 have been extended till October 30.The Centre has directed states to enforce adherence to Covid-related guidelines, especially during the festive season. Large scale gatherings in fairs, festivals, and religious events and functions may lead to a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, the Union home ministry warned states in a letter on Tuesday.Clubs registered with the state government hold at least 36,000 community pujas across the state including 2,500 in Kolkata. Pujas are also held in housing societies and at residences. Women alone organise around 1,500 pujas.According to a study commissioned by the state government in 2018, the economic value of the creative industries that crop up around the puja is worth ₹32,377 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-muted-puja-this-year-too-as-calcutta-high-court-bans-entry-of-visitors-into-pandals-101633091136099.html

The former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh stressed that if the Congress is eliminated from the political canvas of the country, then the "democracy will be without a national opposition," news agency PTI reported.The remarks come as Congress is battling bitter infighting in Punjab, months before the assembly elections. Early this week, Navjot Singh Sidhu stepped down as the chief of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, though reports said he will continue in the post as he has been placated.On Thursday, Amarinder Singh said he will leave the party due to the mistreatment by the high command. The Congress' veteran leader also clarified that he will not join the BJP.Speaking in Dharamsala, Shanta Kumar noted the importance of Congress and said it is the "only national party in the country after the BJP." "The chariot of democracy moves on two wheels. One is the ruling party and the other is the opposition," Kumar also said as per PTI report.He further said that the oldest party which was once led by the likes of Nehru, Gandhi, and Patel, has now become a "joke" of late. The only treatment for Congress is to come out of the “slavery” of the Gandhi family, Kumar asserted.Speaking on the Punjab row, Kumar said Amarinder Singh should not leave the Congress but sit together with G-23 leaders like Ghulam Navi Azad, Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor to "fight for freedom" in the party and break out of the "bondage" of one family.The G-23 referred is a group of Congress leaders who had last year written to Sonia Gandhi, seeking an organisational overhaul of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-the-oldest-party-now-a-joke-bjp-leader-amid-congress-punjab-turmoil-101633090467160.html
01-10-2021||India||India makes 10-day quarantine must for all UK travellers, despite vaccination||India has announced a mandatory 10-day quarantine for all travellers coming to the country from the United Kingdom, irrespective of their vaccination status, people familiar with the development said. The measures come in response to the UK government's latest travel rules where Covishield is an approved vaccine against Covid-19 but India's vaccine certificate is not recognised. India's stern measure comes after the Indian government warned of ‘reciprocal measures’ to the UK government's differential treatment of India's vaccination.Despite their vaccination status, all passengers from the United Kingdom will have to undergo a mandatory quarantine upon arrival in India. In addition, they will need to produce the result of the RT-PCR test done within 72 hours before travel. After their arrival and on day 8, they will have to take the RT-PCR tests again. The mandatory quarantine can be done at home or at the destination address. These new rules are exactly in line with UK's travel rules. ‘Not because of CoWIN’: RS Sharma on UK quarantine rule for IndiansThe UK government recently revised its travel guidelines to be effective from October 4 and initially did not mention Covishield in the list of its approved vaccines. Then it included Covishield in the list but did not give approval to CoWin certificate which testifies the vaccination status of someone who has received the jab in India. This brings doubly vaccinated Indians travelling to the UK to the status of unvaccinated travellers and all alike will have to undergo quarantine in the UK if the vaccine certificate is not accepted.Several rounds of meetings took place between Indian and UK representatives and one was attended by National Health Authority chairman RS Sharma and UK high commissioner Alex Ellis. After the meeting, both expressed satisfaction and said there seems to be no problem regarding Covishield or the certificate. Reports said India is mulling to add the full date of birth on the certificate for people travelling abroad.However, the 'reciprocal' move indicates that the issue over Covishield has not been resolved.India strongly condemned the move of the UK government as it clarified that there is no problem with either the Covishield vaccine or the vaccine certificate. Covishield is a formulation of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine which India also exported to the UK and the certificate conforms to all standards stipulated by the World Health Organization, the government said.As the health ministry will enforce the new guideline specific to UK travellers, all states and UTs that have international airports and thereby may receive flights from the UK have been alerted. The integrated disease surveillance programme Officers in the States have been informed because they will be monitoring the home quarantine and the 8th day test. All port health organisations and Airport health organisations have been informed as they will also be a critical part of the implementation at the entry level. (With inputs from Bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-makes-10-day-quarantine-mandatory-for-all-uk-travellers-101633089737609.html
01-10-2021||India||‘Make him Congress president,’ says RJD leader in a swipe at Kanhaiya Kumar||The discomfort in the Rashtriya Janata Dal after Kanhaiya Kumar joined the Congress has begun to surface. Cracks have appeared in the relationship between the Congress and the RJD in Bihar after senior RJD leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Shivanand Tiwary took a swipe at Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar and Rahul Gandhi, after the former Left leader joined the Congress recently. Two days after former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar joined the Congress, Tiwary took a dig at Kanhaiya and dared the Congress to make him the national president as the post has been lying vacant. Tiwary had earlier too attacked the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi. Describing Kanhaiya “as an expert in the art of delivering speeches”, Tiwary said, “At one point of time Leftists were seeing their future in Kanhaiya Kumar. Now Congress is seeing its future in him. Congress should make him (Kanhaiya Kumar) its president. For the last two years, there is no permanent president in the party,” said Tiwary and added that Congress is looking at him to sail their ship out of the crisis. “He said in his speech at the time of joining that if the big ship does not survive, what will happen to the small boats? It was a historic statement,” he added. The veteran leader rubbished talk that the former student union leader poses a threat to Tejashwi Yadav. “During 2019 Lok Sabha elections, RJD’s candidate stood second in Begusarai. Kanhaiya Kumar was third. In such a situation, he hardly poses a problem to Yadav. He worked to defeat the RJD candidate in the Lok Sabha elections and in fact helped BJP by dividing secular votes,” he alleged. Tiwary, who had criticized Rahul Gandhi took a dig at him again and said that he had full sympathy with him. “Congress trusts outsiders more. The party has not been able to choose its permanent president for the last two years. He must first trust his people. A permanent chairman should be elected. I myself want Congress to be strong. This will strengthen the Grand Alliance,” said Tiwary. The discomfort in the RJD can also be gauged from the fact that even RJD spokesperson Bhai Birendra, MLA, refused to recognize Kanhaiya. Last year, Tiwary had taken a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and said that “he (Rahul Gandhi) is unable to inspire confidence in the public”. RJD’s criticism of Kanhaiya did not go down well with Congress, which alleged that Tiwary “was being guided by RSS ideology.” “Instead of strengthening the Grand Alliance, he is trying to weaken it by toeing a different ideology,” said Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-him-congress-president-says-rjd-leader-in-a-swipe-at-kanhaiya-kumar-101633088735997.html

Five states have already been released, in advance, the 2nd instalment amounting to ₹1,599.20 crore,” the release said.The Centre said that this has enabled the provision in the SDRF norms to be made so as to implement the guidelines issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on September 11 in compliance with the order passed by the Supreme Court on June 30.The government said the decision was taken as part of the government's initiative to facilitate state governments to have enough funds in their SDRF to deal with any emergency arising out of any disaster, according to the release.The Centre said that the state governments will now have ₹23,186.40 crore in their SDRF, including the share of the state government, during the financial year 2021-22. This is in addition to the amount of opening balance available in their SDRF.It said that the expenses will cover for providing relief on other notified calamities as well along with payouts to Covid-19 victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-approves-release-of-rs-7-274-cr-to-23-states-as-central-share-of-sdrf-101633087155528.html
01-10-2021||India||Amarinder Singh admits he was under pressure. ‘Of loyalty to Congress,' he says||Reacting to Harish Rawat's statement against former Punjab chief minister that Amarinder Singh seemed to be under pressure as he announced his decision to quit the Congress on Thursday, the Captain said the only pressure that he has been under is the pressure of his loyalty to the party for which he has put up with the humiliation all these days.A day after Amarinder Singh announced that he will resign from the Congress, public mud-slinging began with Harish Rawat, in charge of Punjab affairs, issuing a detailed statement of how Amarinder Singh was never humiliated, how he lost the support of the MLAs because of his ‘stubbornness’. The Captain too immediately responded to Harish Rawat's attack and said Rawat's statement proves that the party finds itself in a pathetic situation in Punjab. ‘Stubborn’ Amarinder Singh thought he does not need advice: Harish Rawat‘Why was Sidhu allowed to openly critise?’Countering Harish Rawat's claim that the Congress never humiliated Amarinder Singh, the Captain said why Navjot Sidhu was given the free hand to criticise the Congress government in the state. “Why did the party give the rebels, led by Sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? Why was no cognizance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins I handed over to the party through the 4 and a half years I was in the saddle?” Amarinder Singh said. Harish Rawat said the humiliation theory was something that will garner sympathy for Amarinder Singh who, as Rawat claimed, seemed to be under pressure after his Delhi visit. In reply, Amarinder Singh said Rawat will have t put himself in the shoes of Captain to understand the humiliation. He also said that the only pressure he was under was his loyalty to the party. He also questioned why Sidhu is still given the authority to hold the party to ransom.'Why you gave a statement saying you were satisfied with govt's work?'As Harish Rawat said Captain failed to implement even a single suggestion made to him by a Congress committee, Amarinder Singh asked why then Rawat himself made a statement claiming that he was satisfied with the government's track record.Amarinder Singh also denied allegations that he is not taking calls from Rawat and did not even meet Charanjit Channi, the new chief minister. “We spoke just a day before the CLP meeting was called. Mr Rawat told me then there was nothing in the works and even claimed he had not seen any letter sent by 43 MLAs. I am shocked at the blatant way in which he is now lying about this,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-admits-he-was-under-pressure-of-loyalty-to-congress-he-says-101633087403784.html

Media will be informed of the Government’s decision as and when it is taken,” Tuhan Kanta Pandey, secretary, DIPAM tweeted.Senior Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) officials told Hindustan Times that the process of opening the bid is being done and it is between four top airlines and ministry officials only. “Such big developments cannot be based upon sourced information. This is a confidential matter and is being dealt only by four senior officials,” said the MoCA official.MoCA has been taking active steps towards the airline’s privatisation. Recently, the evaluation advisor RBSA and transaction advisor EY (Ernst & Young) had reportedly given a presentation on Air India’s evaluation to the aviation ministry. After financial bids for AI disinvestment were submitted by Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director (CMD) of SpiceJet and Tata Sons on September 15, Tata Sons is reportedly said to acquire Air India as it is believed to have submitted a higher bid.Air India has control over 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports as well as 900 slots abroad.

Aligarh’s district medical officer said that efforts were being made to increase the number of hospital beds to accommodate more patients.“About 2,000 beds are currently available in the district and efforts are being made to increase it... Beds have been provided everywhere,” the district medical officer said, as quoted by news agency ANI.Top hospitals including Deen Dayal and Malkhan Singh District Hospital have run short of beds even as the city conquered the worst of Covid-19 infections. Earlier this week, the management at Deen Dayal Hospital decided to stop taking in more patients and instead referred them to the medical colleges. The hospital said that there was no capacity to admit any more patients.A similar situation unfolded at Malkhan Singh District Hospital, located in the heart of Aligarh, which has a maximum capacity of 200 beds in its wards. Due to a rise in viral fever cases, there has been a shortage of beds and patients are being referred to medical colleges, the hospital said.Aligarh was one of the 24 districts in Uttar Pradesh that was declared free of Covid-19 infections by the chief minister’s office last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-viral-fever-spike-in-up-aligarh-faces-acute-shortage-of-hospital-beds-101633082315577.html

While Harish Rawat made this comment referring to the Bargadi desecration issue and the other issues that the Amarinder Singh government was facing, Rawat also said how the Captain was controlling the state and the party from his farmhouse and never paid heed to the suggestions made by the Congress committees.Amarinder quits Congress, fresh U-turn by Navjot Singh Sidhu“There was a general perception throughout the state that Captain and the Badals are helping each other and they have a secret understanding. I was always politely suggesting him to initiate action on our election promises. At least five times I discussed these issues with Captain sahib but with no result,” Rawat said.  Rawat said the Bargadi issue was not deftly handled by the Captain and the Congress high command formed a three-member panel which submitted 18 points for implementation. There were drug issues, power tariffs etc as well in the recommendations. “Captain Amarinder Singh did not implement even one out of these eighteen points,” Rawat said.'Amarinder Singh didn't bother to telephone me'Harish Rawat said when there was a demand for a CLP meeting, he sent the message to Amarinder Singh through one of Singh's well-wishers, but there was no response from him. Amarinder Singh did not call Rawat, he claimed.“Then I suggested to the party high command, that if we delay the matter then many MLAs may form a separate group or may create some more problem for the party. It was then decided to call a CLP meeting. I then officially informed Captain Amarinder Singh that the party has called a CLP meeting and requested him to attend the meeting,” Rawat said.Referring to those 18 points that a Congress panel recommended for Punjab, Harish Rawat said that he discussed those points with the Captain and brought those 18 points to five points. “After this, 20 days passed, and we didn't hear anything from him. The Congress MLAs and ministers were getting restless,” Rawat said, explaining why Amarinder Singh lost the support of the MLAs.'Amarinder Singh did not bless Channi, refuses to meet me'Harish Rawat said Amarinder Singh was expected to bless Charanjit Singh Channi, the new chief minister. But he did nothing. “I tried thrice to meet him, even I used the services of some of our common friends for meeting him at his residence, but he denied meeting me. The newly appointed chief minister also asked for his blessing, and he said that he will call him for lunch or tea, but nothing has happened," Rawat said. 'Theory of humiliation to gain sympathy'Harish Rawat said the theory of being humiliated by the party comes to gain sympathy. “The humiliation-based sympathy politics may help a person, but it will not help Punjab.

Hansraj College and Jesus and Mary College (JMC) on Friday announced a 100% cutoff in two subjects for admission to their undergraduate programme.While Hansraj has set a cutoff of 100% in BSc (H) Computer Science and 99.75% in BCom (H) as well as Economics (H), JMC said that students not including Psychology in their best of four subjects while seeking admission in Psychology (H) will need 100% to clear the course. Ramjas College announced a 100% cutoff in three courses - Political Science, Physics and a combination of BA Programme.At 98.5%, Aryabhatta College has set its highest cutoff for Psychology (Hons) this is followed by 98% in BCom (Hons) and Economics (Hons).Several principals pointed out that the revised evaluation pattern for Class 12 students led to soaring college cut-offs.In the absence of final end-term board exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Class 12 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) results were prepared on the basis of the internal scores of classes 10, 11, and 12 in a ratio of 30:30:40.Around 220,000 students scored 90% and above marks in CBSE class 12 results this year and 70,000 of them scored around 95% or more. A senior DU official told HT that of the 2.5 lakh paid applicants this year, around 9,600 had scored between 99% and 100% this year. Every year, around 70-80% of the applicants are from CBSE-affiliated schools.Manoj Sinha, principal of the DU principals’ association and head of Aryabhatta College, said his college has increased the cutoff in the range of one to six percentage points.“Based on the response we receive under the first list, there might be some adjustments in the subsequent lists. Since around 70,000 students have scored between 95% and 100% this year in their CBSE results, principals are cautious and may refrain from going below 95% in most popular courses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/du-1st-cut-off-list-2021-hansraj-college-jmc-set-bar-at-100-for-2-subjects-101633080997207.html

Javed Akhtar on attack on Kapil Sibal's house||Poet, lyricist Javed Akhtar who was recently in news for comparing RSS with the Taliban on Friday condemned the attack on Congress leader Kapil Sibal's house in New Delhi and said those who attacked Kapil Sibal's house for expressing an opinion about the working process of the Congress party are the same who criticise Modi govt for “curbing the freedom of expression”. "Shouldn't Rahul Gandhi condemn these hooligans in the strongest words?" Javed Akhtar said.The 'hooliganism' outside Kapil Sibal's house following his comment that G-23, the group of rebel Congress leaders, is not 'Jee Huzoor 23' has effectively divided the party into two groups -- one who are questioning the high command and the other one which is supporting the high command.

MSP is a federally determined floor rate that is meant to serve as a price signal to farmers and traders.Legumes such as arhar or pigeonpea, grown across India, are a staple of millions. Short supply would frequently mean import bills worth ₹7000 crore annually. Spells of soaring prices were one of the reasons why Indians were paying the highest protein prices a decade ago.Average consumer inflation of four key pulses – pigeonpea, gram, urad, and moong – has stabilised around 8.8%, which still stokes food prices, but the country has not suffered a price spiral since 2019, price trends show.Experts say there were four high-price cycles between 2005 and 2017. The swing in prices showed a clear pattern taking hold. According to CRISIL Research, which established the pattern in a 2017 report, wholesale prices of pulses, measured by the headline wholesale price index, prices shot up once in three years.“In the last cycle, wholesale inflation ranged from 46.2% at its peak in November 2015 to -35.5% at the trough in November 2017,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist of the rating firm Crisil Ltd.There haven’t been such price peaks in pulses, especially after 2019, when pulses inflation soared to 20% in July that year.“A sustained increase in production because of policy push and procurement have tamed the price spirals. This is a lesson for other volatile items,” said Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.The year 2019 was an inflection point in output. Between 2019 and 2021 so far, India’s annual output of pulses grew 2 million tonnes on average to touch 23.6 million tonnes from 21.6 million tonnes in the preceding three-year period.Farmers tend to grow more of crops that fetched higher prices in the previous season and less of those where realisations were poor, a pattern known as the cobweb phenomenon in farm economics.So, low prices tend to lead to future scarcity, while better prices produce gluts. This was a key reason for the price spirals in pulses. Higher government procurement of pulses has managed to break this pattern in pulses, experts say.Procurement, or the government’s buying of pulses to build state-owned reserves, increased from 7.7% of production in 2017 to 13.6% in 2021. The government had set up a price stabilisation fund in 2015 to tame price volatility in food articles, including pulses. Federal spending under this fund went up from ₹48.5 crore in FY2016 to ₹996 crore in FY2021.“This has lent support to prices of pulses and helped reduce the volatility,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pulses-still-pricey-but-policy-helps-tame-inflation-spirals-101633078836675.html
01-10-2021||India||IAF officer alleges she was subjected to two-finger test. What does Supreme Court say?||A woman officer of the Indian Air Force (IAF) has accused her colleague of rape and alleged she was subjected to an illegal two-finger test to confirm the sexual assault, which has prompted the National Commission for Women (NCW) to say it violated a Supreme Court ruling as well as her right to privacy and dignity.NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma has also written to the IAF air chief marshal to take necessary steps and impart the necessary knowledge to the force’s doctors about the prevailing government guidelines and the Indian Council of Medical Research in 2014 terming the two-finger test unscientific. "The National Commission for Women is utterly disappointed and strongly condemns the action of Indian Air Force doctors conducting the banned two-finger test on the victim, thereby violating the Supreme Court's decision and also violating the right to privacy and dignity of the victim," the commission said reacting to a media report.The 28-year-old woman officer, who was allegedly raped on the Air Force Administrative College campus in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district, has said that she was made to "relive the trauma". “Only later did I find out that the two-finger test is not supposed to be done for a rape exam. This action made me nauseous enough to relive the trauma of being raped,” according to the first information report (FIR) she filed with the Tamil Nadu Police on September 20.Also read | NCW takes cognisance of reports about IAF offr being subjected to banned testThe controversial “per vaginal” or the two-finger test test involves a doctor inserting two fingers in the vagina of a rape survivor to detect if the hymen is present or not, and the vagina’s size and laxity. Doctors also check how habituated the woman who has been raped is to sexual intercourse and her sexual history.In 2013, the Supreme Court held that the two-finger test on a rape victim violates her right to privacy, and asked the government to provide better medical procedures to confirm sexual assault. A bench of Justice BS Chauhan and Justice FMI Kalifulla said even if the report of the two-finger test is affirmative, it cannot give rise to the presumption of consent on part of a rape victim.“Undoubtedly, the two-finger test and its interpretation violate the right of rape survivors to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity. Thus, this test, even if the report is affirmative, cannot ipso facto, be given rise to thepresumption of consent,” the bench said.Also read | IAF to take over probe into woman officer’s rape caseThe judges said rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity as they referred to various international covenants. “Medical procedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and health should be of paramount consideration while dealing with gender-based violence,” it said.“The state is under an obligation to make such services available to survivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should be taken to ensure their safety and there should be no arbitrary or unlawful interference with her privacy,” the bench said.The top court said that rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not re-traumatise them or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. “They are also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that respects their right to consent,” it said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-officer-alleges-she-was-subjected-to-two-finger-test-what-does-sc-say-101633075988623.html

While the next phase of Mission AMRUT will focus on ‘increasing sewage and septic management, making cities water safe’ and ensuring that no sewage drains in rivers.PM Modi lauded children and youth for being mindful of maintaining cleanliness.“I am happy to note that our generation has taken the initiative to strengthen the cleanliness campaign. Toffee wrappers are no longer thrown on the ground but kept in pockets. Today, children remind elders not to spread litter,” he said.The prime minister said that India is processing about one lakh tonnes of waste every day which was less than 20 percent when the campaign started in 2014.“Today we are processing about 70 percent of daily waste. Now we have to take it to 100%,” he said.As per the statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, “In line with the vision of the Prime Minister, SBM-U 2.0 and AMRUT 2.0 have been designed to realize the aspiration to make all our cities ‘Garbage Free’ and ‘Water Secure’. These flagship Missions signify a step forward in our march towards effectively addressing the challenges of rapidly urbanizing India and will also help contribute towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030”According to the press release, SBM-U and AMRUT have contributed significantly to improve the urban landscape during the last seven years. The government said that the two flagship Missions have augmented the capacity to deliver basic services of water supply and sanitation to the citizens.“All urban local bodies have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) and 70% solid waste is being scientifically processed now. AMRUT has been ensuring water security by adding 1.1 crore household water tap connections and 85 lakh sewer connections, thus benefiting more than 4 crore people,” the statement added.SBM-U 2.0 envisions to make all cities ‘Garbage Free’ and ensure grey and black water management in all cities. The Mission will focus on source segregation of solid waste, utilizing the principles of 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), scientific processing of all types of municipal solid waste and remediation of legacy dumpsites for effective solid waste management. The outlay of SBM-U 2.0 is around ₹1.41 lakh crore.AMRUT 2.0 aims to provide 100% coverage of water supply to all households in around 4,700 urban local bodies by providing about 2.68 crore tap connections and 100% coverage of sewerage and septage in 500 AMRUT cities by providing around 2.64 crore sewer/septage connections, which will benefit more than 10.5 crore people in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-swachh-bharat-mission-urban-2-0-amrut-20-101633073136112.html

At the launch event, Prime Minister Modi said that the two programmes constitute an important step toward fulfilling the dreams of social reformer Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. “It is our privilege that today's programme has been organised at the BR Ambedkar centre,” Modi said. “He believed that urban development was pivotal to equality.”The Prime Minister said that with the Swachh Bharat 2.0 mission, his government is aiming to make the urban areas garbage-free. “With this second phase, we are also aiming for sewage and safety management, making cities water-secure and ensuring that the dirty drains do not merge into the rivers,” he said. “The garbage mounts in cities will be processed and removed completely as part of the SBM-U second phase.”Presumably taking a dig at his political rivals, the Prime Minister then said, “One such garbage mountain has been in Delhi for long, it's also waiting to be removed.”Moving on to talk about the humongous amount of waste products that the country processes each day, Modi said, “Today, India is processing about 1 lakh tonnes of waste every day. When we started the campaign in 2014, less than 20 per cent of the waste was being processed. Today, we are processing about 70 per cent of the daily waste; the next step is to take it to a complete 100 per cent.”The Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 envisions a plan to make all cities garbage-free by ensuring grey and black water management in all cities except those covered under AMRUT, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said.

This latest weather alert for Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Gujarat comes after Cyclone Gulab made landfall in the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on September 26, claiming the lives of three people.According to the IMD bulletin, the deep depression that has now intensified into Cyclone Shaheen lies near Pakistan and Iran besides India. As of 5.30am on Friday, Shaheen lay about 400km west-northwest of Devbhoomi Dwarka in Gujarat, 260km south-southwest of Pakistan’s Karachi, and 530km east-southeast of Chabahar Port in Iran. The arrival of Shaheen is an outcome of the remnant of Cyclone Gulab – deep depression, weakening into a depression, only to intensify into a new cyclone over the Arabian Sea. Earlier, IMD cyclones in charge, Sunitha Devi told Hindustan Times that chances of remnants of Cyclone Gulab turning into a new cyclone “are less,” but the possibility cannot be ruled out.Meanwhile, the additional well-marked low-pressure area over south Bihar and its neighbouring state Jharkhand now lies over southwest Bihar and its neighbourhood. The IMD has already stated that the ongoing monsoon is expected to start its withdrawal process from certain regions of northwest India from October 6 onwards. This is marginally later than the typical time – September 17, with monsoon withdrawing from western corners of northwest India on September 28 last year.Cyclone Gulab has so far lashed several states including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal.Here are the latest IMD alerts for states that will get very heavy rainfall due to the approaching Cyclone Shaheen:1.     The IMD bulletin predicted isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall over Bihar, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, and Sikkim on October 1 and 2. Extremely heavy downpour – more than 20cm of rainfall, is very likely in isolated regions in Bihar on Friday.2.     The weather department has further predicted that rainfall activity will increase over south peninsular India from October 1 onwards, thereby bringing heavy rainfall over Tamil Nadu, Kerala, coastal and south interior Karnataka between October 1 and 4. Tamil Nadu is also likely to receive very heavy rainfall in isolated regions between October 2 and 4.3.     The IMD has cautioned fishermen against venturing out into the northeast Arabian Sea as well as along and off Gujarat coast in the subsequent 12 hours. The same alert has been issued for fishermen over north and adjoining central Arabian Sea, along and off Pakistan-Makran coasts, and the Gulf of Oman till the morning of October 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seven-states-to-see-very-heavy-rainfall-due-to-severe-cyclone-shaheen-till-oct-4-101633070977134.html

Singh added that Shah ensured he did not face any problem during their journey, even though elections were underway in Gujarat at the time, mentioning that all this came despite the fact that he has been their “biggest critic.” “They found [a] way for us through the mountains and also arranged food for all of us,” the Congress leader noted about the RSS workers.Addressing the audience during the launch of Narmada Ke Pathik—a book written by Singh’s long-time associate OP Sharma—the Congress leader talked about his journey on foot he and his journalist wife Amrita undertook along the banks of the Narmada in 2017. “A forest officer arrived, and you will be surprised to know that he told me that Amit Shah had directed him to fully cooperate with us,” Singh was quoted as saying by PTI. Hailing Shah’s gesture during Singh’s more than 3000-km journey that lasted six months, the Congress leader said that it was an example of “political coordination, adjustment and friendship which has nothing to do with politics and ideology.” The Congress veteran also said although he hasn’t met Shah to date but he has expressed his gratitude to the BJP leader through “proper channels.” Singh added that RSS workers, who “had orders” to meet him, arranged the stay for his group at a Manjhi Samaj Dharamshala for a day, where the hall had pictures of RSS stalwarts Keshav Baliram Hedgewar and Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar hung on the walls. Notably, Singh’s group comprised a leader of BJP’s youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and three other BJP workers, according to the PTI report.The reason behind mentioning such details of the journey, Singh noted is to let people know that religion and politics are different and that he took help “from all” during his Narmada Parikrama – adding that the BJP leaders and the party’s youth wing leader have now become an inalienable part of his ‘Narmada family’. The former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh also recounted that the late spiritual leader Daddaji had asked his follower and Bollywood actor Ashutosh Rana to make arrangements for a community feast at Barman Ghat in the state for Singh and his group, PTI reported.Singh’s praises for Shah and the RSS come only days after the former claimed that the BJP and RSS have been creating divisions among people for ages. “Time has come when all the parties, who are against the ideology of BJP and Sangh come on one platform,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He spoke at a protest organised in Bhopal on September 26, which saw the participation of as many as 19 opposition parties. In the same event, a video of the Congress veteran saying that RSS-run Saraswati Shishu Mandir schools sow seeds of hatred towards religion among children, also went viral, inviting sharp criticism from the BJP.It also prompted the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to write to the Madhya Pradesh DGP Vivek Johri for initiating an investigation into the matter and submit a report. NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo has also written to Singh, seeking an explanation over his statement that “appear to hurt the honour and character of all children studying” in the schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-friendship-why-digvijaya-singh-heaped-praises-on-amit-shah-rss-101633065891961.html

He had also stayed away from two major party events along with MLAs, mainly from the Garo Hills region.Sangma had earlier denied the news of his recent meeting Trinamool Congress national general secretary and party supremo Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee in Kolkata. However, buzz over the switchovers has been gaining traction following the visit of Sushmita Dev, who too had moved on from the Congress in search of greener pastures in the Bengal ruling party, to the hill state.If Sangma finally switches camp, several other MLAs may also desert the Congress. A report in News18 said Sangma may make a final announcement after holding talks with Trinamool leaders in Meghalaya.Also read | BJP is the target, says Faleiro after joining TMC. Why it may hurt Cong in GoaThe Trinamool Congress has been on a recruitment-cum-paoching spree ever since the party romped back to power in Bengal for the third straight term.

Even some BJP leaders, including former Union minister Babul Supriyo, have made the switch.On Wednesday, former Goa chief minister and senior Congress leader was inducted into the party in Kolkata. (With inputs from bureau and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exmeghalaya-cm-mukul-sangma-may-join-tmc-with-a-dozen-congress-mlas-101633066075875.html

The by-polls in the state are being held six months after the assembly elections in March-April. Gossaigaon and Tamulpur fell vacant after the lawmakers representing them died of Covid-19. By-polls were necessitated in Mariani, and Thowra as Congress representatives resigned to join the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) lawmaker vacated the Bhabanipur seat to join the BJP. The Majuli seat, which former chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal represented, is also vacant. But it will go to by-polls later as Sonowal, now a Rajya Sabha member, resigned from the seat after the by-polls schedule was announced.BJP’s Assam chief Bhabesh Kalita said they will hold a meeting on Saturday to discuss the by-polls and plan to contest all five seats along with their allies. He added the BJP could contest four seats and leave one seat for its alliance partner even as the final decision is yet to be taken. “For this round of elections, AGP (Asom Gana Parishad) would not be fielding any candidate. ...we are confident of winning all five seats.”The BJP won 60 seats in this year’s assembly polls, while allies AGP got 9 and United Peoples’ Party Liberal 6 in the 126-member House. The Congress managed to win 29 seats, AIUDF 16 and Bodoland Peoples Front 4. This Congress-led Grand Alliance has since disintegrated as the BJP has emerged stronger.State Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah said they were scheduled to have a meeting on Friday to discuss the by-polls. “We have received 48 applications to date for the five seats. The list of candidates would be announced within the next few days.” He called defections an unhealthy trend and asked voters to teach a lesson to defectors. “We are hopeful of retaining both seats that we lost and even gain some more.”The Congress is likely to contest four of the seats and leave one for Asom Jatiya Parishad whose chief Lurinjyoti Gogoi is expected to contest from Mariani.AIUDF leader Md Aminul Islam said they will field candidates for Bhabanipur and Gossaigaon seats. “We have won Bhabanipur three times in a row and will win it again,” he said. “In Gossaigaon, the common opposition candidate had won. Our party emerged as the second-largest party in three elections prior to the last assembly polls. We are confident about this seat too.”Akhil Gogoi’s Raijor Dal will contest two of the five seats. It has named its candidate for the Thowra seat and is also planning to field a candidate from Mariani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parties-gear-up-for-by-polls-in-assam-101633065156785.html

Students belonging to the Dalit community were reportedly made to sit in different queues while being served midday meals at the school in Gaderi village.An FIR has been registered and the school principal has been suspended. A parent has also accused the principal of beating her pupils.However, the principal, Kusum Soni, has now registered a complaint against the village head for creating a ruckus on the school premises and locking the gates, while refuting the allegations against her.“As far as the false allegations are concerned, one Pawan Dubey, claiming to be the village head's representative, had come here, pushed everyone out, locked gates, clicked the school's pictures and posted the same on social media. I have filed a police complaint,” Soni was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The village head, Vinay Kumar Jaiswal, said parents and students had met him to complain about the issues during meals at the school. “I went to the school, but could not find the teacher there. It was told she does not come on time and does not take care of the students,” Jaiswal said.Meanwhile, a detailed probe is underway after the FIR was registered against Soni under relevant sections of the SC/ST Atrocities Prevention Act.When the matter came to his knowledge, district magistrate Arun Kumar ordered an initial probe by the Basic Siksha Adhikari (BSA), who suspended the principal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-students-made-to-sit-separately-for-meals-in-amethi-village-probe-on-101633064747438.html
01-10-2021||India||PhD not mandatory for assistant prof recruitment for this year: Govt||The Centre has decided to put on hold the plan to make PhD a minimum qualification for recruitment of assistant professors for this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2018 set the criteria for recruitments for entry-level posts at universities and colleges. It had given a three-year window to candidates to complete their PhDs and asked all universities and colleges to start applying the criteria for recruitment from the 2021-22 academic session. Due to the pandemic, many candidates could not complete their PhDs and were appealing to the government to relax the eligibility this year.“The government has decided to put on hold the mandatory PhD requirement for assistant professors post for this year. We were receiving a lot of requests from candidates who wanted to apply for the post but were unable to fulfil their PhD requirement,” Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.Candidates with postgraduate degrees, who have cleared the National Eligibility Test, will continue to remain eligible for recruitments to the post. “The UGC will soon release a circular to all higher education institutions regarding this decision. It will help colleges and universities to quickly fill all the vacant seats,” said an official, who did not want to be named.In September, Pradhan asked all the central universities to fill the 6000-odd teaching vacancies by the end of October. Abha Dev Habib, a member of the Delhi University Teachers’ Association, said, “This will help the ad hoc teachers in the university departments whose reappointments were kept pending due to this mandatory PhD clause.”DUTA representatives on September 15 met UGC officials and raised this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phd-not-mandatory-for-assistant-prof-recruitment-for-this-year-govt-101633064015476.html
01-10-2021||India||Congress to set up coordination committee to tackle Punjab crisis. Key points||Punjab will soon have a coordination committee that will be consulted on all major policy matters and decisions of the government in the state, which has been witnessing turmoil in the ruling Congress party. The decision to form the coordination committee for the better functioning of the state government was taken after a meeting of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was upset over the appointments made by the new government and resigned from his post two days ago, on Thursday.According to an official, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) is expected to make an announcement about the committee within 24 hours. People familiar with the matter have said that the panel is likely to be headed by a central leader and may comprise Channi, Sidhu and a third leader for better coordination between the party and the state government. “After the constitution of the new government, I thought my job was done but then this new situation developed. Things will be okay soon. It is just a matter for 5 to 7 days,” Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat told reporters on Thursday.Also read | ‘Everything's fine’: Punjab minister after Sidhu-Channi meeting to avert crisisA senior leader said that Navjot Singh Sidhu will continue as Congress Punjab unit president. Sidhu, miffed with not having a say or being consulted in several key decisions, has also been demanding the removal of director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and advocate general of Punjab APS Deol. “As for the two appointments, it has been decided that a panel of IPS officers will be sent to the UPSC as per the procedure laid down by the Supreme Court. Till then, Sahota will continue and the new DGP will be named from among the three names received from the commission. The issue of AG’s will be decided after a discussion in the coordination panel,” a person familiar with the development said.Also read | Punjab govt sends panel of 10 officers to UPSC for DGP’s postSidhu was also said to be angry with the induction of former minister Rana Gurjit Singh into the cabinet. “DGP IPS Sahota was head of SIT investigating Beadbi case under Badal govt, he wrongfully indicted two Sikh youth for sacrilege & gave clean chit to Badals. In 2018, I along with INC Ministers, then PCC Pres & present Home minister assured them of our support in fight for Justice (sic),” he tweeted ahead of the meeting on Thursday.After Sidhu’s public criticism of the decision taken by Channi, former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and senior Congress leader Sunil Jakhar hit out at him. “Sidhu should run the party and let Channi run the government. There should be no interference. They can talk to each other, but it is the CM who runs the government. I was CM for nine-and-a-half years and had several state chiefs during that period. We used to discuss, but I never faced the kind of situation he (Sidhu) is creating,” Singh said.Also read | The Congress leadership made a mistake with Sidhu. The party is paying the priceJakhar, the former Punjab Congress president, tweeted to put his view forward. “Put an end to attempts to undermine the authority of the CM time and again. Aspersions being cast on selection of AG and DGP are actually questioning the integrity/competence of the CM and home minister to deliver results. It’s time to put the foot down and clear the air,” he tweeted.Sidhu was made PCC chief by the central leadership in July to stem the infighting in Punjab Congress. However, Sidhu announced his resignation on Twitter on Tuesday, just 72 days after he was appointed the Punjab unit chief, plunging the Congress into a fresh crisis in the poll-bound state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-set-up-coordination-committee-to-tackle-punjab-crisis-key-points-101633060368924.html
01-10-2021||India||Delhi interlocutors find Captain raring for a political fight||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh may have discussed the farmers' issue with Union home minister Amit Shah and shenanigans of Pakistan with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, but his Delhi interlocutors were convinced that the veteran Sikh regiment Captain was raring for an electoral fight in the upcoming state assembly elections and avenge his humiliation at the hands of Congress party.Like a true soldier, Captain has announced his plans to quit the Congress party and defined his targets including state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for his next innings. As the former CM has made it clear that he is not joining the BJP, it is quite evident that Captain Amarinder Singh will float his own regional political outfit as his interlocutors found that there was a lot of fight left in the Punjab leader.It is quite obvious that Captain’s new innings will be woven around Fauji-nationalist plank, which will show Sidhu’s love and admiration for across the border Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan army chief Qamar Jawed Bajwa in sharp contrast. The former Punjab CM has already identified Sidhu as his political adversary and has announced that he will not let the former cricketer win the forthcoming Assembly election.With the Congress party in ferment nationally as well in Punjab, Delhi will be keenly watching if state party leaders’ rebel against the high command’s over the top accommodation of Sidhu and join hands with former Punjab CM. As late BJP leader Arun Jaitely, once the political mentor of Sidhu, found out when he contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar against Amarinder Singh, the State Congress President is politically very ambitious and will go to any lengths to achieve his goal. That Sidhu will not play second fiddle to anyone in politics to achieve his objective is known to the top BJP leadership and Captain Amarinder Singh. To this extent, Sidhu is mercurial or unstable as Captain describes him and non-compromising when it comes to his personal political ambitions. Just as Captain likes to delegate work while running the political big picture, Sidhu’s capacity to lead an already fragmented Congress party in Punjab is still untested.To add to the Congress party’s discomfort are statements from senior leaders like Kapil Sibal and Manish Tewari, both from Punjab, criticising the way Captain was unceremoniously removed from the post of CM. The Congress demonstration against Kapil Sibal is also a warning to other members of the G-23 to refrain from questioning the party high command.While the Punjab electorate is still to recover from 10 years of Badal rule in the state, the former Punjab CM has left his anti-incumbency to the Congress party under Charanjit Singh Channi and Sidhu with his political and personal credibility intact. In contrast to the political theatrics of Sidhu, Captain is a steady electoral player without any song and dance. He may not address five political rallies in a day during the election campaign but always has the pulse of the people.The BJP, on the other hand, may not have the capacity of outright winning Assembly seats due to its support for farm laws but has both its cadre and support intact to tip the election away from the Congress and the AAP.All eyes are now on Captain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-interlocutors-find-captain-raring-for-a-political-fight-101633061571159.html

01-10-2021||India||"I'll do a Bhajpa here...': Abhishek Singhvi urges J&K Lakes Authority to change its name. Here's the likely reason||Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi has requested the Jammu and Kashmir administration to “change or slightly amend” the name of the Union Territory’s Lakes and Waterways Development Authority. Taking to Twitter, Singhvi urged authorities to do a “Bhajpa” and undertake the name change, referring to the practice of changing names of cities and towns by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state governments. “Although not a big fan of name change, I’ll do a Bhajpa here and request the J&K authorities to change/slightly amend the name of the Lakes and Waterways Development Authority,” Singhvi tweeted on Thursday. Although not a big fan of name change, I'll do a Bhajpa here and request the J&K authorities to change / slightly amend the name of Lakes and Waterways Development Authority.While Singhvi did not mention the reason behind this “request,” it is likely that this is because the body’s acronym, i.e, the first letter of each word, from Lakes to Authority, when read together, sounds exactly like a common Hindi cuss word.“The cleanliness drive of the Dal Lake is in full swing. It was paused last year due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Lakes and Waterways Development Authority has taken the initiative to clean the lake,” news agency ANI tweeted on Thursday, mentioning the acronym.“We’ve deployed 15-16 more machines. Along with high tech machinery, authorities have also resorted to manual cleaning process,” the tweet further quoted Dr Bashir Ahmad Bhat, the vice chairman of the Authority, as saying. We've deployed 15-16 more machines.

Within minutes of being posted, the tweet, predictably, led to a meme fest on social media. The J&K Lake and Waterways Development Authority trended throughout Thursday, and into early morning hours of Friday.Interestingly, there is no mention of the acronym on the agency’s official website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ill-do-a-bhajpa-abhishek-singhvi-urges-j-k-lakes-development-authority-to-change-its-name-here-s-why-101633059936223.html
01-10-2021||India||Delhi to see cloudy sky, air quality to be ‘satisfactory’||Delhi is likely to see a generally cloudy sky with a possibility of very light rain in some parts of the city on Friday as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast.The minimum temperature on Friday is likely to be at 26 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature is predicted to reach 34 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature on Sunday was 26.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal and the maximum temperature was 35.2 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. No rainfall has been recorded in the last 24 hours while the humidity has varied between 59% to 86% level. The regional meteorological department has predicted a partly cloudy sky over the next 7 days.Delhi’s air quality was in the satisfactory category on Friday morning. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am stood at 97. The prominent pollutants in the air were PM2.5, PM10 and CO. In comparison, the average 24-hour AQI was 84 on Thursday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On Friday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the satisfactory category as dry conditions are prevailing and winds are flowing from the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. However, wind direction will change to westerly from tomorrow, and AQI is forecasted to slightly deteriorate to remain in satisfactory category for next 3 days.”Based on its extended range outlook of air quality over the next one week, SAFAR has stated, “the satellite data indicates some sporadic fire count signatures in north India, but a drastic deterioration is not expected until 10th October. However, delayed monsoon retreat is not a good sign for air quality. The anticyclone which forms immediately after the withdrawal will make the atmosphere very stable beneath which favour rapid fine particulate matter formation and accumulation of pollutants. The situation becomes worse if it is encountered with any external emission source like stubble burning . If such conditions coincide then it will deteriorate the AQI significantly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-to-see-cloudy-sky-air-quality-to-be-satisfactory-101633059515110.html

It said the panel is “utterly disappointed and strongly condemns” the action of the doctors. In a statement, NCW said the test violated a Supreme Court ruling as well as the right to privacy and dignity.The Supreme Court in 2013 held the results of such tests cannot be used against rape survivors and that it was irrelevant whether the victim was seemingly “habituated to sexual intercourse”.NCW chief Rekha Sharma has also written to the IAF chief requesting him to look into the matter and take necessary steps and impart “necessary knowledge” to the IAF doctors about the guidelines laid down by the government.

01-10-2021||India||Gandhi Jayanti 2021: Remembering the Mahatma||On Saturday, October 2, 2021, the nation will pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi on what will be the 152nd birth anniversary of the “Father of the Nation.” Gandhi Jayanti, as the occasion is known, coincides this year with the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, which was inaugurated on March 12 by prime minister Narendra Modi, on the 91st anniversary of a significant event in Gandhi's life, the Dandi March.The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav will be celebrated till August 15, 2023, the 77th Independence Day.Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who shares his birthday with another legendary personality, former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri (born 1904), was born on October 2, 1869, in Porabandar, in present-day Gujarat. A lawyer whose life changed through his experiences in South Africa, Gandhi played the most significant role in India's independence movement, holding demonstrations through non-violent means. Though it is commonly believed that the title “Mahatma” was bestowed upon Gandhi by India's first Nobel laureate, “Gurudev” Rabindranath Tagore, the Gujarat government has disputed this, claiming instead that this title was given by a local journalist from Saurashtra. However, the leader is also commonly referred to as “Bapu” (father).Gandhi is the most frequently invoked Indian personality by world leaders, most of whom, during a visit to India, visit his resting place in Delhi. US president Joe Biden quoted the freedom fighter during his meeting with PM Modi at the White House last week.Also Read | PM Modi-Biden meeting at White House: Here's what the two leaders saidInternationally, October 2 is observed as the Day of Nonviolence in remembrance of the “Mahatma.” In India, it is a full holiday, and one of three national festivals, along with Republic Day (January 26) and Independence Day (August 15).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhi-jayanti-2021-paying-tribute-to-the-mahatma-101633052602639.html

The board's assets, employees, and management are being divided into seven newly established defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs), according to an official order issued by the defence ministry. Although the nearly 70,000 employees of the Ordnance Factory Board are being transferred to these new PSUs, there will be no change in their service conditions, defence minister Rajnath Singh clarified. The names of these seven new defence PSUs are – Munition India Ltd, Armoured Vehicles Nigam Ltd, Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Ltd, Troop Comforts Ltd, Yantra India Ltd, India Optel Ltd and Gliders India Ltd.Also Read | Centre dissolves ordnance factory board, transfers assets to seven DPSUsThere had been a long-pending proposal to restructure the over 200-year-old defence ministry entity – the Ordnance Factory Board –  which, with its 41 ammunition and military equipment production facilities, supplied critical arms and ammunition to the three armed forces and the paramilitary. The proposal aimed to transfer the existing framework into seven state-owned corporate entities to improve the board's accountability, efficiency and competitiveness. Finally, the Union cabinet decided to take the issue up on June 16 and approved the major reform initiative.In an order issued later on September 24, the defence ministry said, “Government of India has decided to transfer, with effect from October 1, the management, control, operations and maintenance of these 41 production units and identified non-production units to seven government companies.”Service conditions of employeesAll the employees of OFB (Groups A, B, and C), belonging to the production units and also the identified non-production units, are to be transferred en masse to the new DPSUs on terms of foreign service. They will, however, not be provided with any deputation allowance (deemed deputation) initially for a period of two years from the appointed date, an official order stated.It said each of the new DPSUs is required to frame rules and regulations related to service conditions of the absorbed employees and seek an option for permanent absorption from the employees on deemed deputation to the respective DPSUs within a period of two years.“The service conditions of the absorbed employees would not be inferior to the existing ones,” the order said, adding a committee would be constituted by the Department of Defence Production (DDP) for guiding the new DPSUs that the absorption package given is attractive.It said the pension liabilities of the retirees and existing employees will continue to be borne by the government from the defence ministry's budget. “For the employees recruited after January 1, 2004, the National Pension Scheme applicable to the Central Government employees is in vogue and the same may be adopted by the new DPSUs, including the continuation of all special provisions applicable to Central government employees under the National Pension System,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ordnance-factory-board-to-be-dissolved-today-employees-retain-service-conditions-101633048371381.html

In December 1945, Ganesamoorthy portrayed Maratha ruler Shivaji in a play titled “Shivaji Kanda Hindu Rajyam.” Such iconic was his performance that the name stuck, and Ganesamoorthy earned the moniker of “Sivaji,” being known by that name for the rest of his life.Though he was mainly active in Tamil cinema, where he made his debut in 1952's “Parasakthi,” Ganesan appeared in nearly 300 films, including those in languages such as Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi.

The decision to form the panel was taken after a three-hour meeting attended by Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned as the president of the Congress’ Punjab unit, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and the state ministers Pargat Singh and Raj Kumar Verka and leaders like Pawan Goyal, Kuljit Nagra and Harish Chaudhary. "Everything is fine," Pargat Singh told the media after the meeting.According to people familiar with the matter, the coordination panel will be consulted before any major decision is take-in the state. And Sidhu is likely to retain his post as the Punjab unit chief of the party. The people cited above said the panel is likely to be headed by a central leader and may comprise Channi, Sidhu and a third leader. Reports said AICC in-charge of Punjab Harish Rawat, senior Congress leader Ambika Soni and a few senior leaders of the party's state unit could be part of the committee.Also read | Sidhu, Channi buy peace, agree on panel for better coordinationDuring the meeting held at the Punjab Bhawan on Thursday, Sidhu demanded the removal of the director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and Punjab’s advocate general APS Deol. Their names are linked to the desecration of a religious text in Punjab’s Faridkot district in 2015, whose investigation was handed over by the then Parkash Singh Badal-led government to an SIT led by Sahota. Deol was a counsel for former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and represented him in cases related to police firing on Sikhs protesting against the sacrilege cases.“DGP IPS Sahota was head of SIT investigating Beadbi case under Badal govt, he wrongfully indicted two Sikh youth for sacrilege & gave a clean chit to Badals...” Sidhu tweeted earlier in the day attacking Sahota.Also read | The Congress leadership made a mistake with Sidhu.

The party was already battling the bitter tussle between Sidhu and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Charanjeet Singh Channi took oath as the 16th chief minister of Punjab on September 20, days after Captain Amarinder Singh stepped down from the top job in the state following months of infighting between him and Navjot Singh Sidhu.Amarinder Singh resigned as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 and told the media that the Congress leadership had let him down and he felt insulted and humiliated. He also took a dig at Sidhu over his resignation, saying he is not a stable man.

01-10-2021||India||Kerala govt to slash motor vehicle tax on tourist caravans||KochiThe Kerala government will slash the motor-vehicle tax on tourist caravans by one-fourth, considering the immense scope of Caravan Tourism in the state, the state tourism department said on Thursday.Kerala transport inister Antony Raju has agreed in-principle to a proposal in this regard from tourism minister P A Mohamed Riyas, the department said in a release.The proposal will soon be approved by the government after going through the formalities required, Raju said while inaugurating a joint workshop of tourism and transport departments held here to deliberate on the operational details of the Caravan Tourism policy and sensitise regional transport officers (RTOs) on the procedural and regulatory aspects of the project. Hailing the policy announced recently as a major step forward in tourism development, Raju pledged support and cooperation of the motor vehicles department for its success. Presiding over the inaugural session of the workshop, Riyas asked the motor vehicles department to ensure that the registration of caravan vehicles and issue of permits to them are carried out in a hassle-free manner. The tax on caravans must be reduced to ₹250 per square metre from the current ₹1,000 per sqm, he said in his address.The government’s policy is that every panchayat and municipality must have at least one tourist destination.For their smooth day-to-day running, the government has decided to enlist active participation of local self-government institutions. Since suitable staying facilities in such set-ups will be difficult, the solution is caravan tourism, Riyas said.Raju said the government would provide green channel passage for caravans that carry a special sticker suggesting the joint recognition of the Tourism and Transport departments.They would also get preference while testing for pollution. Caravans will be given registration within 24 hours of application, the minister said.The additional transport commissioner would be the state nodal officer for caravans. The practice of on-road inspections will be avoided to facilitate smooth passage of caravans. The workshop mainly focused on the rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of tourist caravans. It also looked into the procedural protocols relating to the standardisation of caravans and their smooth movement in any part of the state and comfortable stay of tourists at the caravan parks and other stop-over spots. The state government had recently announced the country’s most stakeholder-friendly Caravan Tourism Policy, promising the visitors a safe, customized and closest-to-nature travel experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-to-slash-motor-vehicle-tax-on-tourist-caravans-101633033952020.html

We will be very cautious as we do not want to hurt the sentiments of other communities. The Church always stands for openness and strengthening the secular fabric of the society by enriching the communal harmony,” the official said in his first of such interaction after the bishop’s remarks rocked the state.The KCBC has observed that the recent controversy over the “love and narcotic jihad” remarks made by the bishop of Pala diocese of Syro-Malabar Church was an “eye opener” for the Church as it was “misinterpreted” by a section of media and politicians for serving their “narrow political and business interests” causing “pain and anguish” among members of another community, he said.After their meeting on Wednesday, the KCBC, which includes bishops of Syro-Malabar, Syro-Malankara, Knanaya Catholic and Latin Catholic churches, had issued a statement saying social evils pointed out by the church require a deeper study and serious enquiry instead of giving it a “different hue” and diverting it to other directions.Choosing not to use controversial terminologies like narcotic jihad or love jihad in its statement, the council said that it rejects in unison all forms of interpretations which undermine religious harmony and weaken healthy co-existence in society by mischievously twisting the warnings of the pastors of this church.“The KCBC disapproves of any covert attempts to show that there exists disunity among the Churches. The fundamental values of truth, love and justice, which the Catholic Church upholds, constitute the basis of all inter-religious dialogue and harmony among religions,” it had said in the release.Addressing the laity in Kuravilangad near Kottayam recently, Bishop Joseph Kallarangatt of Pala diocese had said that Christian girls were falling prey to what he claimed was “love and narcotic jihad” in Kerala and that wherever arms cannot be used, extremists were using such methods to destroy the youth.The comment had resulted in a verbal duel and blame game amongst the major political parties -- CPI(M), BJP and Congress -- in the state.The Congress, which criticised the Bishop for his remarks and the BJP, which supported the Bishop’s remarks, had attacked the Left government and the Chief Minister for their silence on the issue.Thereafter, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on September 21 rejected outright the comments made by the Bishop, saying the southern state is a firm terrain of secularism and society would take strong stand against those who try to upset it.The KCBC said that the Catholic Church in Kerala has been working towards peaceful co-existence and harmony of religions and for the cultural development of society in the state, through its varied services in the field of education and healthcare, as well as social and charitable actions.The KCBC said it wants secularism and religious harmony always and vows to work for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-be-guarded-in-sermons-says-kerala-catholic-church-after-row-over-narcotic-jihad-101633033831861.html

01-10-2021||India||Revenge killings linked to caste rattle Tamil Nadu again||Chennai: In a dramatic penultimate scene in the 1992 Tamil-film “Thevar Magan”, actor Kamal Haasan swipes his large sickle and decapitates the “villain” whose headless body falls to the ground. This final fight after all is a culmination of retributive violence that plays throughout the film pegged on the Thevar caste which was celebrated inside theatres in Madurai - a location where violence and caste dominance is often set.This set a trend for Tamil films to follow on the combination of caste pride and violence as the fictional accounts gave identity to life in the 1990s in Tamil Nadu when revenge killings had peaked before it was brought down by police intervention.But, vestiges of such macabre killings have emerged once again in Tamil Nadu. In just September, four beheadings have been committed in a span of 10 days.Three of these beheadings are said to be revenge killings as the victims severed heads were “offered” to previous murder victims belonging to rival gangs.The latest beheading happened on September 23 borne out of a rivalry that dates back to the early 1990s in Dindigul district near Madurai. On that day, three men on a bike murdered and decapitated a 61-year-old woman, Nirmala Devi. She is an accused in the sensational murder of a Dalit leader C Pasupathy Pandian in January 2012. They carried her severed head to Pandian’s home which was 1.5 km away away from the spot of murder and placed the lifeliess head below his poster. Police have arrested nine men for Devi’s killing. She is a labourer under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme.“They murdered her around 10 am when she had sat down to eat her breakfast,” said a police officer investigating the case. Devi was one of accused in Pandian’s murder case for providing asylum to his killers. These retaliatory murders have reinforced caste-based identities, dominance and loyalty to their communities. Devi is the fifth victim to be killed by Pandian’s supporter, continuing a gruesome bloody trail. The rivalry between the two factions -- the Dalits and the Nadar community in the region dates back to 1990.In this closed world, it’s a local gang war between Pasupathy Pandian, a growing influential Dalit leader and Subash Pannaiyar, a salt pan baron in Thoothukudi district belonging to the Nadar community- a backward but powerful trading community in southern Tamil Nadu. “Devi and Pandian belonged to the same caste and Pannaiyar planted her as a mole. Because of this caste-factor, the locals aren’t even sad that Devi was killed. They feel it was rightful vengence for Pandian’s murder,” the Dindigul police officer said. The first murder happened in January 1993 with the victim being an elderly man from Pannaiyar’s family and they suspected Panidan to be behind the killing. This began to spiral into retaliatory killings which were solidified by caste identity for three decades now.“The Dalits used to be labourers in lands owned by the Nadars who were very dominant and oppressed the schedule caste people like slaves and harrased their women,” explains a retired police officer and an author on police investigations, V Sithannan.“Panidan grew as a resistance force to support Dalits but over time he and his gang began indulging in criminal activities like extortion, land grabbing and murders.” Sithanan, who joined the police force in 1976 and has worked in southern regions, said that beheadings and revenge killings had been prevalent since the 1980s.“Both Pandian and Pannaiyar always moved around with at least 20-gang members with them because they feared they could be killed anytime,” he says. “Their cars would always carry sickles and country bombs.”Despite protecting themselves, including Devi’s murder, 12 lives have been lost from both sides over the generational rivalry. The case even spilled over to Chennai when Venkatesa Pannaiyar, who had sought to avenge his relative’s killings, was shot by the police. Pandian also faced several death threats and fearing for his life, Pandian moved from Thoothukudi to Dindigul in 1997. But in 2006, Panidan’s wife was killed in a country bomb attack in which Pandian escaped. A few years later, when he was alone at home at night, a gang murdered Pandian in his Dindigul residence in 2012.Devi and Pannaiyar are accused in the case among a dozen others. The case is pending in the trial stage at a special court for SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act in the Dindigul court.Though revenge killings and murders have happened everywhere, police say that the culture of crime in southern Tamil Nadu is different.“The people of this region are very affectionate but at the same time they can go to the other extreme of murdering in the most gruesome ways for taking revenge,” says Sithanan. “They don’t care about the consequences. The case may be in court, the rival gangs may be standing just outside the police station but they will kill.”T Kannappan, another retired Inspector General of Police in the intelligence bureau, is credited for bringing down these revenge killings during his two stints in Tirunelveli district as an SP and DIG between the late 1990s and mid-2000s.“In a revenge killing, after murdering the victim, they maim their hands and legs, cut off their heads or crush it. Their methods often show how deep the emotion of revenge is ingrained, In some cases the motive also can be understood,” said Kannapan. Like in the case of Devi, their heads are ‘offered’ to the previous victim for whom the murder of reveneg was committed. “Like making an offering to God, these people offer their rivals’ heads to the previous victims,” Kannapan says. The beheadings this September began in Tirunelveli. On September 13, a farmer Sankara Subramanian (38) who belongs to the Thevar caste was murdered. Police found his severed head at a crematorium ground placed on the grave of a Dalit man named Manirathnam who was murdered back in 2013. This led the police to conclude that this was a revenge killing. Police arrested six persons including Manithiram’s son Maharaja (20). And as the police formed special teams suspecting that there could be a counter-killing, it happened two days later. On September 15, a gang murdered a Dalit man, Mariappan (32) and head was found in the same spot where Subramanian was murdered. Mariappan was accused in a murder case of 2014. Police arrested eight people in the case. “My reading is when such revenge killing happened in Tirunelveli it would have spurred the gangs lying low in Dindigul to act,” says Kannappan.“Suspects usually find a favourable time to commit such crimes.” He says that while the crimes are steeped in caste-rivalry, it usually stems out from even petty issues. In the 1990s when such revenge killings had peaked, Kannappan says they were steeped in caste fanaticism which could stem out from even petty issues because of the production and consumption of alcohol and unemployment.“One caste group would want to monopolise illicit arrack and if another group tries to interfere, it’s a loss of economic activity,” says Kannappan. He and other officers helped the bootleggers to set up other professions using financial assistance from the government.Some of the ‘rowdies’ shifted to Mumbai and other parts of Tamil Nadu during this time. But over the years the bootlegging issue was settled in the southern districts. “But the caste-violence continued in other forms like over land disputes. Even a cattle grazing from a land belonging to an SC caste to another will end up in murders.”And there was a lull in the years that followed. A former SP of Dindigul, who did not wish to be named, said that during his stint four years ago, “nothing of this sort happened.” He was however briefed on all the previous crimes. “There had been a lot of retaliation killings and we had a ‘bandobast’ even if the accused was going to court,” he said. “I’m not sure why this has re-emerged now.”A social activist, who did not wish to be named, said they don’t take up these revenge killings though these are also caste killings.“When a Dalit dies, we have to question the motive,” the anti-caste activist from Madurai said. “These crimes are not solely based on their caste identity. They are also equally involved in criminal activities like money extortion so it’s not the same as honour killings and other caste-based crimes. Their caste is only an extension for their gang wars.”Sithannan and Kannappan explain that such cases are never over. “When a person was murdered his son may have been a minor and after years as an adult, he re-organises the old gang members to seek vengeance for his father,” says Kannappan.“The accused may have money and political power due to which he may not be punished for several years. That gives space to grooming situations. Unless these murder cases are disposed immediately, the revenge killings will continue.”And hence the dramatic method of killing and then decapitating a person to carry their head for a distance and then placing it as ‘offerings’ in homes and graves and statues. “Revenge killings always leave it opens for more retaliation murders to follow,” says Sithannan. “Pandian’s associates about 60-70 of them are still in the southern belt who have become active now after 8 years to avenge his murder. The nine men we have arrested belong to this group,” said an officer investigating the case. Pandian’s house is currently empty. Devi is survived by two sons and one of them works in the Indian army, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revenge-killings-linked-to-caste-rattle-tamil-nadu-again-101633033172033.html
01-10-2021||India||No political angle in MLAs’ Delhi visit: Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel||Amid speculation of a possible change of guard in Chhattisgarh, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday played down the visit of 10 Congress MLAs to the national capital, ruling out any “political angle” in the trip.“The MLAs can’t even go anywhere? If someone has gone there, it shouldn’t be seen from a political angle. If a politician is going somewhere, it’s obvious that he’ll meet political persons only,” Baghel told reporters in Raipur.On the possibility of the MLAs meeting AICC in-charge for Chhattisgarh, P L Punia, Baghel said, “Is Punia ji in Delhi? If Punia ji is not in Delhi, there is no question of meeting him.”The chief minister’s remarks came a day after 10 legislators flew to Delhi, adding to the buzz over a possible leadership change as a part of purported power-sharing formula in the Congress government.Baghel and his cabinet colleague, T S Singh Deo, have been locked in a tussle for the chief minister’s chair. As Baghel completed two-and-a-half years in office in June this year, the Singh Deo camp claimed that the high command in 2018 had agreed to hand over the post to him after the government completed half its term. Punia, however, has time and again denied that any such deal was struck in 2018.Reacting to the visit of the Congress MLAs, Singh Deo on Wednesday said: “We all know what kind of talks are going on regarding Chhattisgarh’s politics. Earlier, there was nothing but now the talk of a possible change of guard is in the public domain and probably that’s the reason for MLAs flying to Delhi, though they are saying that their agenda is development and not political.”Congress leader Brihaspat Singh, who led the group, insisted that there was no issue over the chief minister’s post and that they wanted to meet Punia over a proposed tour of party leader Rahul Gandhi to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-political-objective-says-baghel-on-chhattisgarh-congress-mlas-delhi-visit-101633032271619.html

01-10-2021||India||Accused of raping and murdering 18 women and children, former cop Umesh Reddy’s decades-old saga of brutality close to an end||Bengaluru: He often gained access to his victims’ houses on the pretext of asking for water. His targets were mostly women, who he stalked for days before attacking.This was the modus operandi adopted by Umesh Reddy, a man convicted in nine rape and murder cases. A former policeman, he is accused of raping and murdering at least 18 women and children.Taking serious note of his criminal record, the Karnataka high court on Wednesday rejected Reddy’s appeal for commuting the death penalty awarded to him to a life sentence after his mercy petition was rejected by the President in 2012. While dismissing the plea, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and Pradeep Singh Yerur noted that the nature of the crimes did not merit any leniency. According to officers who investigated him, he was a smart criminal, who not only planned his heinous crimes but also had tricks up his sleeves to escape police custody multiple times. BN Nyamagouda, the police inspector who arrested Reddy said he was a ruthless killer, who managed to escape the police at least five times. Reddy’s criminal history started after he joined the Central Armed Reserve Force (CRPF) in 1996. He was posted in Kashmir after training and after he raped the daughter of his commandant, he escaped from the camp. “There were no systems in place then to check backgrounds of people, so after running away from CRPF, he came to Chitradurga and became a constable in District Armed Reserve (DAR) in November 1996. But he didn’t stick around there either, because he was caught in a rape case there as well,” said Nyamegowda. He initially tried to rape a girl in the KEB Colony in Chitradurga, but the girl raised alarm. Just days later, he raped and murdered a woman in the same district. He was arrested for rape in 1997. But within two months he escaped from jail. “Reddy escaped for the first time when he was being shifted from Bellary jail in March 1997. He was later arrested in July 1997 while attempting to steal women’s undergarments. But he escaped within 24 hours. He was picked up by Peenya police on February 28, 1998, while he was trying to escape after killing another woman. But he managed to escape while being brought to court. It had become an embarrassment for the department,” added the officer. His escapes proved fatal over the years as he got involved in the rape and murders of at least 18 women including five minors. “He entered their houses on the pretext of seeking drinking water or rooms for rent. He made sure the women were alone. He carried weapons that he used to threaten them. He used to tie them or chock them before committing rape. We have some cases where he had sex while the victims were unconscious or dead. He always took the inner clothing of the victims with him. He was a psychopath,” said the officer. Reddy was finally arrested on May 17, 2002, by Yeshwantpur police after he was spotted in a saloon by an autorickshaw driver. In the trial that followed, the court made some powerful observations. In February 2009, while reading out the verdict, the judge ruled that the accused, being a habitual offender, the sentences of imprisonment imposed on him in several cases had no deterrent effect on him. Justice Bannurmath in the verdict said: “It is evident that even after punishments in cases of robbery, dacoity, and rape, he has not reformed; no reformation can be expected from such a habitual offender and pervert criminal.” “I do not understand why such a devil in man’s garb should be maintained by society by locking him up in jail for life. It is a known fact that whenever there is an opportunity, he has a tendency to run away from custody and commit new, heinous crimes.” “The accused, being a habitual offender, the sentences of imprisonment imposed on him in several cases had no deterrent effect on him,” he had observed. According to officers who investigated the case, the conviction is a recognition of the thorough police investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-of-raping-and-murdering-18-women-and-children-former-cop-umesh-reddy-s-decades-old-saga-of-brutality-close-to-an-end-101633031912038.html
01-10-2021||India||ZyCoV-D likely to be rolled out in vaccine drive soon: Official||A second Indian vaccine for Covid-19, ZyCoV-D, will be included in the immunisation campaign “very shortly”, officials said at the health ministry’s briefing on Thursday, and the drive is likely to be opened up to children 12 years old and above, other people aware of the matter added separately.ZyCoV-D has been granted an emergency use authorisation by India’s drug regulators after interim clinical trial data showed is was 66% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19. The trial included volunteers in the 12-18 age group and was among the first doses in the country to have shown to be safe and efficacious in children.Union secretary for health and family welfare Rajesh Bhushan said the government was in talks with the vaccine manufacturer regarding pricing and procurement. “As far as the price of the vaccine at which it will be procured is concerned, we are in conversations with the manufacturer. Since it is a three-dose vaccine and comes with a needleless delivery system, it would have a differential pricing than the existing vaccines that are being used in the Covid-19 vaccination drive,” said Bhushan during the media briefing.“It will be introduced in the programme (Covid-19) very shortly,” Bhushan added.A person aware of the matter separately said the vaccine will likely be offered to 12-18 year-olds as well.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, while announcing that India will restart vaccine exports in the quarter beginning October, said in a statement on September 20 that manufacturers were going to make nearly 300 million doses available for use in October.Globally, at least 50 countries have begun giving doses to children. In most cases, children above the age of 12 are being inoculated. The shots being used for these ages are typically the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna doses – both have shown to be safe in children and their efficacy has been established.In India, makers of Covaxin and the Novavax vaccine are carrying out supplementary – also known as bridging -- trials in children. In adults, India has largely been using Covishield and Covaxin.“The production is going to go up further in the next quarter with the Zydus vaccine doses also getting added in some time. The supply lines have been streamlined...,” said a second senior government official aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.On the issue of Covaxin’s pending recognition by the World Health Organization, ICMR director general, Balram Bhargava said: “We know that scientific data, public health considerations and international health requirements are all considered on which the clearance is given by the WHO. All these have been provided and are being looked at.”The country has administered at least one vaccine dose to 69% of the adult population since January 16, when the drive began. At least 25% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the government data released on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-indian-vaccine-to-be-part-of-vaccination-drive-soon-saysgovernment-101633031524577.html
01-10-2021||India||Breastfeeding an inalienable right of lactating mother: Karnataka high court||Bengaluru The Karnataka high court has said that “breastfeeding needs to be recognized as an inalienable right of a lactating mother” and is protected under the fundamental rights in the Constitution of India.The observation was made by Justice Krishna S Dixit on Wednesday in which one woman had approached the court seeking the return of her child who was taken away from the maternity home soon after birth from her foster mother.In its order, the HC said: “In the light of domestic law and the international law as briefly discussed above, breastfeeding needs to be recognized as an inalienable right of lactating mother; similarly, the right of the suckling infant for being breastfed too, has to be assimilated with mother’s right; arguably, it is a case of concurrent rights; this important attribute of motherhood, is protected under the umbrella of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India; it is unfortunate that this pretty child for no fault remained un-breastfed, its lactating mother having had no access to it till now; in a civilized society such things should never happen.”The court added that between the claim of the foster mother and the biological parent, the latter should have priority over the child.The court said that the contention by the foster mother that she does not have any children while the biological parent has two at home to continue living with the former is “ludicrous”. The court said that “children are not chattel for being apportioned between their genetic mother and a stranger, on the basis of their numerical abundance; the principle of distributive justice which intends to bridge the gap between “haves and have nots” is not invocable, at least in this case.” The court added that a genetic mother “treats all her children as being an integral part of her body and soul, regardless of what the children do to her; this contention of foster mother is abhorrent to the very notion of motherhood.”However, the court also said that such cases are uncommon so as to enable any given judge to “profit merely by experience and thereby enable him to lay down thumb rules, especially when the elements involved are so complex”.It, however, added that the broad norm, in matters of child custody, should be that the claim of strangers yield to that of the genetic parents.Following the intervention of the court, the foster mother handed over the child to the biological parent. Further, the genetic parent has allowed the foster mother to see the child whenever she would like to do so, which the court order appropriately terms as “grace” on both their parts.“Such kind gestures coming from two women hailing from two different religious backgrounds are marked by their rarity, nowadays; thus, this legal battle for the custody of the pretty child is drawn to a close with a happy note, once for all,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breastfeeding-an-inalienable-right-of-lactating-mother-karnataka-high-court-101633031626393.html
01-10-2021||India||Karnataka government plans to make all Bengaluru roads free of potholes in 30 days||Bengaluru The Karnataka government said on Thursday that all roads in Bengaluru will be pothole-free in 30 days, setting another deadline, after many missed ones, to provide one of the most basic amenities to the city’s over 12 million residents.R Ashok, Karnataka’s minister for revenue and interim incharge of Bengaluru city, said an additional ₹1,000 crore has been released for the purpose of fixing roads in the newly added localities of Bengaluru, where damaged roads have added to the nightmarish experience of residents, especially during monsoons. “Every day we were supposed to get 16 loads of bitumen from separate plants we have set up. But for 12 days, we did not get the load due to constant rains. The stone got wet and hot-mix was not working,” Ashok said. The assurance on road repair comes ahead of the elections to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city’s civic body, that are expected to be held early next year. Bengaluru has 13,847 kms of arterial and sub-arterial roads, of which only 295 kms are said to be in good condition and another 246 kms have now been ridden of potholes, Ashok said. The new deadline comes even as huge amounts of money spent for road work were revealed in the just concluded monsoon session of the state legislature between September 13-24. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had revealed in the upper house of the legislature last week that the state government had spent ₹20,060 crore on road works in Bengaluru in the last five years. Bommai, who holds the Bengaluru portfolio, said that only 1344 kms of roads, out of the over 11,200 kms, were motrable in the city, admitting to the one of the biggest infrastructural challenges gnawing at India’s IT capital. He also announced a road maintenance audit to monitor the money spent on roads, initial estimates and final cost, maintenance history, and potholes. Bommai said he would seek responses from contractors, officials and every person involved in the works to keep a watch on the amount spent on these projects. Though Bengaluru aspires to be a global city, its administrators have focused on a few parts of the over 800 square kms area, leaving most of its residents without basic amenities despite it being one of the revenue generators in the country, experts say. Successive governments have often fallen back on the same excuse of “developing city” as a way to circumvent taking responsibility on providing motorable roads without potholes, slush, and dust. Its infrastructure challenges have continued to impact the lives of its residents. The poor quality of roads has led to higher amounts of dust kicking up into the air, slowing down traffic and even taking lives. On an average, Ashoka said, each of the 198 wards has been allocated ₹20 lakh for the pothole-filling exercise. There have also been at least three major incidents in the city in the last one week, with two dilapidated buildings collapsing. Though there has been no loss of lives in these incidents, they have brought focus on the BBMP’s building plan approvals. Ashok said that all dilapidated buildings will get a notice in the next one week. As per a 2019 survey report, as many as 185 buildings were identified in the city and that the cost of demolition will be added to the existing property tax dues of the owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-government-plans-to-make-all-bengaluru-roads-free-of-potholes-in-30-days-101633031440710.html
01-10-2021||India||Electric buses spark hope for sustainable transport in Bengaluru city||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Thursday received the first of its planned 90 electric buses to ply as Bengaluru Metro feeder service, a move that is seen as part of the larger initiative to introduce more sustainable technologies to bring down pollution in the public transport sector. “Our government is dedicated to ensure people get the best transport facilities. In addition, electric buses are being introduced in larger numbers to protect the environment. Request all people to make best use of this transport facility and also help reduce traffic congestion,” B Sriramulu, Karnataka’s minister for transport and scheduled tribe (ST) welfare said in a post on Twitter on Thursday. The Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. will provide financial assistance of ₹50 crore for the operation of 90 electric buses and an incentive of ₹50 lakh per bus have been provided to the bidder, Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) said, adding an additional ₹5 crore is set aside to set up charging infrastructure. “The tender has been finalised and letter of award has been issued to M/s. NTPC Vypar Vidyut Nigam at GCC rate of ₹51.67/ km with electricity for 180 assured km for a period of 10 years. The buses have a seating capacity of 34 persons and can operate 120 kms on a single charge,” the BMTC said in a statement on Thursday. People aware of the developments said the buses would begin in a phase-wise manner from next month when the government will flag off these services. The 90 buses will be operate in Yeswanthpura, KR Puram and Kengeri.The EV (electric vehicle) initiative in the intra-city bus services is part of a larger plan of the state government to introduce more eco-friendly commute options for the public in a city that has seen its quality of air and water deteriorate in recent years, amplified by the intensifying construction and road repair works. Experts said that ever since the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown were lifted, the AQI (air quality index) has oscillated more sharply than before, HT reported on June 25. In the 13 monitoring stations across Bengaluru, only one station near Mysuru Road had a rating of ‘good’ in the AQI index in August while most others were ‘satisfactory’ while two were in ‘moderate’ category, according to the Karnataka state Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) data. Bengaluru has 9.4 million vehicles and pollution caused by them is the biggest reason for the deteriorating AQI in the city and its over 12 million residents. The KSPCB claims have been contested be experts in the past as most of the monitoring stations are placed away from high-density roads and tucked away near lakes and open spaces that lead to inaccurate findings. “If they acknowledge the problem then there has to be an intervention, action, followed by more work which they don’t want to do,” Madhusudhan Anand, chief technical officer at, Ambee, a Bengaluru-based startup that works to find solutions for air pollution earlier told HT.For instance, the air monitoring centre in BTM Layout, one of the most congested localities in Bengaluru, is placed around a canopy of trees near Madiwala lake, away from the main road, which is unlikely to capture the true extent of the pollution. According to KSPCB, in its revised action plan for the control of air pollution in Bengaluru, the city’s AQI -- a metric of daily air quality -- has fallen from 107.1 in 2014-15 to 88.1 in 2018-19, which shows a decreasing trend in the five-year annual average. This data has been disputed even by elected representatives, apart from scientists and experts on the subject. A 41-point action plan to mitigate air pollution, introduced by the state government, includes the implementation of LPG and bio-fuels, promoting battery operated vehicles, effective disposal of construction debris and operations of the metro among other measures to decrease the harmful pollutants entering the air. Electric vehicles are a way forward but the lack of infrastructure and government support has led to hesitancy among the public who still prefer vehicles that use fossil fuels. On September 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union cabinet approved a $3.5-billion incentive scheme aimed at boosting electric and hydrogen fuel powered vehicles production in the country. But the difference between announcing a policy and implementing it has been the biggest challenge in cities like Benglauru, experts said. The government has set a target of one charging station in a 3km radius grid in Bengaluru, as part of its 2017 EV Policy. Companies like Ola, Uber, Bounce, Vogo and several others are looking at increasing EVs in their respective fleets to bring down capital and operational expenditure for service providers, reduce cost per km for users and help bring down pollution by keeping out smoke-emitting gasoline vehicles off the road. But none of this has come with government support and has been an investment of the private sector, according to people familiar with the matter.Ola is investing ₹2,400 crore to set up a two-million per annum EV plant in Tamil Nadu. The Karnataka government earlier this year approved investments of ₹22,419 crore in three different proposals involving EV and lithium-ion battery manufacturing that has the potential to create nearly 5,000 new jobs. But these projects are yet to see any traction on the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/electric-buses-spark-hope-for-sustainable-transport-in-bengaluru-city-101633031131739.html

Superintendent of police, Kolar, D Kishore Babu, said a case has been registered at Gulpet police station. According to the police, the carcasses were identified by some local residents who found the bags on the road. On opening the bags, they found some monkeys gasping for breath, which later died, said police. On Thursday, deputy commissioner of Kolar, Dr Selvamani R, ordered a detailed investigation in the incident, directing the forest department and police to work together to identify the culprits and arrest them at the earliest. In a statement to the media, the deputy commissioner urged people not to resort to such steps. “If any area is facing a monkey menace, just inform the forest department. They will make arrangements and relocate the primates immediately,” said Selvamani. This is third such incident in the state in the past two-three months. On July 26, seven people, including a woman, were arrested for killing 38 macaque monkeys at Chowdenahalli in Hassan district. The bonnet macaque monkeys were poisoned to death and found stuffed in a gunny bag at a road junction at Belur taluk in Hassan district. On September 9, more than 100 stray dogs were found killed in Shivamogga district. Police have arrested 12 people, including two members of Kambadal Hosur gram panchayat, in connection with the death of the stray dogs. Officials of the Bhadravati Rural police station said the gram panchayat issued an order for catching and sterilising stray dogs within panchayat limits and gave the contract to private contractors. The decision was taken during a meeting of the panchayat and an amount was set aside for the task. However, some members of the panchayat, including the secretary, conspired with the private contractors to kill the dogs by poisoning them. Meanwhile, wildlife activists raised concerns over the rising instances of cruelty towards animals. “People say there is a monkey menace etc, but the fact is we encroaching the forests. Since they don’t have any resources in the natural habitat they are coming to the cities,” said Joseph Hoover, a Bengaluru-based wildlife activist. Activists also highlighted that loophole in law enables such crime as under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), offences against animals are treated as damage to property or assets. “Under Section 428 of the IPC, a person can face a two-year jail term for killing or maiming a pet animal worth ₹10 and a five-year jail term if the pet animal was worth ₹50 or more. However, as strays belong to no one, they cannot be considered an asset and are thus not covered under the law,” said Rashmi Nair, a Bengaluru-based lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-monkeys-found-dead-in-karnataka-s-kolar-district-probe-ordered-101633030891528.html

And to some degree, the jury is still out.”“When I say levels of concern, there were commitments which were made by the Taliban at Doha... US knows that best, we were not taken into confidence on various aspects of that.”He added, “So, whatever were the deals which were struck in Doha – one has a broad sense but beyond that, are we going to see an inclusive government, are we going to see respect for the rights of women, children and minorities? Most important, are we going to see an Afghanistan whose soil is not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-clear-if-afghanistan-will-have-inclusive-govt-or-its-soil-won-t-be-used-for-terror-jaishankar-101633030531576.html

The commission’s move comes a week after the clashes at Garukhuti in Darrang district based on a letter by senior Congressman and leader of opposition in the state assembly Debabrata Saikia urging AHRC to take suo-motu cognizance of the incident. The AHRC letter addressed to principal secretary of home and political department asks the government to inform whether any commission has been constituted to probe the incident. The government has been asked to treat the matter as urgent and file a reply within 21 days. Following the incident that took place on September 23, the state government had announced that an inquiry into the incident would be conducted by a retired judge of the Gauhati High Court. No notification in that regard has been issued yet. “I had submitted the letter to AHRC seeking their intervention as there was human rights violation during the eviction drive that claimed 2 lives. But since the state government has already announced an inquiry, a separate probe by AHRC is unlikely to take place,” said Debabrata Saikia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-human-rights-panel-asks-govt-to-give-details-of-probe-into-eviction-drive-violence-101633030171759.html
01-10-2021||India||Manson Mavunkal case: Kerala police seek ASI help to find details of ‘antiques’||Thiruvananthapuram The Kerala Crime Branch on Thursday sought the help of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to find out details of so-called “antiques” seized from the house of the alleged master conman Manson Mavunkal (52) even as a luxury car registered in the name of Bollywood actor Kareena Kapoor was found in his possession. “We have approached the ASI to find details of artefacts seized from his (Mavunkal’s) house. We registered three fresh cases in Kochi and we will also check his degrees and other details,” said additional director general of police S Sreejith, crime branch head. Forest officials who seized ivory products from Mavunkal’s house later confirmed that they were fake. Mavunkal was arrested by the crime branch last Sunday and at least 14 cases have been registered against him under various police stations in Kerala. Close to several senior police officers and politicians, he allegedly cheated many showing his contact with powerful people, collection of his “antiques” and his upcoming international art museum. Lying idle in Cherthala police station (Alapuzha) for almost a year, Porschse Boxster was registered in Kareena’s name and registration certificate mentions Randhir Kapoor as her father and their Bandra (Mumbai) address was given. A motor vehicles department official said 2007 model vehicle was seized by the police last year in connection with a cheating case filed by a business group and that he might have got it from a used car dealer. The actor was not available for her comments. Out of his 30-odd cars found in his house, most of them are high-end luxury vehicles that he reportedly brought from used car dealers. His former driver A Ajith said besides antiques he collected luxury cars from various parts of the country and displayed before his house to attract influential people. Even disposed and faulty luxury cars were carted to his house. “With the fleet of cars he attracted many in the cinema industry also. He allegedly cheated a Karnataka-based luxury car dealer Thyagarajan after buying 8 used high-end cars. When Thyagarajan approached him for payment, he was intimidated using his police connections,” said Ajith. At times he also used to show off saying it was gifted by cine actors, he said. There are unconfirmed reports that many conned cinema personalities are unwilling to come up fearing bad publicity. Meanwhile former DGP Loknath Behra, who was appointed as the managing director of Kochi Metro after his retirement four months ago, has proceeded on leave. But people close to him said he took leave due to some personal reasons. During his tenure as police chief, a beat box was installed outside his house after Mavunkal complained that “he possessed priceless antiques”. Behra’s photo sitting on the throne of Mavunkal was also surfaced in social media inviting embarrassment to the police. Though there were many complaints against him, Mavunkal got away easily using his influence with the police and politicians. Confidential documents with the Hindustan Times suggest inquiries were ordered in 2019 and 2020 but they failed to pick up speed till his arrest on last Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manson-mavunkal-case-kerala-police-seek-asi-help-to-find-details-of-antiques-101633030051631.html

The Union home ministry is also searching for his whereabouts. We have no clue about his whereabouts and we too are searching him,” he said.The minister said it was not appropriate if Singh has fled the country. “There will be action taken against him. It could be under various provisions of the law. It could be a disciplinary action for remaining absent from the duty without informing the authorities. The action is not important, his appearance before the agencies is important. The action against him by the state government is not out of any vendetta but it is a routine procedure which will be followed,” Walse-Patil said in Mumbai.Singh was removed as Mumbai top cop on March 17, following the Antilia explosives scare and subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. He was shifted to the Maharashtra home guards on March 22.On April 7, Singh appeared before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for recording his statement in connection with the two cases. Later, he was summoned by the federal agency, but he did not respond to the summons.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole questioned whether the Centre had helped Singh to flee the country. “Had he been detained by the central agencies investigating Antilia explosive scare case, significant information could have been extracted from him. The investigating agencies have raised doubts about his whereabouts but the question remains unanswered if the Centre facilitated him to go out of the country,” he said.Singh last attended his office on May 4 and went on leave from May 5, on account of health issues. It is believed that Singh had gone to his hometown in Chandigarh. In between, he had communicated with the Maharashtra government, requesting for extension of his leave due to health issues. He also claimed that he had undergone a surgery. In mid-August, he again requested extension for leave over health grounds. But, thereafter, no request has come from him, said a police officer requesting anonymity.An inquiry commission headed by retired Bombay high court judge, justice (retired) Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal in early September issued a bailable warrant against Singh for not appearing before it.A team of the state crime investigation department (CID) that went to three of his (Singh’s) known residences in Chandigarh and Mumbai did not find him there and could not serve the warrant. As he failed to appear before the commission, it re-issued the bailable warrant against him on September 21.The next hearing of the commission is scheduled on October 6.The commission earlier had imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on Singh twice for not appearing before the commission.People aware of the matter said that NIA too has issued summons to him to join the investigation, but he failed to appear before them as well.Three days after his removal as commissioner, Singh on March 20 wrote an explosive letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, accusing state’s former home minister Anil Deshmukh of instructing controversial crime branch officer API Sachin Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort monthly ₹100 crore from bars, pubs, hookah parlours and such other establishments in Mumbai.Singh also approached courts with his complaint, following which the Bombay high court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-untraceable-maharashtra-minister-says-agencies-trying-to-find-whereabouts-101633029991628.html
01-10-2021||India||Farmers protest near BJP meeting venue in Karnal||KARNAL: Hundreds of farmers on Thursday breached police barricades to protest at the venue of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting at Indri town in Haryana’s Karnal district. Earlier, the district administration had made elaborate security arrangements with the deployment of two companies of paramilitary forces besides the state police personnel. Farmers, who are protesting against the three central farm laws, reached the venue by jumping barricades from the residential colonies. Some farm union leaders told reporters that they wanted to hold a peaceful protest and show black flags to BJP leaders, but police allegedly tried to stop and confine them to a particular spot. Expressing their unhappiness, the protesters then tried to march towards the venue.“We wanted to hold a peaceful protest, but police today again wanted to create a situation of confrontation as was witnessed when they lathicharged farmers at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal recently,” said a farm union leader. The situation came under control after Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Ganga Ram Punia, along with Indri sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sumit Sihag, reached the spot and held a meeting with the farmer leaders. The SP said farmers agreed to hold a protest outside the venue peacefully and assured them that they would not enter the venue and disrupt the meeting. The protest, however, continued until the meeting was over after which the police escorted the leaders of the ruling party out of the venue. BJP’s Karnal district president Yogendra Rana and party legislator from Indri Ram Kumar Kashyap were addressing the meeting, Tridev Sammelan, in which nearly 600 booth-level workers of the party were invited. “The meeting was called as per the party’s directions and such meetings are being called in every assembly segment,” said Rana. MLA Kashyap said everybody has a right to protest in a democratic way, but they should not create disturbance to others. The farmers from all across the country, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament last year. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Charuni) Karnal district president Jagdip Singh Aulakh said they had come to protest at the venue of the BJP’s meeting on the call of Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “It is shameful that the leaders of the ruling party are taking shields in the police vehicles. It seems that the state police were only working for the protection of BJP leaders,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-near-bjp-meeting-venue-in-karnal-101633029751429.html
01-10-2021||India||Telangana: Prashant Kishor to help Jagan’s sister Sharmila chart political roadmap||HyderabadY S Sharmila, president of YSR Telangana Party, a newly-founded regional outfit in Telangana, has engaged the services of political strategist Prashant Kishor to work out a long-term road map for her party for the next assembly elections in the state scheduled to be held in 2023.Kishor had earlier been hired by her brother and YSR Congress party president Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and had played a major role in bringing the party to victory in the 2019 assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh.The strategist also played a major role in the formation of governments in Bihar, Punjab, West Bengal and more recently Tamil Nadu.In an interview to a Telugu television channel telecast on Sunday, Sharmila announced that she had entered into an agreement with Kishor, the founder of Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), for working out strategies for her political party for the next assembly elections in Telangana.Sharmila, in fact, had been in consultations with Kishor much before she announced the launch of her political party in July 8 this year. Initially, Kishor’s close aide Priya Rajendran, daughter of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA R Rajendran, helped Sharmila in the launch of the party and her social media campaign.“Priya was of great help in working out strategies for the party. It has only been in the last few days that Kishor’s team has started working for the party,” a YSRTP leader familiar with the development said.On Wednesday, a team of Kishor’s IPAC held lengthy discussions with Sharmila at her Lotus Pond office in Hyderabad to finalise the blueprint for her proposed padayatra (foot march) across the length and breadth of the state, starting October 20.The team, which will continue to hold a series of meetings with Sharmila in the next few days, will also come out with suggestions to strengthen the party, expand the party network from grassroots level and prepare the party philosophy. “The team will set up its office at Lotus Pond premises itself,” the party leader said.Sharmila, who named her proposed padayatra as “Praja Prasthanam” (People’s journey), is planning to cover 90 out of the 119 assembly constituencies in Telangana over a period of one year.Sharmila chose to kickstart her padayatra from Chevella assembly constituency in Ranga Reddy district, the same place from where her father Y S Rajasekhar Reddy began his padayatra in 2003 and brought the Congress to power in 2004 assembly elections in combined Andhra Pradesh.Sharmila is planning to walk for 12-15 km a day and hopes to complete her walkathon in a year. During her journey, she wants to understand the people’s problems personally and highlight what they had lost in the seven years of Telangana Rashtra Samithi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-prashant-kishor-to-help-jagan-s-sister-sharmila-chart-political-roadmap-101633029691605.html

01-10-2021||India||‘India wasn’t fully in the loop on US-Taliban deal’: Jaishankar explains concerns||New Delhi: India was not taken into confidence on all aspects of the deal signed by the US and the Taliban last year and it still isn’t clear whether Afghanistan will have an inclusive government or whether Afghan soil will not be used for terror, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday.These issues have given rise to justified concerns in India and other countries about the situation in Afghanistan, he said while speaking virtually at the annual leadership summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).Jaishankar described the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad as a grouping that brings together four countries with shared values and a shared vision for the Indo-Pacific, and said it should not be perceived as “some kind of ganging up” against China.Participating in a conversation with former American ambassador Frank Wisner, Jaishankar responded to a question about the threat from recent developments in Afghanistan by saying: “I think to some degree, we’ll all be justified in having levels of concern. And to some degree, the jury is still out.“When I say levels of concern, there were commitments which were made by the Taliban at Doha...The US knows that best, we were not taken into confidence on various aspects of that.”He added, “So, whatever were the deals which were struck in Doha – one has a broad sense but beyond that, are we going to see an inclusive government, are we going to see respect for the rights of women, children and minorities? Most important, are we going to see an Afghanistan whose soil is not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world?”The concerns of India and other countries were captured by the UN Security Council resolution 2593, which was adopted in August, though it remained to be seen how these worries would be addressed, Jaishankar said. India will take its time and study the matter because many of the understandings reached by the US and the Taliban “are not known to the entire international community”, he added.India’s concerns related to Afghanistan were discussed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently met US President Joe Biden in Washington and both countries “are on similar pages at a principal level on many of these issues”.He said: “We have been victims of cross-border terrorism from that region and...that has shaped in many ways our view of some of the neighbours of Afghanistan. How much the US shares that view and where is it that the US makes its tactical compromises, that is for the Americans to figure out.”Jaishankar also said India and the US share some aspects of their assessment of Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan, while there were also aspects “where maybe our positions are not exactly the same”.He described the Quad, which recently held its first in-person leaders’ summit in Washington, as four countries with shared interests and common values that have a high degree of comfort in working together on immediate and long-term concerns in the Indo-Pacific. In the past, these concerns included maritime security, humanitarian aid and military exercises, but the Quad has now moved towards addressing new issues such as Covid-19 vaccines, and principles for design, development, governance and use of technology, and semiconductor supply chains. “The beauty of Quad is precisely because it is not rigid, it is not formal, it’s very comfortable and easy-going. The agenda is made up responding to the requirements of the times,” Jaishankar said.He made it clear that the Quad “is for things, it’s not against somebody”. The grouping works for rule of law, democratic values, freedom of overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes and territorial integrity of states.“I think it’s very important not to be railroaded into some kind of negative discourse which actually is not from our script, it is somebody else’s script,” he said, adding that the members of Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – have the fundamental right to cooperate with partners, and “others should not have a veto on our choices”.Jaishankar indicated the Quad shouldn’t be seen as an anti-China grouping. “The rise of China has had a fundamental impact on the international order. So participants in the international order...need to assess that and respond to that in the light of our own interests. It’s essential to normalise this conversation – this should not end up as though it’s some kind of ganging up and a negatively driven event,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wasn-t-fully-in-the-loop-on-us-taliban-deal-jaishankar-explains-concerns-101633028671323.html
