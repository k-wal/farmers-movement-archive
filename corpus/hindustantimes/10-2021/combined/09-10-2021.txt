09-10-2021||Lucknow||Coal shortage hits power production in UP||The electricity crisis in Uttar Pradesh is deepening with the countrywide coal shortage hitting power generation in the state. Consequently, UP’s share in the power from the Central pool also stands reduced, people dealing with the issue said.Due to the coal shortage, the state is already losing around 8,000 MW of power. As a result, the demand-supply gap has increased to around 4,000 MW in the state even as the demand continues to be more than 20,000 MW. The UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) is trying to manage things by resorting to additional power cuts of six hours in rural and semi-urban areas that are getting power supply for only 12 hours a day these days.“As per the government roster, rural and semi-urban areas are supposed to get power supply for 18 hours but we are not able to provide electricity to them for more than 12 hours due to the reduced availability of electricity in the state,” disclosed a senior UPPCL official requesting anonymity.“However, no additional load shedding is being done in cities including district headquarters,” he added.The total power outage in UP is around 8,000 MW due to the coal crunch. “The power outage is more than 1,200 MW in the state-owned thermal plants and 4,000 MW in the private thermal plants while the state’s share in the power available from the NTPC is also down by around 2,500 MW,” the official disclosed. According to information available on the Central Electricity Authority’s website the UP Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam’s Hariduaganj and Parichha thermal plants have already run out of coal stock while the Obra and Anpa plants are left with stock sufficient for only two-three days each. Similarly, the eight private thermal plants in the state are also left with two-three days’ stock.Utpadan Nigam managing director P Guruprasad said that the daily coal supply had been halved in the state hitting power production in the coal-fired plants. “He said pent up post-Covid demand due to resumption of economic activity, low coal stocks as well as heavy rains last month hampering mining of coal appear to be primarily responsible for the sudden coal and power shortages,” he pointed out. Energy minister Shrikant Sharma said that the crisis had arisen because of the world-wide shortage of coal and the shortage, he added, had naturally hit power production in UP as well. “Despite the tough situation, all efforts are being made to provide power to the people as per the roster. State energy department officials are in regular touch with their counterparts in the coal and power ministries to find a way out,” he said.Sharma further added that the UPPLC had been asked to purchase electricity from all available sources, including the energy exchange, to meet the power demand in the state.Expressing concern over the situation UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Vema demanded that the Centre fix the maximum per unit price of electricity that the energy exchanges sold to the states. “Energy exchanges are trying to take advantage of the crisis by selling power at as high a rate as up to ₹10 per unit. The government must put a price cap,” he demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/coal-shortage-hits-power-production-in-up-101633804176870.html

Delhi Police have said that Sukesh Chandrashekar spoofed a senior government officer’s landline number and called Aditi Singh, wife of Shivinder Singh, the former promoter of Religare Enterprises.

A Tihar Jail officer confirmed that the ED on Saturday took the two prisoners into custody for three days. Police in June registered a case after Singh’s wife filed a complaint. Though police have officially not revealed the amount that Singh’s wife paid, people aware of the investigation said this was at least ₹4 crore.The Delhi Police have arrested at least 13 people in the case, including jail officials, a branch manager of a private bank in Connaught Place and Chandrashekhar’s partner, actor Leena Maria Paul. Paul was arrested on September 5 for helping Chandrashekhar pull off the scam.Chandrashekar was arrested in 2017 by Delhi Police for allegedly duping an All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader of ₹2 crore on the pretext of helping his party retain its two leaves symbol by bribing Election Commission officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-take-actor-leena-maria-paul-partner-into-3-days-remand-101633803885254.html
09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Experts corelate spike in mental health issues among kids to smartphone addiction||Even as gaming addiction has claimed several children’s lives across the country, a study has found that smartphone addiction is to blame for a spike in mental health and behavioural issues among kids, with the tiny tots going as far as banging their skulls against the walls!The coronavirus pandemic, which has shifted our lives from real to virtual, have not helped matters one bit. Ludhiana-based experts say addiction to mobile phones is resulting in increased anger among children and resulting in serious psychological issues. They said that most children turning for treatment are not willing to attend physical classes anymore, and incidents of aggressive and violent behaviour has increased among them.Calling the pandemic the “tragedy of the century”, Dr Ranjive Mahajan, professor and head of psychiatry at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H), said, “The Covid pandemic has left an everlasting impact on physical and mental health of people across the world. In fact, the change in lifestyle that people have been accustomed to for centuries has proven detrimental. The sudden change can trigger serious mental illnesses like depression or anxiety in previously healthy people.” “This rapid transition to digital solutions during the pandemic has exacerbated problems for children’s online safety as well. Children spend more time on learning, socialising and entertainment on virtual platforms, which makes them more vulnerable to online abuse and exploitation. Besides, the transition to online learning due to the pandemic has affected not only the quality of education, but also interpersonal relations between children. Internet bullying, which was already a problem before, has intensified. The limited extracurricular activities has hindered personality development of the youth, which has sown the seeds for future mental illnesses,” Dr Mahajan added.Dr Tarlochan Singh, senior psychologist and HOD of behavioural health at Hunjan Hospital, said that he is currently counselling six children who are addicted to their mobile phones and surfing the internet.“They turn angry and in some cases violent, if their mobile phone is confiscated. In two such cases, the children had smashed their hand against the wall and ended up fracturing it, as their parents took their smartphone from them and asked them to participate in physical and creative activities,” said Dr Tarlochan.Dr Rupesh Chaudhary, professor at DMC&H, highlights that levels of anxiety, fear, isolation, uncertainty and emotional distress have also increased. “Shutting down of schools and shifting of traditional classrooms to digital platforms increased learning inequality among children and pushed a large number of children out of school due to the digital divide— the gap between those who have access to the internet and technology at home and those who do not”, Dr Chaudhary adds.Dr Leenu Gupta, consultant neurologist at Deep Hospital, Ludhiana, “Increase in screen time is leading to behavioural disorders among children of all ages. These disorders cause depressive symptoms, decreased concentration and poor academic performance. Unsupervised smartphone/laptop usage is increasing among children. Children with working parents usually stay at home all by themselves and while parents have allowed their children increased access to the internet for online classes, they have unrestrictedly started engaging in other internet activities such as adult content and violent gaming, which are having serious repercussions on their mental health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-experts-corelate-spike-in-mental-health-issues-among-kids-to-smartphone-addiction-101633803766719.html

09-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Artistes get less time to prepare for Ramlila, yet remain undeterred||Uncertainty loomed large and performers and organisers remained anxious about whether Ramlila, the dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Lord Ram that is staged for 10 days and concludes on Dussehra, will be held this year on account of Covid-19, that forced authorities to cancel the event last year. However, authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar giving the green signal for the 10-day cultural extravaganza only two weeks ago has lifted the spirit of the artistes. Though they are enthusiastic about returning to the stage and reconnecting with the audience, they hope they are able to deliver their best and their performances are not affected, given that they have had very less time to prepare for the theatrical rendition of the Ramayana. The training and rehearsals for this year’s Ramlila were very different from usual with actors connecting over video calls to rehearse their performances and dialogues, and some others rushing to book their vaccination appointments.“This year was filled with uncertainties as we were not very hopeful whether Ramlila will be staged in Noida or not. Still, keeping faith in God, we started virtual rehearsals in September but with only those actors who were fully vaccinated. It was only on September 27 that we got the confirmation that Ramlila will be staged and we were booked by organisers. Then, within 10 days, we had to arrange for dresses, fittings as well as makeup artists and be ready for the play,” said Sudip Arora (50), director at Sriji Kala Manch theatre group from Greater Noida that is staging Ramlila in Sector 62.While every year, the theatre troupe starts practising between July and August, this year the group got only a month’s time to practice.“Every year, we practice for at least two to three months before the Ramlila but this year, we could practice only for a month. However, our actors have worked hard and we hope the lack of practice does not affect their performances,” said Rakesh Ratnakar (62), director at Ratnakar Dramatic Art Production theatre group from Delhi, that will be staging Ramlila at the Noida Stadium in Sector 21A.Ujjwal Rana (22), who will be essaying the role of ‘Ram’ for the rendition that will be performed at Noida Stadium, was at his hometown in Himachal Pradesh when he got to know he has been selected for the role.“Since colleges are conducting online classes, I have been in my hometown since the pandemic began. However, since I have been active in theatre, our guruji knew about me and told me that I have been selected for the role of Ram this year. Since the rehearsals were online, I attended most of the sessions from my hometown and came to Noida just last week,” said Rana, who is pursuing masters of mass communication at an institute in Noida’s Sector 16.As soon as their roles in Ramlila were confirmed, some actors said they had to rush for their second vaccination doses as it was made mandatory by the Ramlila organizers.“I crossed my date for the second vaccination dose in August and was not able to find a slot at that time. In September, when we were told we can participate only if we are fully vaccinated, it almost became an emergency for me to book a slot. I used to log in on the Cowin portal every night to book a slot. It took me three days but I managed to book a slot and got fully vaccinated,” said Mohit Sharma (23), a resident of Ghaziabad, who will be playing Raavan’s role at Sector 62. Amit Bharti (37), who is playing four roles, including that of Kumbhkaran for the Ramlila that will be staged at Noida Stadium, said he was disappointed last year when the event was cancelled in Noida.“Though I am a businessman by profession, I have been a part of Ramlila since the last 15 years and look forward to essaying different characters on stage all year long. Last year was hard for the community of actors who perform in Ramlila but we accepted the decision,” said Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-artistes-get-less-time-to-prepare-for-ramlila-yet-remain-undeterred-101633802856662.html

09-10-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati plays up ‘soft Hindutva’ as BJP readies for Dalit-connect rallies||LUCKNOW: In line with majority of political parties tapping soft Hindutva ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said if elected to power her government would continue with the present Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s focus on development of Hindu religious cities of Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi (Varanasi) and other religious places. “My government will not hamper the ongoing development work in Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi and ensure that all projects get completed,” she declared on Saturday. The BSP, seeking a replay of the Dalit-Brahmin social chemistry that propelled the party to power on its own strength in 2007, has been wooing Brahmins. Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi or Varanasi are the three Hindu religious hotspots in UP where the BJP government in UP has been pushing for development. Projects worth several crores have been started in these places by BJP and these projects,, especially in Ayodhya, are being monitored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Office (PMO) and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Mayawati, however, claimed that the ruling party had copied the BSP model by launching these projects in Hindu hotspots. “The BJP, taking a cue from the BSP government,, introduced development projects in Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura and other religious places. But these projects are as yet incomplete and we will ensure that they projects get completed,” she said, making it evident that along with her Dalit politics she would add a dash of soft Hindutva to her UP poll campaign. Some BJP leaders felt that Mayawati’s play of ‘Hindutva’ had been forced by the party’s decision to expand its appeal among Jatavs, the Dalit sub-caste to which Mayawati belongs. “There is a feeling that there has been a steady breach in Mayawati ji’s Dalit vote bank, which has been leaning towards the BJP, especially since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. After its sweep in 2014 LS polls, the BJP had won 71 of the 85 seats reserved seats in 2017 UP polls, underlying the significance of Dalits along with others in BJP’s handsome win. In 2019, the BSP did win 10 Lok Sabha seats in alliance with Samajwadi Party but 2022 is her big test, especially as BJP, with its development plank and religious appeal, has begun targeting Jatavs too,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political observer. He felt that Mayawati had responded to the BJP’s attempts to poach on her core Dalit Jatav voters, by playing the Hindutva card. The BJP has only recently decided to get Baby Rani Maurya, its current national vice president, a Jatav, to hold rallies across UP with the avowed intention of getting Jatavs to veer towards the BJP. Maurya was recently made to quit as Uttarakhand governor and made party’s national vice president, making it evident that the BJP leadership had planned to woo Maya’s core supporters through her. The BJP has also elevated another woman Dalit leader Kanta Kardam from Meerut, by making her a Rajya Sabha MP. Another Jatav in UP BJP government is GS Dharmesh, a minister of state and who like Maurya, also hails from Agra where Dalits make up about 20 per cent of the population. Overall, Dalits make up about 21 per cent of UP’s electorate and of these, Jatavs make up for around 11 per cent. Mayawati’s plan is to get around 10 to 11 per cent Brahmins in UP too to support her as they did in 2007 when she had won 206 of the 403 seats, say party leaders. “In Prayagraj, while attending a ‘prabuddh varg sammelan’ Satish Chandra Mishra had played up the 2007 slogan: “Brahmin shankh bajayega, haathi chalta jaiyega (Brahmins will blow the conch shell, elephant (BSP’s symbol) will triumphantly march ahead),” a BSP leader said, adding that the focus was on expanding the party’s voter base while holding on to one’s base vote. “That’s the model all the political parties are following. One distinct advantage that the BSP has over others is that in our party, the command structure is clear. Lesser time is wasted, so leadership’s directions are quickly implemented,” the BSP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-plays-up-soft-hindutva-as-bjp-readies-for-dalit-connect-rallies-101633802436531.html
09-10-2021||Lucknow||Cases of depression, anxiety have gone up during pandemic, say experts||Cases of depression, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder have gone up manifold among people of all age groups during the pandemic, said doctors.“Students have got addicted to screen and have shown changes in behaviour much to the dislike of parents. Now, parents have to play a greater role in diverting the child’s energy into activities that give similar kick to the brain as does mobile phones,” said Dr Mohd Aleem Siddiqui, addressing a press conference on “mental health in an unequal world” at IMA Bhavan on Saturday, a day before World Mental Health Day. He added that during the first and second waves of Covid-19, many people lost their kin and many are still facing financial crises. “Even after the Covid period, people have been suffering from sleeplessness, irritability. We get frequent calls from such people,” said Dr Siddiqui. Dr Omar Musheer, consultant psychiatrist at Apollomedics Superspeciality Hospital said: “About 20-30% of the people, who have been affected with Covid, were found to experience post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. People are unable to sleep properly because of stress.” Also during the day, King George’s Medical University organised a webinar on the topic. “Among elderly the key issue is loneliness. During pandemic they were virtually locked up inside their houses and even today the risk of getting infected is keeping them restricted from walking in parks or open spaces. With a long spell of isolation the impact upon mental health has been tremendous,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, head of Aastha Geriatric Centre. Dr Shantanu Bharti, psychiatric consultant, Medanta Hospital, said: “The pandemic has made us all realize that mental health issues are real and everyone faces them at some point in their life. It is very important to take care of your brain just like it is important to take care of other body parts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cases-of-depression-anxiety-have-gone-up-during-pandemic-say-experts-101633802256583.html
09-10-2021||Noida||Firms in GB Nagar enlist mental health specialists to help staff tackle stress||In the past one and a half years, working professionals across the globe have gone from going to work to working from home (WFH). As Gautam Budh Nagar is a hub of corporate firms with a large number of working professionals living here, mental health specialists have reported a rise in work-related psychological stress among their patients.The World Health Organisation (WHO) observes October 10 as World Mental Health day in order to raise awareness of mental health issues and mobilize efforts in support of mental health.According to Dr Samir Parikh from Noida’s Fortis Hospital, the number of corporate and IT professionals reaching out to mental health specialists in the city has increased in the past year.“WFH has brought about a drastic change in lifestyle and a lot of employees could not cope up with it. There is lack of social connect, no physical contact, no time or space boundaries between work and professional life and so on. As a result, we are seeing a spike in the number of patients who are reeling under work-related stress and having issues such as problems in sleeping, burnouts, anxiety and uncertainty regarding the future, work and life,” said Dr Parikh, director of mental health & behavioural sciences at Fortis Healthcare.The WFH structure, which became the global norm after the pandemic, has after a year and a half now, started showing signs of mental fatigue, say experts.“Social isolation, long work hours and multitasking has affected mental health of many working professionals. Sleep disorders, mood swings, interpersonal conflicts and depression are some of the psychological and clinical manifestations of WFH. The initial advantage of WFH, such as saving on the commuting time, flexibility in working, spending time with the family, has gradually been dwarfed by mental distress, anxiety and depression,” said Dr Priyanka Srivastava, consultant, department of behavioural sciences, Jaypee Hospital (Noida).In Gautam Budh Nagar, a number of corporate firms are helping their employees deal with mental stress and facilitating mental health specialists for them. “Corporate firms have started having discussions around mental health, more so since the pandemic hit us. Since the last one year, we have been conducting virtual sessions with at least eight companies in the city every month,” added Dr Parikh.At Tech Mahindra, located at Noida’s Special Economic Zone in Sector 82, professional counsellors and experts have been roped in for the employees.“The mental health specialists organize various wellness webinars like ‘ease your stress’, for our employees, to help them manage stress and build resilience. We have also introduced ‘mind plan’, a mental health initiative that will provide daily doses of mindful tips and exercises to help our employees relax and feel positive during challenging times,” said Harshvendra Soin, global chief people officer and head, marketing, Tech Mahindra.Similar initiatives have been taken at Barco India--an electronics firm in Sector 64. “We have initiated a month-long ‘let’s address the elephant in the room’ campaign on World Mental Health Day to help employees discover ways to address and enhance their emotional well-being. We have also roped in a firm that offers professional psychological counselling and comprehensive wellness programme for our employees,” said Rajiv Bhalla, managing director, Barco.Some firms are also training their managers to be supportive and be aware of their subordinates’ mental well being. “Since Covid-19 continues to throw challenges, we have roped in mental health professionals who hold sessions for the senior management so that managers can not only manage their own mental well being but also become a guide and mentor for the employees,” said Agendra Kumar, managing director, Esri India, a technology firm located in Sector 16.Dr Abhay Singh Tomar, a psychiatrist at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, advises confiding in colleagues or family members at the onset of stress.“Often mental health disorders worsen when people bottle it up and don’t talk about it. My advice to anyone suffering from distress at work is to seek a friend, colleague or a family member to confide in. One should also take small breaks while working at home to avoid getting bogged down by stress,” said Dr Tomar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/firms-in-gb-nagar-enlist-mental-health-specialists-to-help-staff-tackle-stress-101633801780838.html

In the book, he has narrated the lifestyle, freedom and above all the liberty which people in those times used to enjoy,” said Indu Prakash, one of the speakers, while admiring the book.Akarshan Jain, one of the organisers of the National Book Fair, said the present Afghanistan-Taliban conflict and deteriorating political scenario in Afghanistan made the book even all the more interesting as by reading the book, people will get a fair idea about the Afghanistan of 1970s when people there were all smiles.Jain said being an archaeologist, the author had also covered several historical places and explained how rich the country used to be in terms of heritage structures now in a shambles. The book was released in the presence of senior journalist and author Haricharan Prakash, senior journalist Dr Atal Tiwari, archaeologist Dr Shamoon Ahmed and archaeologist Indu Prakash. Other books, including “Prarambhik Shiksha-Vyanktitva Vikas” and “Kathputli” were also released during the day. Akarshan Jain said several competition and cultural programmes were also organised during the event that would conclude on Sunday.

09-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Four offer lift to man, rob him of ₹15,000 cash at gunpoint||A man was allegedly robbed of ₹15,000 cash at gunpoint by four men who offered him a lift in a car to Rabupura in Greater Noida on Saturday night. The victim, identified as 30-year-old Shyam Kumar, works at a restaurant in Delhi. Kumar told police that he received his salary on Friday and decided to go to his hometown in Rabupura village the next morning. “I took a bus from Noida’s Sector 37 and reached Greater Noida. I was waiting for a bus to Rabupura at Zero Point on the Yamuna Expressway when four suspects reached there in a black car. The suspects offered me a lift saying they were going towards Rabupura,” said Kumar adding that he boarded the car. In his complaint with the police, Kumar said that on the way, the suspects overpowered him at gunpoint and snatched his cash. “The suspects also thrashed me for resisting the robbery. They removed the battery of my mobile phone to ensure I do not make calls to the police. They dropped me near Chapargadh village and fled the spot,” said Kumar in his complaint. Kumar added that he wanted to pay the school fee of his two children with the remuneration he received. With the help of a passerby, he informed police about the matter. Anil Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Sector Beta 2 police station, said a case has been registered against unknown persons under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code. “We are scanning CCTV footage of the expressway to zero in on the suspects and arrested them,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-four-offer-lift-to-man-rob-him-of-15-000-cash-at-gunpoint-101633801778189.html

A common sight near Bahlolpur village in Sector 63, the garbage was set ablaze allegedly by some ragpickers on Pushta road along the Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad (FNG) Expressway, locals said. The residents’ welfare association (RWA) members of Bahlolpur on Saturday also shared some videos of the burning garbage on social media. Stating that the garbage dumping and burning have become a menace in their area, they said the waste from the local vegetable market was burnt during the afternoon and kept smouldering till evening.“We have complained several times about the garbage burning to the authority officials. It often happens that garbage is set ablaze and we have to call the fire department to douse the flames. The authority workers clean the area, but garbage is dumped in the night and set afire next day. The residents suffer as the foul smell reaches out to their houses,” said Sonu Yadav, vice-president of Bahlolpur RWA, Sector 63, who shared the video on social media.According to environmentalists, the issue is concerning given the fact that the administration recently released winter action plan for pollution mitigation.“It’s a continuing issue and happens primarily because the authority is least bothered about it. It’s dangerous especially when the air quality has started to deteriorate,” said Vikrant Tongad, a Noida-based environmentalist.The action plan prepared by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) was released on October 6 by the district administration that also asks for formation of quick response teams to check open burning, among other measures. UPPCB officials said that they will look into the incident. “Open burning of the garbage is banned throughout the year anyway. I will direct the officials concerned to check the same,” said Utsav Sharma, acting regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.Noida authority officials could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Noida generates around 700 tonnes of domestic waste daily. The door-to-door garbage collection covers 220 high-rises having 140,000 apartments, about 98 RWAs having 40,000 houses and about 70 small and big villages within the city, the officials said.After collection, the garbage goes to 21 different transfer stations of the Noida authority, where the waste is separated manually with the help of ragpickers and later sent to the main storage facility at Sector 145.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/garbage-set-afire-days-after-noida-gets-action-plan-to-combat-pollution-101633801656885.html

Officials of the district health department said they are conducting extensive drives of fogging and eliminating mosquito breeding spots, both in urban and rural areas, to curb the spread of dengue. According to officials, as many as 20 dengue cases were reported on Saturday. The first dengue case reported this year was on September 1 and the tally of the cases arising from the vector borne disease stood at 312 till September 30, indicating an average of 10.4 cases per day. With 147 more cases till October 9, the incidence of dengue has increased to 15.87 cases per day. Of the 459 patients, 320 of them required admission in hospitals, taking the rate of hospitalisation to 69.71%. According to officials, dengue cases are still on the rise and increasing at a faster rate.  “Our teams are regularly carrying out fogging and anti-larvae activities; each and every case is being mapped for containment exercise in the locality. We have also deployed four ambulances in rural areas to attend to patients in need. We are expecting the dengue cases to decline after October 15, which has been the trend over past years,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. The positivity rate of dengue is also on the higher side. According to official records, till October 9, the district conducted 1,572 tests for dengue, of which 459 returned positive. The positivity rate stands at 29.19%. So far, the district has reported 16 cases of malaria of the 27,102 tests it has conducted for the disease. The sample positivity rate of is about 0.05%. According to officials, areas like Govindpuram, Harsaon, Vijay Nagar, Raj Nagar Extension, Shastri Nagar, Nyaya Khand 1 and 2 in Indirapuram, Gyan Khand and Ahimsa Khand 1 in Indirapuram and Prahlad Garhi have high incidence of dengue cases, and likely accounts for 250 of the total cases. Experts said dengue cases have not seen any decline so far. “It is expected that the dengue cases, like in previous years, will subside only after Deepawali. The figures of the district health department could be less as the hospitals are receiving many dengue patients,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). Officials from the health department said chances of under reporting of dengue cases are less. “Our teams call up hospitals and nursing homes on a daily basis to gather information about new admissions. Moreover, they are also required to send a sample of each patient for a dengue confirmatory test in our laboratory. It is only after confirmation that cases are declared positive. Hence, the chances of under reporting are negligible,” said Dr Gupta. Apart from dengue and malaria, cases of scrub typhus have also been reported in the district. However, the tally of scrub typhus has stood at 39 since September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-147-dengue-cases-in-first-nine-days-of-october-tally-now-459-101633801603681.html

Only two lanes, out of four, on the Noida-Greater Noida side of the expressway are currently operational due to an underpass work. After the cave-in incident, only one lane was operational on Saturday, officials said. Anil Nigam, a resident of Noida’s Sector 49 and dean of journalism department at a Greater Noida college, said that he was stuck in a traffic jam for more than an hour on Saturday morning. “There was at least 2km jam around 8.30am on the expressway. There were no officials from the traffic police at the spot. Due to confusion, some commuters started taking U-turn which added to the traffic mess,” he said. Nigam also tweeted some photos from the spot drawing attention of the officials.The cave-in took place due to an underpass work through box push technology, officials of the Noida authority said, adding that the situation on the stretch will be normal in 10 days. “A portion of the road caved in around 6.30pm on Friday which resulted in traffic jam. We have deployed a team to fix the problem,” said PK Kaushik, general manager, Noida authority.In the box push technology, the reinforced cement concrete (RCC) boxes are pushed with the help of hydraulic jacks to create a subway tunnel under the road. This ensures the traffic movement on the road does not disturb due to the work. Another authority official, who wished anonymity, said there are four lanes on the expressway. “The two right lanes were blocked last week due to the construction work. The traffic movement on the two left lanes were functional. After the cave-in incident on Friday evening, we restricted the movement on that lane for repair works,” he said. The Noida traffic police diverted the Greater Noida bound traffic to service lane near Mahamaya Flyway in Sector 93. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the two right lanes are blocked while one of the left lanes is unpaved due to Friday’s cave-in and repairing works. “The navigation of vehicles is not smooth on the stretch,” he said. Saha said that the traffic police personnel have been deployed at the spot to guide commuters. “We also took to social media to inform commuters about the diversion. We have also deployed a crane, in case a vehicle breaks down at the spot,” he said. The authority started the work on the 434-metre underpass in June 2020 with an aim to provide smooth connectivity between Sector 137/142 and Sector 168, located along the expressway. The underpass is estimated to be ready by December 10, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-jam-on-noida-expressway-as-portion-of-road-caves-in-101633801602371.html

Special judge/ additional sessions judge, MP/MLA court had granted bail to Gayatri Prajapati in July this year. A single judge bench of Justice Rajeev Singh on October 5 said: “Till the next date of listing, operation and implementation of the order dated 14.07.2021 in case crime no. 537 of 2020, under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 506, 386, 388,120-B I.P.C., police station-Ghazipur, District Lucknow, shall be kept in abeyance.”“District and Sessions Judge, Lucknow, is directed to send the complete record of Bail Application no. 08 of 2021 decided by Special Judge, M.P. M.L.A./Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.19, Lucknow, forthwith,” the court said.Appearing on behalf of the state government, additional advocate general Vinod Kumar Shahi opposed the bail order granted by the MP/MLA court. Shahi apprised the court that Prajapati had been in prison since March 15, 2017 after being arrested in a case of gang rape of a 40-year-old woman and attempt to rape her minor daughter and a first information report (FIR) in another case was lodged against him on September 17, 2020. “This means Gayatri Prajapati was having criminal history. But this fact was not considered by the court (MP/MLA court) while granting bail,” argued Shahi. While granting bail to Prajapati, the court (MP/MLA court) had observed that the prosecution (government advocate) had not placed any criminal history of the opposite party (Gayatri Prajapati) before the court. Shahi apprised the court about seven criminal cases lodged against Prajapati. The court listed the case for next hearing on November 16. AAG’s submission before the court Additional advocate general (AAG) Vinod Kumar Shahi submitted before the court that a lady, after she was allegedly administered some intoxicating substance, was subsequently raped by the opposite party (Gayatri Prajapati) as well as other accused persons and obscene photographs of the victim were clicked. On the basis of same, she was being blackmailed and forced to have physical relations with the accused persons, Shahi apprised the court. She had filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India before the Supreme Court seeking registration of an FIR against Gayatri Prajapati as the FIR was not being lodged because he was a minister in the then ruling government (Samajwadi Party), Shahi told the court. The Supreme Court passed an order on February 17, 2017, in the aforesaid writ petition and directed the police station concerned to register the FIR on basis of the complaint and further directed the police to investigate the matter and submit its report in a sealed cover within seven weeks from the date of order. Thereafter, an FIR was lodged at the Gautam Palli police station, Lucknow, on February 18, 2017, against Gayatri Prasad Prajapati, Ashok Tiwari, Pintu Singh, Vikash Verma, Chandra Pal, Rupesh and Ashish Shukla under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hc-stays-mp-mla-court-order-granting-bail-to-ex-minister-prajapati-101633801296526.html

He reiterated that his government decided to withdraw all cases registered against farmers for burning crop residue.Yogi Adityanath made these points in a meeting of party’s lawmakers from Braj and Kanpur regions at his official residence in Lucknow.“Neither has the government snapped any power connection of farmers due to non-payment of bills nor does it intend to do so in the future,” Yogi Adityanath said at a time when the government has been under fire over the killing of eight people, including four farmers, in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence of October 3.Union minister of state for home and BJP MP Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra is the prime accused in the violence.“We have also decided to withdraw all cases registered on farmers for burning crop residue. We are also planning to launch a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme under which all interest on pending farmer bills would be waived,” Yogi Adityanath said. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who has been named head of the party’s election panel for UP, the party’s current UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal were also present during the meeting. Yogi Adityanath has been meeting BJP lawmakers in a phased manner in the run-up to the 2022 UP polls. He had met the party’s lawmakers from the Awadh region of central UP on Friday. For organisational purposes, the BJP has demarcated the state into six organisational regions. “Three nodes of the defence corridor are in Kanpur region and in Bundelkhand great development has been done,” Yogi Adityanath said while tasking the lawmakers to ensure the benefits of the government schemes reach majority of the people. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the world was watching Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2022 state assembly election and that is why a campaign was underway to malign the image of the state. “A malicious campaign to malign the state, to magnify small things is on. We are a party whose cadre is committed to the country. We need to stay united, focused and vigilant,” he said. UP BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal said that the party, set to embark on a membership drive, plans to add 1.5 crore new members by December. Bansal said all lawmakers and party functionaries would participate in the party campaign that would be undertaken in each of the 1.63 lakh booths across the state. “We are also undertaking a campaign to cross check the voter lists.

What to expect||The Uttarakhand government is mulling to make the state's anti-conversion law more stringent and a proposal to this effect has already been sought from the state police chief. According to a report carried by PTI, the Pushkar Dhami government is contemplating to tighten the law as it apprehends the worsening of communal amity amid demographic changes in some regions of the state.The state police department has already sent a two-page proposal to the government, with recommendations to amend the anti-conversion law on the lines of Uttar Pradesh.Speaking to PTI, Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar said that the police have recommended to make the acts of forcible religious conversion a cognisable offence with a sentence of a minimum three-year jail term to the maximum of 10 years along with a fine of ₹25,000.As per the current law, a forcible conversion is a non-cognisable offence and requires the complainant to file a complaint in a court seeking its directions to the police to register an FIR.If the new proposal were to come into effect, then the state police will be authorised to lodge an FIR on its own without needing any court direction.The proposal is currently being examined, PTI quoted Additional Chief Secretary Abhinav Kumar of Chief Minister Dhami as saying.The government's decision to tighten the law follows an attack by miscreants at a church in Roorkee of Haridwar district for allegedly promoting mass conversion. The state government had last month directed police to act against the consistent migration of people of a particular community amid the rising population of another community in a particular region of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-mulls-to-make-anti-conversion-law-more-stringent-what-to-expect-101633799397044.html
09-10-2021||Lucknow||Ahead of UP election, Maya seeks ban on pre-poll surveys||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday reiterated her demand for Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award, for her mentor and BSP founder Kanshi Ram even as she sought a ban on pre-poll surveys ahead of UP assembly election to be held early next year.She said she will write to the Election Commission demanding surveys by media organisations and other agencies be banned six months before any election so that the polls in the particular state are not influenced by it.Addressing BSP cadres in Lucknow on the occasion of Kanshi Ram’s 15th death anniversary at a memorial built in his memory, Mayawati said “I bow my head to Kanshi Ram ji on this occasion.” She cited the case of pre-poll surveys that projected losses for Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in West Bengal assembly election. “Ahead of polls, Mamata Banerjee was shown trailing but when results came in, she won by an overwhelming majority and hopes of those dreaming to attain power were shattered,” she said. Accusing some agencies of being in “dhandha” (business) of pre-poll survey, Mayawati said a ban on pre-poll surveys was necessary to stop this. Mayawati has in the recent past too has shown her displeasure at such pre-poll surveys predicting gains for BJP and alleged that it was part of a conspiracy to underplay her party’s impact ahead of the 2022 UP polls. Claiming that people in UP have made up their mind to unseat the BJP, Mayawati alleged that the ruling party’s governments at the centre and in UP were misusing official machinery for electoral gains. “I would appeal to people to not waste their vote on BJP,” she said. She also claimed that the BJP could give a communal twist to things ahead of 2022 UP polls. “It is known that BJP ultimately resorts to giving Hindu-Muslim spin and seeks advantage through polarisation,” she said urging the cadres to be wary of such things. BJP’s former ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and a Dalit organisation Bhim Army led by Chandrashekhar Azad are active ahead of the polls. SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar has claimed that Azad would be part of his Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, an organisation comprising various smaller caste-based parties. Without naming any particular smaller party, Mayawati cautioned the cadres against them too. “Various smaller parties or organisations are there wanting to contest elections independently or together. But their main aim is not to win elections but to discreetly help the ruling party,” she alleged.She also alleged that ahead of the polls, the BJP government had started resorting to caste politics and cited the recent foundation stone laying function of a university in name of a Jat community leader and unveiling of a statue of a leader of Gurjar community in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ahead-of-up-election-maya-seeks-ban-on-pre-poll-surveys-101633799496153.html

The body of the deceased was handed over to his relatives after a post-mortem examination around 1pm, following which they left for Shamli in Uttar Pradesh to perform the last rites.Officials of the SGT University said that staff and students had gone along with the victim’s family to attend the last rites. “We are shocked by the incident as there has been no such incident in the past. We have increased security and screening on the campus,” Rajneesh Yadav, a spokesperson for the university, said.A condolence meeting was also held on the campus on Saturday, which was attended by the university staff and management, said Yadav. “We are also installing more CCTV cameras to keep a strict vigil on the campus,” he said.Vineet Kumar, a 24-year old student of SGT University in Budhera, located around 10 kilometres from Gurugram, was shot dead on Friday afternoon on the campus by a student of the same institution over a personal rivalry. Kumar was pursuing a BAMS degree, while the accused, Lucky, was pursuing a law degree. A case of murder was registered against Lucky, a resident of Najafgarh, and his accomplices.“My son is extremely disturbed by the murder and he is badly depressed. I took him to a doctor on Friday evening and again today (Saturday) to get some medicine so that his stress can be released. He is also completely confused as he and his friends can’t process the murder incident,” the father of a student, who was also a BAMS student and had gone to Shamli for the last rites, said.He said, “A number of students have come from Gurugram to attend the cremation and they are shocked. My son insisted on going along, so I brought him, but he is not in a condition to speak. He is quite nervous after being questioned by the police and even we are not feeling comfortable.”A group of students also held a march on the campus on Friday evening in homage to Kumar.

We have already identified 13 hotspots and more areas are being identified. Next week, the district task force will also be meeting, after which the number of hotspots might be increased. The peak for dengue cases is likely to hit by October end or early November.”According to the health department data, over the past five years, 86, 66, 94, 22 and 51 cases of dengue were recorded in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.Officials said that this year, over 2,000 samples have been collected for the dengue test in the district so far.Doctors from hospitals across the city said that over the past few weeks, the maximum number of patients at the out-patient department have been complaining of viral fever, high fever, cold or cough.At Civil Hospital in Sector 10, almost 90% beds of the hospitals are occupied with patients suffering from viral fever, while 10 of the 30 beds in the dengue ward are currently occupied.Dr Manish Rathi, deputy medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, said, “Around 500 patients walk in with fever or similar symptoms in the OPD for our internal medicine department. Most of the beds in the hospital are occupied by patients suffering from viral fever.”Dr Amitabh Parti, director (internal medicine), Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said, “At this point in time, there must be at least eight to 10 patients of dengue and the criterion for hospitalisation is when platelet count is 50,000 and below. Since last week, there has been a surge of 15-20% in the number of dengue cases. Fewer than 5% of those patients require transfusions when the platelet count drops to below 20,000, but most of them are recovering on their own. So, the severity of dengue cases is much less. Dengue shock syndrome or dengue haemorrhage is very rare.”Last week, the district administration had also issued two helpline numbers, 18001801817 and 0124-44055779, for residents to request fogging drives in their areas from 9am to 5pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-case-count-reaches-108-ahead-of-predicted-november-peak-101633798837307.html

The school parking areas can be used for parking after school gets over after 2pm till the time the markets stay open.Most people unaware of parking spacesEven though every year such parkings spaces are assigned, most people don’t use them because they are generally too far from the markets or residents aren’t aware of them.Speaking about this, CBM president Charanjiv Singh said, “This year we will request all markets to put up visible boards at the entrances to tell people about these parkings. Many markets will also designate volunteers to ensure people park properly and to guide them to the makeshift parkings.”During the festive season, the traffic police also put up barricades and make roads one-way outside some of the busier markets including Sectors 22 and 19. Speaking about this, Singh added that the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal hadn’t written about this to the authorities yet but MWAs could contact the authorities by themselves in case the arrangement was needed.Chief spokesperson Diwakar Sahoonja added that they will work with the traffic cops posted in various markets to ensure that people didn’t have to suffer.List of designated parking lots during festive season1.

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Cash-starved Ramlilas struggling to stay afloat||Even though most Ramlilas have started in the city, organisers are adopting the no-frills approach owing to a major cash crunch in post-Covid times.The Ramlila in Vikas Nagar of Mauli Jagran remains the worst affected, so much so that the organisers have decided not to open the show this year owing to a shortage of funds.One of the organisers, Bobby Mehta, said, “For organising a Ramlila, we need a minimum ₹2 lakh. I run a tea stall in Ram Darbar, but I would still contribute ₹50,000 per year. Now, none of us have that kind of money.”Mehta added that it was unfortunate that political parties never hesitated to use their stage for spreading their own political messages in the past, but none had come forward to help them. “Conducting a Ramlila every year is a sacred service, but it is out of our hands now. I hope people can help us next year. In 2020 too, we were unable to hold the Ramlila,” he said.Recycling costumes to save costsFrom the OCF Sanskritic Manch, Sector 29, senior artiste Jyoti Bhardwaj said, “In previous years we would have three to four musicians, but this year we are using pre-recorded music to save on costs.” He added that they were also re-using the costumes from previous years and no money was spent on new dresses or props.Most Ramlilas have asked their patrons, the viewers, and even the performers to donate funds to run the Ramlila.BP Gaur with the Garhwal Ramleela Avam Sanskritic Mandal in Sector 22C said that the performers had contributed ₹10,000 of their own to keep the Ramlila running. “Performing the Ramlila is a sacred duty. While times are difficult we will keep the show on the simpler side, but we won’t give up,” he said.Some Ramlila organisations are also disheartened by the donations they are receiving. Vice-president of the Sector-20 Ramlila, Ashok Choudhary, said, “Definitely there is an effect on the spending capacity of people and they can mostly only spare around ₹500. Even some of our donors with the deepest pockets have been more cautious with their money this time. Earlier we would receive donations over ₹1 lakh, but now they haven’t gone over ₹21,000.”Director of the Sector-17 Ramlila, Rajinder Bagga, however said that even though the organisers themselves had to put in money, he was inspired by how people were still helping them even when they were facing problems of their own, and Ramlilas were also working with what they had to do their best.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-cash-starved-ramlilas-struggling-to-stay-afloat-101633798061392.html

09-10-2021||Ranchi||Police opt for awareness campaign as opium trade continues to flourish in Chatra||With opium cultivation and smuggling of cannabis and other drugs having grown into a menace in Jharkhand’s Chatra, the district police are set to launch an awareness campaign against opium trade with special focus on highlighting its health hazards, even for those involved in its cultivation, besides stringent penal provisions that can lead up to death penalty.The heavily forested and Maoist-infested Chatra district in the coal-bearing North Chhotangpur division has been a den of opium cultivation in the state, with several small and marginal farmers being involved in it allegedly having support of outlawed CPI (Maoists) and their splinter groups.Till recent pasts, the district administration would deny that it was an organized crime and their action and would be limited to occasional raiding in the interior forest areas and destroying the standing crop. However, the district administration has now decided to launch an awareness campaign to educate people about the practice, besides continuing to crackdown against the syndicate involved in the crime.“We can’t deny the fact that we have a problem at hand and we need to solve it. The police has been cracking down against those involved in the crime and have done several seizures of opium and drugs and have made several arrests. While the crackdown continues, we also want to educate people about the different dynamics of the illegal trade,” said Chatra superintendent of police, Rakesh Ranjan.As per data provided by the district police, from January 1, 2021 to October 6, 2021, the police have registered 123 cases related to the trade and arrested 129 persons. In this period, the police seized 605.77kg opium, 61.65 quintal of Doda (dried opium stem), 2.621 kg brown sugar, 120kg of Posta (poppy seeds), besides vehicles ranging from two-wheelers to trucks, arms and ammunition and cash.Most forested areas in the district,including Pratapur, Lawalong, Rajpur and Hunterganj--which also share border with Bihar--are some of the areas where opium cultivation is done, sources said. The awareness campaign of the police is largely aimed at reaching out to people explaining them about the health hazards, environmental impact as well as stringent legal provisions. Banners and posters having messages on those counts are being installed at several locations in the state, said the SP.Symbolically, one of the banners was unveiled by chief minister Hemant Soren during his visit to Chatra last week for an inaugural function.The banners spread the message about impact of opium cultivation on forest and soil degradation, impact on health of pregnant woman and the growth of unborn babies, and legal provisions such as capital punishment.“We have planned to target the family as a unit to create awareness because most of the members are involved in it. Also, most of them are not aware of many of these things. For example, law even provides for capital punishment under Section 31 (A) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Those involved will ultimately be chased down even if they are practising in deep forests, as we are using drones to detect such fields,” said Ranjan.The officer said the police, in association with the district civil administration, is also educating and encouraging people to take up alternative agricultural practices and grow other cash crops.“Some farmers have started saffron cultivation in the district. We are encouraging farmers, in association with the department concerned, that they grow such produce which are equally rewarding. We are also engaging the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in our efforts,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/police-opt-for-awareness-campaign-as-opium-trade-continues-to-flourish-in-chatra-101633796495972.html

A forest department team was rushed to the spot to bring the carcass to the Katarniaghat forest range office, he said.Prima facie, the tiger was 3-4 years old, DFO said, adding no external injury marks were found on the carcass. A panel of veterinarians will conduct a post-mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death, he added.Senior Indian Forest Service officer Ramesh Kumar Pandey, an expert in tiger conservation, said as per the standard operating procedure of the National TigerConservation Authority (NTCA), every tiger death is considered as unnatural unless proven otherwise.To prove a tiger’s death as natural, one has to rule out all other angles like poaching and poisoning, he explained.It is very rare for a tiger to be found dead in water because big cats are good swimmers, he said.(WITH PTI INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tiger-carcass-found-floating-in-uttar-pradesh-canal-101633796435984.html

Likewise, Malleshwaram, in Bengaluru, has also initiated a 24x7 vaccination mega camp, after its success in Patna,” said Mansoon Mohanty, team lead for Patna district resource unit of Care India. “Other places like Jharkhand’s Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Jamshedpur; Udaipur in Rajasthan; Bhopal, Panna, Balaghat and Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Lucknow and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi (NCR) have mega camps, which operate 12 to 15 hours a day,” he said. All mega camps, hosted in our collaboration in other states, have been initiated in August and September, after their success in Patna, where we launched them in June,” said Mohanty. The 24x7 vaccination mega camps at the government polytechnic in Patliputra Colony, hotel Patliputra Ashok on Beer Chand Patel Path and the Patliputra stadium at Kankerbagh, managed by the Care India in Patna, have administered over 50% doses to the nearly 12 lakh urban population of Patna, said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate (DM). Patna, which has an estimated target population of 4,424,678 to vaccinate, is a success story as far as Covid vaccination in Bihar is concerned. It has done better than the state and national average and tops among 38 districts in the state in terms of administering Covid doses to beneficiaries. With a total of 5,193,789 doses administered till 6.30 pm till October 7, Patna has a first dose coverage of around 76% and 58% second dose achievement against the first shot. The state’s vaccination coverage was 64% and 28%, respectively, as on October 7(6.40 pm). Around 26.3% had been fully vaccinated with both doses in India, while the country’s first dose coverage was 70.1%, as of 7am on October 3. Having inoculated 136,560 doses on August 7, Patna became the fifth district in India to cross the 1 lakh vaccination mark in a single day. It achieved another milestone by becoming the second district in the state after East Champaran to vaccinate over 2 lakh people in a day, having administered 201,142 doses during a mega camp on October 2. East Champaran administered 240,054 doses on September 17, during a special vaccination drive on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, when Bihar logged 3,339,879 Covid jabs, the day’s highest in India when it administered 2.5 crore doses. “Patna ranks ninth among Indian districts in terms of administering Covid vaccine doses. We have vaccinated over 114% of our urban population and 57% of the district’s rural population. Many people from rural areas and adjoining districts have come to take shots at our 24x7 vaccination centres,” said Singh. “We understood the people’s need and convenience and launched the special vaccination centres in June so that we can tap the people interested in taking jabs early in the morning, before going to the office or on their return from work in the evening. We opened three 24x7 centres and a couple for 12 hours a day. Their response was very encouraging, prompting other districts to adopt it,” the DM said. Danapur, Sheikhpura and Kankerbagh branches of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sri Krishna Memorial Hall, ITI-Digha, Anugrah Narayan College, the Ram Dev Mahto Samudayik Bhawan (community hall) and the Patna Women’s College were venues of special centres in Patna, most of which were operational from 9am to 5pm, while a couple functioned for 12 hours a day. “We reduced the waiting time at the special camps by deploying our best workforce, increasing the number of vaccinating teams, segregating people based on their choice of vaccine, age and gender, having separate queues for them. We also ensured cleanliness and hygiene, providing basic facilities like drinking water and washroom, having proper waiting areas with arrangement for sitting and opened up to 1,000 slots a day at each such camp, before introducing on-spot registrations,” said Singh. “Many other districts (Katihar, Darbhanga, Rohtas, Gaya and Bhagalpur) in Bihar and some other Indian states are also learnt to have recently adopted our model,” added Singh.Headline: A shot in the arm Intro: Bihar’s capita; has done better than the state and national average in Covid-19 vaccination 4,424,678: Patna‘s estimated target population to vaccinate5,193,789: Doses administered till 6.30 pm till October 7Vaccination coverage so farPatna76%: First dose 58%: Second dose Bihar64%: First dose 28%: Second does 24x7 vaccination mega camps in PatnaGovt polytechnic in Patliputra ColonyHotel Patliputra Ashok Patliputra stadium at Kankerbagh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nine-indian-states-adopt-patna-covid-vaccination-model-101633796258699.html

CPI(ML) state secretary Kunal Parwez said his party had an alliance with the RJD and hence it was obliged to support its candidates. CPI MLA Indu Shekhar Singh hoped RJD could wrest the seats despite cracks in the Opposition’s Grand Alliance (GA). Congress was expecting support from the left parties. “Our leaders are in touch with the left parties. I will write formal letters to the left leaders for help soon,” said Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha. BPCC chief spokesman Rajesh Rathore, however, said the biggest leader of the left parties in Bihar, Kanhaiya Kumar, had joined Congress. “Congress is sure to win both the seats. People are looking at the grand old party as the only reliable option to defeat BJP. People will ditch RJD in the bypolls as it did it with Congress,” he said. Former Patna University teacher and political observer Nawal Kishore Yadav said, “Whatever the consequences of the left’s move, it would ultimately benefit JD (U)-led dispensation, which is contesting to retain both the seats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bypolls-left-pledges-support-to-rjd-against-congress-101633796255879.html

In another decision, it was decided to provide online classes and coaching facilities to students from backward classes lodged in various hostels run by the state government. The meeting was also attended by deputy CM Renu Devi, who is also the minister for the department concerned.The Bihar government had earlier announced to reserve 33 per cent seats for girls in medical and engineering colleges. The state has 2,035 engineering seats and 1,330 medical seats in the 38 engineering and 11 medical colleges it runs. In 2006, Kumar-led NDA government had reserved 50 per cent seats for girls in primary schools and 35 per cent in secondary schools at the panchayat levels. The state had in 2016 reserved 35 per cent jobs for women in the police and 33 per cent in other government jobs. Besides, to encourage girls to pursue higher education, the state gives a cash incentive of ₹50,000 to those who pass their graduation. The government has also come up with a women’s entrepreneurship incentive, under which up to ₹10 lakh worth of financial assistance would be provided to women to help them set up businesses. While ₹5 lakh will be provided as grant or subsidy, the remaining amount will be interest-free loan.Earlier, the entrepreneurship scheme was available only to SC (Scheduled Caste), ST (Scheduled Tribe) and EBC (Extremely Backward Caste) women. Now, it has been extended to all women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-plans-inter-level-residential-schools-for-girls-for-backward-classes-in-all-districts-101633796230526.html

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Coal crisis leads to power cuts across Punjab||Amid shortage of coal to run thermal plants, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has resorted to up to six-hour cuts on electricity supply across the state.The move comes despite the corporation purchasing power for ₹6-14 per unit from the grid. In fact, it is for the first time that Punjab, which usually sells power on the grid in October, is forced to buy it.On Saturday morning, Patiala, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Barnala, Sangrur and Bathinda witnessed power cuts for two to four hours. Cuts lasted for even six hours in some parts of the state. More power cuts are in the offing in the evening too.Punjab is facing an acute coal crisis with stocks available to run its five thermal plants fast depleting. At the three private plants, the available stocks are not expected to last even two days. The Rajpura plant has 1.9 days of coal stock left, while Talwandi Sabo has 1.3 days of coal, and GVK plant at Goindwal Sahib has just 0.6-day stock. PSPCL plants in Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar have coal stock for 4.9 and 4 days, respectively.Coal to all these plants is supplied by various Coal India Limited (CIL) subsidiaries under their respective fuel supply agreements. According to the government, presently the receipt is much below the required level. Only 50% power generation“Against an installed capacity of 5,620 MW of thermal power generation, only 2,800 MW is being generated, as two units of Ropar plant are shut while one unit each of Talwandi Sabo and Lehra Mohabbat is shut. The others are operating at half of their installed capacity to conserve coal,” said a PSPCL official, who did not wish to be named.Punjab is facing a shortage of 1,000-1,200 MW of power daily. The demand is set to soar as the festival season has just started. On Friday, PSPCL had to purchase 131 lakh units from the grid at a whopping rate of ₹13.52 per unit. It has already finalised purchase of 1,200 MW for the month of October for prices ranging between ₹7 and ₹14.CM demands supply as per quotaReviewing the situation on Saturday, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said power cuts on domestic consumers in cities and villages are being imposed to ensure sufficient supply to the agriculture sector as well as to maintain grid discipline.Slamming the Centre for inadequate coal supply against the PSPCL’s agreements with various CIL subsidiaries, the CM asked it to immediately enhance the state’s coal supply as per the quota to tide over the power crisis.He also reiterated his government’s commitment to provide adequate power supply for irrigation of paddy crop. Earlier, A Venu Prasad, chairman-cum-managing director, PSPCL, told the CM that thermal plants throughout the country are reeling under coal shortage. Prasad said he is in touch with the coal ministry officials to bring more stocks, and the situation is likely to improve in the coming days.(With inputs from Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coal-crisis-leads-to-power-cuts-across-punjab-101633794156351.html

09-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh to show solidarity with farmers, says MVA||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies on Saturday said that statewide bandh announced on October 11 to protest the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri is to display that Maharashtra is with the farmers of the country. Essential services have been exempted from the bandh, the leaders said. Senior leaders of the MVA, including Sena leader Sanjay Raut, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister Nawab Malik and Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, said that the one-day strike on Monday will be successful. Raut said that Shiv Sena will participate in the bandh in full strength. Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV while they were returning from the protest against the Central government’s farm laws in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on October 3. The farmers alleged that Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of home Ajay Mishra, was in the vehicle and later fled the scene. “Shiv Sena will participate in the bandh with its full strength. All three parties will actively participate in the bandh. What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri was a murder of the country’s Constitution, a violation of the law and a conspiracy to kill the food-provider (annadata) farmers of the country. To awaken the people of the state and to tell the farmers that we are with them, MVA has announced a complete bandh on October 11,” said Raut, who was flanked by Malik and Sawant, in a press conference in Mumbai.Malik said that workers of the three parties across the state would meet people, shopkeepers, etc., and seek support for the bandh. “We appeal to people that they must come together. We must keep our work shut for one day; shopkeepers on their own must keep shops shut. Workers of the three parties will request shops, establishments and people to show support for the farmers,” said Malik.The NCP minister further said that the bandh would come into force from Sunday midnight. He said, “We appeal to all the workers to not create any issues for the essential services, such as hospitals, ambulance, medical stories, milk supply, during the bandh.”The three leaders targeted the BJP-led Centre over the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. Congress leader said that the incident was a “blot on humanity” and a “stain on the democracy”. “It is a blot on humanity how the peacefully protesting farmers were crushed to death. The accused, who are shielded, this is nothing but a stain on Indian democracy,” he said.Malik called the incident a “massacre” and said BJP has become a party that kills farmers. “Despite such a massacre, they (government) were initially not ready to register a case. Like [NCP chief Sharad] Pawar saheb said that the country had not seen a cruel incident since Jallianwala Baug. The BJP has branded farmers protests as Khalistanis and terrorists... Until now, we use to say that BJP does not care for the farmers, but they are plunderers of their produce. After the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, BJP has become a party that kills farmers,” Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-to-show-solidarity-with-farmers-says-mva-101633792655503.html
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Beautifying footpaths at 33 locations on BMC’s cards||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned to beautify footpaths of around 90-km stretch in island city including central Mumbai. Under this plan, the paver blocks will be removed to make way for the cement concrete surface of the pavements.Under this project, footpaths at 33 locations including Dadar, Churchgate, Marines Lines, Colaba, Kemps Corner, Walkeshwar have been identified in the island city and central Mumbai.According to civic officials, most of these footpaths have paver block surfaces, because of which the civic body had faced criticism, as the blocks would come off due to sub-standard work and the surface would remain uneven. Under the new plan, the surface would be made of cement. The BMC will install road signages and pedestrian-friendly signages besides taking measures to make it convenient for the disabled citizens. It has also included maintenance work of manholes and stormwater drains along with surfacing a few of the roads along with footpaths. The cumulative cost adding the above is around ₹50 crore.The project to beautify the footpaths at five locations in the city will be taken up on the line of the improved footpaths around the Fort area in south Mumbai. The BMC floated bids for the same on Thursday and the last date to submit bids for the contractors is October 28.Earlier, a month ago, the BMC had passed a ₹69 crore proposal to beautify footpaths at Lady Jehangir Marg from St Joseph Circle near Wadala station to Ruia College; Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati Marg from Diamond Garden to Chembur railway station; Sant Gyaneshwar Mandir Road and RKP Road in Bandra (East); and MG Road at Goregaon etc.However, corporators have criticised the plan.Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition and BMC corporator said, “Spending huge sum of money on the conversion of footpaths from paver blocks to cement is the sheer wastage of money. On one hand, BMC cries of fund shortage and here they will spend so much on footpaths. Our roads are in a very bad shape and they more focus.”Meanwhile, Prabhakar Shinde, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator and group leader of BJP in BMC said, “Our objection is simple even now and earlier, that if BMC wants to beautify footpaths, it should do it across the city. Why pick and choose areas? Also, BMC is appointing consultants for the design of these footpaths despite having in-house engineers. This is not spending money wisely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/beautifying-footpaths-at-33-locations-on-bmc-s-cards-101633792535977.html

The PMC will make available the facility within campuses as students who haven’t got their first or second doses can then get them easily. It will help vaccinate more people above 18.”Earlier, Pune’s guardian minister Ajit Pawar gave his nod to reopening colleges in Pune district from next week on the condition that only students who have taken both doses will be allowed to attend. Considering this, the PMC decided to make the facility available inside college campuses so that students no longer have to suffer delay in the learning process. The mayor said, “The PMC managed the vaccination drive efficiently and hence, stood first in Maharashtra.

The notice has asked Singh to appear before the investigating officer concerned for the enquiry on October 12.A copy of the notice, issued by unit-11 of the crime branch, has also been pasted on the door of Singh's official residence at Nilima Building in Walkeshwar.A team of police officials has also gone to Chandigarh to serve the notice at his native place, said a crime branch officer.The case concerns a complaint lodged by private contractor Bimal Agarwal who had alleged that Singh along with dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin had threatened him and extorted (hafta) monthly payments from January 2020 till March 2021 for “letting him run his hotels in Goregaon and Andheri without any police hassles.” The case was originally registered by the Goregaon police but was later transferred to the Crime Branch.In order to meet their extortion demand, Agarwal claimed that he had paid a sum of 9 lakh in cash along with giving them two Samsung Fold-2 mobile phones worth ₹2,12,000 to the accused. The contractor had further alleged that the accused had extorted money from other hotel owners and bookies in Mumbai.Singh is a 1988-batch IPS officer and has been slapped with five FIRs in Mumbai and Thane. He is also facing two open inquiries by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) with regards to allegations of corruption made against him by two serving police inspectors.Singh's mobile phone is switched off, prompting the investigating agencies to suspect that the senior cop might have fled abroad.On March 18, 2021, Maharashtra government shunted out Singh as Mumbai police commissioner following Ambani security scare and Hiran murder case and transferred him to home guards.(With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crime-branch-issues-notice-to-param-bir-singh-in-extortion-case-101633790361586.html

Vaccination centres in Tembhi Naka and Wagle Estate saw fewer beneficiaries owing to the ongoing festive season.“During Ganeshotsav, we had discontinued vaccination on select days. We have not done the same during Navratri. Also owing to the weekend and fasting rituals that many follow, a decrease in the number of beneficiaries would have been noted in centres. However, we are getting a good response overall. On Friday, we had vaccinated more than 13,000 beneficiaries across Thane city,” said a senior officer from TMC.On Saturday, TMC conducted vaccination in 19 centres including five on wheels or mobile units.Meanwhile, a vaccination centre in Kalyan had no staff to give away the token to citizens who thronged the centre on Saturday at around 7am. Around 40 citizens who arrived to get their jab at Saket College in Kalyan (E) had to wait for three to four hours for the staff to arrive and give away the tokens.“Usually, the tokens are given at around 8.30am and that is why I went to the centre at 7am. However, there was no one at the centre to give the tokens and when we asked the security guard, he was also clueless. After waiting for a long time, I got the token at around 10.30am and then they allowed us in for the dosage,” said Jagdish Rai, 36, who arrived at the centre to take his second dose.The KDMC was undertaking vaccination drives at its 29 centres on Saturday. “We will check if there was a delay caused due to negligence at the centre and take necessary steps. However, at around 10.30am the vaccination was initiated by the staff,” said an officer of the health department of KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/few-takers-for-vaccination-against-covid-in-thane-city-101633788998002.html

From the age group of 51-60 years, 80 are active while 66 are active in 61-70 years, 31 in 71-80 years, 14 in 81-90 years and one in 91-110 years age groups. “The age group of 21-40 years is most vulnerable as people in this category have to go out for work. The only way to protect oneself from the virus is by wearing masks, getting vaccinated and following all the Covid norms. We have got a delay in the third wave and that is because of the preventive steps taken by the people themselves and they need to be continued,” Dr Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/most-active-covid-cases-in-navi-mumbai-fall-in-31-40-years-age-group-101633787558555.html

09-10-2021||Mumbai||77% cancer patients hesitant to take Covid vaccine: Study||Nearly 77% of cancer patients are hesitant to take the Covid-19 vaccine due to fears about the side effects, vaccine interfering in chemotherapy and radiation therapy, lack of information and misinformation, a questionnaire-based study, carried out by a team of doctors from the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), has found. The medical team highlighted the need for robust communication strategies and systemic programs for the dissemination of information to fortify the Covid-19 vaccination. “Cancer patients are more vulnerable to Covid-19 because of their low immunity level and vaccinations are thus crucial for them,” said oncologist Dr Shripad Banavali, who is one of the co-authors of the study published in the Cancer Research, Statistics and Treatment journal. The survey was carried out between May 7, 2021, and June 10, 2021, in patients aged 45 years and above, with solid tumours. “The Covid-19 vaccination does not interfere with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There are no additional side effects associated with the vaccine among cancer patients,” said Banavali. A total of 435 patients were included in the study. Of these, 348 or 80% of patients had not received even a single dose of the vaccine; 15.2% of patients had received the first dose and only 4.8% had received both doses. Vaccine hesitancy was seen in 259 or nearly 77% of the surveyed patients. Among the most common reasons for hesitancy were fear of side effects and impact on cancer therapy (38%) and lack of information (26.7%). The study noted that the lower educational level and lack of prior advice regarding the Covid-19 vaccines played a significant role in the hesitancy. The survey data was analysed end of June. Since then the vaccination numbers in the country have picked up with over 94 crore doses administered to date. “But many patients who are coming to our OPD’s (outpatient department) are still unvaccinated,” said Banavali. “We sensitise them and bust their myths about the vaccines,” he said adding that the hospital also receives many calls from patients outside Mumbai asking if the Covid vaccines are safe for them. A comment piece written by TMH doctors published on Friday also deliberated on India’s vaccine hesitancy and the many factors contributing to it. “The development of the Covid-19 immunisation programmes is hampered by vaccine hesitancy,” said head and neck surgeon Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi who authored the piece along with Dr Mihir Dani and Dr Arjun Singh. The piece noted that vaccine hesitancy is a complex problem and should be tackled at the policy level, interpersonal level and organisation level. For instance, interpersonal communication training should be provided to auxiliary nurse midwives, anganwadi workers, Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha), traditional healers, local doctors, and other mobilisers, the piece noted.Cancer and Covid-19 vaccination-Covid-19 vaccines can be taken by cancer patients who are on active chemotherapy or radiation therapy -Covid-19 vaccine does not hamper cancer therapy or cause any additional side effects-Cancer patients fall under the vulnerable category and Covid-19 vaccination is thus crucial for them||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/77-cancer-patients-hesitant-to-take-covid-vaccine-study-101633785154570.html

Judge Priti Kumar Ghule convicted the accused under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 376 (rape) of Indian Penal Code and under sections 4 (Penetrative Sexual Assault), 8 (sexual assault) and 10 (aggravated sexual assault) of Pocso Act, 2012.Reacting to the plea of the accused for leniency, the judge observed, “The court has to strike balance between reformative theory and principle of proportionality. Sentencing for any offence has social goals, the accused must realise the crime has created a dent in his life and also concavity in the social fabric. Punishment should serve as a deterrent.”“The accused has chosen a minor to satisfy his lust. The accused did not protect the child but abused her and her childhood. The children are the future of the country. The offence will leave a scar on the mind and body of the survivor. It will be difficult for her to concentrate on her studies and make a good future. Hence, minimum punishment is not appropriate in the matter,” said the court.Special public prosecutor VD More had argued that the case date backs to 2019, the victim has two brothers, her father works as a carpenter and her mother had gone to their native place when the accused, a neighbour allegedly assaulted her.The accused, on several occasions called the survivor to his house under different pretexts and misbehaved with her. One day he dragged her to his house and misbehaved with her, she managed to rescue herself and called for help. Her father and the public gathered and even beat the accused.More argued that the offence of sexual assault was proved beyond reasonable doubt and sole testimony of the survivor was sufficient to convict the accused. There was sufficient content and trustworthy evidence for a conviction.Advocate Roshni Singh, who appeared for the accused argued that the entire complaint is based on false and fabricated statements of the survivor’s father and the victim. Though there are several witnesses, only interested witness survivor’s family members are examined by the prosecution. The survivor’s statement lacks adequate corroboration and cannot be relied upon and benefit of doubt should be in favour of accused.”The court observed, “It is pertinent to note that the offences of rape are in the four walls and the survivor is the best witness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/19yearold-gets-15-year-jail-term-for-sexually-assaulting-minor-101633785034547.html

"There is an acute shortage of coal in coal-fired power plants across the country. There is only one day's stock left in the plants from which Delhi gets electricity, there is no coal at all," said the power minister, according to an ANI report.He also noted that the city is dependent on the Centre-run power plants, which provide power supply according to the demand and warned that the city might plunge into darkness after two days. "After two days, there will be a complete blackout in the whole Delhi, if we do not receive more power supply from the Centre," ANI quoted him as saying.Delhi is staring at a severe power crisis due to the acute coal shortage at thermal power plants in the country. In India, over half of 135 coal-fired power plants, which supply around 70% of the country's electricity, have fuel stocks to last less than three days, news agency Reuters had reported Friday. Other states that are facing a similar crisis include Tamil Nadu and Odisha.The minister further informed that the city's power plants are running on only 55 per cent capacity and it has now "come to the point of rationing". "There is a coal shortage even when production plants are not running at full capacity. Appeal to Centre look into the matter. We have a power purchase agreement where they are giving us half of the electricity. We have come to the point of rationing," Jain also said, as per ANI.In order to resolve the power crisis in Delhi, the government is ready to buy expensive electricity at present, Jain said. He also held a meeting with the representatives of power distribution companies (discoms) in Delhi to discuss the issue."We want the plants to generate 45,000 MW of electricity during this peak hour," he said, adding, "we have also made power purchase agreements with NTPC of 35,000 MW-45,000 MW. Still, we are ready to buy the expensive electricity today at the cost of ₹20 per unit."Speaking further on the crisis, Jain warned that there could be politics on the issue, as it "appears to be a man-made crisis similar to the oxygen crisis". "We have 3.5 times more production capacity than what we require and still, we aren't able to produce power," Jain added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-one-day-s-coal-stock-left-delhi-s-power-minister-warns-of-power-crisis-101633783542323.html

09-10-2021||Mumbai||Bhiwandi lacks infrastructure to accommodate lakhs of vehicles on daily basis||With more than 35,000 heavy vehicles and more than a lakh of other vehicles commuting through Bhiwandi daily, the road and transport infrastructure in the city is insufficient to take this load. The result is pothole-riddled, accident prone roads and hours of traffic jams.There are around two lakh godowns and many power loom factories in Bhiwandi. These warehouses are functional for neighbouring cities of Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. Many vehicles head from JNPT towards Ahmedabad or other parts of Gujarat as well.Apart from the arterial roads and the Mumbai-Nashik Highway that passes through Bhiwandi city, the route between Mankoli to Anjurphata and Thane to Kasheli are the most affected roads. Moreover, the ongoing Metro work on the Thane-Kasheli route is such that diversions are also not possible and often heavy vehicles get stuck on this stretch causing traffic jams.Experts claim that the city requires better infrastructure in terms of roads and transport facilities as it is one of the major links to Northern Maharashtra and metro cities.Pankaj Joshi, principal director, Urban Center, Mumbai, said, “In the last decade, Mumbai Metropolitan Region has developed into an industries and logistics hub. It is creating its own job opportunities and Bhiwandi is one among them. Along with infrastructure development, there is an urgent need to improve the connectivity within Bhiwandi. Keeping in mind its rise, there is a requirement for public transport facilities. A hop-on-hop-off bus service connecting the industrial areas with the neighbouring cities will ease private vehicles on the road.”The traffic department has implemented various measures like strictly not allowing heavy vehicles or vehicles from outside the city to enter inside during the day or during peak hours and are focussing on traffic regulation.Currently, the traffic police are halting heavy vehicles outside Vasai Naka or near Gaimukh and restricting entry into the city precincts. Balasaheb Patil, DCP (Traffic), said, “We are currently managing the situation by stopping entry to outside vehicles and heavy vehicles during peak hours. Moreover, we have asked all officers to focus on traffic regulation and avoid taking action against vehicles during the peak hours. We have a lot of manpower involved in stopping heavy vehicles’ entry into the city. This has helped manage the traffic situation considerably. We have also coordinated with local authorities and soon after rains subside, the roads will be repaired.”Darshan Thakker, a 49-year-old resident of Thane, said, “I am a businessman and have to visit the power looms quite often for work. Since the last few years, the potholes and bad roads have become a common phenomenon during monsoons in Bhiwandi. The traders and residents have often written and complained to the local authorities but all have fallen on deaf ears. It is a struggle to spend six hours almost on a regular basis only for commuting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhiwandi-lacks-infrastructure-to-accommodate-lakhs-of-vehicles-on-daily-basis-101633780655730.html

09-10-2021||Other||Cheer in Goa tourism industry as plea to allow foreign tourists granted||The tourism industry in Goa has welcomed the decision to lift the ban on tourist visas thanking the Union government for heeding their demand for an early relaxation to coincide with Goa’s upcoming tourism seasons.With the timely relaxation, the first charter flights with tourists will arrive by mid-November providing relief to Goa’s tourism-related businesses, stakeholders from the state tourism industry said.“It was largely due to our requests that the Central government decided to allow foreigners to arrive in Goa. Goa makes up 92% of the charter flight arrivals in the country and the announcement ahead of the season will allow us to plan in advance and allow charter companies to book slots at the Goa airport,” president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), a body which represents businessmen from the tourism industry, Nilesh Shah said.Repeated requests, letters and meetings between the industry, the state government and the Union government helped speed up the process and ensure that the announcement was made to coincide with the start of Goa’s tourism. Besides repeated letters, Goa’s tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar held a meeting with officials of the central government - the most recent meeting being earlier this week - in which the modalities of allowing charter planes to land as early as October 15 were worked out.The TTAG has been consistently seeking the restart of foreign tourist arrivals which they say is the bread and butter of small and medium hotels, most of whom are yet to reopen ever since March 2020 when the lockdown was introduced.Unsurprisingly, the decision was greeted with cheer in Goa’s tourism industry.“The decision will benefit every tourism stakeholder - from the charter operator to small and medium hotel owner and everyone in between. We are grateful for this,” the TTAG’s Shah said.Being a tourist-centric state, Goa’s tourism industry sought special dispensation going so far as to request that even if regular international flights were not going to be resumed, tourists should be brought in via chartered planes through reciprocal bubble agreements with countries that were already accepting tourists from India.“As Goa is one of the leading states for tourism, we propose charter flights be allowed to land in Goa especially from safe destinations that have allowed Indians to travel to their countries on a tourist visa. International flights are already operating in between two countries like Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. So we should reciprocate the same way. As tourists arriving in Goa don’t travel to any other state and majority of them spend their time at their respective hotels so it becomes easy to control and monitor them,” the TTAG said in a representation to the Union Home Ministry in September this year.According to the association, tourism is one of the most adversely affected sectors for the Covid-19 pandemic. The tourism sector employs over 40 million skilled and trained manpower and generates approximately US $29 billion foreign exchange per annum.“With the full closure of international flights and visas since March 2020, many operators and stakeholders have shut shop and are facing severe financial constraints,” the TTAG had said.In 2020 too, the TTAG sought the reopening of the sector in a limited way; no sooner did cases begin to plateau towards the end of October. While tourists from within India flocked to Goa in hundreds, foreign tourists were conspicuous by their absence.In 2020 too, the TTAG sought the reopening of the sector in a limited way when cases began to plateau towards the end of October. While tourists from within India flocked to Goa in hundreds, foreign tourists were conspicuous by their absence.Goa’s tourism season usually begins with the receding monsoon and as winter sets in across the northern hemisphere, those seeking to escape the often biting cold climate choose to spend time in warmer parts of the world and Goa is among the preferred destinations for those seeking to travel.For many who had made a winter visit to Goa an annual affair, not being able to travel to Goa and having to spend Christmas back in the UK was something they “never experienced before.”The UK, Germany, Poland, Russia and Ukraine are the primary sources of foreign tourists to Goa. Visas weren’t relaxed last year as much of Europe was battling an especially severe second wave at the time.The Prime Minister first dropped hints that the Union government was willing to relax its suspension of tourist visas during an interaction with health workers from Goa after the state became the second one after Uttarakhand to complete vaccinating its targeted population with at least one dose of the vaccine.“India’s vaccination drive is not (only) a cover for health, but a cover for livelihood too. It is important that tourism destinations open as soon as possible (like) the Char Dham yatra in Uttarakhand. Goa’s 100 percent vaccination has become important to revive the tourism sector,” Modi said. “You imagine, hotel industry people, taxi drivers, hawkers, shopkeepers... Once everyone is vaccinated, tourists can come to Goa with peace of mind. Politics aside, Goa is a part of a select group of tourist destinations where people are vaccinated,” he said.“Tourism can resume in the coming tourism season just like before. Domestic and international tourists can take pleasure in coming here. This will be possible when we give as much importance to corona precautions as much as we have given to vaccinations. It is our duty,” he said, adding that he was apprised of Goa Tourism’s requests to allow foreigners to set foot in the sunny state once more and that a decision was in the offing.“The Central government is taking steps to welcome foreign tourists back. The government has decided to give the first 5-lakh tourists free visas,” he added.The industry in Goa is hopeful that demand will remain high after a gap of one and a half years. “Our charter partners have reported that inquiries have already begun and we can expect a strong start to the season.“Foreign tourists travel in larger groups and stay for a longer time, often the average duration of stay is between 21-28 days. To compensate for the loss of a single foreign booking, a hotel will have to secure four to five different bookings of domestic tourists to maintain the same level of occupancy,” Nilesh Shah, the president of the TTAG, told HT.A domestic tourist on average stays on average between 3-7 days.Prior to the pandemic, the state witnessed close to 90-lakh tourists including around 9 lakh foreigners.Goa Tourism Development Corporation had conducted a state-wide survey through a consultant to understand the impact of Covid-19 on Goa’s tourism industry. As per the survey, the overall loss of earnings in the tourism industry during the lockdown has been estimated at ₹2,062 crores. Potential loss of earning for the 2020-21 season has been pegged at ₹7,239 crores and the potential job cuts were to the tune of 1.22 lakh (58%).Goa’s tourism sector is a big source of revenue for the state with the industry directly contributing 16.43% towards the state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and also provides employment to nearly 35% of the state’s population that is dependent on the sector, according to official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cheer-in-goa-tourism-industry-as-plea-to-allow-foreign-tourists-granted-101633779816046.html

According to the police complaint, the accused allegedly misled the registrar by forging bogus entries in a sale deed, by mentioning incorrect boundaries and wrong CTS numbers. Joint sub-registrar LM Sangavar (41), had given a detailed complaint after which the case lodged against Bhosale, a resident of Baner road, Vinod Goenka, Vikas Oberoi, both residents of Mumbai, Sapna Jain, Kalpana Raisoni, Suman Nikam, Nitin Nikam, Rupali Nikam, Nilesh Nikam, Devaki Nikam, Neelam Suryavanshi, Akshay Suryavanshi, Vitthal Pawar and Jyoti Pawar. According to the investigators, Sangavar is posted at the joint sub-registrar Office Haveli No. 8 in Dhanori since 2019. Landowner Chetan Nikam had lodged four complaints with his office in 2015, 2016 and 2019 about seven documents registered at this office. According to the FIR, while registering the sale deed of the land at Sangamwadi, false entries were allegedly made on the land belonging to Nikam. His land was not mentioned in the document. Instead, it appeared to belong to the person who was selling it. Moreover, alleged bogus entries were made regarding the original owner Ardesar Sethn and Dadabhai Sethna by mentioning false CTS numbers in some sale deeds. An inquiry conducted by the Joint District Registrar and Stamp Duty Collector led to a violation of rules regarding the registration of documents. It was inaccurately mentioned that the complainant’s land allegedly belonged to Kalpana Raisoni. Index 2 of a sale deed also had wrong entries, the complaint stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fir-against-builder-avinash-bhosale-vinod-goenka-vikas-oberoi-and-11-others-for-forgery-101633777593878.html
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Kirti Vyas murder: Court refuses bail to accused||The sessions court on Friday rejected the bail plea of Siddhesh Tamhankar, a former Bblunt salon chain employee, booked along with his colleague for allegedly murdering Kirti Vyas, finance manager of the firm, in 2018.Tamhankar, 42, who had applied for bail on the grounds of parity, approached the court after the apex court granted bail to his co-accused, Khushi Sahjwani, in July. However, the trial court rejected his plea, saying the offence is very serious and there is strong technical evidence in the case. The trial court said the apex court granted bail to Khushi as she is woman, and that Tamhankar is not entitled to parity nor there is any change in circumstance.Advocate Sandeep Karnik had argued for Tamhankar that the 42-year-old is behind bars since May 5, 2018. The case of the prosecution is on a DNA sample collected from Sahjwani’s car, that too after two months. He said undue weightage is given by the prosecution to CCTV footage, in which the victim is seen near the car.He had pointed out that there is no witness to the killing, there is no evidence that the car had stopped at any point, it is impossible to believe prosecution theory of murder that Vyas was killed in a moving car and the body was shifted to the boot of the car. The alleged extra-judicial confession of co-accused Sahjwani is not reliable, the body of the victim is not found, hence in the absence of recovery of corpus-delicti, case of murder cannot be inferred. The co-accused is released on bail charges against both are same, hence Tamhankar is also entitled for bail on the grounds of parity.”Special public prosecutor AK Chimalkar had argued for the state that co-accused was granted bail by the apex court as she is a woman undertrial prisoner and looking into her family conditions. We are ready to begin trial, but accused is consuming time by filing bail applications.”Additional sessions judge, MG Deshpande, rejected the bail application, observing that “there is strong technical evidence in the case, we are ready to expedite the trial the accused are delaying it, the apex court granted bail to Sahjwani as she is a woman, Tamhankar is not entitled to parity nor there is any change in circumstances.Though there are 110 witnesses and a 936-page charge-sheet, the prosecution won’t examine all of them during trial. The Bombay high court (HC), while rejecting Tamhankar’s bail application, has earlier already observed that in a trial for murder it is not an absolute necessity or essential ingredient to establish Corpus-Delicti.The day when Sahjwani went missing she was seen in the car with the accused. There are several calls between Khushi and Tamhankar before and after murder.While arresting the two, the police had alleged they killed Vyas who worked with BBlunt Salon as a finance manager along with the two. The police had claimed that Tamhankar and Sahjwani had eliminated Vyas as she had served notice to Tamhankar to terminate him for his bad performance.The murder took place on March 16, 2018.In June 2021, a sessions court had rejected bail plea of both sent from prisons, citing the high power committee recommendations for the release of prisoners on temporary bail to decongest prisons during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kirti-vyas-murder-court-refuses-bail-to-accused-101633777533915.html

09-10-2021||Delhi||Ramlila 2021: Catch the action BTS||Restrictions are aplenty yet actors in various Ramlilas in Delhi-NCR have not let the challenges of performing in Covid times get to them! Ramlilas, in Delhi, have got the permission to be conducted in a smaller format with a maximum of 200 people in closed auditoriums and a variable capacity of audiences in outdoor venues; while maintaining adequate social distancing. But it’s not just during the performance that the Ramlila actors are following precautions. During the rehearsals as well they avoided flouting Covid norms even if that meant rehearsing virtually on phone. And as these artistes proceeded to their respective performance venues, they are ensuring that everyone participating in performances are getting their temperature checked and sanitising regularly, to keep Covid-19 at bay. Vaccination status significant for selection!“Humein bahut strictly bola gaya hai ki bas jin artistes ka act hai, wohi honge stage ke aas paas. Iske illawa koi bhi allowed nai hai,” says Himpy Jain, a dance teacher from Rohini, who has been portraying Hanuman in the Ramlila organised by Shri Ramlila Committee Indraprastha at Ipex Bhawan, for the last three years. Jain adds that before allowing anyone as part of the cast, their vaccination status was checked. “Koi bhi artist select nai hua tha jab tak unhone apna vaccination ka certificate submit nai kiya. Abhi bhi jab hum venue mein enter kar rahe hain, tab humara temperature check kiya ja raha hai aur sanitiser bhi diya jata hai. Main Hanuman ka role pichle teen saal se kar raha hun, par iss saal alag tareeke se performance ho rahi hai. Iss saal hum episodes mein dikha rahe hain puri Ramlila,” he shares.For actors of Ramlilas in NCR, too, there was a great stress to get at least one dose of vaccination. Take for instance Shri Durga Ramlila in Gurugram’s Jacobpura, where preparations began months ago, and as the on stage acts kick off, what’s mandatory are masks and social distancing protocols. Gagandeep Saini, the actor who plays the role of Kaushalya in this Ramlila, shares, “Mujhse pehle mere papa bhi kiya karte the Kaushalya ka role. I’ve been performing for 17 years in this Ramlila. Hum chhote the toh papa ke saath aate the; tab 7-8 saal ke the. Director sir ne dekha ki acting kar sakta hun aur papa ke baad ab mai play kar raha hun. Ye toh Ram ji ki sewa hai. Agar aapki lagan hai toh jo role aap chaho zarur milega. Acting ka shauk toh hai shuru se par iss saal kaafi mushkil tha Covid time me practice karna. Humari sanstha ne bahut facilities provide karayi.”‘Watched TV show to learn the nuances’Karan Bakshi, 23, who works in a BPO in Gurugram, says Ramlila is an “inseparable” part of his life! His father used to carry him as a child to watch the epic on the stage, and Bakshi, who has been part of Ramlila for over 12 years now, says, “I’ve always dreamt to play the character of Ram. Bada mann karta tha mai bhi aisa banoo. Mujhe bhi koi tayyar kare. Ram ka kirdar karke mujhe yeh pata chala ki kaise apne mata-pita ki sewa karni chahiye. Kaise humein unki har agya ka palan karna chahiye. I used to watch the TV show Siya Ke Ram to learn the nuances of playing Ram. Humare niyam bhi hote hain. Jab se maine Ram, Bharat aur Shatrughan ki bhoomika nibhani shuru ki, pyaz khaana band kar diya. Humari ek aur maryada aur hoti hai; hum zameen pe sote hain. Rehearsals mein humne raat ke dedh do baje tak practise kari. Mask mein hi practise karte the aur sanitise karte the ache se.”‘Theatre se pyar karte hain isliye karte hai’Govind Maurya, 37, whose role as Sita has won him several accolades, is portraying the character of Kaikeyi this year. He says, “Mask laga ke practise kari iss bar. Thodi der ke liye utar bhi dete the kyunki bolna bahut mushkil hain aise. Kaikeyi ka role Sita se bhi mushkil hai. Kayi log kehte hain that we get paid and that’s why we perform in Ramlila. Par sach ye hai ki theatre se pyar karte hain, isliye har saal rak dekhte hain rehearsal aur performance karne ki! Mera shauk tha bachpan sa. Iss saal socha chod dun, pandemic mein kaafi mushkile ayi par phir socha jab tak sans chalegi tab tak Ramlila karenge!”And a similar vigour is showcased by 13-year-old Lucky Sood, who plays Surya Dev in the same Ramlila in Gurugram. “My favourite role is Shatrughan par main iss baar woh ban nahi paya... Hum badon ko dekh dekh ke seekhte hain. Mere friends kehte hain woh bhi kuchh banna chahte hain, mere jaisa role karna hai. Bahut khush hote hain mujhe stage par dekh ke. Surya Dev ke role mein mushkil kuch nahi bas ghabrahat hoti hai stage pe jaane ki. Rehearsal mai ek baje tak karta tha kyunki phir school bhi jaana hota tha.”Rehearsals have happened over calls: Samikssha BatnagarWell, we are still not out of the pandemic and while the Ramlila is being showcased, the actors barely met to rehearse together. “Most, if not all, of our rehearsals happened over phone calls! We got the script a month back and were preparing at our individual homes. So we were aware of our lines. They (organisers) gave us prior notice about when the show would take place and we came accordingly,” says Samikssha Batnagar, who enacts Sita in Ramlila by Lav Kush Ramlila Committee’s at Red Fort grounds. She adds, “The in-person rehearsal happened only on the October 5, a day prior to when we began. We are all experienced and we only needed to understand the positioning on stage.”Ghar mein sabko bol diya ki online dekhna mujhe: Satish Kumar The fear of a third wave still looms large, and actor Satish Kumar, who plays Ravana in the Ramlila by Shri Ramlila Committee Indraprastha at Ipex Bhawan, says he has asked his family to watch him virtually. “Hum zyada bheedh mein vaise hi nai jaate. Maine bola hai sabko ghar par bhi ki online dekh lena,” says Satish, who is a dance teacher at a school in Gurugram.Kumar, who has a two-year-old son, adds, “I’ve been playing Ravana since a decade. But this time hum costumes bilkul bhi share nai kar rahe; jaise pehle karte the. This time we will wear the costumes and then sanitise them before wearing them the next day. We have also ensured that all participants are vaccinated. Jinki vaccine nahi lagi thi, unko time diya lagwane ka... Meri family bahut concerned thi ki main bahar jaa raha hoon, Ramlila ke liye. Woh bolte rahe mujhe ki bach ke rehna. Jab mai ghar jaake pehle nahata hun aur phir apne baby ko milta hun!” It’s a bio bubble we have maintained: Gagan MalikWhile off the stage one can be fully masked and sanitised, it’s not always possible when on the stage. “At times even maintaining social distance is a challenge,” says actor Gagan Malik, who portrays Ram in Lav Kush Ramlila Committee’s Ramlila at Red Fort grounds, and adds: “Only those actors who are fully vaccinated have been selected here. Sanitisers are provided, and everyone has their masks on very strictly. And there’s a team of doctors as well to check if anyone gets any symptoms. Our oxygen level and temperatures are checked regularly. The whole stage as well as dressing room is sanitised... Stage pe you can’t wear a mask and many scenes mein gale lagna padta hai story ke according. Woh toh karna hi padhega, and that we can’t let go. But since every one is fully vaccinated, it’s a sort of bio bubble that we have maintained.”Author tweets @anjuri and @NainaArora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ramlila-2021-catch-the-action-bts-101633776801729.html
09-10-2021||Pune||Pune Startup Mantra: This personal Gyde makes your company’s software easy to use||A less-talked about change in work behaviour during the “work-from-home” phase of our existence, is that of, “call IT”, while using or installing an application or software. You can still call IT but the process is now a business opportunity with AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) now primed to solve your issues.Cure the “paper-clip feature in Office applications, which provides, based on most user feedback, the kind of help that is needed. Identifying this need for handholding end-users, Gyde – a Pune-based startup – has created a software assistance platform and is on a mission to democratise software guidance and reduce the go-to-market time for companies. Founded by Prasanna Vaidya and Shubham Deshmukh in January 2018, Gyde uses a set of AI-based tools for educating software application users to drive actions for better on-boarding, adoption, engagement and customer success. In the beginning… After completing his BE Mechanical from Mumbai University in 2006, Vaidya changed course and started working in software development. After a short stint in USA, he returned to India with good exposure to artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). His co-founder Deshmukh, is a computer engineering graduate from Pune and worked on a team led by Vaidya in the USA. The duo shared ideas and brainstormed about creating a B2C application which would be used by millions. After a lot of pivots, pilots and failed attempts, since 2015, Vaidya and Deshmukh finally realised that they both were from an engineering background and did not have the marketing nous for a B2C product. Says Deshmukh, “We had created a platform for creating chatbots at a hackathon, which we eventually won. We started pitching this platform to customers from the fintech segment and travelled to Mumbai. Slowly, we understood and learnt the B2B sales process. We realised that this is something we can pursue. Then we pivoted into Gyde. I handle product development and customer onboarding, while Vaidya handles sales.”What is Gyde?Explaining the concept of Gyde, Vaidya says, “In any big enterprise, a single person uses around 50 applications. During lockdown and work-from-home, our colleagues were not around to seek help. The learning curve is so steep that if we don’t understand a certain step in 15 minutes, we will raise ticket, or email someone and finally end up reducing the use of that application. That’s why adoption decreases. Gyde helps users to use such applications by providing step-wise help. That’s why we call it as a software assistance platform.”“During and post-Covid, the pace of buying, replacing and deploying applications like CRM, HRMS, Content Management Systems in businesses has also increased. Enterprises invest a lot of money in new applications, replace old with new ones and they always want more and more people to use those applications to get a good return on investment,” he adds.Identifying the spaceRecalling the pivot moment, Deshmukh said, “We also wanted to do something niche in chatbots, something different than a marketing or support chatbot. Some customers of our chatbot platform were application owners. We noticed that most of questions asked to the bot were about how to use the application… the questions were ‘how-to’… That’s when we realised that there are many such applications and the opportunity is huge. After eight months of a pilot, we got Bajaj Allianz as our first customer.” Do big companies not offer their help or support services? “The problem is that most applications are customised for the user (company). They have a basic documentation about features, but the documentation for the process implemented by the company has to be made by the company itself. One can approach the forums or help pages and ask questions, but there’s no guarantee of getting an answer within time,” Deshmukh claims.Digital adoption Enterprises conduct classroom trainings, prepare user manuals and share it with their employees or end-users to increase adoption of any application. For that they have a dedicated learning and-development team. However, there are lot of inconsistencies in this process and it is difficult to manage content as softwares or applications keep changing. The problem is multiplied if the end-user is a field operative. Another aspect is behavioural changes on the end-consumer side. Deshmukh and Vaidya agree that voice- assisted or voice-driven applications are increasingly being used. Says Vaidya, “Localisation in regional languages is also a trend in all markets especially India. Millennials or younger populations don’t want to call support numbers and helplines. They try to figure it out and if they fail, they just abandon it. Hence, walkthrough videos in regional languages are now popular. The English- speaking population segment is now served and hence, next growth is going to come from regional-language speaking internet users. Interestingly, this learning or training penetration has not happened in digital applications. That is why this space is called ‘Digital Adoption.”“Data quality also needs to be checked. Since users are filling lot of forms online, handholding them improves the quality of data gathered significantly. Gyde helps in providing byte-size and to-the-point help during this process and resolves the last-mile training or adoption issue. That’s how Gyde is envisioned,” he adds. Lockdown experienceRecalling the first national lockdown period in 2020 after the Covid-pandemic breakout, Vaidya said, “Bajaj Allianz had become our first customer just before pandemic hit us. They were rolling out lots of applications for their audience and wanted to make these apps self-served. They wanted fewer enquiries to customer support regarding application usages. Classroom/in-person training sessions in Maharashtra and northern India were planned along with implementation of Gyde. However, due to lockdown their offline training plan had to be scrapped. Now they completely relied on Gyde. They downloaded videos, shared on WhatsApp groups and took exams based on Gyde content about understanding the application. We also provided multiple language voice-over support.”All on board?Deshmukh said, “Onboarding duration depends on the underlying application size. For an average application consisting of 100 processes which should be covered by Gyde, it would take about 15 days to a month. Our customers can tell us what content should be distributed via Gyde or they can take our platform and create their own content. It is a self-served platform. They don’t need coders or certified professionals for this purpose. We have chrome extensions, dashboards and the integration is also easy.”Says Deshmukh, “Every page content - for managers, employees, consumers – is contextual and differs according to their role. We are now launching a new feature called product feedback. Users can give their feedback based on ratings or questions. As of now, mechanism of collecting feedback from end-users is not available, but we get response or feedback from trainers.”“Be it enterprise software, SaaS software or mobile application, ‘Using Software Should Be Easy’ is our motto, mission and vision. We also track clicks optionally. Going forward using those clicks we want to identify behaviour of the users – who clicks where and how much time they take to complete the process. On the basis of those clicks we will auto-trigger the guide content to make that user go towards completion of that process. That will also act as a feedback mechanism for Gyde and the application users,” Deshmukh explained. Where’s the money?Shubham Deshmukh says, “We were kind of incubated in a company with whom our investor Ashish Achrekar had business relations. He used to visit the office and we had pitched the chatbot platform initially. Although that plan did not work, we stayed connected. Achrekar has seen how we have pivoted and how we finally had a stable product. He was investing in Canada-based startups actively then and was also looking to get into the Indian startup ecosystem. At the same time, we met Vaibhav Domkundwar of Better Capital. We had some brainstorming sessions and ideations with Vaibhav about how to establish Gyde as a brand.” Future plansRevealing their future plans, Vaidya says, “While working with enterprises we also realised that software product companies is also our customer segment. We have started generating some numbers like what is the customer acquisition cost, churn and lifetime value. Post-funding, customer acquisition will be our major focus. In the next two years we want to reach up to 100 customers including enterprises or product companies in various markets. Says Vaidya, “We are focussing on developed markets, because all the big players and platforms like Salesforce have huge penetration in those markets unlike India. We have ready-to-use guides for platforms like SAP SuccessFactors, Salesforce, Zoho CRM, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and Microsoft Dynamics, among others. If you are using these, you can get started from day one. You can simply install one extension and with 10 important walkthroughs and you can customise it based on your requirement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-startup-mantra-this-personal-gyde-makes-your-company-s-software-easy-to-use-101633776574403.html

09-10-2021||Mumbai||‘NCB let off 3 individuals including BJP leader’s kin after cruise ship raid’: NCP’s Nawab Malik||Three days after claiming that Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, and Arbaaz Merchant were brought to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) office by private individuals with one of them being a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office-bearer, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief spokesperson Nawab Malik on Saturday alleged that the NCB let off three individuals after detaining them from the cruise party.“The day raid was conducted, NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said 8 to 10 people were detained but the fact is a total of 11 people were detained by the NCB that night. They were brought to the NCB office but later three of them were released. They are Rishabh Sachdeva, Pratik Gaba and Amir Furniturewala. Sachdeva is the brother-in-law of Mohit Bhartiya alias Mohit Kamboj. He was allowed to go after his father and uncle reached the NCB office,” Malik told reporters at NCP headquarters at Ballard Pier in south Mumbai.He said that a total of 11 individuals were detained from the raid conducted at the cruise ship and brought them to its office but let off three of them. Of them, one was Rishabh Sachdeva, the brother-in law-of Mohit Bhartiya, a former Yuva Morcha chief of BJP, Malik alleged. The other two are Amir Furniturewala and Pratik Gaba - the ones who invited Aryan Khan to the party, Malik told reporters and demanded an explanation from the NCB for allowing them to go.He alleged that Sachdeva was allowed to go after BJP leaders from Delhi and Mumbai intervened. He will now write to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to conduct a probe in the matter.Malik also released video clips in which Sachdeva can be seen being brought to the NCB office and later leaving it along with his father and uncle.“Who ordered them to be released? Our information is that BJP leaders, right from Delhi and Mumbai, intervened after which Sachdeva, Furniturewala and Gaba were released by the NCB. If nothing was found from then why only these 11 were detained among 1100 present at the cruise? We demand Sameer Wankhede clarify this. The entire probe is going ahead based on WhatsApp chats as nothing was found in Aryan Khan’s possession. Did the NCB take the mobile phones of these three and check them?” the NCP leader said.“It was a pre-planned conspiracy. Those who invited Aryan Khan to the party at the cruise ship, Pratik Gaba and Amir Furniturewala, were detained and later allowed to go. Satish Maneshinde too has said in the court that Aryan went to the party as he was invited by Gaba and Furniturewala,” Malik said in reply to a question.Malik earlier alleged that the two people —Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi — who brought Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant to the party were private individuals. Of them, Bhanushali is a BJP office-bearer and Gosavi is a serial offender and also an absconder in a cheating case in Pune. NCB officials could not answer the questions as to how the private individuals were allowed to handle high profile accused.Terming it a conspiracy, the NCP leader demanded a free and fair probe in the matter. “I will write to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and demand that things are very serious and need to be looked into. If required, call an inquiry and let the real facts come out before the people,” Malik said.BJP leader Pravin Darekar told the media that the concerned authorities will probe the allegations. As of now, they are allegations by Malik. Let it be probed by the authorities,” he added. Meanwhile, responding to the allegations, Pravin Darekar, leader of opposition in the legislative council, said that they are only allegations and videos and pictures can be morphed. He also alleged that Malik is making allegations to save the accused. “These are just allegations. As far as pictures and videos are concerned, they can be morphed. BJP cannot be held responsible even if Mohit Kamboj’s brother-in-law was involved. With the same criteria, we can hold NCP and Nawab Malik responsible for the arrest of his son in law (Sameer Khan) by the NCB in a drug abuse case,” Darekar said.“He is trying to create sensation by making allegations every day to save the accused. The action was necessary as drugs can spoil the entire generation,” he added.He further said the MVA government can conduct a probe with the Mumbai police and its anti-narcotics cell by obtaining call detail records (CDR) and probe the matter for their own satisfaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-let-off-3-individuals-including-bjp-leader-s-kin-after-cruise-ship-raid-ncp-s-nawab-malik-101633775975407.html

A delegation of people from the area apprised the Haryana chief minister of the situation and demanded that the road be opened at the earliest.“A delegation of people from the villages around the Singhu border of Sonipat district came to meet me and demanded the road to the Singhu border be opened. Supreme Court has also taken cognisance of it and we're hopeful that the problem will be solved soon,” Khattar told reporters in Delhi, as quoted by news agency ANI.“I met with Amit Shah Ji today, we briefed him on the issue of opening of Singhu and Tikri borders. I have also told him about farmers' protests being held at several locations in the state. I am hopeful that borders will be opened soon,” he added.Supreme Court rejects plea over Singhu border road blockadeThe appeal to the chief minister comes after a Supreme Court bench led by Justice Chandrachud refused to entertain the petition filed by Sonipat residents seeking immediate removal or dispersal of the mass gathering of farmers at Delhi borders. The plea stated that it was disturbing the right to movement for people who have regular connectivity to the road.However, the Supreme Court rejected the petition saying that the matter can be addressed by the high court. "Why don't you approach the High Court, being a resident of Sonipat? Why are these petitions filed here for publicity? There is no need for us to intervene when high courts are well versed with the local conditions and what is happening. We should trust HCs," the top court had said on Monday.Life came to a standstill for shopkeepers and traders at Singhu and Tikri border in Haryana due to the more than 10-months-long farmers’ protest against the three enacted farm laws -- Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-ask-haryana-cm-to-end-farmers-blockade-open-singhu-border-101633771382627.html

Inconvenience caused is regretted,” read an SMS received by a TPDDL consumer in Burari.According to a report carried by PTI earlier this week, the coal supply crisis seems to be deepening as 64 non-pithead power plants are left with less than four days of dry fuel stocks.The latest report from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) also showed that 25 such power plants had coal stocks for less than seven days as on October 3. The report also showed that 17 plants -- with a cumulative installed power generation capacity of 21,325 MW -- had zero coal stocks while 20 power plants of 22,550 MW capacity had one day of the dry fuel stocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/coal-crisis-delhi-may-soon-face-load-shedding-kejriwal-seeks-pm-s-intervention-101633771087824.html
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Diesel rates cross ₹100 mark in Mumbai, highest among metros||Diesel price crossed the ₹100 per litre mark for the first time in Mumbai on Saturday, highest in metros, as state-run oil marketing companies again raised petrol rates by 30 a litre and diesel by 35 paise even as India’s average crude oil import price softened marginally by 2.47% from a seven-year peak of ₹6,026.47 a barrel on Wednesday.After the 10th hike in the last two weeks, on Saturday, petrol became costlier by ₹2.65 per litre while diesel soared by ₹3.85 a litre (the 13th rate hike since September 24). Consequently, petrol is now priced at ₹109.83 per litre across Mumbai pumps and diesel at ₹100.29.Pump rates of petrol and diesel in Delhi also made another fresh record at ₹103.84 a litre and ₹92.47, respectively. While the benchmark automobile fuel prices for the country are set by the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi, retail prices vary from place to place due to local levies.The highest fuel rates are often recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar because of a high incidence of local levies. Petrol is now sold at ₹115.86 per litre and diesel at ₹106.48 in Ganganagar.International oil rates, which are often volatile, directly influence the retail prices of petrol and diesel in India.Benchmark Brent crude on Friday closed 0.54% up at $82.39 a barrel, which was its three-year high. It had surged to $82.56 on Tuesday (October 5) after producers’ cartel - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (together known as OPEC+) – on Monday rejected the pressure from oil consumers to ramp up output to meet surging demand beyond what it had already planned in July.Heavy loads of central and state taxes are also responsible for astronomically high fuel rates. At present, the central and state levies on petrol and diesel are about 50% of their retail prices. According to IOC data, the pump price of petrol in Delhi has about 32.3% central excise component and 23% state levy (VAT). Central tax on diesel is about 35.2% of its retail price, while the VAT component is 14.62%.Throughout 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the Central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States, too, followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/diesel-rates-cross-rs-100-mark-in-mumbai-highest-among-metros-101633768834664.html
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise rave party raid: Nawab Malik names BJP leader's kin 'let off' by NCB, says it must reveal facts||A day after accusing the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) of letting off the brother-in-law of a key Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader after its raid on a cruise ship off Mumbai coast, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik stepped up his attack on the central agency. The NCB has so far arrested 18 people, including Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, after allegedly seizing drugs from the Goa-bound ship. “After raid on a cruise ship off Mumbai coast, NCB's Sameer Wankhede had said that 8-10 people were detained. But the truth is that 11 people were detained. Later, three people—Rishabh Sachdeva, Prateek Gaba and Amir Furniturewala—were released,” Nawab Malik was quoted as saying by ANI.Rishabh Sachdeva is the brother-in-law of Mohit Bharatiya, a former chief of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha—the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)—and Furniturewala and Gaba invited Aryan Khan at the party, alleged Nawab Malik. “We want to ask NCB that when they had detained 11 people after cruise ship raid, then on whose directions did they release the three people. We demand NCB to reveal the facts. We think there might have been some talk between Sameer Wankhede and BJP leaders,” Malik added. “Mumbai Police Anti Narcotics Cell should conduct an independent investigation into this. I will write to CM also. If required, an inquiry commission should be set up to probe the raids.”Also read | Aryan Khan arrest: Nawab Malik releases new videos, questions WankhedeOn Friday, Malik alleged that two were let off by the NCB after “intervention from higher level” and also targeted the agency’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede, saying the officer should clarify how many phone calls he had received during the detention and on whose direction the “high-profile detainees” were allowed to go. The allegations by the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party against the NCB comes a day after the income tax department raided the premises of commercial entities linked to its party leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Nawab Malik also said the motive behind the I-T department's raids on entities linked to Pawar was to malign him.Also read | Cruise ship drugs case: NCB raids producer Imtiyaz Khatri's Mumbai office, homeBefore this, Malik produced video footage on the involvement of two men in the arrest of the accused after the raid on the cruise ship from where drugs were seized on October 2. The footage showed that a BJP officer-bearer, Manish Bhanushali, and a person named Kiran Gosavi, who faces criminal cases, were part of the NCB team which had arrested actor Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan and actor Arbaaz Merchant for their alleged involvement in the rave party.The BJP, however, hit back on Friday, saying that the ruling party’s claims against the NCB were "baseless", and added that Malik "vents out" his anger against the agency due to personal reasons.Notably, Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB on January 13 this year in an alleged drugs case. He got bail in September. The NCP shares power with the Shiv Sena and the Congress in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-names-bjp-leader-s-kin-let-off-by-ncb-says-it-must-reveal-facts-101633767319528.html

But, the Puja committees have decided to keep it a simple affair. Some committees say that there was paucity of time — as permissions came in late — for large scale preparations, and most confirm that they are purposely trying to keep the festivities within Covid-19 compliant behaviour, since the fear of a third wave remains.Conscious decision to be cautious Though Durga Puja holds immense importance for Bengalis, they are choosing to forego grand celebrations, for the greater good. “Our celebrations used to be so big that there’d be traffic jams,” says Prodip Ganguly, secretary, Kali Mandir Society (KMS), Chittaranjan Park. But this year, they will go hybrid in their celebrations, with “devotees allowed in batches of 50 only, for darshan of about five minutes and within barricades”. “We’ll have only the idol of Maa Durga. No bhog or pushpanjali will be allowed inside,” says Anita Halder, convener, KMS, adding, “There will be no sindoor khela, and the idol immersion will be done in an in-house tub.” Submit vaccination proof in advanceAt Arambagh Durga Puja, near Jhandewalan, the puja samiti is inviting devotees to their social media channels for live streaming of Pujo. “Entry in the pandal is only for organisers and their family, who have submitted vaccination certificates in advance. Even hired staff are fully vaccinated,” shares Abhijit K Bose, chairman of the committee. And committee’s president, SK Chakraborty adds, “Hum koi risk nahin le rahe.”‘People are more tech savvy now’ Besides facilitating virtual streaming of celebrations, most committees are facilitating home delivery of bhog with advance booking to avoid contact. “People are more tech savvy now. So we have online pre-booking of bhog, and pushpanjali in sync with the live streaming of mandir purohit chanting mantras,” informs Halder. Suvendu Bagchi, from CR Park B-Block Puja, which is organising a symbolic ghot (Kalash) puja on Mahashtami (October 13), says, “Only 50 people will be allowed in at a time. There’s no pandal hopping this time. We have to be responsible to hold back any possibility of a third wave.” While E-Block mela ground and Milan Samity committee in CR Park are organising one day puja with no devotees allowed, Sarbojanin Puja Samiti, D Block, CR Park, will have the celebrations on small scale and restricted entry in small batches. “The puja set-up is small because we didn’t have time,” says Soumili Sen, from D Block committee. And Sujoy Ghosh, general secretary, Sarbojanin Puja Samiti, adds that as it’s their silver jubilee, “An online anjali will be scheduled and we’ll have a two-feet idol that can be dissolved easily.”“We are holding the Puja in a park, but the tent is not even half of what we used to put up before Covid-19. All of us have to be responsible to hold back any possibility of a third wave,” adds, Suvendu Bagchi, From CR Park B-Block PujaAuthor tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/durga-puja-2021-don-t-want-third-wave-so-keeping-puja-small-safe-101633764932660.html

The price of petrol is also inching towards ₹110 per litre with its current price at ₹109.83. In Mumbai, petrol crossed the ₹100 mark on May 29, 2021.The prices of petrol and diesel in Thane and Navi Mumbai are ₹109.97 and ₹100.42 per litre, respectively.The highest price of petrol is at Parbhani in Maharashtra at ₹112.39 per litre. Diesel is the costliest in Amravati at ₹101.83 a litre. According to oil marketing companies, the hike in the price of fuel is related to a rise in global crude prices.Prices of petrol and diesel, along with LPG cylinders used for cooking in homes, have substantially increased in the last 18 months ever since the first lockdown in the country was announced in March 2020. Earlier this week, Mahanagar Gas also hiked the retail price of compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) by ₹2 each.On the other hand, transporters are planning an emergency meeting to discuss the hike of diesel price on Monday. This comes as the majority of the transportation takes place using diesel vehicles. The increase in fuel prices directly increases goods transportation charges resulting in price rise across several sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/diesel-price-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-mumbai-4-months-after-petrol-jumped-over-rs-100-101633762774130.html

Passing an order based on an application filed by the Goa government seeking a six-month extension from its earlier deadline of August 31 until February 2022, the NGT rejected the government’s request owing to its “leisurely manner” and gave it until December 31 to complete the plan. “We note that there is a breach of the mandate of finalizing CZMP as per CRZ Regulations, 2011 for the last ten years, causing failure to regulate the matters as per law, to the detriment of the environment. Having regard to the long delay which has already taken place, we see no justification for granting the extension sought,” the Tribunal bench of Adarsh Kumar Goel, Sudhir Agarwal, Brijesh Sethi and Dr Nagin Nanda said. “The State cannot go on in a leisurely manner without concern for its duty. Accordingly, we direct that if CZMP is not completed even up to 31.12.2021, the concerned Secretary of State of Goa will not be entitled to salary from 01.01.2022 till the default continues. This direction is being issued in the light of the earlier direction in the order dated 27.11.2019, which remains uncomplied, in view of the further extensions of time granted earlier, as above,” the NGT said. The Goa government filed an application seeking an extension of time for finalizing the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) by six months i.e. till 28.02.2022, as against the time granted and extended from time to time which finally expired on 31.8.2021.The plan has been pending since 2014 when all coastal states were expected to draw up fresh coastal zone management plans based on the CRZ notification of 2011. However, more than a year later very little had moved, forcing a petitioner to approach the NGT in 2015 with a plea to expedite the process. By 2017, the Tribunal directed the MoEF&CC to file an affidavit as to why CZMP for different States was not being finalized besides also issuing notices to 13 coastal States and UTs concerned. It was observed that even though six years had passed after the said regulations were notified, CZMP had not been finalised.The NGT had earlier given the state a deadline of August 31 to complete the plan, which was initially supposed to be completed back in 2014.In its application, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority said that it was still processing the thousands of objections and suggestions it has received at the public hearings held in August. Activists have alleged that the plan, as it stands, is full of discrepancies, missing geomorphological features and the lack of an adequate plan for protecting and restoring the coast, (which is the basis of the CZMP) without which the plans will remain incomplete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-plan-no-salary-ngt-denies-goa-govt-6-more-months-to-complete-coastal-plan-101633751492792.html

09-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The South Ex promenade||Very often restless people have the habit of pacing to and fro in their living room or on their terrace, if they have any. Such an exercise is said to bring clarity to the thought process. That same pacing can also be executed on the dream-like walkway here.If the redesigned Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi can be celebrated these days for its new pedestrian-friendly ambience, what’s preventing people from singing about this airy promenade, just outside the South Extension Metro station in South Extension-2?This late afternoon, the paved stretch is soaked in a soothingly warm sun. A young woman is repeatedly trying to click a perfect selfie with a stray cat under a lamp post. A young man is reading that timeless classic ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’. A woman in long skirt is… well, pacing thoughtfully. Two boys are strolling in circles, their arms on each other’s shoulders. And then there are other people, probably Metro commuters, hurriedly ambling along the avenue, immersed in their daily tensions.There’s no other place in Delhi like this. The stretch (made of tiled and untiled portions) is almost as broad as the Ring Road that divides the locality in two halves. It’s definitely wider than the circular corridor of Connaught Place (CP), another superb pedestrian destination. The promenade is spiritually superior to the CP roundabout (and even to the one in Chandni Chowk) in the sense that it is situated far from showrooms and storefronts, freeing the walker from the distractions of window shopping. Opened simultaneously with the area’s Metro station some years ago, the walkway is too short. But why crib on that point—one ought to be simply grateful that a public infrastructure that would be taken for granted in any great city of the western world has found a breathing corner in our city, otherwise so hostile to pedestrian civilisation.A cynic might point out that nobody’s stopping anybody from enjoying a walk in, say, Lodhi Gardens. But walking this avenue is profoundly different from walking in a park. In a park, one enters to escape from the city, but here one enters right into its heart—yet remains secluded from its irritants. The current easy-going buzz in fact resembles that of a tourist town’s car-free plaza, filled with weekend dwellers. While hanging out in this walkway, one’s eyes instinctively search for a Delhi counterpart of the lady with a little dog, the lonely Russian heroine in a famous Chekhov story—the story begins with her sighting in a seaside promenade. Meanwhile, the lady with the cat is still trying out various selfie poses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-south-ex-promenade-101633740883994.html

The civic body will take a few days to repair the damaged portion of the road.Mayor Balkar Sandhu, along with area councillor Jai Prakash, inspected the ongoing works of repair of the damaged portion on Friday and directed the officials to expedite them.As per officials, the incident was reported on Wednesday night after a major portion of the road, which had been built over a five-decade-old brick sewer line, could not take the load of a heavy truck and collapsed. No injury was reported while the truck driver had a narrow escape.The truck was pulled out with the help of a crane and MC officials commenced the repair works on Thursday.The officials stated that the water line got damaged due to the incident and the supply was snapped in Guru Nanak Pura, and Shahi Mohalla besides other adjoining areas after the incident on Wednesday night.However, temporary arrangements were made to ensure supply of water in regular intervals. Prem Nath, one of the shopkeepers of the area, said, “The residents could have faced issues as the main water supply line got damaged after the incident but the MC had made temporary arrangements to provide them with water.”MC subdivisional officer Anshul Garcha said that the line was repaired by Thursday night and now the bridges and road (B and R) department of the civic body is working on repairing the road.

The court will hear arguments on a fresh bail plea filed by Khalid, who did so last month after the prosecution raised objections towards maintainability of his earlier plea, which led to the former JNU student withdrawing it.Also Read | Umar Khalid files fresh bail plea after police’s objectionOn September 23, the hearing was adjourned to October 9 as Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat was on leave.In a previous hearing, Khalid’s lawyer, senior advocate Trideep Pais, argued before ASJ Rawat that the Delhi Police’s chargesheet in the case read like a script of the Amazon Prime web series “Family Man.” Pais said, “The chargesheet uses rhetoric like ‘veteran of sedition’ for my client. It, therefore, reads like a 9pm news script of one of those shouting news channels. Please understand that the investigating officer is writing all this in a chargesheet, and not in a script of Family Man.”Also Read | Delhi Police chargesheet reads like ‘Family Man' script: Umar Khalid’s lawyer to court“This is the kind of stuff that is read and peddled so that public opinion can be created in order to substitute for the lack of evidence. This is done with the objective to unfairly prosecute people when there is no material to do so lawfully,” he further argued.Khalid, whom the police have described as the “mastermind” behind the February 2020 violence, has been booked under the stringent anti-terror UAPA law, as are several others. Communal riots broke out in northeast Delhi as a result of clashes between those supporting the contentious CAA and those opposed to it.

Likely to be a result of the pressure mounted by a section of councillors, the meeting is expected to take place either on Tuesday or Wednesday.Even MLAs and councillors of the ruling Congress have been slamming the authorities for delayed projects while residents have been raising hue and cry over the failure of MC to build the roads dug by contractors for reconstruction or laying sewer lines. As per MC officials, projects worth more than ₹300 crore have already been allotted or approved in different parts of the city. Congress MLA (central) Surinder Dawar and councillors of central constituency also lambasted the MC officials over the delay in completing the projects during a meeting held with mayor Balkar Sandhu on Thursday. They complained that the contractors have secured the projects moving above their capacity and now they are not able to complete the works in time.Leader of opposition in the MC House and councillor of ward number 30, Jaspal Giaspura said that a contractor has dug roads in Hargobind Nagar and not reconstructing the same citing pending payment by MC. “The MC should get the previous projects completed as the residents are facing a harrowing time. The tender of laying sewer lines in Amardas colony has not been allotted even as six months have elapsed after the project was approved,” he added. District president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “The ruling government thinks that it will benefit them in the upcoming elections if they give nod to more development projects, but it will rather have a negative impact if they fail to complete the projects in time-bound manner.” The opposition leaders demanded that the MC should first finish the already allotted works rather than allocating more projects. The leader of BJP councillors, Sunita Rani, said that few roads in Gandhi Nagar area have also been ignored by the contractors and residents/shopkeepers are being troubled due to dug roads. “The councillors have to bear the brunt for the failure of MC as the public criticises their representatives,” she added. Mayor Sandhu said directions have already been issued to the officials to speed up the development projects and prepare a roster so that residents do not face any trouble due to incomplete projects. The officials have also been asked to take action against the contractors for delaying projects, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-backlog-ludhiana-mayor-calls-another-f-cc-meeting-to-sanction-more-projects-101633737328876.html

Later, the The Resistance Front (TRF) has claimed responsibility for the attack. Her family and friends staged a sit-in protest outside the Srinagar Civil Secretariat with the body and demanded that the killers be punished. Later, senior police officers persuaded them to end the sit-in protest. Kour’s body was later consigned to flames at the Cremation Centre in Karan Nagar. Members of the Sikh community were carrying placards demanding justice. Political leaders condemn killing Several mainstream party leaders also visited Kour’s house to express their condolences, among them were PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah. Calling the attack on civilians an attempt to divide the community, Omar said, “The attacks are taking place back-to-back and no one feels secure here today. The Muslims here have also been targeted, Kashmiri Pandits and Sikh brethren also. They do not feel safe.” “There is an atmosphere of fear, everyone is thinking of leaving from here. It is our responsibility, especially of the majority community, to try to give a sense of security to our brothers and neighbours so that we will not see a repeat of the 1990s-like situation,” he said.“The situation is worsening day by day and the BJP government is responsible for it. Its wrong steps and measures taken since August 5, 2019, (abrogation of Article 370) and before that as well, are directly responsible for the fast worsening situation in Kashmir,” Mehbooba said.Policy failure to blame: PAGD Meanwhile, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration spokesperson Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said, “These killings have created a climate of fear that has not been seen in Kashmir since the early 90s. The current situation is the result of the failure of the policies of the government that have brought Jammu and Kashmir to this point. Be it demonetisation or scrapping of Article 370, these decisions were sold to the country as a solution to the problems of militancy and alienation in Kashmir.” “ In fact, some recent decisions of the Jammu & Kashmir administration have only served to heighten differences between the communities that were otherwise were living peacefully,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-slain-school-principal-supinder-kour-cremated-amid-protests-101633731027171.html

The party workers took out a protest rally in Srinagar against the civilian killings in Kashmir over the past one week and blamed the administration for interrupting the rally. The party’s chief spokesperson Suhail Bukhari said, “So, for its (administration’s) failures, for not being able to protect the people, for the worsening situation and for working against the people, the PDP demands that lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha has no moral authority left to continue and he should resign. He has failed in his work to provide security and development.”Meanwhile, PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also demanded accountability and said heads should roll. “PDPs attempts to take out a unity march in view of recent targeted killings was stopped by police. Ironically, the Centre spreads canards that Kashmiri Muslims do not stand up for minorities.The truth is that this vicious hateful propaganda suits BJPs electoral narrative and prospects,” Mehbooba said in series of tweets. Mufti said attacks could have prevented had the focus been only on security issues. “Until yesterday, the security grid was completely immersed in organising normalcy picnic tours and horseback riding for visiting ministers. Perhaps these attacks could have been averted if their sole focus was not these ministerial visits and normalcy acrobatics.” Perpetrators will be punished: Sinha Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said perpetrators of recent civilian killings will be punished and every drop of blood spilled will be avenged. “ I am deeply pained and anguished and I promise the family members of the innocent victims that perpetrators of the barbaric acts will be punished soon,” Sinha said.“Everyone wants justice. I assure you that we have given free hand to the security agencies to eliminate the enemies of humanity, and soon the terrorists and those aiding and abetting them will pay for their heinous crimes. I want to assure the people of J&K that terrorist’s nefarious plan to destabilize the process of peace, development and prosperity in Jammu and Kashmir will never succeed. Every drop of innocent civilians blood will be avenged,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pdp-demands-j-k-lieutenant-governor-s-resignation-101633730367102.html

He died on the spot.“Yasir Ali killed by security forces at a check point in South Kashmir last night. A heightened state of alert cannot be a reason to open fire like this. Senior officers of the security forces need to ensure calmer heads prevail & nothing happens to worsen the situation,” said Omar Abdullah. Police said that the CRPF personnel had fired in self defence. The incident took place at Monghal Bridge in Anantnag when troopers of 40 battalion CRPF fired on a Scorpio vehicle that did not stop at checking point.“A Naka was established by 40BN CRPF at Monghal Bridge. A suspected vehicle without number was signalled to stop by the Naka party. However, it rushed towards the naka party. It was then challenged by the on duty troops,” the police spokesman said in a statement. “Troops fired upon in self defence in which one person died. But the driver of the vehicle managed to escape from the spot,” the spokesman said.Former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said action should be taken against the trigger-happy personal. “This appears to be the start of a knee-jerk reaction to what has transpired during last two days. Disproportionate force has been used by CRPF, which has resulted in this innocent civilian’s death.

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Monsoon leaves Chandigarh with 29% shortfall||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced monsoon withdrawal in the region on Friday, 13 days later than its normal departure on September 25.This is the most delayed rainy season withdrawal since 2019, as per IMD officials. It retreated on September 30 in 2020 and on October 10 in 2019.According to IMD, monsoon withdrawal is announced when no rain is recorded in the whole region for four to five days in a row and an anti-cyclonic movement starts to form over the region.“Rain continued till the end of September due to the formation of Low Pressure Areas (LPAs) over the Bay of Bengal and due to pressure differences in the region. LPAs had a huge impact on monsoon in this region this year,” said Manmohan Singh, director, IMD, Chandigarh.Weakest monsoon since 2016This year, the region received 600.2mm rain against a normal of 846.5mm, a deficit of 29%.This made it the weakest monsoon since 2016, when 456.9mm rain was recorded.“July and August, which are supposed to be the rainiest months of the year, didn’t see enough precipitation this time. In comparison, September was the wettest month, which is unusual, but has emerged as a trend in the recent years,” said Singh.Monsoon had started off strong with 119.4mm rain in June, though it was 8% below normal. However, at 148.1mm, the rain in July was 48% deficient. The deficit continued in August that saw 160.2mm rain, a 44% shortfall.September sprang a surprise with 172.5mm rain, which was 15% surplus, making it the only monsoon month this year with above normal rain.Punjab and Haryana were wetter than ChandigarhWhile rain remained on the lower side in Chandigarh, overall, the region saw sufficient rainfall.Haryana received 30% excess rain (573.1mm), highest in the past 18 years, which brought along problems for farmers, delaying harvest and sowing of next crop.Though rain was 7% deficient in Punjab (436.8mm), it was highest in the past eight years.IMD officials said Chandigarh remained drier in particular due to local factors and pressure differences that developed over the city.Dry weather aheadOn Friday, the maximum temperature went up from 33.7°C on Thursday to 33.8°C, one notch above normal. But the minimum temperature decreased from 22.3°C to 22.1°C, still four degrees above normal.Dry weather is likely to continue in the coming days, which will see a drop in the night temperature. It is expected to remain lower than 22°C, while the day temperature will be between 33-34°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/monsoon-leaves-chandigarh-with-29-shortfall-101633725449359.html

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh PGIMER gets country’s first HR-pQCT scanner||The endocrinology wing of the Nehru Hospital Extension Block of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is now equipped with country’s first high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scanner, which will be used in early diagnosis of bone disorders.The machine, worth ₹5 crore, has been imported from Switzerland and provides minute details on bone quality and mass, and architectural details comparable to a bone biopsy. Bones scanned using the scanner are usually in the forearm and leg. A HR-pQCT scan emits much less radiation than a standard Chest X-ray. It was inaugurated by PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram in the presence of Kumar Gaurav Dhawan, deputy director (administration); Dr Sanjay Bhadada, head, endocrinology department and other senior faculty members.Dr Ram said, “The HR-pQCT machine is non-invasive and gives quick results on diagnosis of bone disorders, unlike bone biopsy which is invasive, painful and time-consuming. Also, when a patient undergoes CT scans, the machine produces high radiation, but this advanced technology won’t. This treatment option opens a new avenue in PGIMER, not only in patient management but in clinical and basic research.”While detailing the multi-pronged usage of the scanner, Dr Sanjay Bhadada said, “HR-pQCT is useful for the early diagnosis of multiple bone disorders like osteoporosis, primary hyperparathyroidism, steroid induced bone damage, bone disease in diabetes, celiac disease, transplant bone disease, bone disease associated with malignancy, bone disease in thyroid and pituitary disorders and other rare metabolic diseases.”Dr Bhadada added, “Early diagnosis of bone diseases can help prevent future fractures. Also, HR-pQCT can be used to monitor improvement in bone health following initiation of treatment which can be picked up as early as three months. Besides, HR-pQCT will help us conduct advanced research in the field of bone disorders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pgimer-gets-country-s-first-hr-pqct-scanner-101633724965854.html

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala city: Four years on, three development projects hanging fire||Even after four years, three development projects worth ₹28 crore are yet to be completed due to paucity of funds. The projects -- Mahavir Park at Agrasen Chowk; Bal Bhawan, which is next to the park and Navrang Rai Talaab, behind Panchayat Bhawan -- are being developed by the municipal corporation and have missed several deadlines despite the budget being increased twice, official said.Engineers of the civic body said that the process for allotting new tenders with revised budgets is still underway for all the projects.Municipal commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata, said, “Specifications and requirements for all three projects have changed, which lead to increase in costs and stalled their development.”Mahavir ParkThe construction of Mahavir Park started in September 2017 at a cost of ₹9 crore over 25 acres of land. It was planned to have a walking path shaped like a turtle and a restaurant in the lake among other attractions.It is coming up at one of the busiest intersections in the city, which has many sparkling markets and the park is being transformed from a barren water body to a tourist spot.The work was halted in 2019 over paucity of funds and resumed with a revised budget of ₹18 crore after a few months. However, the process stopped again during the lockdown last year and now, more funds are needed.A controversy had erupted earlier when the then health minister and Ambala Cantt MLA Anil Vij wrote to the then urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain, seeking an inquiry into alleged irregularities in a maintenance tender in 2016, before the beautification work started.Navrang Rai TalaabThe pond is surrounded by at least 14 temples and attracts devotees from many north Indian states during the annual vaman mela in September. Its beautification was announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in 2015,with an initial budget of ₹3.5 crore. However, the cost increased to ₹11 crore and work has now stopped due to the change in budget, officials said. Recently, a few devotees were injured after a railing fell into the pond at the site on the last day of a three-day mela last month. BAL BHAWANThe foundation stone of the Bal Bhawan was laid by Khattar in March 2018 in the presence of MP Rattan Lal Kataria and MLA Aseem Goel. It was initially supposed to come up at a cost of ₹6 crore, but after the cost rose to ₹9 crore, the construction was halted. The building adjoining Mahavir Park is in a decrepit state, with more than half its basement filled with rain and sewage water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-city-four-years-on-three-development-projects-hanging-fire-101633724436337.html

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CITCO told to set clear criteria for discounts||Coming down heavily on the way discounts are being given out at Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) Hotels, managing director Yashpal Garg on Friday told the corporation’s officials that it should be based on certain objective criteria rather than pick-and-choose basis.Expressing disappointment at the CITCO officials, Garg said, “If we are allowing a certain average discount to almost all walk-in customers, then instead of bargaining in each case, we should allow it to all customers and remaining discounts should be extended based on specific criteria. The criteria should be known to all guests and be available on the corporation’s website to bring transparency and fairness.”Garg had held a marathon meeting with the officials on Thursday. He said, “The in-charges need to make their best effort by contacting potential customers with aggressive marketing strategies instead of wasting their time in bargaining even for the discount which they are eventually extending.”The criteria may be developed at their levels and after approval from the undersigned, they should be displayed in the hotel and be widely publicised for better business prospects, Garg directed.Questioning the business acumen of the GM/DGMs, Garg said, “Some of us don’t know even know the basic business strategy where break-even point is decided on the basis of variable cost and not on the basis of total cost.”Further castigating the working of some of the officials, Garg, said, “One of GM/DGM was not aware of the average occupancy of the hotel during the last few months/weeks. He didn’t even know the average discount on each category room being allowed by the front-desk on his behalf. In fact, the ongoing rack-rate for each category of room was also not readily available with him.”Avail festive discounts till Oct 31In view of the upcoming festive season, CITCO has decided to offer discounts of up to 35% for room bookings at Hotel Mountview, Hotel Shivalikview and Hotel Parkview from October 11 to 31. In Hotel Mountview, discount for business standard room is 25%, and for executive room and royale suites, it is 35%. In Shivalikview, discount on regular and semi-deluxe room is 30%. For standard room, deluxe room and suite, and premium suite, it is 25%.

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||HT Readers’ take: Check reality of your realty dreams||RERA should act to protect hard-earned money of buyersTo reduce mental agony for buyers and curtail unfair practices by builders, GMADA must proactively come up with appropriate measures i.e instant registration of FIR by exposing the builders and promoters. RERA should not become toothless hence Punjab government must intervene to protect the hard earned money of buyers.Gian Singh, ChandigarhLegal tools in place to protect buyers’ moneyThe available legal tools to regulate real estate business in Punjab is so exhaustive and gives so much strength to competent authorities and government that there is not an iota of doubt that anyone can misuse buyers’ money or flee the country. Breach of trust is a criminal offence, 90-95% end users put in their hard earned money, raise loans to realise life’s one-time dream to own a house. So the government is required only to do introspection to find out what and where it has gone wrong to follow the prescribed processes and legal provisions and plug the loopholes to create accountability.MS Aujla, via emailStricter regulatory authority need of the hourRight from allotment of land to allotment of built up dwelling units to the needy, there is a big nexus of promoters, government agencies as well as financial institutions. There are a large number of cases where innocent buyers are being fleeced on one pretext or the other. In the absence of any concrete solution, they are helpless as to which doors to knock on if they end up losing their money. There needs to be a permanent solution to this problem. There has to be will and intention to honestly implement the Acts framed by our legislative bodies. Besides, there needs to be a strict regulatory body as in the case of Insurance Regularly Authority and Telecom Regulatory Authority to protect the rights of the buyers.SK Khosla, ChandigarhBuyers must examine the veracity of builders carefully One had always thought the GBP group was a reputed real estate group but the recent news that their promoters had fled the country was shocking. This news shows that the authorities should keep a close eye on real estate builders. Authorities should ensure that the promises of these builders are being fulfilled. People should be advised not to be fooled by beautiful images and look into the building projects carefully. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhResearch thoroughly before investing in dream homesOver the past decade, Chandigarh has seen a sudden boom of construction and ongoing residential projects in its periphery. The recent controversy regarding the GBP group has created tension in the minds of people who have already invested in their dream homes. To stop such incidents, people should carry out a thorough research on real estate projects before investing in them. Also, RERA should make it mandatory for each and every builder to upload their financial and legal documents on their companies’ sites. Transparency must be very important before starting any project/investment. Firms that have a history of duping people must be legally barred from working on any upcoming future development projects.Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhPay only security amount before start of projectThe toothless RERA needs more powers, including judicial, to deal with all types of real estate regulatory matters effectively. To keep tabs on builders and realtors who fleece the buyers, they should be allowed to take only security amounts of ₹5,000 to 25,000 (as per the size of the flat and plot) at the time of starting the project. Full payment should be made by buyers only after completion certificate is issued by the RERA. The practice of bookings by developers or realtors should be banned and public will not be trapped and cheated.Subhash Chugh, ChandigarhAbsence of tough regulator to be blamedIn the absence of a tough regulator and unwillingness of an average home buyer to get into expensive court proceedings that could take years, most builders – reputed or otherwise – have been shamelessly taking hapless home buyers for a ride. Builders avoid paying penalties for late delivery of possession by inserting smart clauses in thick apartment buyers’ contracts that most buyers don’t bother to read and later repent having no real recourse. Diversion of money collected from one housing project to another or for speculation in land deals jacks up land prices, and makes homes increasingly un-affordable to most end users. Delays also happen because builders divert funds. Plus they somehow avoid paying penalty. To check diversion of fund, the bill stipulates that 70% of the money collected for a project will be kept in a separate escrow account which can only be used for that project. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhNeed qualified authorities to check anomalies RERA was formed to control the malefic intentions and actions of property dealers and look after the interests of purchasers. But it has failed miserably due to lack of executive powers. To be effective, the authority should have a team of qualified engineers, architects, town planners, environmentalists and accountants. The authority should monitor the activities of the builders right from the time of purchase of land to the final sale of plot/flat strictly as per the laid out norms. Any violation or deviation must be checked at the first point itself. Only then can the menace could be controlled.Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhPromoters dupe unsuspecting buyers and flee abroadThe real estate sector in our country is very opaque. Promoters lure potential home buyers with flashy advertisements all over the place. They promise heaven in the flats and bungalows but the reality is entirely different. We never find any scheme getting completed within time. Promoters take lakhs of rupees as advance from buyers and then when they become millionaires, they flee abroad. Real estate regulatory bodies, such as RERA, have failed to enforce the provisions of the Act and poor gullible buyers have nowhere to go. Even court-monitored projects are taking years to complete. The only way out of the mess and opaqueness is to create an Escrow account for every real estate project so that the money of the buyers is in safe hands.Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhChoose carefullyThe buyer should choose a good broker while buying any kind of property since the broker knows the sector inside out. A good broker plays a vital role as a matchmaker for both the buyers and sellers. So the government should promote this kind of system and keep on checking on unscrupulous brokers. Jaspreet Kaur, via emailShattered dreams, lost savingsThere is a lot of development happening around the tricity. One can see lots of residential and commercial towers everywhere these days. Around 15 years ago, construction was very negligible. But now, construction of residential towers is a trend. What’s more, the rates are so high that a person ends up exhausting their entire life’s saving to purchase one flat. This makes it all the more important for RERA to keep its vigil up. Government must also certify trusted builders so that buyers can approach the right places. Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhBuy only ready-for-possession properties Even if one has to secure a higher amount for housing loan, it is always safe to pay the full and final payment and occupy the allotted accommodation, instead of paying the advance installments and waiting for completion by the builder. To obviate the eventuality of builders fleeing investors, RERA will do well to seek bank guarantees of adequate amounts from the builders before granting approval to a builder to start any housing project, so that the interests of gullible investors remain protected. SC Luthra, ChandigarhMandatory NOC after completion of flatsIt is the duty of the government to verify the builder and check their credentials before giving nod to launch any real estate project. All the essential criteria, including green area, construction material used, safety norms, number of floors, occupied area, working of lifts should be checked from time to time to keep a check on the ongoing construction. In most cases, government officials don’t visit the construction site and give the nod without proper inspection. Sometimes builders have a nexus with government officials, and may bribe them to get a nod by bypassing norms. Government needs to keep tabs on such violations and bring transparency in the working by installing closed-circuit television cameras and recording every activity. Government should take feedback from flat owners to check if the promises made by the builder have been fulfilled. An app or website should be launched where flat owners can make their complaints directly without any hassle. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliInvestors, be cautiousThe past ten years have witnessed Mohali and its peripheral towns of Zirakpur, Kharar and New Chandigarh becoming the tricity’s real estate hub. There are 500 residential and commercial projects in the pipeline. Eight of these projects are being developed by the GBP group. Recently, its promoters have fled the country, leaving 2,500 investors in a fix. They have sought civil and criminal proceedings against them for leaving the work midway. Panjab Real Estate Regulatory Authority(RERA) is expected to keep a watch and oversee the progress from day one till its completion but it has failed to do so. Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act was passed in 2016 to address the grievances of the hapless buyers but it seems to be toothless. The investors should be cautious; they must have a written deal/memorandum of understanding on a non-judicial stamped paper and must obtain the required documents which establish the legality of the case. The buyers, then, can file a case in the court individually or collectively. This will deter the builders from looting the buyers.Usha Verma, ChandigarhThousands fell prey, govt’s duty to protect themThousands of home buyers, who have invested in housing projects of various real estate companies such as GBP group, have knocked the doors of the Supreme Court for protection after being cheated of their investment. The court said it was primarily the government’s duty to step in to rescue them and protect their interests. These people have invested their hard-earned money. They are paying interest on home loans but are not getting their homes. Sanjay Chopra, MohaliStop accepting one-sided agreements It is a known fact that builders and buyers agreement is often one sided and always favourable to builders resulting in physical, mental and financial loss to buyers. Need of the hour is to have model builder buyer agreement to safe guard the interest of buyers from builder’s default. RERA authorities should also be involved in finalising model builder/ buyer agreement. Builder should be penalised with interest to buyer in case of delayed possession to allottee of the flat/ house by due date. It is also pertinent to mention that majority of buyers took housing loan and have to pay interest on the loan amount which adds to their mental and financial agony. Therefore, need of the hour is to have model Builder/ Buyers agreement dully endorsed by RERA authorities to save guard the interest of buyers. Col TBS Bedi (Retd), MohaliScams growing at the rate of real estate growthThe real estate sector is growing at a rapid rate and so are the frauds associated with it. Even consumers are well aware of this but still suspectable to scams. It is government’s obligation to protect the citizens who invested their hard earned money into buying property but unfortunately get cheated by builders. To protect the gullible buyer, the government should take over the management of the groups who cheated on the buyers and get the work of pending construction work completed and hand over possession to buyers. Government should step in to rescue the investors by taking the strict action and imposing huge penalty on defaulting builders. Government should do in-depth checks on the builder’s background and his past work experience before giving the legal rights of development to residential as well as commercial buildings. In case something is fishy, the builder must be immediately blacklisted. Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurReader of the weekNeed strict monitoring, simplified processThe root cause of problems being faced by investors and buyers of residential and commercial properties is the total lack of monitoring by licensing authorities. As an interim measure, the competent authorities should strictly enforce projects as per the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995. All financial transactions of builders should also be monitored to protect the interests of the buyers. Since the present situation continues to be alarming, the state government should set up a task force to urgently review and simplify the working of the real estate sector as most of the realty players in Punjab seem to be heavily stressed due to the cumbersome procedures. Hardaman Singh Bhogal, MohaliExpert takeSingle window for plaintsThe state government should appoint one authority so that allottees can go to one place, instead of multiple agencies. At present, the allottee is totally confused, whether to go to RERA, consumer court or police. State government should also give more powers to RERA so that they can execute their orders.Ravinder Taneja, chairman, TDI, managing director Give teeth to RERARERA should be made powerful enough to deal with such complaints and another agency should be attached to it to execute its orders. Investors should also do their homework and check whether the builder has a valid license, and fulfills norms of the building bylaws. Vipul Ujjwal, chief administrator, GMADA Timely plaintsIn case of problems, home buyers must immediately lodge a complaint with RERA so that action can be taken in a timely manner. Sanjiv Gupta, member, RERA, Punjab Official willingness Despite challenges in the new law, we have given remarkable relief to thousands of consumers in a short period. If officials are willing, then the authority has enough powers to ensure justice is done. Dr KK Khandelwal, chairman, Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Gurugram) Check builder’s credentials Before investing money, the investor should look into the history of the builder. They should also check whether the builder has a license or not. Before taking possession, the buyer should check the completion certificate.

A complaint was submitted to DSP Anil Kumar, alleging that the driver, on instructions of the MP, intended to turn Naraingarh into another Lakhimpur Kheri.However, the lawmaker refuted the allegations and said in fact, his driver and a PRO in the Innova were attacked by the farmers and a complaint has been filed.“They chased the vehicle thinking that I’m inside while I was in the front vehicle of the convoy with state transport minister Moolchand Sharma. They should present a video of the incident,” Saini had said.Meanwhile, Ambala SSP Hamid Akhtar called the farm leaders for a meeting at his office on Friday. This came hours after the top cop met Vij at the latter’s residence, along with Range IG Bharti Arora and DSPs. Vij is said to have discussed the law and order situation in the region.Malkit Singh, district BKU (Charuni) president said they were called by the SSP, who asked them to keep protests peaceful and avoid confrontations.“I told him that our protests are always peaceful and the BJP intends to turn it violent. Police should ask Saini that he is a representative of Kurukshetra, what is he doing in Ambala? On Thursday, speaker Gian Chand Gupta and MLA Aseem Goel also attended a few religious events, but we didn’t agitate against them. But if Saini comes again, we will protest against his presence,” Singh said.For a comment on the same, Akhtar remained incommunicado despite several attempts.In October last year, a similar incident happened a few kilometres away from Thursday’s venue on Naraingarh-Sadhaura Road, near Milan Palace on Ambala-Roorkee national highway, where a 70-year-old farmer Bharat Singh, of village Baragarh died during a tractor rally in support of three farm laws. He was a BJP member and farm unions had protested against the rally.Later, a murder case was lodged against protesting farmers including Malkit Singh on October 14. However, an SIT-led probe found that he had died of heart failure and the FIR was quashed on December 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dsprank-officer-to-probe-naraingarh-incident-vij-101633722747426.html

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Over 4 yrs, no development of focal points in Punjab: Industry||Over four years after the Punjab government, then led by Captain Amarinder Singh, highlighted in its own report how focal points in various parts of the state were in a bad shape, the condition still remains the same with no progress being made on this front. The issue of ailing infrastructure in focal points of Ludhiana and Amritsar was highlighted during a virtual stakeholder meeting of the PHD chamber of commerce and industry (PHDCCI), Punjab chapter, with the state government on Friday. Gurmeet Singh Kular, president, federation of industrial and commercial organisation (FICO), highlighted how since 1996, no new focal point had been given to Ludhiana. “Ludhiana is the world’s second-largest manufacturer of bicycles and bicycle products. The only little progress is that a chunk of land has been given to the Hero group for the Dhanansu cycle valley project. What we need is a focal point in Dhanansu where ancillary units can be set up, but that has not been done. Other focal points are also in a pitiable shape in the state with the government paying no heed to the same,” he said. Kamal Dalmia from Amritsar Textile Association said the industry had suffered a lot post the pandemic. “Amritsar needs special funds to be allocated for infrastructure development of the focal point. There are no proper roads and a lack of sewerage at the old focal point in Amritsar. Plots allocated for the fire substation are lying vacant. In 2009, ₹5 crore was allocated for the development of focal points and in the last 12 years, no fresh allocation of funds has been provided by the government,” he said. In 2017, soon after the Congress government was voted to power, an internal report submitted to the chief minister’s office (CMO) by the Ludhiana administration had highlighted the non-availability of waste compactors in focal point areas and the tendency of industries to litter in nearby vacant plots that was taking a toll on solid waste management. Four years on, the situation is still the same. The industrialists also highlighted that the strength of any state was the MSME sector, but the government had not put in place any policy to strengthen this sector and all emphasis was always on the large-scale units while the MSME sector continued to be neglected. Besides, issues like the demand for the abolition of professional tax, trade licence and fulfilling the long-pending demand of the industry to provide power at ₹5 per unit was also raised. Dr Ashok Khanna, former president, PHDCCI, said the government should focus on strengthening the existing infrastructure with modern facilities and an uninterrupted power supply that would act as a magnet for the industries to invest. Tejveer Singh, principal secretary, industries and commerce, said the department of industries and commerce had taken various initiatives to bolster the growth of the industry in the state in terms of providing a stable policy regime, good infrastructure, focal points industrial parks, skilled manpower, good air and road connectivity, reduced compliance and easy allotment to do business. Avneet Kaur, joint CEO, Invest Punjab, said Invest Punjab was a one-stop office for all investments to happen in the state. She apprised industry members of various initiatives taken by the Punjab government in the last 4.5 years with 3,300 projects on board and proposed investment of ₹99,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-4-yrs-no-development-of-focal-points-in-punjab-industry-101633722449530.html
09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ranjit Singh murder case: Dera Sacha Sauda head Ram Rahim found guilty||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Panchkula on Friday held Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim guilty of conspiracy in the murder of Ranjit Singh, a former dera manager, in 2002. The court also convicted four others, three for killing Ranjit and one for conspiring the murder plot. Special CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg held Jasbir Singh, a follower; Krishan Lal, a dera manager; Sabdil, gunman of Dera head, guilty of murder, and Avtar Singh, a key functionary of the dera, of conspiracy. The quantum of punishment will be awarded on October 12, said, CBI special prosecutor HPS Verma. All convicts face punishment up to death sentence. HC dismissed plea for transfer of trial On Tuesday, the high court had dismissed a plea of Ranjit Singh’s son Jagseer Singh, seeking the transfer of trial to another court in neighboring states, levelling allegations against a CBI lawyer. However, the high court termed the allegations based upon surmises and conjectures. Acting on the plea of Jagseer Singh, the high court stayed further proceedings on August 24, two days before the trial court was to pronounce the final judgment. Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra. Two remains unidentified till now. Ranjit stood against sexual abuse at dera According to the CBI, Ranjit was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter highlighting sexual exploitation of female disciples at the dera. The CBI had stated that the letters on sexual exploitation of female disciples had reference to Ranjit Singh and one of his sisters and in June 2002, he was summoned to Dera when content of the letter came to light. He was threatened with dire consequences but Ranjit Singh refused to “seek pardon”, telling the convicts that he had done nothing wrong. The dera head is lodged in Rohtak’s Sunaria Jail, serving a 20-year-jail term for raping two disciples and life sentence in the murder case of a journalist in 2002. There were mainly three cases registered against the Sirsa-based dera chief since 2002-03. All were investigated by the CBI. The dera chief has been convicted in two cases, one related to sexual exploitation of women disciples and the second of the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. The third case was of Ranjit Singh in which he was convicted on Friday. The first conviction was in a sexual exploitation case in August 2017, which had resulted in widespread violence in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ranjit-singh-murder-case-dera-sacha-sauda-head-ram-rahim-found-guilty-101633722448428.html

The Congress is shedding crocodile tears in the name of farmers protesting against the three farm laws. Had all MLAs of Congress resigned with me, it would have built immense pressure on the BJP,” he said.“If this had been done by Congress, many MLAs from the BJP-JJP would have been forced to resign in solidarity with farmers. The result of the Ellenabad bypoll will make the coalition government realise that these black laws are their death warrant,” he added.Hitting out at the BJP and Congress, Chautala said both the parties have fielded turncoats who have joined both the parties recently but people are waiting to teach them a lesson.“This time I will hit a four (referring to the fourth consecutive win from Ellenabad) and in the next assembly polls, I am aiming for a six (sixth term as an MLA in his political journey) with the blessings of Ellenabad voters. This election will be fought between the farmers and Opposition parties who had betrayed them in their struggle,” Abhay added.Pawan Beniwal was accompanied by leader of Opposition and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, party’s Haryana affairs in-charge Vivek Bansal, Congress state president Kumari Selja, and others.Hooda said what farmers have gained from Abhay’s resignation and this was done to gain political mileage.“The farmers are still protesting and these three laws were not taken back after Abhay’s resignation. If he had resigned for farmers, why is he contesting the election as the farmers are still camping,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ellenabad-bypoll-abhay-chautala-pawan-beniwal-file-nomination-101633722445519.html

Satinder Kour , principal of Government Boys Higher Secondary school in Eidgah, and a teacher at the school, Deepak Chand, were shot dead on the school premises by militants. The Resistance Front (TRF), which police say is the front for terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack and said the teachers were killed for their role in getting students to participate in a “function at school on August 15”.Taking serious note of the killings, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said: “There is outrage among the Sikhs over the incident. The minority communities are not safe in the region. It is the responsibility of the Union government to ensure the safety of the Sikhs in every state of the country.Expressing condolences with the grieving families, she said the SGPC will approach the Centre to raise concerns of the community in Jammu and Kashmir. Besides, the SGPC delegation will also meet the Sikh leaders of the state, she said.

09-10-2021||Chandigarh||HC questions Punjab govt’s ban on outside paddy in 2020||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Punjab chief secretary to explain as to how instructions issued by the state government in October 2020 against bringing paddy from other states would be sustainable at a time when the three farm laws had not been stayed by the Supreme Court.“It is to be observed here that in terms of the law well settled, since 1972, ... instructions contrary to even statutory rules are wholly unsustainable and obviously therefore, instructions in the face of an enacted statute would be completely and wholly illegal in the opinion of this court,” the court said while posting the matter for November 11. The order was passed in a matter in which two people were booked by the Patiala police in October 2020 for allegedly bringing paddy illegally from outside the state.The petitioner’s counsel, Ferry Sofat, had submitted that the order staying the three farm laws was passed by the Supreme Court in January 2021, but the laws came into effect in June 2020. At the time when FIRs were registered against the duo on October 20, 2020, there was no stay on these laws. It was also submitted that instructions issued by the chief secretary were wholly illegal and unsustainable as they were against a statute enacted by the Parliament. Also, as the implementation of the laws had not been stayed at that stage, and the FIR against the petitioners was also illegal and unsustainable, the court was told.While asking the chief secretary for an explanation, the HC also told the Patiala police to file an affidavit, stating as to how the FIR is sustainable in view of the issue raised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-questions-punjab-govt-s-ban-on-outside-paddy-in-2020-101633721005623.html
09-10-2021||Chandigarh||More trouble in store for Dera Sacha Sauda head Ram Rahim||Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been convicted in three cases so far, but there could be more trouble in store for him. The trial in another the case by the CBI is pending before the special CBI court in Panchkula. The case relates to castration of dera followers in 2000. The CBI has claimed that 128 of 166 followers, whose names were mentioned in a complaint, were contacted and examined during the probe. Six of them became CBI’s main witness and deposed against the dera head saying they were castrated at the behest of Ram Rahim at dera headquarters in Sirsa in early 2000. In December 2014, the Punjab and Haryana high court had handed over the probe to the CBI on a plea of one Hans Raj Chauhan of Fatehabad district, who alleged that the followers were castrated after giving them the false hope that “males who would get castrated would be able to achieve God through Ram Rahim”. On February 1, 2018, the CBI had charged the dera head and two doctors in the case. According to the chargesheet, a large number of followers were castrated at the behest of Ram Rahim by Dr Pankaj Garg and Dr MP Singh. Though Ram Rahim has not been charged for the Panchkula violence of 2017, reported soon after his conviction in the cases of sexual exploitation, there has been demand from various quarters to probe his role. In fact, a person in January 2020, approached the CBI court demanding that he be roped in as an accused. His application was based on testimony of a witness who had claimed that the dera head in 2017 gave instructions to resort to violence if he is convicted in rape cases. As many as 36 persons died and 423 were injured in the violence following his conviction in Panchkula alone. Panchkula police had registered 177 FIRs against 2,318 accused and 2,167 were arrested. There were reports of widespread damage in Punjab and Haryana too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-trouble-in-store-for-dera-sacha-sauda-head-ram-rahim-101633720945713.html
09-10-2021||Chandigarh||Indian-origin Singaporean Sikh couple to release docuseries on Guru Nanak||An Indian-origin Singaporean Sikh couple will be releasing online a 24-episode docuseries (a television series) that chronicles the vast expanse of sites that were visited by Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, during his lifetime.Amardeep Singh and his wife Vininder Kaur will release the weekly episodes of the docuseries at no cost on the website TheGuruNanak.com, Singh said on Friday. It will also be available for download.In the next phase, the docuseries, produced by ‘Lost Heritage Productions’ and ‘SikhLens Productions’, will be translated into Punjabi and Hindi.Over 550 years ago, Guru Nanak travelled across the distant lands of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Tibet, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka for over two decades on an altruistic pursuit to spread the message of the oneness of creation.To relate with people of diverse cultures and belief systems, Guru Nanak engaged in philosophical and social dialogue, and through the medium of words and music, he gracefully imparted experiential and spiritual insights, fearlessly challenged the binary constructs of society, and relentlessly opposed gender, religious, racial and class inequalities.In the 21st century, geopolitical restrictions and cultural mandates impose immense challenges to trace Guru Nanak’s extensive travels as approximately 70% of the places he travelled to fall in geographies where filming is difficult.However, in January 2019, the Singh and Kaur led team embarked on a journey to retrace Guru Nanak’s footsteps. “This herculean task, extending far beyond personal ambition, is aimed with a passion to preserve Guru Nanak’s teachings that perceives no borders or human divisions,” said Singh in a press release.Aided with the analytical study of the oldest ‘Janamsakhis’ (biographies of Guru Nanak) and supported by the allegorical messages in Guru Nanak’s verses, the team spent over three years filming all the geographies and multi-faith sites visited by Guru Nanak to present his life events in the form of a 24-episode docuseries.Undeterred by adversities, they travelled from the deserts of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Mount Kailash in Tibet, explored remote regions of perilous Afghanistan, experienced the scorching heat in Iraq, scaled the arid Baluchi mountains in Pakistan, sailed across the waters of the Indian Ocean to disembark in Sri Lanka, blended with the Persian culture in Iran, crossed the delta region in Bangladesh and mapped all four directions in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indianorigin-singaporean-sikh-couple-to-release-docuseries-on-guru-nanak-101633720585309.html

The video was apparently shot in Mohali on Thursday, minutes before Sidhu along with some cabinet ministers and party leaders left for Uttar Pradesh to meet families of those killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.Sidhu and other leaders were waiting for chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who was a bit late, when the video was shot. Hindustan Times could not independently ascertain its veracity. In the purported conversation, while a cabinet minister and MLA were enthused by the success of the event, Sidhu said that had he been made the chief minister, he would have shown them success. It was followed by an expletive-laced reference to the Congress’ prospect in the 2022 assembly elections, which was picked up by microphones. Congress central leader Harish Chaudhary and Sidhu’s media adviser Surinder Dalla denied having any information about the viral video or use of foul language by the state unit president. “I will check and get back to you,” Dalla said. Though party leaders were taken aback by the latest controversy, they refused to comment. BJP, SAD take dig at CongThe Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiromani Akali Dal were quick to target the Congress after the video went viral. Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said: “Finding himself isolated and left behind, Sidhu is on a rampage. In the video, he has also admitted in a huff that his party was rapidly diminishing and losing space.”SAD senior vice-president Daljit Singh Cheema said Sidhu’s utterances made it obvious that he had no respect for the CM and the SC community, and was engaged in one-upmanship to secure the top post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhus-expletive-laden-video-kicks-up-another-row-in-punjab-101633720465268.html

The incident was reported from north-west Delhi’s Sawan Park near Ashok Vihar, the police said, adding that both suspects have been arrested – one after he was caught by the public from the crime scene and the other following police searches the same night.The cab driver, identified as Vipin Kumar, was admitted to Deep Chand Bandhu hospital with stab injuries and he died during treatment on Thursday evening, deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said, adding that the crime was reported to them around 7pm from the hospital. A case of murder was registered at the Bharat Nagar police station and the two suspects, identified as Tajim,22, and Pawan,23, were arrested.During the inquiry, DCP Rangnani said it was learnt that Kumar, a resident of Jahangirpuri, was driving his cab back home, when his two friends from the neighbourhood met him near Sawan Park underpass. The duo asked him to give them a free ride to their home since he was going that way.“Kumar refused after which a scuffle broke out between them. One of the two took out a knife and stabbed Kumar in his thigh. The entire incident took place on the road. Kumar screamed for help and Tajim was caught by the public. A passerby rushed Kumar to the hospital,” she said, adding that Pawan was arrested later in the night.This is the fifth case of murder over trivial issues in the past one week. On Thursday, the Chhawla police arrested two persons, including a woman, for allegedly shooting dead 29-year-old Takesh, the son of an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Delhi Police, for refusing to pay a high interest on ₹2,000 that he had borrowed from the arrested woman, Anita.On the night of October 4, a 25-year-old rickshaw puller was stabbed to death with an ice pick allegedly by another rickshaw puller after their vehicles “grazed past each other” in south Delhi’s Sarita Vihar. Just 24 hours before that, a 30-year-old woman, who ran a grocery shop in south-west Delhi’s Dabri, was stabbed to death allegedly by a plumber over the money he owed her for groceries. The woman was attacked on a busy lane in the market and the assault was captured by CCTV cameras, the footage of which was widely circulated on social media soon after. On October 2, a 19-year-old man was stabbed to death allegedly by a group of five persons, including two minor boys, over ₹300 that the man had borrowed from one of them and was not returning.In another case of murder, two men were arrested on Friday for allegedly killing the 45-year-old caretaker of a bedridden man, the father of one of them, in Rohini’s Sector 3 on September 21. Interrogation of the arrested men, identified as Lovely Verma,46, and Anubhav Sharma,32, revealed that the caretaker, Aslam, was murdered for making some “derogatory remarks” about Verma’s wife some days before the murder, police said.“Verma developed animosity against Aslam for his indecent remarks and he included Sharma in his plan to teach Aslam a lesson. The duo invited Aslam to a party, got him excessively drunk and then assaulted him to which injuries he succumbed later,” said deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhicab-driver-killed-by-two-friends-for-refusing-them-free-rides-101633719625214.html
09-10-2021||Delhi||New DU V-C takes charge, says will focus on infra, recruitment||Continuous recruitment of teachers over the next five years, upgrading university infrastructure to tackle a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, implementation of the new National Education Policy, reopening of campuses in a phased manner, working on the teacher-student ratio, and understanding the DU merit-based admission process – these are some of the priority areas highlighted by Yogesh Singh, Delhi University’s 23rd vice-chancellor, after he took over charge on Friday.The day also saw multiple protests on the campus by several student groups against the high cutoff marks for undergraduate courses and also against the controversial remarks made by DU’s Kirori Mal College professor Rakesh Pandey, who had used a communally sensitive and derogatory term, “marks jihad”, to contend that students from Kerala were being given higher marks in Class 12 so that they could take over the country’s top higher education institutes.When asked about the protests, Singh said, “We will speak to students and listen to their concerns on the process and then consult all stakeholders in the university to see how these concerns can be addressed.”Several students’ outfits – All India Students Association (AISA), National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), and Students’ Federation of India (SFI) – held protests against Pandey’s remarks with NSUI demanding his termination from service and AISA his suspension.This year, colleges such as Hindu College, Ramjas College, and Shri Ram College of Commerce were among the eight colleges that set 100% cutoffs for several of their courses. Several members of the admissions committee in these colleges said most of the students admitted to these high cutoff courses are from the Kerala state board. Meanwhile, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has demanded that the admission process be stopped immediately to start a preliminary screening of students as students from state boards “where marks have been inflated are being able to take admissions”.Speaking on the cutoff process, V-C Singh said he wants to first understand the whole cutoff based admission process in DU. “While IP University admissions are based on entrance exams and DTU relies on Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), DU has been following a merit-based admission process involving cutoffs for many years. If reforms are required, the deans, heads of departments, and principals should advise and we will see if something needs to be done,” he said.Singh was the vice-chancellor of Delhi government-run Delhi Technological University (DTU), an institute he joined in 2015, till he took over the DU V-C.Before that, Singh served as the director of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (now known as Netaji Subhas University of Technology) between 2014 and 2017. Between 2015 and 2017, he handled the charges of both DTU and NSIT. Singh has also served in various administrative and academic roles at the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.On Friday, speaking to media persons during an informal interaction, Singh said he wants to strengthen the implementation of DU rules and statutes while working on maintaining the “soul of the university”. The 55-year-old vice-chancellor will be holding meetings with various stakeholders in the coming days to discuss their issues and take their opinions.Singh’s predecessor Yogesh Tyagi was suspended in October last year, over “dereliction of duty” particularly with regards to the slow recruitment of permanent teachers.“Recruitment should not and will not be a one-time activity. It will be done on a regular basis for the next five years. Around 252 positions have already been advertised and we will continue to work on recruitment and will be active on the matter,” Singh said, adding that the teacher-student ratio prescribed by University Grants Commission (UGC) will be maintained in the university.On reopening the university to all students, Singh said, “We will reopen the university but it will be done in a gradual manner for the safety of our students. We don’t know how the third wave of the pandemic will be and want to exercise caution, especially in the aftermath of the devastating second wave.”Currently, final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students of the varsity are allowed to return to colleges and departments for practical work or for academic consultations.Singh said he would also ensure that the medical infrastructure in the university is upgraded to deal with Covid-19 cases, if any. “We will upgrade the existing medical infrastructure to make both short- and long-term arrangements,” he said.Teachers’ group National Democratic Teachers’ Front issued statement welcoming Singh to the varsity. “NDTF is expecting him to carry out much awaited regularisation of existing ad hoc teachers in departments and colleges. The left out agenda of promotions needs to be taken up expeditiously,” said NDTF president AK Bhagi.There are over 4,100 ad hoc teachers in DU, who work on a contractual basis without benefits such as maternity leave. Various teacher bodies in the varsity have been pressing for the regularisation of these teachers. “We will try to understand the issue of ad hoc teachers, consult stakeholders, and see if there is some way out,” the new V-C promised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-du-v-c-takes-charge-says-will-focus-on-infra-recruitment-101633719567054.html
09-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari to take out rath yatra against Chhath Puja ban||Northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari is going to start a rath yatra from Saturday seeking feedback from the Purvanchal community on the ban on Chhath Puja celebrations in the national capital. He criticised chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for banning the celebrations a month in advance and said the move has hurt the community.Tiwari, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s prominent Purvanchali face, said, “The ban on the Chhath Puja celebrations has hurt the community. When Dussehra and Ramlila celebrations are allowed, weekly markets are open, why is just Chhath Puja banned? I’ll go to residential neighbourhoods where Purvanchalis reside in large numbers and ask for their feedback on the government decision.”Responding to the BJP and Tiwari’s comments, CM Kejriwal said the decision to ban festivities was taken for the welfare and safety of the people and the opposition party was resorting to dirty politics. “I have said this earlier as well, we want people to celebrate all festivals. But for Chhath Puja, people will have to step into water. If even one Covid infected person enters the water, then the entire water will get infected. It can result in a fast spread of the disease. It is due to this reason, we have taken this step ( of banning festivities). I’m sure people will understand this. They will also understand that the opposition is doing dirty politics.” In a recent order, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority banned Chhath Puja celebrations while allowing Ramlila and Dussehra, Durga Puja celebrations, though with restrictions.Chhath Puja, a three-day festival, will be celebrated between November 8-10 this year. It is the most popular festival in Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and parts of Madhya Pradesh. There is a significant presence of the Purvanchal community in Delhi as well.In the past decade, the community has become politically significant as it plays a decisive role in elections.The former Delhi BJP chief said he will start the rath yatra from Sonia Vihar in Karawal Nagar, which has a large Purvanchali population. He also questioned the timing of the decision. “Why was the decision to ban Chhath celebrations taken over a month in advance?” he said while addressing a press conference. Abhay Verma, Delhi BJP chief spokesperson, said last year, too, the Chhath celebrations were banned in Delhi while they were allowed in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. “The government should explain the reason behind the decision. Unlike last year, this time around, people are vaccinated. All we ask is that the government allow the celebrations in accordance with Covid protocols,” he said.Verma said the rath yatra will be taken out in all seven parliamentary constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-mp-manoj-tiwari-to-take-out-rath-yatra-against-chhath-puja-ban-101633719445145.html

Police officers associated with the investigation said that the Palwal-based supplier may be asked to join the investigation if required.On September 15, the Delhi government first announced a “complete ban” on the sale, storage and use of firecrackers in the Capital this Diwali. The pre-emptive ban was imposed in view of the city’s deteriorating air quality over the past three years, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had explained said in a series of tweets. In a separate order days later, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) later extended the ban till January 1, 2022.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said that in the early hours of Wednesday, two personnel from the Sadar Bazar police station were on bike patrol duty when around 3 am, they noticed a loaded tempo going towards Jhandewalan from Motia Khan.“The tempo, which was stopped under our ‘roko and toko’ strategy, was found loaded with firecrackers. The driver, Nagmani (33), and Udit (26) were arrested. The firecrackers, weighing 421.5kg, and the vehicle were seized and a case was registered,” said DCP Kalsi.During the interrogation, the DCP said, Udit, who is an auto-rickshaw driver by profession and lives with his family in central Delhi’s Nabi Karim, revealed that he got the idea of making quick money by selling firecrackers during the festival season. According to police, he contacted a dealer in Palwal and paid ₹70,000 to procure the firecrackers three days ago. Though Udit did not have a licence to store or sell firecrackers, police said he had planned to sell it from his home.“Udit tasked Nagmani to bring the first consignment of crackers into Delhi from Pawal and were in touch over cellphones. When Nagmani entered Delhi and reached near Jhandewalan, Udit boarded the vehicle. They were moving towards Nabi Karim when the policemen caught them,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-held-for-smuggling-over-421kg-of-crackers-into-delhi-101633719266469.html

09-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt disburses one-time aid of ₹50,000 to kin of 13k Covid victims||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Friday said the government has disbursed ₹50,000 as one-time financial assistance to families of 13,005 Covid-19 victims, out of 14,605 applicants, as part of a programme announced in June.A press statement said Kejriwal has issued directions to officials to disburse financial assistance to the remaining families by Wednesday.“The government has completed distribution of 89% of ex-gratia amount. The chief minister has directed that 100% distribution has to be completed by Wednesday,” said the statement issued by Kejriwal’s office, after he chaired a review meeting earlier in the day.Kejriwal during a meeting last week came down on bureaucrats for the “slow” distribution of the assistance, and issued directions that regulatory compliances be done away with.The statement added, “CM Arvind Kejriwal instructed officials to visit homes of bereaved families and transfer the financial assistance to them on the spot... He asked them [officials] to do whatever it takes but register all the victims and start their monthly pension of ₹2,500 in a week, and to ensure that no one is left behind.”The statement, however, did not elaborate on applications received for monthly assistance and absolute numbers of claims disbursed.In June, the Delhi government rolled out a scheme of one-time financial assistance of ₹50,000 to families of each Covid-19 victim and monthly assistance of ₹2,500 for families losing their breadwinners and children orphaned by the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-disburses-one-time-aid-of-50-000-to-kin-of-13k-covid-victims-101633718907688.html

An IndiGo flight departing for Mumbai at 1.05am is the first flight scheduled from T1 after its reopening.“Delhi airport is all set to reopen for domestic flight operations at T1 after 18 months (nearly 19 months by October end) of shutdown. With the resumption of the third terminal, Delhi airport will be functional completely. We would like to assure passengers that at Delhi airport, they would be in a safe and healthy environment. We have implemented several measures at the airport to ensure passenger safety without compromising their comfort and experience,” said Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO of DIAL.He said DIAL teams have worked round-the-clock to sanitise the vast terminal. “DIAL will continue its awareness drive by educating and encouraging passengers to maintain social distancing at the airport,” he said.Commercial operations of domestic and international flights from IGI airport were suspended from March 24, 2020, in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.The airport resumed operations in a phased manner, opening Terminal 3 on may 25, 2020, and subsequently opening up Terminal 2 on July 22, 2021.Speaking of the arrangements at Terminal 1, an official said that six CUSS (common-use self-service) kiosks will be available for passengers for web check-in before entering the Departure forecourt. Additionally, arrangements have also been made for thermal scanning of passengers as per government guidelines. Further, DIAL said it will also have facilities to isolate suspected Covid-19 passengers at the airport.At the check-in area, to avoid close contact and crowding at the counters, passengers will be encouraged to use the e-boarding scanners for entry to the security and frisking points.Meanwhile, at the security check area, queue managers will ensure social distancing between CISF personnel and passengers.The area will also have floor markings and installation of automatic hand sanitiser at various places.Standard operating procedures also include measures for tray disinfection to ensure the safety of passengers. Auto sanitiser dispensing machines have also been kept for passengers to use after security checks.Alternate seating arrangements are also in place at the boarding gates and queue managers will be deployed at boarding and bussing gates.DIAL said it will encourage passengers to wear masks and maintain social distancing at all times.“A team of housekeeping personnel have been deployed to ensure a clean and sanitised terminal for passengers round the clock. The staff will be thermally screened and checked for symptoms before going on with their duties. Regular sanitisation of high contact surfaces, such as desks, chairs, elevators, railings, CUSS, trolleys, handles, trays, baggage belts, etc. inside the terminals will be carried out. Apart from these, washrooms will be closed every hour to sanitise all surfaces,” said an official.Currently, Delhi airport sees around 1,000 aircraft, including chartered flights, carrying over 1 lakh passengers, at T3 and T2 terminals. DIAL estimates reopening of T1 will increase aircraft traffic by another 200 flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-terminal-1-to-reopen-from-oct-31-nearly-19-months-after-closure-101633718905075.html

Of the 226 vaccination sites, at least 104 were workplace Covid-19 vaccination centres.In a press communique the district administration had said that the vaccination target given by the state is 70,000 against which 89,300 doses have been arranged. By 9 pm 46,498 doses had been administered.“Vaccination in urban areas was good but in rural areas the vaccination was not as per the expectation. We shall focus more in rural areas and run an awareness drive to ensure more people come forward to take the vaccine dose next time,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer of Lucknow.With a total over 40.64-lakh doses, Lucknow is leading in the total vaccine dose count among districts in the state since the start of the campaign on January 16.

09-10-2021||Delhi||Covid gloom takes a back seat as Ramlila marks 65th anniversary in Delhi||Putting together a dance-drama, one that uniquely fuses several forms of classical music and dances, martial and acrobatic arts, masks and make-up styles, requires months of preparation. It is a formidable task in the best of times, more so when a pandemic has bound up the city. And yet, the immensely talented artistes of the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK), which organises the cultural extravaganza “Shri Ram” every year, remain unfazed. Even last year, when the fear of Covid was at its height and almost all Ramlilas were cancelled, SBKK managed to stage the “Shri Ram”, a ballet that manages to leave its audience spellbound and awed, year after year. And this year is no different.As the clock strikes six on Thursday evening, the long queue of restless people waiting outside the Shri Ram Kala Kendra trickles in to be greeted by the sound of soft hymns playing in the seating area. They quickly find their seats, placed at a distance from each other owing to Covid-19 concerns, and settle in. Slowly, silence reigns as all eyes turn to the stage for the curtains to go up on “Shri Ram”.In contrast, a flurry of activity is taking place backstage. Elaborate jewellery and costumes are laid out in the green room as artistes essaying the different roles allow assistants to give them last-minute touch-ups. Among them is Raj Kumar, a Chhau dancer, who has been playing the central character of Ram for the production for the past 25 years. Kumar said the team is excited to reconnect with the audience. “Since the pandemic situation is better this time, we are hoping to see a larger turnout -- last year, the fear was palpable and people wary of stepping out. We are excited and look forward to entertaining the audience,” he said. As he and the other artistes go about fixing their jewellery and costumes, Shobha Deepak Singh, the brain behind the “Shri Ram” walks in. Since the past five decades, the cultural doyen has been directing the fusion dance-drama that is attended without fail by the who’s who of Delhi. “Even when the world came to a standstill last year, we ensured that “Shri Ram” continued to interact with audiences. This time, we started preparations in the beginning of September with fully vaccinated artistes. To cut the risk of transmission, our artistes stayed at the hostel on the premises,” said Singh, as she fixes the jewellery of an artiste. “While the Ramlila is on stage for a fixed number of days, the preparations continue throughout the year. It’s an ongoing process. Every time I see the performance, I am able to spot areas where we can improve further,” said Singh, who has her eye on the minutest of details. First started in 1957, the “Shri Ram”marks its 65th anniversary this year. Over the years, it has seen a number of innovations as it kept pace with the changing trends. This year too, the Ramlila has incorporated a number of new elements. “This year, “Shri Ram” has a special background music, adopted from the older version of our own Ramlila. The choreography and jewellery have also been tweaked. The SBKK is perhaps the only institution that does not have to purchase anything from outside -- be it costumes, ornaments or jewellery. Both the jewellery and ornaments are specially designed by our in-house experts who have been associated with us for the past several decades,” said Singh. Staying true to its tradition of having artistes from across India, this year, too, the Ramlila has actors from the different states and also from countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh. A fusion of different dance forms and martial arts styles, ranging from Bharatanatyam and Kalaripayattu to Chhau, will enthral the audience during the nearly two-hour long production that will be staged daily till October 20. This time, a number of students of SBKK have been roped in to play crucial characters in the ballet. “We have around 20 students of our own who have been involved in the production. This is a great opportunity for them and will give them a lot of exposure,” said Singh. Sapan Majumdar, 41, who has been playing the character of Ravana for the past 25 years, said the production is a huge morale booster for artistes who faced financial hardships during the pandemic. The return of “Shri Ram” would herald the beginning of better times, he hoped. “At the end of the day, every artiste craves the stage and the audience. We perform for the audience and it’s a matter of pride for us to carry forward our legacy year after year. We hope that with this year’s production, we will be able to tide over the gloom of the pandemic,” said Majumdar, as he rushes to join the other artistes for the inaugural session of the ballet. And just like that, the cultural extravaganza came alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-gloom-takes-a-back-seat-as-ramlila-marks-65th-anniversary-in-delhi-101633718245356.html
09-10-2021||Dehradun||Independent MLA from Bhimtal joins BJP, third legislator to join party in 2 months||Independent MLA from Nainital’s Bhimtal constituency, Ram Singh Kaira, joined the ruling BJP at the party headquarters in New Delhi on Friday in the presence of senior party leaders including Union minister Smriti Irani. Kaira had won the Bhimtal constituency during the 2017 state assembly elections amid the thumping mandate given to the BJP in the same elections. He had earlier held many senior party positions in the state Congress unit including the post of state general secretary. Kaira is the third MLA to join the BJP from the Opposition. Before him, independent MLA from Dhanaulti constituency- Pritam Singh Panwar and Congress MLA from Purola constituency- Rajkumar had joined the ruling party last month at the party headquarters in New Delhi. Welcoming him to the party fold, Uttarakhand BJP president Madan Kaushik called him a very popular leader in his constituency. “Having started his political career with student politics, Kaira also actively participated in the statehood movement before joining Congress which he left to contest independently in the 2017 elections. He is a very popular leader in his constituency and has always raised issues in the state assembly with determination to make the Congress uneasy at times,” said Kaushik. “His inclusion in the party will make it stronger in the Bhimtal area,” he added. Senior BJP leader and Union minister Smriti Irani said, “It is a matter of pride that a person like Kaira who has contributed immensely to the state of Uttarakhand, has joined BJP today.” “We wholeheartedly welcome him to the world’s biggest party and we are hopeful that working along the party lines, he will help in taking the state ahead on the path of development,” Irani said. Kaira while expressing his gratitude for the welcome meted out to him in the party said that he decided to join BJP as he thinks it is the “only party which works for the people”. “While working as an independent MLA, I contemplated and figured out that BJP is the only party which works for the society and country and not politics. I was greatly influenced by PM Modi’s thoughts and hence decided to join the party,” said Kaira. The Congress in turn has claimed that MLAs joining the BJP will not make any difference in the 2022 state assembly elections. “It does not matter how many MLAs BJP gets to join their party. It did nothing for the development of the state in the last four and half years. It will lose the upcoming 2022 state assembly elections,” said Congress state president Ganesh Godiyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/independent-mla-from-bhimtal-joins-bjp-third-legislator-to-join-party-in-2-months-101633718185180.html
09-10-2021||Delhi||Phase 2 of Delhi’s Bharat Darshan Park to cover 17 monuments from across India||With the upcoming Bharat Darshan Park in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh nearing completion, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has already begun planning for phase 2 of the project, identifying 17 monuments from 17 states and union territories to recreate in the park using scrap material.The park currently features 21 replicas of prominent monuments, made using 350 tonnes of scrap material collected from various municipal yards, from 13 states and union territories. The park, which is spread over 8.5 acres, is likely to be inaugurated by October end.Mukesh Suryan, the mayor of the south corporation, said that the work on creating the replicas has finished and that they are currently involved in creating pathways, finishing electrical work and developing green areas. “We are working round the clock to throw open the park by month end and then we will try to cover the monuments from remaining states in the remaining space,” the mayor said. The corporation is also setting up a 1.5-km-long walking track, an amphitheatre for holding cultural events and a food court.Officials said with a plan to feature at least one monument or cultural icon from each state, the second phase of the park will focus on the northeastern states: the Unakoti caves from Tripura, Rang Ghar from Assam, a Naga house replica from Nagaland, Mizo dance form from Mizoram, wood masks from Sikkim, Behdienkhlam festival from Meghalya and figurines of Manipuri dancers. Twang Gate from Arunachal Pradesh, which was expected to be covered in phase 1, will also be taken up in the second phase, said officials.Among the other monuments selected for phase 2 include the Thiksey monastery from Ladakh union territory, Nishant Bagh from J&K and Masroor temple from Himachal Pradesh. The civic body has also selected Narnaul’s Chor Gumbad from Haryana, Basilica of Bom Jesus from Goa, Lepakshi temple from Andhra Pradesh, Sirpur temple from Chhattisgarh and race boats from Kerala. A senior official working on the park development said that they have a set a deadline of October 25 to complete the phase one work. “If both the phases are considered together, there will be 39 replicas of monuments or cultural icons with representation from each state and union territory. The park will also have food court featuring cuisines from various states so that visitors get a wholesome experience,” the official said.The project had run into controversy earlier after a replica of the Golden Temple in Amritsar had to be dismantled in June following objections by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (DSGPC). The civic body replaced it with the Char Dham replicas from Badrinath in Uttarakhand, Jagannath temple in Odisha, Dwarkadhish in Gujarat, and Rameshwaramin Tamil Nadu, which have been placed in the four corners of the park, an official said. “To represent Punjab, a replica of the Sheesh Mahal may be set up in the second phase,” official said.After the Waste to Wonder park at Sarai Kale Khan, the Bharat Darshan Park will be the second such park featuring replicas of monuments prepared from salvaged junk material from municipal corporation yards. “Since the number of monuments and area of the park is much larger than Waste to Wonder park, the entry fee is expected to be at least ₹100 per person,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/phase-2-of-delhi-s-bharat-darshan-park-to-cover-17-monuments-from-across-india-101633718125167.html
09-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt tells staff to get vaccinated by October 15 or miss work||In the first major vaccine mandate in the national capital, it has been made compulsory for all state government employees to be at least partially inoculated against Covid-19 by October 15, failing which they will not be allowed to attend work, and their absence from duty will be counted as leave, said an official order from the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday.To be sure, Assam earlier this month put in place a mandate for its government staff, while Odisha made jabs compulsory for all its staff in Bhubaneswar.“All government employees working in departments, autonomous bodies, PSUs, local bodies, and education institutions under government of NCT [National Capital Territory] of Delhi, including frontline workers, health workers, as well as teachers and other staff working in schools and colleges, should get vaccinated (at least first dose) by 15.10.2021 as per prevailing guidelines and protocols prescribed for vaccination by the Union government,” said the order, a copy of which HT has reviewed.It added, “The aforementioned government employees, health workers, front line workers, teachers, and other staff in schools and colleges, who do not get vaccinated (at least first dose) by 15.10.2021 shall not be allowed to attend their respective offices, healthcare institutions and educational institutions with effect from 16.10.2021 till they have obtained the first dose vaccination. The said period of absence from duty shall be treated as ‘on leave’ till the administration of the first dose of vaccination.”To be sure, there is currently no provision for state government employees in Delhi to work remotely.According to the CoWin dashboard, nearly 12.5 million people in the Capital have got at least one jab of either Covishield, Covaxin, or Sputnik V — the three vaccines currently available across the country. Of these, 6,393,602 have taken both doses and completed their Covid-19 immunisation regimen.According to government estimates, the city has a total adult population of 15 million.Delhi has so far recorded around 1.44 million Covid-19 cases and 25,088 deaths. A bulk of these infections came between April and May this year, when the Capital was struck by its fourth and most brutal wave of the pandemic yet.With the festival season approaching, DDMA’s decision comes at an important juncture. Between Dussehra and Diwali last year, Delhi witnessed its third wave of the viral disease, peaking at 8,593 new cases a day in mid-November.The Delhi government has at least 200 departments, such as finance, revenue, health, education, home, water, power, transport, urban development, excise, social welfare, which employ around 500,000 workers.The heads of Delhi government departments concerned have been entrusted with monitoring the process and verifying each employee’s vaccination status.On September 29, the state government’s education department made it mandatory for teachers and staff in its schools to get at least one jab of a Covid-19 vaccine by October 15.A senior government official said a recent internal survey showed that more than 90% government employees have taken one dose of the vaccine so far.Health experts hailed the government’s move.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “It is a good move. Government offices are closed spaces. There is always a risk of transmission, especially in departments that involve public dealings.”“Many government employees are also parents of school-going children. This policy will ensure that not only are school staff vaccinated, but consequently a large number of parents are vaccinated too. This is an important decision ahead of the festive season,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department at Safdarjung Hospital.“However, from a public health point of view, such orders can be problematic. The government should invest more on encouraging people, even its employees, to get vaccinated voluntarily.”Currently, there are hardly any restrictions in Delhi other than on political, social, religious, and other gatherings; a a cap on the number of guests in restaurants and bars; and on in-person lessons for students below Class 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-tells-staff-to-get-vaccinated-by-october-15-or-miss-work-101633717946676.html
09-10-2021||Gurugram||Locals protest against Friday prayers in Ggm Sec 47, Muslims move to new site||Around a 100 Muslims, who had gathered in Sector 47 to offer Friday prayers, were asked by the Gurugram police to shift their prayers to a site around 200 metres from the original spot after a group of residents protested against them offering namaz in a public place. The prayers, however, were conducted peacefully at the new site in the presence of police. At about 1pm Friday, around40 to 50 residents gathered at the prayer site, which is located on a vacant ground in Sector 47, and began shouting slogans. They also carried placards demanding a stop to Friday prayers in open spaces. The protesting residents said Friday prayers should be offered in mosques or on Waqf Board land, and not in public places. Sunil Yadav, president of the residents’ welfare association of Sector 47, said, “Every week, hundreds of people gather in this area to offer namaz on government land. Due to this, vehicular movement gets affected as the plot is next to a private school, and the namaz timings clash with the time when school ends and our children return home. They (Muslims) should offer prayers at mosques or in their religious institutions. We had raised the matter with the district administration earlier also and have submitted a letter on Friday as well. The administration assured us that they will look into the matter and find a solution,” he said. Residents also alleged that until a few months ago, around 20 people would gather at the spot for prayers on Friday; but now the number is close to 200. They also said a majority of the people who gathered there on Fridays were not from the area. Kuldeep Yadav, councillor of ward 29, who was present at the spot, said they submitted a written complaint to the administration. “We asked the administration to tell us which resident consented to the use of this site for offering prayers. Residents are protesting because they want this practice to end,” he said. In 2018, the district administration had designated 37 sites, including the Sector 47 site, as places where prayers could be offered on Friday. Yadav, however, said this arrangement was not permanent and the authorities must find a solution. Muslims, who had gathered for prayers on Friday, said they shifted the prayers to another site nearby as local police requested them to do so in view of the protests. Mufti Mohammad Salim Qasmi, president of the Gurugram unit of Jamiat Ulama, said they complied with the request as their purpose was to pray peacefully. He also said there were only 13 mosques in Gurugram-- hardly enough for the 500,000-strong Muslim community of the city. Some members of the community, however, are angry over the protesters’ allegations of them blocking traffic, which they said was blatantly false. They also said being asked to move was a violation of their right to worship. “A handful of people are overruling the Constitution of India that gives citizens the right to practise their faith without fear. Their allegations are completely false. This is being done to malign and suppress Muslims. I appeal to the administration and the state government of Haryana to allocate land in several sectors of Gurugram so that we can build mosques,” said Altaf Ahmad, co-founder, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a civil society group. Aman Yadav, ACP, Sadar, said, “The matter has been brought to the notice of the SDM and district administration. The protesters submitted that this land is meant for a market and they had not given written consent for it to be used as a prayer site. They have been protesting for the past three weeks. Namaz was offered peacefully after Muslims moved slightly away from the site in view of the protests.” For the past three weeks, offering prayers on Friday at various open sites in Gurugram has become an issue after a Hindu group started appearing at these sites and opposing the prayers, leading to tension. The issue was also widely discussed on social media. In April this year, members of the right wing group had protested against the practice of Friday prayers in the open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/locals-protest-against-friday-prayers-in-gurugram-sec-47-muslims-move-to-new-site-101633717585514.html
09-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram student shot dead after an argument on varsity campus||A 24-year-old student of SGT University in Budhera, around 10km from Gurugram, was shot dead allegedly by a fellow student on campus over a personal dispute on Friday afternoon.Police said the suspect fled from the spot after the incident and was yet to be traced till Friday night even as investigators detained one of his accomplices for questioning.The deceased student was identified as Vineet Kumar from Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh, a fourth-year student of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery at the university.Police said the incident took place around 12.30pm, when the victim, Vineet Kumar, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli and a fourth-year student of BAMS at the university, and his friends were returning to the hostel on the same campus. Police said that a law student, Pankhil, alias Lucky, and his accomplices confronted Kumar and after a heated argument, Pankhil allegedly shot him. Kumar was taken to SGT Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Police said a case of murder was registered at the Rajendra Park police station against Pankhil, a resident of Najafgarh.His accomplices, identified as Nitesh, Rahul and Himani (all known by their first names), were also booked in connection with the matter, police said. Police did not reveal which of them was detained on Friday but said that they were still looking for the others.“Kumar was shot in the abdomen and later succumbed to his injuries. A number of students are being questioned in this connection and CCTV camera footage is also being analysed. We will soon arrest the accused,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Saharan, adding that all the suspects in the case studied at the same university.In his complaint to the police, Kumar’s friend Harsh (identified only by his first name) said that they were attending class, when Lucky and his brother Nitesh, both students of the same college, asked Kumar to step out, but the teacher did not allow Kumar to leave the class.When the session ended around 12pm, Kumar, sensing trouble, asked Harsh and a few other friends to escort him to the hostel as he fearedthat Lucky and his friends would try to pick a fight.When the group neared the hostel, Lucky and his accomplices stopped them and started fighting with Kumar.

The agency claimed that the market value of the property, mortgaged as collateral for a ₹400-crore loan advanced to Avantha Group, was about ₹550 crore, but it was acquired by M/s Bliss Adobe Pvt Ltd, a firm in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and authorised signatory, for ₹378 crore. CBI also claimed that the sale proceeds were not used to clear the entire loan, and instead the loan was subsequently declared as a non-performing asset. “Against this favour, the then MD and CEO of Yes Bank extended an additional loan of ₹1,360 crore (approximately) to some other company of Avantha Group,” said a CBI officer.“It was also alleged that the said loans were never utilised for the purpose for which they were given and the borrowers were allowed to divert the funds for ever-greening of existing loans of the group companies” said the CBI officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-charge-sheets-rana-kapoor-his-wife-avantha-group-promoter-101633715185061.html

Citibank had vacated the place in June 2019 after the expiry of their lease.According to the documents accessed by Zapkey.com, a real estate date analytics and research firm, the lease deed was registered on September 28. A stamp duty of ₹30.86 lakh was paid along with ₹30,000 as registration charges for the deal.The stamp duty document reveals that Bachchan and his actor son Abhishek have given the 3,150 sq ft ground floor for 15 years to the bank. There will be cost escalation of 25% every five years. In the first five years, a rent of ₹18.9 lakh will be paid monthly, which will increase to ₹23.62 lakh for the next five years and ₹29. 53 lakh for the last five years.SBI has paid ₹2.26 crore as deposit for the property, which is almost the rent for 12 months.According to Sangeet Hemant Kumar, founder and CEO (chief executive officer), SHK Ventures, which deals with high-end properties in JVPD, the premium levied on this property is justified. “This is a marquee property which belongs to Amitabh Bachchan, who is a superstar, and is just next door to his house. This is bound to attract a premium. In addition, this is a corner prominent spot in Juhu,” said Kumar.He added that the current lease rent in JVPD is ₹400- ₹500 per sq ft.JVPD scheme is one of the plush areas in Mumbai, housing several Bollywood personalities such as Dharmendra, Anil Kapoor, Rakesh Roshan, Sunny Deol, Shatrughan Sinha and Rohit Shetty. Last December, actor Ajay Devgn had bought a bungalow, spreading across 474.4 sq metres for ₹47.5 crore in this area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amitabh-bachchan-leases-property-near-mumbai-home-to-sbi-for-18-9l-month-for-15-years-101633714944887.html
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Drugs seized on cruise: BJP leader’s kin was detained but let off by NCB, says NCP||Nationalist Congress Party (NCB) leader and Maharashtra minority welfare minister Nawab Malik on Friday has alleged that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) let off the brother-in-law of a key Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader after officers from the agency received calls from the party leadership. Malik has announced to produce a video footage to prove his claims on Saturday in a press conference. On Wednesday, Malik had alleged lapses in the raids on the cruise from where drugs were seized on October 2 and produced a video footage on the involvement of two private persons in the arrest of the accused in the rave party. The footage produced by Malik in a press conference showed that a BJP officer-bearer, Manish Bhanushali, and a person named Kiran Gosavi, who is facing criminal cases, were part of the NCB team which had arrested actor Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan and actor Arbaaz Merchant for their alleged involvement in the rave party. Malik had also raised questions over their presence during the raids and their handling of the accused. On Friday, Malik alleged that 10 people were detained by the NCB team during the raid, but two were let off after “intervention from higher level”. “One of them was the brother-in law of a key BJP leader. Both of them were brought to NCB office, but were later allowed to go. NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede had said after the raid that they had detained eight to 10 people. Why did he not give the specific number of the detainees? Was he vague on the number because he had to free two people? We will produce a video-recording to prove that two detainees were freed from NCB office and one of them was the relative of a high-profile BJP leader,” he said.NCB had raided on an off shore rave party on a cruise ship along the Mumbai coast on Saturday night. At least 10 people were either detained or arrested, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan and two of his friends.Malik said Wankhede should clarify how many phone calls he had received during the detention and on whose direction the “high-profile detainees” were allowed to go. He should also clarify what connection he has with BJP. Malik said a few government officials such as ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh were involved in ill practices under the guise of actions against criminals. “Bollywood artists were harassed for money by seizing 1-2 grams of drugs. We will expose it all in due process,” he said.Leader of opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar said, “The allegations levelled by Malik are baseless as NCB will never allow any person arrested to let go. If Malik has any proofs related to it, he should submit them to the investigating agency, rather than wasting time in producing them before the media. If such proofs are handed over, the NCB will take action and ensure that the guilty are punished.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drugs-seized-on-cruise-bjp-leader-s-kin-was-detained-but-let-off-by-ncb-says-ncp-101633714768428.html

The authority had initially decided to pay between ₹24 lakh and ₹4.12 crore per acre, depending on the land’s location. The revenue department has decided that the relief for those being paid ₹24 lakh per acre should be increased to ₹1 crore. After the department forwards the recommendation to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the authority will take the final call on whether to enhance the rates. Mohali district revenue officer Gurjinder Singh Benipal said, “We had previously also advised an increase in the compensation and now, as decided, the final amount will be recommended to NHAI.” NHAI had earlier released ₹450 crore to acquire 450 acres in 66 villages to construct the 32-km road, but affected landowners in Nagiari, Devi Nagar and other villages objected to the low acquisition rates. A senior NHAI officer said, “We have already released the compensation as per the collector rates. Senior officials will take further decision on increasing the relief.” A greenfield road is built in an area that has never been developed. The planned road from IT Chowk near the Chandigarh International Airport to the Kurali-Chandigarh Road will provide an alternative route to traffic moving between the Delhi side and parts of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Ashoka Buildcon Limited has been finalised to execute the project. The NHAI had come up with this project after scrapping the project to widen the 40-km Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in July 2019, owing to its high cost. Even MP Manish Tewari had taken up the need for an alternative route with Union minister Nitin Gadkari in February 2020. More recently, on September 30, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, along with party leaders and workers, had held a protest in Mohali against the low compensation rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-enhances-relief-nhai-to-take-final-call-101633708703264.html

The function in New Delhi was attended by a number of top leaders, including defence minister Rajnath Singh, RJD president Lalu Prasad and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Former MP and JAP president Rajiv Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav was also present at the function, organized by Chirag Paswan.Kumar, who had skipped a similar functioned organised by Chirag Paswan in September in Patna, was the first to arrive at the event organised by Paras, making clear his support for the group. Governor Phagu Chauhan also attended the function.Several ministers of Nitish Kumar’s cabinet, both from JD (U and BJP, and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi also attended the event. Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav did not turn up but his elder brother, Tej Pratap Yadav, came to pay his tributes. Recalling his long association with late Paswan, Kumar said, “His memories shall ever reside in our hearts. And we will do whatever is required by way of commemoration.” Paras has demanded that the Bihar government make a request to the Centre for conferring Bharat Ratna on the late leader and installation of his life-size statue in the state. Paras has extended his party’s support to JD(U) which is contesting both the assembly seats, Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur, where bypolls are to be held October 30.Chirag has also announced candidates for the two assembly seats. In 2020, the LJP, headed by Chirag, had contested assembly elections alone, damaging JD(U)’s prospects on many seats. Nitish Kumar’s party ended up with its worst ever electoral performance, though the NDA secured a majority and BJP backed Kumar for another term in office.The BJP has since distanced itself from Chirag leader and ended up recognising the breakaway faction headed by Paras, who also secured a berth in the union cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/paswans-death-anniversary-paras-chirag-hold-parallel-functions-held-in-patna-delhi-101633707985236.html

In the closure report filed in the court of chief judicial magistrate Sanjeev Kundi, the police have recommended the cancellation of an FIR registered against Amit Vinayak, alias Dimpy Vinayak, under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the complaint of Karan Kataria’s brother Ankit Kataria. On February 6, the contractor shot at his wife, his three-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son with his revolver before shooting himself around 4am. Both the children and the contractor died, while his wife survived the injuries. Initially, Karan’s brother had claimed in his statement that Dimpy refused to return money to his brother and also threatened him, after which his brother took the extreme step. In a statement in the court on Friday, Karan’s brother said he has no objection to the closure report filed by the district police for cancellation of the FIR. The police had also registered another case against the Karan under Sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC and Arms Act for killing his two children and injuring wife. Meanwhile, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed by Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana in the Punjab and Haryana high court against the closure report. The PIL also demanded CBI inquiry of the incident. The matter will be taken up by the high court on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/faridkot-deaths-i-abetment-to-suicide-police-file-closure-report-in-fir-against-warring-s-brotherinlaw-101633698382097.html
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Part of Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 between Central Park in Kharghar and Pendhar can start operations in Dec 2021||The Navi Mumbai residents can take a Metro from Central Park in Kharghar to Pendhar by the end of this year if all goes according to plan.This corridor is of 5km length and has five stations – Pendhar, Pethali Taloja, Amandoot, Pethapada and Central Park.The Navi Mumbai Metro project, which is delayed by more than a decade, is now expected to start operations on the remaining six stations from Belapur to Kharghar by December 2022. The Navi Mumbai integrated elevated metro rail corridor is expected to not just connect the city’s nodes and boost the transit system but also act as an economic booster.CIDCO is developing four elevated corridors under the Navi Mumbai Metro project that will connect to the proposed international airport. The entire first phase is a 11km-line from Belapur to Pendhar and is a ₹4,000-plus crore project. It has 11 stations, a depot for maintenance at Taloja and two traction sub-stations in Panchanand and Kharghar.Following constant delays, CIDCO, in February this year, appointed Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (Maha Metro) for completion of Line 1. Maha Metro will also run services on Line 1 for 10 years as per an agreement in July this year.CIDCO VC-MD, Sanjay Mukherjee, said, “The project was delayed due to several engineering and other issues. The car sheds were ready, rakes procured but the stations did not come up. Maha Metro has a good track record on Metro project and hence its expertise has been sought for completion of the project and also for running it.”The trial run of Line 1 was conducted successfully earlier this year. This was followed by Oscillation Trial under the guidance of Research Design and Structured Organisation (RDSO) in September. The ministry of telecommunications then inspected Stations 1 to 10 on the route and granted the Dynamic Clearance Certificate recently. The next step will be the ISA certification.Mukherjee added, “With several important permissions in, we are now aiming for safety certification from commissioner, Metro Rail Safety. We will then be able to start partial commercial operations of Line 1 from by year end. The full operations should begin from December 2022.”On Lines 2 and 3, the detailed project report of which has been approved by CIDCO, Mukherjee said that they were waiting for a cabinet resolution by the Government of Maharashtra and a Government of India notification authorising it as the agency for the project.Special emphasis has been given to make Metro accessible to people. This includes provision of feeder buses, shared auto rickshaws, e-rickshaws, bicycles and scooters. Similarly, for the convenience of passengers, lift and escalators have been provided at all stations. Provisions have also been made for disabled persons.A spokesperson of Maha Metro said, “Various civil, electrical and system works that include electrification, signalling, telecommunications, among others for the Kharghar to Pendhar line are in the advanced stage of completion. The track work has also been completed.” The responsibility of Maha Metro includes recruitment and training of train operators, controllers, security and safety personnel and station staff, safe and punctual running of train and to provide passenger amenities at stations.Dinkar Samant, Urban planner, said, ”Kharghar will benefit from this Metro project as around a 7km stretch of Kharghar is along the Sion-Panvel Highway. The Metro will reduce the traffic congestion here. The major housing projects in Kharghar too will benefit from the Metro. Places like Taloja and its surrounding areas including Ghot and Koyanaville villages will be connected to rail routes.”Bhupendra Shah, Chairman Trustee Board, Builders Association of Navi Mumbai, said, “A separate Metro line should be laid along with the under-construction Mumbai Trans Harbour Link connecting Mumbai to Navi Mumbai. It is a good move to connect Mumbai and Navi Mumbai airports through Metro as is seen in international cities like Singapore and Dubai. The Metro will boost the economy just as the railway did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/part-of-navi-mumbai-metro-line-1-between-central-park-in-kharghar-and-pendhar-can-start-operations-in-dec-2021-101633696166856.html
09-10-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand police propose 10-year imprisonment for mass conversions||The Uttarakhand Police have proposed making mass conversions punishable by up to 10-year imprisonment and ₹25,000 fine through an amendment to the state’s anti-conversion law passed in 2018, people aware of the matter said. The proposal has been made in a report submitted last week after chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami met top police officers and sought suggestions on how to make the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act stronger to check conversions.A police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they suggested some new provisions on the lines of Uttar Pradesh’s anti-conversion enacted this year. “The existing Act in the state (Uttarakhand) is very weak as it has no provisions for punishment for those involved in mass conversions...” He added in the existing law, there is also no provision against mass conversions. “...family members of a victim of forced or wrongful religious conversions can file a complaint case against the accused in court which then directs the district magistrate concerned for registering an FIR (First Information Report). We have proposed a provision under which the police can register an FIR on the basis of a complaint of family members.”Dhami in September said information will be gathered about incidents of forced religious conversions and the so-called “love jihad”. He added police were working with more strictness against “love jihad” and the government will make the existing law more stringent.“Love jihad” is a term Hindu groups use to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. The courts and the Union government do not recognise the term. Also read: Uttarakhand’s Corbett tiger reserve likely to be renamed as Ramganga National Park, says park directorBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled states have enacted anti-conversion laws to discourage such relationships. Activists and legal experts have argued such laws could be used to target Muslims and infringe on fundamental rights.The police officer cited above said they have suggested specific punishment for those involved in the conversion of minors and women from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities. “...we have also proposed hearings of the cases under the Act (anti-conversation law) in sessions courts instead of family courts under the existing law,” said the officer.A second police officer said the existing law provides limited powers to the police. “At the meeting with the chief minister in September, he asked why police were unable to stop the love jihad cases. We replied the law is like a toothless tiger with not many provisions in it for the police to take action unlike the one in Uttar Pradesh...Then he said the law will be made stronger on the lines of Uttar Pradesh,” said the second officer on the condition of anonymity.He said one or two cases have been filed under the anti-conversion law in the state over the last few years. He added this included one in Dehradun against a Muslim cleric and a man for allegedly forcing a Hindu woman to change her religion for marriage in December last year.Uttarakhand Police chief Ashok Kumar said they have given suggestions to the government, and it is up to it to make a decision. “During the meeting last month, we told the chief minister we have to make the law stronger like the one in Uttar Pradesh. We have proposed suggestions on imprisonment and penalty accordingly.”The Uttarakhand Freedom Of Religion Act was passed in April 2018 making “forced or fraudulent conversions done through force or allurement” non-bailable offences with a provision of imprisonment for up to five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-police-propose-10-year-imprisonment-for-mass-conversions-101633692429511.html

He added further probe is underway and added the First Information Report in the case has not been made public in view of the sensitivity of the matter.Garg said both Pandey and Singh were present at a protest rally organised in the town which turned violent on Tuesday. He added the situation is under control now. Police said bikes were torched and some houses were also ransacked that prompted them to resort to a lathi charge and impose a curfew.At least 95 people have so far been arrested for rioting and violence, which broke out after a clash over the removal of religious flags from a thoroughfare. Around a dozen of people including three policemen sustained minor injuries in the violence. Pandey said he participated in the rally but was not in that mob which turned violent. “The charges against me are false... People in the rally got scattered and some miscreants entered the lanes where the violence took place,” said Pandey.Singh was unavailable for comments.Dharamlal Kaushik, the opposition leader in the state assembly, said the case against two BJP leaders reflects dictatorship and political vendetta. “The two leaders who were booked actually tried to contain the tension. The administration and police are responsible for Tuesday’s violence and now they are trying to put blame on the BJP leaders.”Ruling Congress leader Sushil Anand Shukla said Pandey and Singh led the mob and instigated violence in the peaceful town. “I believe that both should be arrested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-communal-violence-mp-among-2-bjp-leaders-booked-101633688288998.html

Nothing should be done to weaken the existing government in Afghanistan which can lead to problems for the people," he said, in a recorded statement translated by AFP.Muttaqi's remarks came on the first of two days of talks with a US team led by the State Department's Deputy Special Representative Tom West and top USAID humanitarian official Sarah Charles.He said the US would also help vaccinate Afghans against Covid-19.No immediate comment on the talks was available from the US side."The delegation from US decided that they will cooperate with us in vaccination and will provide human cooperation," Muttaqi said.He added: "It is being promised that states will have good relations with one another and have patience while Afghanistan is passing through a very tough time, so Afghanistan will come out of this condition with more strength."The hardline Taliban regained power in August as the United States ended its two-decade occupation with a withdrawal that included a chaotic airlift of foreign residents and Afghans.Mosque attackTheir efforts to consolidate their rule have been undermined by a series of attacks by the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), who claimed a bombing of a Shiite mosque that left more than 60 people dead on Friday.Afghanistan's economy is also teetering on the brink of collapse, with international aid cut off, food prices rising and unemployment spiking.Muttaqi said the Taliban wanted to hold meetings with other countries as well as the US to discuss Afghanistan's difficulties."We are trying to have such meetings and gatherings with the US and other countries of the world and to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan, listen to one another's opinions," Muttaqi said."The issues that people of Afghanistan are facing in terms of economy or any other issues should be resolved. The existing government of Afghanistan is committed to having good relations with other states and cooperate with others, to facilitate its people and provide them services."This is what we want and we are trying to discuss these areas with other countries."Before the talks, a US State Department official said its priorities were securing safe passage for US and other citizens who want to leave Afghanistan, and making sure the Taliban does not allow "terrorists" to operate on Afghan soil."This meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-warns-us-not-to-destabilise-regime-in-face-to-face-talks-101633800821097.html
09-10-2021||World||'Biased against facts': Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa criticises Facebook||Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa used her new prominence to criticise Facebook as a threat to democracy, saying the social media giant fails to protect against the spread of hate and disinformation and is "biased against facts".The veteran journalist and head of Philippine news site Rappler told Reuters in an interview after winning the award that Facebook's algorithms "prioritise the spread of lies laced with anger and hate over facts."Her comments add to the pile of recent pressure on Facebook, used by more than 3 billion people, which a former employee turned whistleblower accused of putting profit over the need to curb hate speech and misinformation. Facebook denies any wrongdoing.Sought for comment on Ressa's remarks, a Facebook spokesperson said the social media giant continues to invest heavily to remove and reduce the visibility of harmful content."We believe in press freedom and support news organisations and journalists around the world as they continue their important work," the spokesperson added.Ressa shared the Nobel with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov on Friday, for what the committee called braving the wrath of the leaders of the Philippines and Russia to expose corruption and misrule, in an endorsement of free speech under fire worldwide.Facebook has become the world's largest distributor of news and "yet it is biased against facts, it is biased against journalism," Ressa said."If you have no facts, you can't have truths, you can't' have trust. If you don't have any of these, you don't have a democracy," she said. "Beyond that, if you don't have facts, you don't' have a shared reality, so you can't solve the existential problems of climate, coronavirus."Ressa has been the target of intense social-media hatred campaigns from President Rodrigo Duterte's supporters, which she said were aimed at destroying her and Rappler's credibility.ELECTION 'A BATTLE FOR FACTS'"These online attacks on social media have a purpose, they are targeted, they are used like a weapon," said the former CNN journalist.Rappler's reporting has included close scrutiny of Duterte's deadly war on drugs and a series of investigative reports into what it says is his government's strategy to "weaponise" the internet, using bloggers on its payroll to stir up anger among online supporters who threaten and discredit Duterte's critics.Duterte has not commented on Ressa's award. The presidential palace, Duterte's spokesperson, his chief legal counsel, and communications office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Facebook in March 2019 removed an online network in the Philippines for "coordinated inauthentic behaviour", and linked it to a businessman who has previously said he helped manage the president's social media election campaign in 2016.Filipinos top the world in time spent on social media, according to 2021 studies by social media management firms.Platforms like Facebook have become political battlegrounds and have helped strengthen Duterte's support base, having been instrumental in his election victory in 2016 and a rout by his allies in mid-term polls last year.The Philippines will hold an election in May to choose a successor to Duterte, who under the constitution is not allowed to seek another term.That campaign "will be a battle for facts," Ressa said. "We are going to keep making sure our public sees the facts, understands it. We are not going to be harassed or intimidated into silence."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biased-against-facts-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-maria-ressa-criticises-facebook-101633792191835.html

The power outage is expected to continue for a few days or at least till next Monday, the official further told the news agency. According to the report, the country has plunged into "complete darkness"."The Lebanese power network completely stopped working at noon today, and it is unlikely that it will work until next Monday, or for several days," the official said.The official further stated that the Lebanese government has plans to use the army's fuel oil reserve to operate the power plants temporarily but, he added, that would not happen anytime soon.The thermoelectric plant stopped at Zahrani power station after the Deir Ammar plant stopped on Friday amid a fuel shortage.Many Lebanese normally rely on private generators run on diesel, although that is in short supply.Lebanon has been paralysed by an economic crisis, which has deepened as supplies of imported fuel have dried up.

He was 88.Among a sea of black-robed Shiite clerics, Banisadr stood out for his Western-style suits and a background so French that it was in philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre that he confided his belief he'd be Iran’s first president some 15 years before it happened.Those differences only isolated him as the nationalist sought to implement a socialist style economy in Iran underpinned by a deep Shiite faith instilled in him by his cleric father.Banisadr would never consolidate his grip on the government he supposedly led as events far beyond his control — including the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis and the invasion of Iran by Iraq — only added to the tumult that followed the revolution.True power remained firmly wielded by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whom Banisadr worked with in exile in France and followed back to Tehran amid the revolution. But Khomeini would cast Banisadr aside after only 16 months in office, sending him fleeing back to Paris, where he would remain for decades.“I was like a child watching my father slowly turn into an alcoholic," Banisadr later said of Khomeini. "The drug this time was power.”Banisadr's family said in a statement online Saturday that he died in a hospital in Paris after a long illness. Iranian state television followed with their own bulletin on his death. Neither elaborated on the illness Banisadr faced.Earlier exiled to Iraq by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini ended up having to leave for France in 1978 under renewed pressure from the Iranian monarch. Arriving in Paris and speaking no French, it was Banisadr who initially gave the cleric a place to live after moving his own family out of their apartment to accommodate him.Khomeini would end up in Neauphle-Le-Chateau, a village outside the French capital. There, as Banisadr once told The Associated Press, he and a group of friends fashioned or vetted the messages Khomeini delivered — based on what they were told Iranians wanted to hear.Tape recordings of Khomeini’s statements were sold in Europe and delivered to Iran. Other messages went out by telephone, read to supporters in various Iranian towns. Those messages laid the groundwork for Khomeini’s return after the shah, fatally ill, fled Iran in early 1979, though the cleric remained unsure he had the support, Banisadr once said.“For me, it was absolutely sure, but not for Khomeini and not for lots of others inside Iran,” Banisadr told the AP in 2019.That return saw Khomeini and his Islamic Revolution sweep the country. Banisadr became a member of the cleric’s Revolutionary Council and became the head of the country’s Foreign Ministry just days after the Nov. 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by hard-line students.In an echo of what was to come, Banisadr served only 18 days in that role after seeking a negotiated end to the hostage crisis, pushed aside by Khomeini for a hard-liner.The hostage-takers were “dictators who have created a government within a government,” Banisadr would later complain.But he remained in Khomeini’s council and would push through the nationalization of major industries and former private business holdings of the shah. And in early 1980, after Khomeini earlier decreed that a cleric should not hold Iran’s newly created presidency, it was Banisadr who won three quarters of the vote and took the office.“Our revolutionary will not win unless it is exported,” he said in his inaugural address. “We are going to create a new order in which deprived people will not always be deprived.”Amid purges of Iran’s armed forces, Iraq would invade the country, starting what would be a bloody eight-year conflict between the two nations. Banisadr served as the country’s commander-in-chief under a decree from Khomeini. But battlefield failures and complaints from Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard became a political liability for the president, who himself would survive two helicopter crashes near the front.A parliament controlled by hard-line clerics under Khomeini’s sway impeached Banisadr in June 1981 for his opposition to having clerics in the country’s political system, part of a long-running feud between them. A month later, Banisadr boarded an Iranian Air Force Boeing 707 and escaped to France with Massoud Rajavi, the leader of the leftist militant group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq.He emerged from the flight with his trademark mustache shaven off. Iranian media alleged he escaped dressed as a woman.Khomeini “bears heavy responsibility for the appalling disaster that has befallen the country,” Banisadr said after his escape. “To a large extent, he has imposed this course upon our people.”Born March 22, 1933 in Hamadan, Iran, Banisadr grew up in a religious family. His father Nasrollah Banisadr was an ayatollah, a high-ranking Shiite cleric, who opposed the policies of the shah’s father, Reza Shah.“Even in the womb, I was a revolutionary,” Banisadr once boasted.As a youth, he protested the shah and was imprisoned twice. He supported Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, who nationalized Iran’s oil industry and later was ousted during a 1953 CIA-backed coup. During unrest in 1963, Banisadr suffered a wound and fled to France.Banisadr studied economics and finance at Sorbonne University in Paris and later taught there. He authored books and tracts on socialism and Islam, ideas that would guide him later after entering Khomeini’s inner circle.After leaving Iran, Banisadr and Rajavi formed the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Banisadr would withdraw from the council in 1984 after the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq partnered with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein as his war against Iran continued.He would remain outside of Paris for the rest of his life, under police guard after being targeted by suspected Iranian assassins.Banisadr again gained notoriety after alleging without evidence in a book that Ronald Reagan’s campaign colluded with Iranian leaders to hold up the hostage release, thereby scuttling the re-election of then-President Jimmy Carter. That gave birth to the idea of the “October Surprise” in American politics — an event deliberately timed and so powerful as to affect an election.U.S. Senate investigators later would say in 1992 that “the great weight of the evidence is that there was no such deal.” However, after Reagan’s 1981 inauguration, U.S. arms began flowing to Iran through Israel in what would become known as the Iran-Contra scandal.“The clergy used you as a tool to get rid of democratic forces,” Banisadr told a former hostage in 1991 while on a U.S. tour. “On the night you were taken hostage, I went to Khomeini and told him he had acted against Islam, against democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abolhassan-banisadr-iran-s-first-president-after-1979-revolution-dies-101633774332204.html

H-1B visa allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in speciality occupations, and a majority of them are from India and China.The current US immigration system imposes a seven per cent quota on Green Card allotment per country, making Indian professionals on H-1B visas wait for years to receive the coveted Permanent Resident Card. Biden had promised an overhaul of the US immigration system for giving a pathway to citizenship for undocumented as well as legal migrants.If the Biden administration addresses the delays in the processing system of Green Card, it could help thousands of Indians waiting to receive the Green Card.During a media briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the wastage of some 80,000 unused employment-based Green Card numbers on October 1 as the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) failed to allocate them. Indian IT professionals had been urging the Biden administration and the US Congress for a legislative amendment that would not let the Green Card slots expire when several million people are waiting in line for the lawful permanent resident (LPR) status.“The President absolutely wants to address the delays in the green card processing system as well,” Psaki responded.Earlier this week, Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks introduced legislation that would USCIS preserve unused employment-based visas for use in Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021.“Ensuring that our immigration system is fair and orderly is one of my top priorities in Congress. These visas are already authorized by Congress and would have been used if not for the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Miller-Meeks after introducing the Preserving Employment Visas Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-wants-to-address-delays-in-green-card-processing-system-says-white-house-after-slots-wasted-101633773150676.html

The country's prime minister seems to think so||Mali has accused France of “training terrorists” inside the country, according to a report by Al Jazeera citing the Russian media, even as French president Emmanuel Macron maintains that France has no intention to retain its military presence there for much longer. In an interview with Russian network RIA Novosti, Mali's prime minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga claimed that French officers, feigning to be on counter-terror operations, have instead been training terrorist outfits in northern Mali's Kidal region.The report published by Russian state-controlled television network RT said that Mali even has evidence that France is training terrorists inside its territory. “They have militant groups there, who have been trained by French officers,” the report quoted Mali president Choguel Kokalla Maiga as saying. “We have evidence of that.”According to the allegations reportedly raised by the Mali prime minister, French troops now control an entire enclave in Kidal, a northern desert town, to the point that Malian authorities have even been ‘banned’ from entering their own territory. There, the French are allegedly coordinating with an al Qaeda-linked “terrorist group” known as Ansar-al-Din and other outfits which “came from Libya”.Notably, France intervened in Mali in 2013 after armed rebels took control of the northern region of the West African country a year prior. Since then, Paris has deployed thousands of troops in the semi-Arid Sahel region of Africa with a stated aim to combat the armed uprising. France has been conducting Operation Barkhane against terrorist groups in the Sahel region—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger—since August 1, 2014.But Mali's prime minister said that the “terrorists” arriving from Libya are a result of France's 2011 military intervention in the north African nation along with its Nato allies. He claimed that although Mali initially wanted to cooperate with France to combat the terror outfits with “intelligence data and air support”, Paris rapidly increased its military presence in the region, which was uncalled for.According to Maiga, about two-thirds of Mali is now occupied by terrorists, a significant deterioration in the situation from eight years ago, when militants were only present in pockets.Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron said, “We have no intention to remain [in Mali], that is why we are closing the bases. Our work in Tessalit or Kidal [northern Mali] is not aimed at retaining bases.” Speaking on the sidelines of the Africa-France summit in Montpellier on late Friday, Macron added that Paris wanted to leave the bases in Mali as soon as possible but that required a strong state in Mali and significant investment projects in this country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-france-training-terrorists-in-mali-the-country-s-prime-minister-seems-to-think-so-101633758611398.html

The area is heavily populated by migrants and asylum-seekers.The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said the raids last week had left at least one person dead and several others injured. It added the agency was "extremely concerned" about reports of killing and "excessive use of force against migrants" in the area.Doctors Without Border (MSF) said that at least 5,000 migrants had been "detained during violent mass arrests across the city since October 1."“We are seeing security forces take extreme measures to arbitrarily detain more vulnerable people in inhumane conditions in severely overcrowded facilities,” Ellen van der Velden, MSF’s operations manager for Libya, said in a statement.Velden added that entire families had been captured and transported to various detention centers and the process had split families and hurt several members.Libyan authorities have refuted claims of excessive force, saying the wave of detentions was part of anti-drug raids on houses and makeshift shelters in Gargaresh.There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in Libya, some seeking to travel onwards to Europe and others looking for work in the major oil-producing country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-migrants-shot-dead-at-detention-center-101633767424188.html

Stewart was reprimanded by the Speaker of the House of Commons Anthony Rota in June this year for refusing to hand over documents relating to the reasons behind the firing of two Chinese-origin scientists from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg in January last year.Xiangguo Qiu, and her husband, Keding Cheng, were earlier escorted out of the laboratory in the spring of 2019, with reports swirling she supervised shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is now synonymous with the Covid-19 pandemic.As that matter is still being investigated and is even before Canadian courts, it will continue to pose a significant challenge to Kochhar as will the possibility of a winter wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senior-indo-canadian-bureaucrat-harpeet-kochhar-appointed-chief-of-canada-s-public-health-agency-101633765654159.html

Xi was speaking at a meeting to mark the 110th anniversary of the Revolution of 1911.Xi’s call on reunifying Taiwan comes in the backdrop of a week of heightened military tension with the democratically-run island that Beijing claims as a breakaway region.The Chinese PLA deployed more than 150 fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Straits, which violated the island’s air space last week prompting Taipei to call it the worst tensions with China in 40 years.The tension has also sparked international concern.“The complete reunification of China will be and can be realised,” Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state media, adding the Taiwan question, which is purely an internal matter for China, arose out of the weakness and chaos of the Chinese nation and will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality.“It has never ended well for those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, or split the country,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Saturday.“They will definitely be scorned by the people and judged by history,” he said.“National reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including compatriots in Taiwan,” he noted.“Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should stand on the right side of history and join hands to achieve China’s complete reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi said.The Xinhai Revolution started on October 10, 1911, and led to the end of a 2000-year-old monarchy in China.The revolution established the Republic of China by the Kuomintang who later fled to Taiwan in the late 1940s after being defeated by the triumphant Communist Party of China – who then established “New China” in 1949.Xi’s Saturday speech seemingly struck a softer note than the one he delivered on July 1 to mark the CPC’s 100 years in which he vowed to “smash” any attempts at formal independence.In 2019, he directly threatened to use force to bring the island under Beijing’s control.The presidential office in Taipei criticised Xi’s speech, saying Taiwan was a sovereign independent country, not part of the People’s Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China’s offer of “one country, two systems” to rule the island.“The nation’s future rests in the hands of Taiwan’s people,” the presidential office was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.Asked on Friday about news reports on the presence of US troops in Taiwan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Washington should cease military ties and arms sales to Taiwan to avoid damaging bilateral relations.“The US side should fully recognise the great sensitivity of the Taiwan issue,” he told a regular daily briefing.“China will take all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/complete-reunification-of-china-will-and-can-be-realised-president-xi-jinping-101633764453927.html
09-10-2021||World||‘Taiwan question’ will be resolved, no external interference needed: China||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday made a strong pitch for the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland amidst heightened tensions with the estranged island, saying the “Taiwan question” will be resolved and it brooks “no external interference”.Xi's comments came after China sent a record number of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four days in a row, in a public show of force.Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state - but China views the self-ruled island as a breakaway province. Beijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.Speaking in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the revolution that ended the country's last imperial dynasty, Xi said the biggest obstacle to the reunification of China was the "Taiwan independence" force.The Taiwan question arose out of the weakness and chaos of the Chinese nation and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality, Xi, also the General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), said."This is determined by the general trend of Chinese history, but more importantly, it is the common will of all Chinese people," Xi said.The 1911 Revolution led by nationalists headed by Dr Sun Yat-sen ended 2,132 years of imperial rule and 276 years of Manchu rule and heralded the beginning of China's republican era followed by the formation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.Taiwan separated from the PRC in 1949 while fighting a civil war with the CPC headed by Mao Zedong.Since he took over power in 2012, President Xi, 68, has made the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and realisation of the Chinese Dream, and integration of Taiwan with mainland China his main goals.Last week, tensions flared up after a Chinese military plane made a record 150 flights into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), prompting the US to express serious concern over the escalation.The intensity of China’s air raids prompted US President Joe Biden to remind Xi that they have agreed to abide by the “Taiwan agreement” during their talks over the telephone last month."I've spoken with Xi about Taiwan. We agree… we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement. We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement,” Biden said.Xi, in his address, asserted that the Taiwan question is purely an internal matter for China, one which brooks no external interference."The complete reunification of our country will be and can be realised," he stressed.In a hard-hitting speech, President Xi said that national reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including compatriots in Taiwan."Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan strait should stand on the right side of history and join hands to achieve China's complete reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," he said.Those who forget their heritage, betray their motherland, and seek to split the country will come to no good end, Xi said, hitting out at pro-Taiwan independence advocates.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is a strong advocate of Taiwan’s independence.Such forces will be disdained by the people and condemned by history, Xi said.He also highlighted the role and the importance of the CPC headed by him which this year celebrated its centenary.What the past 110 years have shown to the Chinese people since the Revolution of 1911 is that China needs strong force, he said."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, the Chinese people must have a strong force to lead us forward, and that force is the Communist Party of China," he said.Xi, regarded as the most powerful leader after Mao heading the CPC, the military, and the Presidency, is due to complete his second term next year and is expected to continue in power possibly for life in view of the 2018 constitutional amendments, which removed the two-term limit for the President.So far, all his predecessors retired after two terms.Stressing the importance of strong leadership, Xi said that without the CPC, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation.Efforts should be made to ensure that the CPC always firmly stands as the most reliable backbone of the Chinese nation and people."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, the path we take is of fundamental importance. Socialism with Chinese characteristics has proven to be the only correct path."We will ensure coordinated implementation of the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy, deepen reform and opening up across the board, modernise China's system and capacity for governance, and work tirelessly to fulfill the people's aspirations for a better life and realise common prosperity for all," he said.The past 110 years have shown that to realise national rejuvenation, the Chinese people must rely on their own heroic efforts, Xi said."Through courage and skill, we will overcome all major risks and challenges that may impede our path to national rejuvenation and resolutely safeguard our national sovereignty, security, and development interests," he said."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, the Chinese people and nation must stick together through good times and bad, and rely on our strong unity to overcome all risks and challenges on the road ahead."On the journey ahead, we must fully promote patriotism, foster a strong sense of national dignity and confidence among our people, and strengthen the Chinese nation's sense of community,” he said, calling for the formation of the “broadest possible patriotic united front."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, China needs not only a stable and united domestic environment but also a peaceful and stable international environment, the Chinese President said."Aggression and hegemony are not in the blood of the Chinese people. Our people hope to successfully realise national development, but they also hope to see all peoples of the world, leading happy and peaceful lives," he said.On the journey ahead, China will always fly the flag of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, strive to promote the building of a human community with a shared future and endeavour to improve the global governance system, Xi noted."We will promote the shared human values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, work to strengthen solidarity with the peoples of all other countries, and engage in common efforts to oppose hegemony and power politics."China will remain a champion of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order, and we will do our very best to make even greater contributions to humanity," Xi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-question-will-be-resolved-no-external-interference-needed-china-101633758120217.html

Before the age of e-mails, letters used to be handwritten and delivered by post across the world. Even today, postal services hold a significant role in the delivery of parcels globally.“On World Post Day, we recognize the invaluable contributions of postal workers to our societies and economies. The vast postal network – involving millions of workers moving billions of pieces of mail through hundreds of thousands of post offices – is woven into our societies, connecting communities the world over,” a message from the United Nations secretary general António Guterres read.History and significance of World Post DayWorld Post Day is celebrated in remembrance of the foundation of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in 1874 in Bern, Switzerland. Celebrated across 151 countries, it was first declared as the World Post Day by the UPU Congress held in Tokyo, Japan, in 1969. In India, too, the day acknowledges the beginning of National Postal week, celebrated from October 9 to October 15.Member nations around the globe use this day to launch new postal initiatives and hold special exhibitions to raise awareness about the importance of postal services in everyday lives and its contribution to the social and economic development of countries.Theme of World Post Day 2021The theme for this year’s World Post Day is “Innovate to Recover” to highlight the plight of postal systems in the changing times of a digital revolution and how it is adapting to new realities and redefining itself, taking on new roles founded on digitalisation, e-commerce and financial services."Together, let us learn the lessons arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and understand that innovation is not an accessory; it is the driving force behind recovery, and what makes this sector crucial to billions of people," the UPU director said.Interestingly, amid the coronavirus pandemic, postal services have also been used to deliver vaccines in many parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-post-day-history-significance-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-day-101633749529833.html
09-10-2021||World||Texas wins bid to reinstate abortion law challenged by Biden administration||A US appeals court on Friday temporarily reinstated Texas's near-total ban on abortion, dealing a setback to abortion rights advocates and the Biden administration.The U Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, an intermediate appeals court, said it was putting on hold a lower court ruling from Oct. 6 that blocked the abortion law.The administrative stay from the Fifth Circuit, a conservative-leaning appeals court, came in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department on Sept. 9. The purpose of the administrative stay is to give the court time to determine whether to issue a more permanent ruling.The Texas abortion law, which took effect on Sept. 1, bans abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy.The law makes no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. It also lets ordinary citizens enforce the ban, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide abortion after the fetal cardiac activity is detected. Critics of the law have said this provision enables people to act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.US district judge Robert Pitman in Austin on Wednesday temporarily blocked the abortion ban while litigation over its legality continues.The Justice Department has argued that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy that was recognized in the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide.

Tesla's move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks major blow||California Governor Gavin Newsom frequently touts that his state is the leader in cutting-edge manufacturing and green technology. Now one of the most recognizable companies in those fields is taking its headquarters elsewhere.Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California, the electric-car maker’s home since its founding 18 years ago. It joins companies including Oracle Corp., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., and Charles Schwab Corp. in relocating their corporate hubs to the cheaper and more tax-friendly Lone Star state in the past two years.They all are keeping a large presence in California, underscoring the importance of the world’s fifth-largest economy. But the shifts of companies born and bred in the state show how many of its intractable issues, from the nation’s most expensive housing costs to high taxes and climate catastrophes, pose a threat to continued economic growth if corporate departures multiply. And losing Tesla -- a long-shot, clean-energy startup that upended the auto industry and embodies much of the state’s economy -- delivers a particularly symbolic hit.“Tesla as a brand represents not just Motor City USA, it represents Silicon Valley and Hollywood,” said David McCuan, chairman of Sonoma State University’s political science department. “Tesla is really a California-centric thing. But Elon Musk represents something larger than life, and that’s really Texas.”Musk, Tesla’s co-founder and chief executive officer, pointed to some of California’s issues when he announced the move from Palo Alto to Austin. The company’s Fremont factory is jammed with workers and equipment, with little space to build around it. The billionaire clashed with local public officials over lockdown policies during the pandemic. He defied local orders by restarting production at the plant. Musk said that Tesla isn’t leaving California and will continue to expand there –  but he made clear that he saw more opportunity for growth in Texas.“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away,” said Musk, who last year said he was moving to Texas himself. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.”That region, in particular, has long been seen by companies as a difficult place to do business. Employers have had to offer ever more generous compensation so that workers can keep up with sky-high housing costs. Many workers have simply been priced out of living near their work, forcing them into long commutes before the pandemic.  California’s Association of Realtors forecast this week that the state’s median single-family home price will jump to a record $834,000 next year, more than twice the national level. The median sale price of homes in Santa Clara County -- the heart of Silicon Valley – was $1.66 million in August, an almost 11% jump from a year earlier, according to the industry group.Newsom – a Democrat who last month beat back a recall effort that was in part driven by anger about the state’s cost of living, crime, and homelessness -- on Friday emphasized that the state has created more than 750,000 jobs since January. He said California’s policies encouraging innovation and investment in electric vehicles contributed to Tesla and Musk’s success.“Our regulatory environment helped create that company and grow that company,” Newsom said at a press briefing. “I have reverence and deep respect for that individual. But I also have deep reverence and respect for this state, and what we’ve done.”Strong EconomyTesla’s move is more a symbolic blow than an economic one. While the tech industry is a significant part of the state’s economy, California reaps the rewards of other lucrative sectors, such as trade and entertainment. The state has notched a $75.7 billion surplus and revenue is again running ahead of projections -- by about 18% -- for the fiscal year that began in July. Its credit ratings are at their highest in about two decades.Silicon Valley also remains a magnet for tech investment. In the third quarter, there was a record $27.1 billion worth of venture deals struck in the region, a 17% increase from the previous three months, according to a recent report on venture capital from CBInsight. “The tech sector is so big that Texas can grow and we can grow,” said Stephen Levy, director, and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. But “the exoduses do have a real concern if they’re based on the high housing prices and lack of housing.”The state has few answers for how to fix its most pressing problems. Construction remains way below Newsom’s goals for addressing the housing shortage. Taxes are unlikely to go down. Climate change has contributed not only to record-setting wildfires but drought, power outages, and smoke-filled air.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whose Silicon Valley roots go back to the founding of Hewlett-Packard Co. in a Palo Alto garage eight decades ago, said last year that cutting real estate costs were a major factor in its decision to relocate to Houston, already its largest US employment hub. The company, which has maintained much of its tech and innovation workforce in the Bay Area, also said the pandemic and the changing nature of work contributed to the move.In many ways, Covid proved to companies that they could effectively operate elsewhere, or at least with a smaller footprint. Silicon Valley’s office vacancy rate has continued to climb, reaching 15 per cent in the third quarter, as more employers looked to offload space they’d previously leased, according to real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.The region still remains key for the tech industry, with its depth of talent and access to renowned universities, said Robert Sammons, senior director of research at Cushman in San Francisco.“Certainly, the business climate has room for improvement,” Sammons said, citing regulations and the high cost of living. “Those are all difficulties that California has and has had for years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-losing-tech-grip-tesla-s-move-from-silicon-valley-to-texas-marks-major-blow-101633741044376.html

The US, however, stressed that the meeting on Saturday and Sunday did not indicate that it was recognising the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. "We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions," the spokesperson said.The Associated Press cited an official as saying that the weekend talks will focus on holding Taliban leaders to commitments that they would allow Americans and other foreign nationals to leave Afghanistan, along with Afghans who once worked for the US military or government and other Afghan allies during the two-decade military operation.Also read | ‘Afghans know who were better friends’: Jaishankar slams Pak for aiding terrorThe United States also wants to press the Taliban to observe the rights of women and girls, many of whom have been barred from returning to jobs and schools, and of Afghans at large, the state department spokesperson said. "We will press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and girls, and to form an inclusive government with broad support," the spokesperson was quoted as saying by AFP on Friday. "As Afghanistan faces the prospect of a severe economic contraction and possible humanitarian crisis, we will also press the Taliban to allow humanitarian agencies free access to areas of need," the spokesperson added.Also read | Not Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar could be the first to recognise Taliban cabinetAFP reported that the spokesperson did not specify who would represent the two sides.

09-10-2021||World||Brazil tops 600,000 Covid-19 deaths amid doubts about delta variant||Bars in Brazil’s biggest metropolis, Sao Paulo, are full again for Friday happy hours and lawmakers in the capital have nearly done away with video sessions via Zoom. Rio de Janeiro’s beaches are packed and calls for strict social distancing seem but a memory.These developments are part of Brazil’s bid to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, even as its death toll tops 600,000, according to official data on Friday from the health ministry. Relief in both Covid-19 cases and deaths have been particularly welcome given experts’ warnings that the delta variant would produce another wave of destruction in the country with the second-most victims. So far, that hasn’t materialized.The country’s average daily death toll has hovered around 500 for a month, down sharply from more than 3,000 in April. Almost 45% of the population is fully vaccinated, and a booster shot is being administered to the elderly. A greater percentage of Brazilians are at least partially vaccinated compared to Americans or Germans, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.Improvement has encouraged mayors and governors to admit fans into soccer matches, and let bars and restaurants stay open until the wee hours. Some are even contemplating the end of mask mandates, which people often ignore already. And Rio’s mayor has announced plans to bring back the city’s massive New Year’s Eve party on Copacabana beach.Gonzalo Vecina, a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo, told The Associated Press in July that delta, which is more contagious, would cause “a new explosion” of cases within weeks. He was hardly alone among experts sounding the alarm.Now, Vecina believes the high number of Brazilians infected earlier this year with the gamma variant -- first identified in the Amazonian city Manaus -- may have slowed delta’s advance.“That isn’t a conclusion from a study; it is a possibility we are raising in the face of what we are seeing,” Vecina said. “We are seeing delta rise in countries that reopened just as much as Brazil, and our number of cases is still going down, with few very particular exceptions.”Some analysts remain worried about delta’s potential to spread. Among them is Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. He believes authorities are taking considerable risk by reopening too much and announcing celebrations, and that Brazil may soon see more hospital admissions.“The pandemic has waned, but 500 deaths per day is far from good. And we don’t even have half the population fully vaccinated,” Lago said. “We just don’t know enough and we have this horrific milestone to contemplate now.”Friday morning, on Copacabana where Rio’s New Year’s party will take place in less than three months, activist group Rio da Paz held a memorial on its sands to mourn the 600,000 dead, with hundreds of white kerchiefs strung on lines.Across town, at a support group for family members of the virus’ victims, Bruna Chaves mourned the loss of her mother and step-father.“It’s not just 600,000 people who are gone; it’s a lot of people who die with them, emotionally,” Chaves said in an interview. “It’s absurd that people treat it like it’s a small number. It’s a big number.”Many in Brazil continue to downplay the pandemic’s severity, chief among them President Jair Bolsonaro, whose popularity has sagged largely due to his government’s chaotic pandemic response. But he hasn’t veered from his positions, including staunch support for drugs proven ineffective against the virus, like hydroxychloroquine.He also continues to criticize restrictions on activity adopted by mayors and governors, saying Brazil needed to keep the economy humming to avoid inflicting worse hardship on the poor. On Thursday night, during a live broadcast on Facebook, he showed a series of newspaper articles reporting economic turmoil in Europe and the U.S. last year in an attempt to prove he was right all along.Months after its New Year’s bash, Rio will also host Carnival, according to Mayor Eduardo Paes. And he said social distancing is out of the question.“That would be ridiculous, asking people to keep one meter away. If that were the case, I would be the first to disrespect that,” he told residents in a middle-class neighborhood on Monday. “Science has advanced, it won, it is allowing us to open.”Brazil’s long history with vaccination campaigns has played a significant role in slowing the virus’ spread, with broad uptake. Nearly three-quarters of Brazilians have received at least one dose so far -- despite the fact Bolsonaro spent months sowing doubt about their efficacy and remains unvaccinated himself. Even most of his supporters rolled up their sleeves.As Brazil surpasses 600,000 deaths, a Senate inquiry on the government’s handling of the pandemic is nearing its end. Sen. Renan Calheiros, who will write the investigation’s final report, told journalists Wednesday that it will include the recommendation for at least 40 people to face charges, including Bolsonaro, his former health minister Gen. Eduardo Pazuello and several allies.Luiz Davidovich, president of The Brazilian Academy of Sciences, said scientists performed their role in alerting Brazilians about the pandemic’s dangers, but their advice should have been better heeded.“What remains now is the memory of this tragedy that marks the history of the country and our lives, involved in collective grief, permeated by sadness and indignation,” Davidovich said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-tops-600-000-covid-19-deaths-amid-doubts-about-delta-variant-101633738240562.html

In a statement released on its Telegram channels, the jihadist group – an associate of the Islamic State (ISIS) – said that its suicide bomber specifically targeted a crowd of Shiite worshippers who gathered inside a mosque and it was there that the attacker “detonated an explosive vest”.Also Read | Afghanistan: Multiple causalities after explosion hits mosque in Kunduz city#BREAKING Islamic State group claims Afghanistan mosque attack: statement pic.twitter.com/FFx1wQ7vIrThe Islamic State group, moments after taking out the first statement, released another in which it elaborated on the suicide bombing attack in northern Afghanistan. The terror outfit said in its second statement, seen by AFP, that the “perpetrator of the attack was an Uyghur Muslim”, a minority that the Taliban – the new rulers of Afghanistan – “vowed to expel”. The statement was later carried by the IS-linked Aamaq news agency.The development hints at aggravating sectarian violence in the war-ravaged nation as the extremist Islamic State group, bitter rivals of the Taliban, has time and again targeted the Shiite population to stir up unrest in the Sunni-majority Afghanistan. The outfit bombed a Shiite mosque in the west of Kabul in a similar suicide attack in October 2017, killing at least 56 people and wounding 55 others, including women and children who gathered for the evening prayers. Islamic State terrorists have also targeted Taliban positions and attempted to recruit members from their ranks.Also Read | Taliban destroy Islamic State cell in Kabul after deadly mosque attackIn the past, the Taliban were not shaken by the Islamic State due to the presence of the United States military on the ground, which ensured the terrorists stayed limited to certain pockets. However, with the withdrawal of the American forces in August, it remains unclear whether the Taliban can now suppress what appears to be a growing ISIS footprint. The terrorists, once confined to the east, have penetrated the capital of Kabul and other provinces with new attacks.The development comes at a critical moment, as the Taliban attempt to consolidate power and transform their guerrilla fighters into a structured police and security force. But while the group attempts to project an air of authority through reports of raids and arrests of IS members, it remains unclear if it even has the capability to protect soft targets, including religious institutions.According to news agencies, Shiites make up roughly 20 per cent of the population of Afghanistan. Many of them are Hazaras, an ethnic group that has been heavily persecuted in the land for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-group-claims-afghanistan-mosque-bombing-says-suicide-bomber-targeted-shiites-101633736406087.html

DownDetector, which tracks outages, showed spikes in reports of problems accessing or using Facebook, photo-sharing app Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. "Sincere apologies to anyone who wasn't able to access our products in the last couple of hours. We fixed the issue, and everything should be back to normal now," the company said.Some users were unable to load their Instagram feeds during the latest outage and others were not able to send messages on Facebook Messenger. People swiftly took to Twitter to share memes and jokes about the second service disruption this week. "Looks like Facebook went to a 3-day work week. Monday and Friday shutdowns?" a Twitter user said. "What's up with Instagram?" A user tweeted along with a picture of cartoon character Bart Simpson sitting in a corner in apparent punishment.Also read | Facebook grapples with another global outage"It's not even 4 days and it's already down again." "Problems with Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp AGAIN!" said another on a DownDetector chat forum.Instagram thanked users for their patience and "for all the memes this week" and according to Facebook, the outage on Friday was not related to the one earlier in the week.Also read | Facebook outage shows why we need our own social networks: RussiaOn Monday, billions of users reported that they were unable to access the services WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook for nearly six hours before services were restored.  The social media giant blamed a "faulty configuration change" for the nearly six-hour outage that prevented the company's 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services.According to cyber experts, the problem was related to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)—the system the internet uses to pick the quickest route to move packets of information around. Data centre company Telehouse’s Sami Slim compared BGP to "the internet equivalent of air traffic control" which changes the schedules of flights. “Facebook did an update of these routes," Slim said, according to AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sincere-apologies-facebook-after-second-outage-in-a-week-101633736789614.html
09-10-2021||World||Facebook grapples with another global outage||Facebook on Friday said users around the world again had problems accessing its services for hours due to a tweak of its system, just days after a massive outage caused in a similar fashion."Sincere apologies to anyone who wasn't able to access our products in the last couple of hours," a Facebook spokesperson told AFP about 21:30 GMT."We fixed the issue, and everything should be back to normal now."Website trouble tracker DownDetector showed spikes in reports of problems accessing or using Facebook and its photo-centric Instagram network as well as Messenger and WhatsApp starting about three hours earlier.Facebook attributed the trouble to a configuration change at its computing platform and said that it affected users of the social network and Instagram, Messenger and Workplace globally.People flocked to Twitter to voice frustration."What's up with Instagram?" read a tweet that included a picture of cartoon character Bart Simpson sitting in a corner in apparent punishment."It's not even 4 days and it's already down again.""Problems with Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp AGAIN!" read a lament in a DownDetector chat forum.Hundreds of millions of people were unable to access Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp for more than six hours on Monday, underscoring the world's reliance on platforms owned by the Silicon Valley giant.In an apologetic blog post, Santosh Janardhan, Facebook's vice president of infrastructure, said that day's outage was caused by "configuration changes" on routers that coordinate network traffic between data centers.Cyber experts think that problem boiled down to something called BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol -- the system the internet uses to pick the quickest route to move packets of information around.Sami Slim of data center company Telehouse compared BGP to "the internet equivalent of air traffic control."In the same way that air traffic controllers sometimes make changes to flight schedules, "Facebook did an update of these routes," Slim said.But this update contained a crucial error.It's not yet clear how or why, but Facebook's routers essentially sent a message to the internet announcing that the company's servers no longer existed.The outage on Friday was not related to the one earlier in the week, according to Facebook.Experts say Facebook's technical infrastructure is unusually reliant on its own systems.Social media outages are not uncommon: Instagram alone has experienced more than 80 in the past year in the United States, according to website builder ToolTester.Facebook's services are crucial for many businesses around the world, and Facebook accounts are also commonly used to log in to other websites.Facebook's apps are used my billions of people monthly, meaning outages can touch a large portion of the world's population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-grapples-with-another-global-outage-101633734808981.html

The state has 2,035 engineering seats and 1,330 medical seats in the 38 engineering and 11 medical colleges it runs.In 2006, the Kumar-led NDA government had reserved 50 per cent seats for girls in primary schools and 35 per cent in secondary schools at the panchayat levels. The state had in 2016 reserved 35 per cent jobs for women in the police and 33 per cent in other government jobs. Besides, to encourage girls to pursue higher education, the state gives a cash incentive of ₹50,000 to those who pass their graduation.The government has also come up with a women’s entrepreneurship incentive, under which up to ₹10 lakh worth of financial assistance would be provided to women to help them set up businesses. While ₹5 lakh will be provided as grant or subsidy, the remaining amount will be interest-free loan.Earlier, the entrepreneurship scheme was available only to SC (Scheduled Caste), ST (Scheduled Tribe) and EBC (Extremely Backward Caste) women. Now, it has been extended to all women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-plans-residential-schools-for-girls-from-backward-classes-in-all-districts-101633802920119.html

In view of the looming crisis, the Centre has also directed National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) to increase coal stocks equal to the national average for Dadri and Jajjhar stations "for full availability", Union Power Secretary said in a statement.The statement comes hours after the Delhi government said that it has only one day of stock left at the thermal power station and the city might plunge into the darkness within the next few days. "There is an acute shortage of coal in coal-fired power plants across the country. There is only one day's stock left in the plants from which Delhi gets electricity, there is no coal at all," Delhi's power minister Satyendra Jain had said.India is at the brink of a major power crisis as more than half of the country's 135 coal-fired power plants have fuel stocks to last less than three days, according to a report by Reuters. Besides Delhi, several states including Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh have also asked the Centre for adequate supply as they raised similar concerns regarding the low coal stocks.Meanwhile, the Centre said that the core management team, constituted by the Union ministry of power, is closely monitoring and managing coal stocks on a daily basis. The management body is also working to ensure follow up actions with Coal India Limited and coordinating with Indian "Railways to improve the coal supply to power plants," it added.The power ministry says that an "unprecedented increase in electricity demand due to revival of the economy (after the second wave of Covid-19) and heavy rains in coal mine areas in September have affected the coal production", which has led to the countrywide power crisis."Rise in imported coal prices resulting in dependence on domestic coal are reasons behind depletion of coal stocks at power plants," it also stated.The core management team comprises representatives from the Union ministry of power, the central electricity authority, power system operation corporation, railways and Coal India Ltd to ensure daily monitoring of the coal stocks and despatches.Prices of power-generation fuels are surging globally with industrial growth pushing up electricity demand, leading to a tightening of coal and liquefied natural gas supplies.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-supply-all-required-quantities-centre-to-delhi-govt-amid-coal-shortage-101633801539495.html

The arrest was confirmed by deputy inspector general Upendra Agarwal who is heading the SIT. A day after staying away from interrogation, Ashish Mishra appeared before the investigation team on Saturday morning. The interrogation lasted for hours as the special investigation team prepared over a dozen of questions for the Union minister's son. However, the answers received during the marathon questioning were not satisfactory, police said. Towards the evening, unconfirmed reports claimed that he was arrested but the confirmation came only on Saturday night.“He was arrested after he failed to cooperate in the interrogation. He could not inform or validate various points regarding his whereabouts at the time of the incident on the day of the incident. And we will try to get information after getting him on police remand,” Upendra Agarwal said. While Ashish was facing interrogation, his father Ajay Mishra Teni was huddling with a group of lawyers, reports said.After two of his aides were arrested, the police pasted a notice on the Union minister's residence asking his son to be present before the investigation committee. On Friday, Ashish did not appear before the committee and his father said he was not well; he would be present on Saturday. Ashish was named in the FIR as the main accused of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where four farmers were crushed by a vehicle in which Ashish was allegedly present. Four others were killed in the violence that began after the incident on last Sunday in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri.The FIR said Ashish managed to get out of that overturned car and opened fire. The Union minister has denied his son's link with the incident and said earlier that it was his car but his son was not present there. He also claimed that the driver of the car lost balance as stones were pelted on the car.Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly election, the Lakhimpur Kheri has become a major political issue with the Congress taking to the streets over this issue. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi visited Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this week. The party has asked its state/UT unit chiefs to observe 'maun vrat' on Monday in protest of Lakhimpur violence. The removal of the Union minister is one of the demands of the Congress.The UP Police sprung into action after being rapped by the Supreme Court which on Thursday asked the government how many arrests it has made so far regarding the case, as four days had already passed between the incident and the Supreme Court taking up the case. While the police arrested two of Ashish Mishra's aides and summoned Mishra to appear for interrogation, the apex court on Friday said it was not satisfied with the investigation done by the Uttar Pradesh Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-s-son-ashish-mishra-arrested-over-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-101633800292600.html

09-10-2021||India||Centre pushes for optimum power generation; coal crisis to improve soon||A day after the power ministry issued guidelines to coal-fired power plants, a core management team monitoring the coal stock situation in the country noted the situation in power plants are likely to improve soon, according to people familiar with the matter. The committee reviewed the status on Saturday amid reports of acute coal shortage in several states. It noted that the total dispatch of coal by Coal India Limited (CIL) touched 1.501 MT on October 7, reducing the gap between consumption and actual supply.The coal dispatch is likely to touch 1.7 MT per day after three days, helping the coal supply and consequent power situation to improve, the core management team (CMT) assured.The team has cited the surge in electricity demand; heavy rains in coal mine areas; increase in prices of imported coal to unprecedented high level; and non-building of adequate coal stocks before the onset of monsoon as the primary reasons behind the coal shortage. The dependence on coal has increased since 65% to 70% demand of more than 4 billion units per day consumption of electricity is being met by coal-fired power generation only, according to the CMT.The monitoring team has also noted that legacy issues of heavy dues of coal companies from certain states have aggravated the crisis.On Friday, the ministry of power issued guidelines for operationalising optimum utilization of generating stations in the electricity grid. The ministry said that the utilised power capacity that remains idle under power purchase agreements needs to be despatched in the public interest.Under the new guidelines, the Central government has allowed the generator to sell the unrequisitioned power in the power exchange if the procurer does not requisition power from the power plant up to 24 hours in advance prior to the day of delivery of power.“Where the procurer decides not to schedule power for any period, either full or part capacity, from the generating station with which he has signed the PPA, which may be more than 24 hours in advance, the generator shall be free to sell the un-requisitioned power, for the period for which it has not been requisitioned, in the power exchange,” the guidelines read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-pushes-for-optimum-power-generation-coal-crisis-to-improve-soon-101633796416941.html

Now, the government plans to set up as many as 10,032 YSR Rural Clinics to take healthcare to the villages. They are attached to the village secretariats and each clinic covers a population of 2 000,” the official said.Each rural clinic will comprise Mid-Level Health Providers (MLHPs) who have completed B.Sc. Nursing and Certificate Programme in Community Health (CPCH), along with an Auxiliary Nursing Midwife (ANM). Even ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers would report to the rural clinics.These clinics would be linked with PHCs regularly through video conferences. In the coming days, they would also be linked to laboratories. The health records of the villagers will be available in the respective village clinics through their Arogya Sri (a state government health scheme) cards. Using the QR code on them, those details can be viewed.These details can be accessed by the nearby PHC doctors, who would visit the villages from time to time and they will be very useful while diagnosing and treating the cardholder. “Every mandal will have two PHCs equipped with facilities and staff, including two doctors, and they will be integrated with emergency health services and ambulance services.The main task of the staff at the rural clinic is to provide 12 basic medical services and 14 types of basic diagnostic tests, and 64 types of medicines will be stored at the clinic. Further, 67 types of basic medical equipment will be available in these clinics, apart from telemedicine services, the official said.“The government is investing ₹16,203 crore for revamping government hospitals and medical colleges across the state in order to strengthen public healthcare and health Infrastructure. The chief minister has already given the green signal for the recruitment of 14,200 doctors and paramedical staff this year, so that there is no staff crunch in the hospitals,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-plans-to-set-up-ysr-rural-clinics-to-take-healthcare-to-doorstep-of-villagers-101633794996119.html

Uddhav-ji." Rane left Shiv Sena around 16 years ago and he exit from the party was bitter. And it was Bal Thackeray who gave Rane the responsibility of the district. "... the work for basic amenities like roads, power, education, water, and healthcare was carried out. The existing infrastructure is because of Narayan Rane. Nobody can match it,” he said.In his speech, Rane also remembered Balasaheb a number of times and said Balasaheb did not like lying.As Uddhav Thackeray started his speech, he countered Narayan Rane on every point in good humour as he said, "As per my knowledge, the Sindhudurg fort was built by (Shivaji) Maharaj...otherwise someone might say `I built it'". He reiterated his father's trait of not putting up with lies, already mentioned by Rane, and said Balasaheb used to kick out people of the party for lying."You (Rane) are a minister. So what if it is `micro and small', it is still an important department and (we are sure) you will use it for the benefit of Maharashtra," Thackeray said taking a swipe at Rane's profile.Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia who was present at the inauguration event said with the new airport, the distance of 530 km between Mumbai and Chipi can now be covered in 50 minutes. There are also plans to connect Chipi with Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and other major cities and 20-25 flights to Chipi will be started in the next five years, the minister said adding that Maharashtra now has 14 airports.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/so-what-if-it-is-micro-and-small-uddhav-rane-share-stage-exchange-barbs-101633793369465.html

During an interaction at the 'India Today Conclave 2021', Puri said the parliament building was in Seismic Zone II at the time of its construction but the area now lies in Seismic Zone IV, the high damage risk zone."When the building was constructed, it was in Seismic Zone II and today, that area is in Seismic Zone IV. It is not an exaggeration. We don't want to create panic, but you know you are above pushing the limit..." Puri said at the event.The Union housing and urban affairs minister further underlined that the existing building was a council house of the British colonial power and was never designed to be Parliament. He also pointed to the increasing of parliamentarians since India’s independence. The next delimitation of parliamentary seats is due in 2026, with the 2021 census data as the base."The number of members (parliamentarians) has been increasing since we became an independent country. So, there have been a lot of internal adjustments and new facilities have been added...from a purely structural point of view, it is an unsafe building,” Puri said.The Vice President’s enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed under the Modi government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan. The total estimated cost of the Central Vista revamp is around ₹20,000 crore. The Opposition parties have criticised the government for spending hundreds of crores on the Central Vista project in the middle of a pandemic. But Puri insisted that the construction of a new Parliament building and redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue will be completed in a time-bound manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/existing-parliament-building-unsafe-capacity-reached-upper-limit-says-union-minister-puri-101633786342560.html

The draft specifies the quantity of waste that will have to be managed by producers, importers and brand owners who generate plastic packaging waste in India.When passed, the draft notification published on October 6 will come into effect immediately. EPR means the responsibility of a producer for the environmentally sound management of the product (plastic packaging) until the end of its life. People and stakeholders can submit objections or suggestions to the environment ministry on the draft within 60 days.EPR covers three categories of plastic packaging including rigid plastic packaging; flexible plastic packaging of single layer or multilayer (more than one layer with different types of plastic); plastic sheets, carry bags (including carry bags made of compostable plastics), plastic sachet or pouches; and multi-layered plastic packaging.For example, the draft states that in 2021-22 producers of plastic packaging waste will have to manage 35% of the ‘Q1’ waste in metric tons. Q 1 is the average weight of plastic packaging material (category-wise and state wise) sold in the last two years plus average quantity of pre-consumer plastic packaging waste (generated before product reaches the consumer) in the last two financial years minus the annual quantity of plastic packaging supplied to brand owners (BO) including online platforms/marketplaces and supermarkets/retail chains etc during the previous year. This EPR target for producers increases to 70% in 2022-23 and 100% for 2023-24 onwards. Similar EPR targets apply for importers and brand owners but the quantity would be different depending upon the quantity of packaging waste they are responsible for.For brand owners EPR target in 2021-22 shall be the average weight of fresh plastic packaging material purchased and introduced in market in the last two years plus average quantity of pre-consumer plastic packaging in the last two years. There are targets in the draft for recycling of plastic packaging waste which is mostly 30 to 50% of EPR in 2023-24. Those plastics which cannot be recycled will be sent for end-of-life disposal such as road construction, waste to energy, waste to oil, cement kilns etc. as per relevant guidelines issued by Indian Road Congress and Central Pollution Control Board, the draft states.The draft gives producers, importers, and brand owners of plastic waste an opportunity to trade in EPR certificates. They can use the surplus EPR certificates for offsetting previous year shortfall; carry forward for use in succeeding year and sell it to other producers and brands.CPCB will draft guidelines for imposition and collection of environment compensation, a penalty on producers, recyclers and end of life processors for violating obligations specified in the regulation and also for violations of conditions such as sharing false information / certificates as mandated under these guidelines.All producers, importers, brands, recyclers etc will have to be registered with CPCB through an online centralized portal. In case of irregularity or false information provided by them, the registration would be revoked for a five-year period and /or penalty may also be imposed, after giving an opportunity to be heard, the draft states.“We welcome this notification as the industry was waiting for long time and operating in uncertainty. Therefore, this notification brings clarity and opportunities for industry to start working on compliances. Prima facie this notification seems to be giving overall directions and clarity on several issues and sets the processes. However, there could be some challenges due to ground realities which needed to be mitigated based on the experience of implementation of this notification,” said Hiten Bheda, Chairman, Environment Committee, The All-India Plastics Manufacturers Association.“People can send in their comments to us. We have had consultations with industry bodies also on the EPR regulation,” a senior environment ministry official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/producers-given-targets-to-manage-their-plastic-packaging-waste-in-draft-epr-notification-101633786474802.html

Following a meeting with his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the green strategic partnership finalised a year ago reflected the foresight of both countries and respect for the environment. “This partnership is an example of how by collective effort, through technology, one can work for green growth while preserving the environment. Today, we not only reviewed the progress made under this partnership but reiterated our commitment to increasing cooperation on climate change in the near future,” Modi said.Frederiksen said the cooperation between India and Denmark is a “great example of how green growth and green transition can go hand in hand”. She noted that while Denmark has the skills in the field of green technologies, India has the scale to use them to benefit a population of more than a billion.“Our green cooperation is now part of a very ambitious five-year joint action plan,” Frederiksen said, adding there is huge untapped potential in trade and investment.Among the four agreements signed on Saturday was a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the National Geophysical Research Institute in Hyderabad, and Aarhus University the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland on mapping groundwater resources and aquifers.The Indian Institute of Science-Bengaluru and Denmark’s Danfoss Industries Private Limited inked an MoU to establish a centre of excellence on natural refrigerants for tropical climates. A traditional knowledge digital library access agreement was signed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Danish Patent and Trademark Office, while the skill development ministry and the Danish government signed a joint letter of intent.Three commercial agreements announced on Saturday were an MoU between Reliance Industries and Stiesdal Fuel Technologies for developing a hydrogen electrolyser and its manufacturing and deployment in India, an MoU between Infosys Technologies and Aarhus University to establish a centre of excellence for sustainability solutions in Denmark, and an MoU between the Observer Research Foundation and the State of Green on research on green transition.Modi welcomed Denmark’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance, saying this has added a new dimension to bilateral cooperation. He also thanked Denmark for backing India at different international forums.The two sides also decided to expand the scope of their cooperation, including a new partnership in health. “In order to increase agricultural productivity and income of farmers in India, we have decided to cooperate in agriculture-related technology. Under this, work will be done on technologies in many areas such as food safety, cold chain, food processing, fertilisers, fisheries and aquaculture,” Modi said. India and Denmark will also cooperate in smart water resource management, “waste to best”, and efficient supply chains.Modi referred to Danish companies that have been working in India for a long time in areas such as energy, food processing, logistics, infrastructure and machinery, and said reforms in the domestic economy, especially steps in the manufacturing sector, are facilitating many opportunities for these firms. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-meets-danish-counterpart-sign-mous-to-boost-green-strategic-partnership-101633778076030.html

Aryan Khan is now at the Arthur Road Jail after he was denied bail by the metropolitan magistrate court on Friday. Reports said Shah Rukh Khan's driver has been summoned by the NCB for questioning.Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, whose son-in-law was arrested by the NCB in January this year, has brought a series of allegations against the NCB in connection with the Aryan Khan case. On Saturday, the minister said the agency let off three individuals and one of them is Rishabh Sachdeva, the brother-in-law of Mohit Bhartiyam a former Yuva Morcha chief of the BJP. The other two are Amir Furniturewala and Pratik Gaba, as Nawab Malik claimed.NCB says Gosavi, Bhanushali were independent witnesses in Aryan Khan case; not known to agency"It has been said that we let off three people. But we actually let off six people as their roles didn't transpire in the investigation. We had brought them to the office for inquiry by serving them notice under sections 67 of the NDPS Act and as their role was not found in the case, they were subsequently allowed to go. For security reasons, their identity can not be revealed," Sameer Wankhede said.Clarifying the number of how many people were arrested from the cruise on that day, NCB said 14 people were detained and 8 eight were later arrested while six were let off as there was no evidence against them. "We have recorded statements of all the detainees. The time of the statement has also been mentioned. NCB's all actions were well within the law and transparent. The case related documents were produced before the court. We would soon file chargesheet in the case," NCB deputy director-general Gyaneshwar Singh said."All the allegations levelled against NCB are baseless, motivated afterthoughts & prejudiced in nature. Such statements are based on conjecture and assumptions. These assumptions are frivolous and malicious in view of documents and records of procedures duly followed by NCB that can subject to legal verification," the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-people-let-off-not-3-ncb-s-reply-to-minister-aryan-khan-s-driver-quizzed-101633777357957.html

Farmers have claimed that the Union minister's son Ashish Mishra was in the SUV that mowed down the protestors."The killing of two BJP workers in Lakhimpur Kheri after a convoy of cars mowed down four farmers is a reaction to an action. I do not consider those involved in the killings as culprits," Tikait was quoted as saying by PTI, in reply to a question asked during a press conference in Delhi.Tikait and other farmer leaders have demanded that both Union Minister Ajay Mishra and his son be arrested in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, and said the incident was a "pre-planned conspiracy".“Ajay Mishra should also be removed from the government as he started this conspiracy and is also protecting the culprits in the case,” said Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Yogendra Yadav during the press conference.Yadav went on to say that the SKM will on October 15, that is Dusshera, burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to protest against their inaction over the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-consider-those-who-killed-bjp-workers-in-lakhimpur-as-culprits-rakesh-tikait-101633775157791.html
09-10-2021||India||India, China to hold 13th round of military talks, Hot Springs to be in focus||The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will on Sunday hold the next round of military talks to cool tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the dialogue expected to focus on hammering out a disengagement plan for rival frontline soldiers deployed at Hot Springs, which is one of the friction points on LAC, officials familiar with the developments said on Saturday. The 13th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of LAC, said one of the officials cited above. It will begin at 10.30 am. The last round of military talks was held on August 2 after which the two armies pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the friction points on LAC. It was the second round of disengagement this year after the two sides pulled back their troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February. “Problems at Hot Springs or Patrol Point-15 are likely to be discussed during the talks. We are hopeful of positive outcomes that will take the disengagement process forward,” said a second official. If PLA is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre, so is the Indian Army, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on the eve of the talks, referring to the massive military buildup and infrastructure development by the neighbouring army across LAC. “It is a matter of concern that the large-scale buildup that occurred last year (when the border row erupted) continues to be in place. To sustain that kind of buildup, there has been an equal amount of infrastructure development on the Chinese side. It means that they (PLA) are there to stay. But if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too,” he said at the India Today conclave. India and China have been locked in a border standoff for 17 months and despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two sides still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre. The 13th round of military dialogue follows a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers along LAC in Arunachal Pradesh’s sensitive Tawang sector last week and another incursion by PLA in Uttarakhand on August 30. “PLA plans to keep the entire border active so that they can keep reinforcing their claims. It can also be an act of creeping assertiveness to subsequently lay a claim to these areas,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd) said on Friday. Top Indian and Chinese commanders agreed to a speedy resolution of outstanding issues on LAC at the 12th round of talks, with the dialogue focusing on disengagement of rival troops from the remaining flashpoints on the contested border. A joint statement issued after the 12th round described the talks as “a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.” After the disengagement of troops from Gogra, former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said, “Hopefully, it can provide grounds for further disengagement in other areas. The real test will come when Depsang is discussed, and a breakthrough here could lead to a major de-escalation.” To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-13th-round-of-military-talks-hot-springs-to-be-in-focus-101633776156787.html
09-10-2021||India||If PLA there to stay, so is Indian Army, says Gen Naravane on eve of LAC talks||If the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre so is the Indian Army, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Saturday referring to the military buildup and infrastructure development by the neighbouring army across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). His comments came on the eve of the 13th round of military talks with PLA to cool LAC tensions. “It is a matter of concern that the large-scale buildup that occurred last year (when the border row erupted) continues to be in place,” the army chief said. “To sustain that kind of buildup, there has been an equal amount of infrastructure development on the Chinese side. It means that they (PLA) are there to stay. We are keeping a close watch on the developments. But if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too,” he said at the India Today Conclave. He said India had taken countermeasures and matched PLA’s moves. India and China have been locked in a border standoff for 17 months and despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two sides still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre. “If they continue to stay there for the second winter, it will definitely mean we will be in a Line of Control (LoC) kind of situation (referring to the Indian and Pakistani deployments on the LoC), though not an active LoC as is there on the western front. We will have to keep a close eye on PLA troop buildup and deployments to ensure they don’t get into any misadventure once again,” Naravane said. Asked to comment on PLA’s intentions given its aggressive moves in the northern sector, he said, “I wish I knew. The most difficult thing is to get into your adversary’s mind. This is the question we have been asking not just within the army but also at other forums. But whatever those reasons may have been, I don’t think they have been able to achieve their aims because of the rapid response by the Indian armed forces.” The army chief said renewed infiltration attempts by Pakistani terrorists were being witnessed along LoC in Kashmir after a four-month lull following the renewal of a ceasefire pact with Pakistan in February 2021. The two countries first agreed in 2003 to observe truce along their de facto border in Jammu & Kashmir. “The ceasefire held in totality till July. Incidents have started taking place again. There have been three incidents of ceasefire violation in north Kashmir. It seems to be a repeat of the 2003 pattern when it started with one odd incident and then rising to...as good as not having a ceasefire,” he said. On the Afghanistan situation and its impact on Kashmir, the army chief said when the previous Taliban regime was in power 20 years ago; Afghan-origin terrorists were operating in the valley. “There is reason to believe that the same thing might happen once again. We are prepared for any such eventuality. Just as we dealt with them in early 2000s, we will deal with them now should they venture anywhere near us.” Naravane flagged concerns about the recent targeted killings in Kashmir, saying the acts were unacceptable and a last-ditch attempt by terrorists to stay “a little relevant”. On the possibility of women being assigned front-line combat roles given that the doors of the National Defence Academy have been opened to them, he said, “We have opened 10 branches of the army to women, except infantry, armoured corps and mechanised infantry. I think for the foreseeable future that will remain the same. I will not make any false promises. We will have to see how it goes along. None of our neighbouring countries have opened up their combat arms to women officers. Things could change in future. We have to move slowly...change will happen but at its own pace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-pla-there-to-stay-so-is-indian-army-says-gen-naravane-on-eve-of-lac-talks-101633774960669.html
09-10-2021||India||NCB says Gosavi, Bhanushali were independent witnesses in Aryan Khan case; not known to agency||The Narcotics Control Bureau on Saturday issued a statement clarifying the association of Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi in the Aryan Khan case and said the agency did not violate any norm. The presence of independent witnesses is a must during raids and KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali whose names have come to the media were among those independent witnesses, deputy director-general Gyaneshwar Singh said adding that there were a total of nine independent witnessed in the case. None of these witnesses was known to the NCB prior to the raid, the official clarified.NCB's operation raised questions after Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik released photos of KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali arriving and leaving the NCB office on the day of the raid. While Manish Bhanushali is a BJP leader, KP Gosavi himself had fraud cases against him. KP Gosavi also took a selfie with Aryan Khan which went viral and NCB issued a statement denying any association between Gosavi and the agency.Cruise rave party: Who took the selfie with Aryan Khan? What did NCB say?While the NCB earlier claimed that Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi do not belong to the agency, it is the first time that the agency clarified what role they had in the case. Manish Bhanushali admitted to the media that he is a BJP leader and claimed to be an informer in this case. “As per due procedure established by the law of land, independent public witnesses are mandatorily required to be present during seizure operations. NCB strongly adheres to this procedure and involves at least 2 independent witnesses in all the operations. As the operations are conducted on a real-time basis, field verification of independent witnesses is not possible as the main focus is on the operation and drug recovery. A total of 9 independent witnesses were involved in the whole operation. Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi were among them,” Singh said in his statement. While Gosavi was seen in the selfie with Aryan, Manish Bhanushali was the person who was seen with Arbaaz Merchant, another arrested in the case who has been accused of possession of drugs. Bhanushali earlier said that he was there while the persons detained were being transported, but he was not dragging any of them. In its statement issued on Saturday, the NCB clarified none of the detained or arrested persons was ill-treated and at that time there was a rush to take them to the safety of the NCB custody. "As high-profile persons were involved in the said case, to avoid unwanted leakages of any information and for the safety of the detained persons, they were rushed to the safety of the NCB office to avoid large crowds and numerous cameras gathered. None of the detained or arrested person was ill-treated in any way," Gyaneshwar Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-high-profile-person-was-involved-what-ncb-says-on-kp-gosavi-bhanushali-101633774216549.html

It explained in a statement that this was being done with a view to boost the domestic availability and uptake of syringes for the nationwide exercise.“The domestic vaccine manufacturers, and manufacturers of syringes have played an important and critical role in the implementation of India's Covid-19 vaccination programme, the largest in the world. Syringes are vital to sustain the momentum of the drive to vaccinate all eligible citizens in the shortest possible time,” the health ministry noted in its statement.The three categories, the export of which has been blocked for 90 days are: 0.5ml/1ml AD (auto-disable), 0.5ml/1ml//2ml/3ml disposable, and 1ml/2ml/3ml RUP (re-use prevention). “It is clarified that the ban is not on the export of any kind/type. It is only a quantitative restriction for a limited period and does not cover syringes of other denominations or type other than those mentioned,” the statement further mentioned.Any restriction which is "quantitative" in nature limits the quantity of goods to be imported or exported.The national inoculation drive against the viral illness commenced on January 16 this year and, thus far, more than 940 million doses of a Covid-19 jab have been administered. At present, only those aged 18 and above are eligible to get vaccinated; the government aims to vaccinate 100 per cent adult population by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-announces-ban-on-export-of-3-categories-of-syringes-for-90-days-101633764186804.html
09-10-2021||India||India, China border talks tomorrow; Hot Springs de-escalation possible||A meeting between India’s Ladakh Corps Commander and Chinese South Xinjiang military district commander is expected to take place on Sunday at Chushul with de-escalation from patrolling point 15 or general area Hot Springs on the agenda. According to people familiar with the matter, the senior military commanders will take up remaining points of friction in East Ladakh, including Depsang Bulge and Charding Nullah Junction in South Demchok, one at a time. If the two decide to come to an agreement (most plausible) on de-escalation from Hot Springs, the PLA aggression of May 2020 will be reversed with the status quo intact in East Ladakh. As of now, some 50 PLA personnel are ahead for their positions at patrolling point 15 with an equal number of Indian Army troops facing them at a distance.Even though the military situation has eased out between the two sides as compared to last year, the PLA has still deployed more than two divisions and a number of combined arms brigades. The Indian Army also has matching deployments with the air force on standby from both sides. “If de-escalation from PP 15 is reached on Sunday, then both India and China can work towards de-induction of troops from the East Ladakh theatre after 16 months,” said a Beijing watcher.While India will welcome the de-escalation from Hot Springs after the Gogra agreement in the previous round of military dialogue, New Delhi wants continued discussions to resolve patrolling rights in Depsang Bulge and Charding Nullah Junction so that all pin-pricks along the 1597km long Ladakh LAC are removed.While there has been recent excitement within the media over PLA transgressions in Barahoti Plains in Central Sector and Tawang in the eastern sector, the armies on both sides have taken them as routine annual fall-outs of an undefined border. However, India has made it very clear that normalcy in bilateral relations is totally dependent on peace and tranquillity along the 3488km LAC with PLA directed to desist from making any unilateral changes on the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-border-talks-tomorrow-hot-springs-de-escalation-possible-101633764475644.html

As many as five innocents from these minorities were gunned down in Srinagar by local fronts of Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) this month. As many as four counter-terror and intelligence teams from intelligence agencies and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are parked in Srinagar with firm instructions to eliminate these terror modules through pin-pointed action. Besides, counter-insurgent force, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), has been told to pull up its socks in Srinagar and the Border Security Force (BSF) has been asked to prevent infiltration from across the border.On Friday night, the J-K police gunned down Aqib Bashir, a LeT terrorist from Shopian, in an encounter in the Natipora area in Srinagar. An AK-47 assault rifle and two magazines were recovered from the body and a fresh attempt to target minorities was foiled. Another terrorist, said to be a Pakistani national, managed to escape the encounter site.After the targeted killing of a Kashmiri Pandit pharmacist Makhan Lal Bindroo, school principal Supinder Kaur, schoolteacher Deepak Chand and Virender Paswan, a hawker from Bihar, the security forces are scanning the Srinagar city to neutralise the new threat as the Centre has made it clear that it will not allow anyone to terrorise the public.According to senior officials of J-K police, three local modules two terrorists of LeT front, so-called the resistance force, are operating in Srinagar and targeting innocents with small arms. The officials confirm the presence of a Pakistani national who is guiding the attacks by selecting the targets.After a review of the security situation was conducted by Union home minister Amit Shah along with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on October 7, the Centre has decided that its first priority is to eliminate the perpetrators of the crime and then go after their sponsors in the Valley and beyond. The intelligence and security status has been upgraded as there is a legitimate fear of proliferation of US-made assault rifles, sniper rifles and night vision devices from Taliban occupied Afghanistan. The US forces exited Afghanistan last month after leaving billions worth of military hardware including lakhs of assault rifles and ammunition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-ready-for-hard-options-against-targeted-minority-killings-in-valley-101633758559193.html

Now, this enables Indian visitors, vaccinated with recognised vaccines, which include Covishield, to enter the United Kingdom without quarantine. We now have to get people moving between the two countries. People are desperate to come here (India),” Ellis said, according to news agency ANI. #WATCH We are delighted with UK-India cooperation on Covishield, those travelling from India can now enter the UK without quarantine, says Alex Ellis, UK High Commissioner to India pic.twitter.com/EPY1X1BTy6The next step, the high commissioner said, is easing the way for business travellers to come to India, and opening up more flights. “We have to look at each process and, in turn, at each vaccine. We start with the ones recognised by regulators, and that includes Covishield,” Ellis said, when questioned on the possibility of British regulators recognising Covaxin, India's first indigenous anti-Covid jab.A major diplomatic row erupted between New Delhi and London after the latter announced that under its new entry rules, Indian nationals arriving in the UK will have to spend 10 days in quarantine even if they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 but not from a vaccine not recognised here, including Covishield. The jab, in reality, is the Indian version of Britain's Astrazeneca vaccine.Later, the Johnson administration accepted Covishield, though it did not approve India's CoWIN-generated vaccine certificates.In response, New Delhi imposed reciprocal measures. The respective entry norms of both sides came into effect on October 4.The new travel rules to the United Kingdom will apply from October 11. As a result, India, too, is likely to relax quarantine rules for those arriving from there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/absolutely-delighted-uk-high-commissioner-on-end-of-vaccine-certification-row-with-india-101633759092964.html

09-10-2021||India||Kerala HC sends notice to Centre over PM Modi’s photo on vaccine certificate||The Kerala High Court on Friday sent a notice to the Union Government on a petition seeking the Covid-19 certificate without Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photo on it. Petitioner M Peter, a resident of Kottayam, contended that the present vaccine certificate violates the fundamental rights of a citizen and sought a certificate without the photo of the Prime Minister. After submitting his plea Justice P B Suresh Kumar directed both, union and state governments, to file their views in two weeks. The petitioner also produced vaccination certificates of different countries including the United States, Indonesia, Israel and Germany saying they all carried necessary information, not photos of their heads of the government.The petitioner, a frequent traveller, also said he has to carry the certificate with him to several places and the photo of the PM has “no substance, utility or relevance.” If the government is firm, people can be given an option to carry the certificate without any photo.In the petition filed through Advocate Ajit Joy, he said the fight against the pandemic is converted into a public relations and media campaign and it gives an impression that it was a one-man show. He said he has every right to carry a vaccine certificate without the photo of the PM.“The photograph is a needless intrusion into the private space of the petitioner. The Central government or the PM cannot claim to have done anything particular, but their duty,” he contended in the petition.Earlier, the Union government defended its decision to include the photograph in the certificate saying the PM’s image along with his words help create general awareness and Covid-appropriate behaviour. When a question came up in the upper house two months back, Minister of State for Health BP Pawar said the PM’s photo was ideal to promote awareness. “Given the context of the pandemic, its evolving nature and the fact that following of Covid-appropriate behaviour has emerged as one of the critical measures for preventing the spread of the disease,” he said in a written reply justifying the photo. “The photograph along with his words reinforces the message for creating awareness and importance of following Covid-appropriate behaviour even after the vaccination. It was done in the larger public interest,” he said. But Congress and other opposition members deplored it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-sends-notice-to-centre-over-pm-modi-s-photo-on-vaccine-certificate-101633756653276.html

Details here||With the festive season officially underway, the Northern Railway (NR) is gearing up to manage crowds at railway stations in the national capital, and to ensure that they comply with Covid-19 norms. As heavy rush is expected due to festivals such as Diwali and Chhath Puja, both of which will be celebrated next month, NR will run 78 trains from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from October 29 to November 10.To manage crowds effectively, officials have directed that trains will be parked at designated platform 30 minutes before scheduled departure time, according to a report in Hindustan Times' sister publication Live Hindustan; this is being done to give passengers sufficient time to get onboard. Additionally, during festivals, there shall be no change in platform from which a train is scheduled to depart. All trains leaving for Bihar from New Delhi and Anand Vihar railway stations will depart from platform number 16 and 1 respectively, officials said. This, according to them, is because these are close to the entrance gate of the respective railway stations.To ensure compliance with Covid-19 norms, arrangements will be made for sanitisation at all stations, Dimpi Garg, Delhi Zone rail manager, said, adding that passengers will be made to undergo thermal screening. On platforms, marks have been made for social distancing, she further said.Further, mini control rooms will be set up at New Delhi, Old Delhi and Anand Vihar stations.

The coal-based power plants are operating at less than 50% of their 90 MU/day capacity because of coal shortages. Even the Central Generating Stations have not been able to supply more than 75% of their 40 MU/day capacity,” he said.Jagan said the state had to depend heavily on market purchases for sourcing its shortfall energy. The daily average market price of about 40 MU/day power has increased three times, from an average of ₹4.6 per unit (kilowatt-hour) on September 15 to a daily average of ₹15 per unit on Friday.“On some days, the rates in the power market have gone up to ₹20 per unit irrespective of peak or off-peak hours. The power is also not available at certain hours in the market due to less availability of generation in the country,” he said.The chief minister describing it as an alarming situation and said the finances of distribution companies would deteriorate further if the situation persists. CM Jagan said it had become increasingly difficult to meet the grid demand and the circumstances are pushing the state towards load shedding.“More water is required in the last stage of harvesting and if it is denied, fields would dry up and farmers stand to lose. Unplanned power cuts once resorted to, will lead to chaotic conditions,” he pointed out.Seeking the Centre’s help to tide over the power crisis, Jagan said the coal ministry and railways might be directed to allot 20 coal rakes to AP thermal stations. He suggested that the stranded and non-working pit-head coal plants in India without PPAs or coal linkage may be revived on an emergency basis.“Deep-water well gas available with ONGC and Reliance may be supplied on an emergency basis to the 2300 MW stranded and non-working gas-based power plants in AP. Similarly, the deficit of nearly 500 MW from Central Generating Stations due to plant maintenance can be bridged by reviving the plants at the earliest or postponing their maintenance,” he suggested.Jagan also requested that banks and lending institutions be instructed to provide working capital loans liberally to power distribution companies to make coal payments and undertake market purchases till the crisis is overcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-power-plants-running-out-of-coal-stocks-cm-sends-sos-to-pm-modi-101633751972244.html

According to the survey, Punjab is headed for a hung assembly with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) set to emerge as the single largest party in the northern state. The AAP is seen emerging as the main challenger or a close third party in Punjab and Goa as well as in Uttarakhand. The Congress may witness severe infighting across all the state units with Punjab and Manipur being the worst hit. The predictions are in line with the first round of the ABP-C Voter survey last month. According to the latest survey, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP can get 41.3 per cent of vote share, while Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party can get 32 ​​per cent, the Bahujan Samaj Party can get 15 per cent, Congress 6 per cent and others can get 6 per cent in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. The BJP has been continuously maintaining its vote share of around 41 per cent in the state—in the last assembly elections in 2017, the ruling party garnered 41.4 per cent of the votes polled in the state. In terms of seats, the survey shows that the BJP is likely to get 241 to 249 seats and the share of the Samajwadi Party can be 130 to 138 seats. Mayawati’s BSP can be reduced to between 15 to 19 and Congress between 3 to 7 seats, according to the survey.The ABP CVoter survey has predicted a hung assembly in Punjab with the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerging as the single largest party. The AAP can get a big advantage in the elections to the 117-member assembly in Punjab. The AAP is likely to get 36 per cent of the vote share, Congress 32 per cent, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) 22 per cent, the BJP 4 per cent and others 6 per cent. In terms of seats, the AAP can get 49 to 55, Congress 30 to 47, Akali Dal 17 to 25, the BJP 0-1 and others 0-1 seats.The BJP can once again make a comeback in the Uttarakhand elections next year. According to the survey, Congress may get 34 per cent, BJP 45 per cent, Aam Aadmi Party 15 per cent and others 6 per cent of the vote share. The Congress party is likely to get 21-25 seats, the BJP 42-46 seats, the Aam Aadmi Party 0-4 seats and others 0-2 seats in the hill state, the survey shows.According to the survey, the BJP can once again form its government in Goa with the maximum number of seats in the 40-member assembly in the coastal state.

However, even though this pledge of financial support—to mobilise $100 billion annually in climate finance to support the needs of developing countries—was made in 2010, much of it has still not been met. In fact, the UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa also personally urged the developed countries earlier this year in June to make good on their promise, according to an official statement by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Recognising that there is a need to desist from “cherry-picking” of the UNFCCC's structure, India's permanent representative to the UN, Tirumurti, said that the negotiation should be done by all the member-states and not just a few nations who tend to decide for all. “There is a need to desist from ‘cherry-picking’ from the inclusive and comprehensive structure of the UNFCCC,” the ANI news agency quoted Tirumurti as saying. “It is negotiated by all the member-states. A few should not decide for all. India supports member-states driven process in the interest of developing countries.”Need to desist from “cherry-picking” from inclusive & comprehensive structure of UNFCCC, it's negotiated by all member-states.

For many nations, securing the financing necessary to spur their own transition to a more sustainable future can’t happen without this promised support. This includes action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and action to build resilience to the inevitable impacts of climate change, such as frequent and severe droughts, floods, and storms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/less-than-what-nfl-earns-india-urges-developed-nations-to-deliver-on-100-billion-climate-pledge-101633742690731.html

09-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur: SC pulls up UP police over delay in arrests||The Supreme Court on Friday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for not immediately arresting Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, commenting that the state police do not appear to be “really serious” even as the “brutal” episode left eight people dead five days ago.Mishra has been named as an accused in a murder first information report (FIR) lodged on Monday. The court was exceptionally harsh while commenting on the police’s lenient handling of Mishra, although it didn’t name him.“This is an offence registered under Section 302 (murder charge under the Indian Penal Code). Do you treat everyone in the same manner? Issue notice and then wait for them to appear? Will an accused in every part of the country be treated in the same way like the present case? Giving them an invitation that you please come? We want to question you so you kindly come?” the bench asked lawyer Harish Salve, who was representing the UP government in the case registered by the top court on its own (suo motu) as a public interest litigation.Mishra dodged a summon to appear before the police (as a witness, not an accused) on Friday. Although he made an appearance on some TV channels to proclaim his innocence, he has not been seen since Thursday.The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, held that the apex court is “not satisfied” with the investigation conducted so far in the case.It added that the special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the state government does not inspire any confidence, and asked the state to have an “alternative agency” with independent investigators take over the probe.“What is the message you are sending? If a case is lodged under Section 302, the police will normally go and arrest the accused. After all, this is a case involving the brutal death of eight people. The law should have taken its course and all accused should have been arrested,” the bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, told Salve.The bench expressed anguish that the UP Police issued a notice as a witness (to Ashish Mishra) despite his name being in the murder FIR lodged on Monday.The UP Police on Thursday arrested two men, both believed to be associates of Mishra. The arrests happened hours after the Supreme Court hearing on Thursday when the bench termed the Lakhimpur Kheri incident “very unfortunate”. Mishra, however, was sent a notice under section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code as a witness of the October 3 incident, for presenting himself before the investigators Friday.Salve said that the police have issued a notice to Mishra and he has sought time till 11 am on Saturday.“If he does not come, the rigours of law will follow. I was told that the post-mortem did not show any bullet wounds that is why a notice has been sent. But there is strong evidence to show prima facie that this is a murder case... the case is extremely serious,” added Salve.Unmoved by his submissions, the court retorted: “This is the opinion of the bench. We expect you to act as a responsible government and as a responsible police force. When there is a serious allegation of death or gun-shot injury, will you treat the accused like this? You say this is an extremely serious case but the way you are proceeding, you are not really serious. It is only in your words and not in action.”The court also expressed its disapproval at the composition of the SIT set up by the state government to carry out the probe after noticing that the team comprised a deputy inspector general, superintendent of police and all other police officials from the UP Police itself.“Look at the composition of the SIT. It has all your officers. This is what happens when you have all local people in the SIT...We don’t know if a good probe is conducted in this case because of the officers involved. Please, ask the DGP (director general of police) to ensure that all evidence is protected and not destroyed in the interim by the time another agency takes over,” said the bench, asking Salve to inform the court on October 20 about some other agency that can take over the probe.It also inquired from Salve if the state has made any request to CBI to step in. While Salve said the court could pass such orders on the next date after giving the state an opportunity to show the progress in the investigation, the bench itself remarked that the CBI may not be a solution here “because of the persons involved”.“We hope that the state will take necessary steps. Because of the sensitivity of the issue, the state should understand that we are not saying anything more... We will take it up after the Dussehra break but that should not mean that the state holds its hands. Take immediate steps. You have to act to inspire confidence,” it told Salve.Salve, on his part, conceded that what needed to be done has not been done and that he is giving his personal assurance that the state would be in a position to satisfy the court by the next date of hearing.The court then recorded in its order that it is not satisfied with the steps taken so far by the state government and that Salve has assured it that an alternative agency would be explored for further probe in the matter. The bench has also noted that the evidence collected so far shall be preserved properly.Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same.The minister and his son deny the charge and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led to the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed. The Mishras claim Ashish Mishra was not at the site.On Wednesday, a new, 45-second video of the incident showed the Thar ploughing through the farmers at high speed, with two vehicles in tow. The identities of individuals in the vehicles were not clear and HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-sc-pulls-up-up-police-over-delay-in-arrests-101633742171847.html

Ashish Mishra was previously summoned as a witness, not an accused, by the police on Friday but he failed to appear before them. MoS Teni later said his son was unable to report to the police due to ‘health reasons’. After this, the UP police pasted a fresh notice outside the minister's residence asking his son Ashish Mishra to appear before them for questioning on October 9.In photos posted by the ANI news agency, it was seen that the UP police has already started making preparations to tighten the security in Lakhimpur Kheri police lines, ahead of Ashish Mishra's expected appearance before the cops today.Security tightened in Police lines Lakhimpur Kheri as Ashish Mishra (Son of MoS Home Ajay Mishra Teni) summoned by UP Police today. pic.twitter.com/7xkXqiuYYFAshish Mishra was named in a first information report (FIR) following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down farmers protesting against UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya's visit on Sunday.Also Read | My son is at home, says Union minister Ajay Mishra after cops paste 2nd noticeDespite summons, Ashish Mishra managed to dodge the calls for questioning on Friday, even though he was seen making an appearance on some TV channels to proclaim his innocence earlier this week.

09-10-2021||India||India, China in fresh face-off in Arunachal||Scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh’s sensitive Tawang sector last week, officials familiar with the development said on Friday. The latest confrontation comes at a time when both sides are planning to hold the next round of military talks to cool tensions in the Ladakh sector.The face-off took place when rival patrols came face-to-face in a contested area near Yangtse, with the soldiers asking each other to retreat to their respective sides, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.“The face-off lasted a few hours before the matter was resolved at the level of local commanders,” said a second official.“Both sides undertake patrolling activities up to their perception of the border. Whenever patrols of both sides physically meet, the situation is managed according to established protocols and mechanisms. Physical engagement can last for a few hours prior to disengaging as per mutual understanding. This is routine business,” he said.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, said it did not have “relevant information” about the skirmish.“I am not aware of relevant information,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular media briefing.The latest incident came weeks after Chinese patrols consisting of around 100 soldiers crossed LAC in the central sector in Uttarakhand on August 30 and damaged a footbridge before they went back to the other side. The area in which the intrusion took place is manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.“PLA plans to keep the entire border active so that they can keep reinforcing their claims. It can also be an act of creeping assertiveness to subsequently lay a claim to these areas,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).Last week, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that the next round of military talks with the Chinese PLA to reduce tensions along LAC in eastern Ladakh could take place in the second week of October.He said the situation on the LAC was under control and outstanding problems with PLA could be resolved through talks.The two armies have been locked in a border standoff for almost 17 months and both sides are carrying out negotiations to reduce tensions. Outstanding problems at Hot Springs, or Patrolling Point-15, which is one of the friction points on the LAC, could be taken up during the 13th round of talks.The rival armies carried out the second round of disengagement in early August when both sides pulled back their forward-deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrolling Point-17A, with the breakthrough coming after the 12th round of military talks.Earlier, India and China wrapped up the disengagement process in Pangong Tso area in mid-February, with their armies pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the LAC after 45 years.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-in-fresh-face-off-in-arunachal-101633725458586.html

The case was registered against unknown accused. Based on the orders of the MHA, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) re-registered the case and took over the investigation. The bomb blast in the Mysuru court was one among a series of five explosions by the members of Base Movement, an organisation owing allegiance to al-Qaeda, the NIA official said.In 2016, they had executed a blast at Chittor Court at Nellore in Andhra Pradesh in April, at Kollam court in Kerala in May, again at a Nellore court in September 2016 and at Mallapuram court in Kerala in November 2016, the official said.Ali and Sulaiman had formed the Base Movement in Tamil Nadu in January 2015, inspired by the ideology of al-Qaeda and its leader Osama Bin Laden, according to the NIA official.They recruited other accused and hatched a conspiracy to threaten government departments, especially courts, holding them responsible for “atrocities and injustice meted out to a particular religious group”, the official said.They systematically issued threats to prison authorities and police officials of different states and the French Embassy in India.The NIA had filed a charge sheet against Nainar Abbas Ali, Raja and Sulaiman in May 2017 and the trial in the case was concluded in September 2021, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2016-mysuru-court-blast-case-nia-convicts-3-al-qaeda-inspired-terrorists-101633725147378.html

The Orissa high court rejected his anticipatory bail application on October 5.Jagdev, who in the past has courted controversies over his strong-arm tactics, allegedly thrashed BJP’s Dalit leader Niranjan Sethi on September 8 when the latter protested the delay in distribution of National Food Security Act cards for the beneficiaries and assistance for construction of houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Balugaon area of Khurda district.

09-10-2021||India||Bengaluru: Police complaint against online gaming firm for violating new law||Bengaluru A police complaint was registered in Bengaluru on Thursday against a popular online gaming company for alleged violation of the newly enforced laws on online gambling and gaming barely two days after the contentious legislation was notified. According to the Bengaluru police, a complaint was registered in Annapurnenshwari Nagar station on Thursday. “A complaint has been registered by a person who said that the website of Dream 11 continued to be active despite the new legislation coming into force. He said that this was a game of chance and not skill,” said a senior police official from Annapurneshwari Nagar on Friday. He said that a case was registered under Section 79 and 80 of the Karnataka Police Act. The complaint comes two days after the Karnataka governor’s assent to a Bill that was passed by both houses of the state legislature in the just concluded monsoon session held between September 13 to 24.Araga Jnanendra, the home minister had tabled the ‘Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021’ to bring an amendment as technologies like smartphone, computers have increased gambling on apps and other platforms. He had said that terms like cyber space and online gaming were included in the Act. The swift notifying of the ban on online gambling and gaming by the Basavaraj Bommai-led government has caught operators off guard who were hoping for some more time for the law to come into force, especially with the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) that brings in a significant chunk of the revenues. The All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) on Wednesday had told Hindustan Times that it was “needless to say, the industry will challenge this in court and seek legal recourse”. Companies had on Wednesday said that they had banned users from Karnataka from accessing their respective apps. Dream 11 declined to comment. The bill comes at a time when Deepavali is just around the corner during which there is gambling in almost every household as part of the festivities. The Indian gaming industry, part of the Sunrise sector, has been a roaring success in the country especially since the Covid-19 induced lockdown where engagement increased from around 2.5 hours (11% of total smartphone time) before the pandemic to 4.1 hours (15% of the total smartphone time) in just the first month of the lockdown, according to a June 2021 report by KPMG. “The industry has been seeking clarity in regulation based on several precedents which establish the legitimacy of “games of skills” and the state should take cognizance of these judgements in issuing an enabling gaming policy that will facilitate growth and opportunity for this sector,” Biren Ghose, the chairman of the CII’s National committee on AVGC and president of Association of Bangalore Animation Industry (ABAI) said on Wednesday. The online gaming industry, which gained significant traction during the Covid-19 -induced lockdown, is slated to grow from 360 million gamers to 510 million by 2022, according to a 2021 report by All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) and EY.

09-10-2021||India||Karnataka: Sri Ram Sene’s chequered past back under lens after hate crime||Bengaluru: Over nine months have passed since the Special Investigation Team (SIT) are on the trail of the assassins who were involved in the murder of journalist turned activist Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru. Until the first of June, police had arrested several accused in the murder conspiracy, including the mastermind – Amol Kale. But the man who pulled the trigger on Lankesh was still at large. The suspects in the custody remained silent on the identity of the shooter even after weeks of interrogation. Finally, a breakthrough came in the form of a codeword in Kale’s diary – builder. One of the suspects finally told police that it was the builder (bodybuilder) who pulled the trigger, but he didn’t know his name. Armed with a forensic report that showed that the shooter was around 5.1 feet tall, an SIT team reached Sindagi town in North Karnataka’s Bijapur, based on a mobile number found next to the code name ‘builder’. They conducted an identity parade of people with a criminal past. Among them was a muscular man who was 5.2 feet tall. His photo was sent back to SIT and a suspect in custody confirmed that it was the shooter. On June 11 morning, the team arrested Parashuram Waghmore, the man who shot Lankesh dead. The SIT investigation on the conspiracy found that the syndicate that murdered Lankesh was recruiting young men from various right-wing organizations, who had a tussle with the law in the past. Waghmore was recruited from Sri Rama Sene. During this time in the organization, in 2012, Waghmore along with his associates hoisted a Pakistan flag in front of tahsildar’s office in Sindagi on January 1. They alleged it was done by the Muslim community and communal tension prevailed in the city. He was later acquitted by a lower court citing mistakes and technical errors in the charge sheet. Sri Ram Sene was founded in the late 1960s by Kalki Maharaj, the right-hand man of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, and a former member of the Bajrang Dal and the Vishva Hindu Parishad. In Karnataka, controversial right-wing activist Pramod Muthalik held the top post in the organization, and over the years, it became infamous. The incident in Singadi was not the first time Sri Rama Sene was entered in the record books of the Karnataka Police. On January 24, 2009, a group of 40 activists of the Sene barged into a pub called “Amnesia — The Lounge” and allegedly trashed a group of young women and men, claiming the women were violating traditional Indian values. Two of the women were hospitalized. In the latest incident, on Thursday, police arrested members of a group ‘Sri Ram Sene Hindustan’ for murdering and decapitating a 24-year-old Muslim man who was in a relationship with a Hindu girl. According to police, Sri Ram Sene Hindustan’ is an offshoot of Sri Ram Sene headed by Muthalik. A senior officer who was part of the Gauri Lankesh investigation pointed out the rise of right-wing Hindu organisations like Sri Rama Sene is a matter of concern. “During the Gauri Lankesh investigation, we learnt that around 22 Karnataka youths went through firearms training so they could carry out assassinations of intellectuals. All of them were recruited from organisations like Sri Rama Sena. It is a dangerous trend. These right-wing organisations often act with impunity across the state, which attracts a lot of youth,” said a senior police officer who didn’t want to be named. “Even though members organisations like Sri Rama Sene is involved in crimes, like the Gauri Lankesh murder (Bengaluru, 2017), intentionally creating communal tensions (Bijpiur, 2012), Pub attack (Mangaluru 2012) and now the murder of this young man (Belagavi 2021). There is no proposal to ban the organisation. In fact, in the Gauri Lankesh case, the government didn’t even appeal when the petition was filed to drop charges of organised crimes against the some accused,” the officer added. According to another officer, a criminal past of the organisation, from moral policing to organised murder, is a cause for concern. “Moral policing is a big problem in coastal regions and to some extent in north Karnataka as well. They are often dismissed as vigilantes but these incidents show why the trend is alarming,” said an ADGP rank officer who was posted in the coastal Karnataka region. As per Karnataka Communal Harmony’s records, there have been 1,288 instances of communal violence including moral policing, cattle vigilantism, and hate speech since 2010 in coastal Karnataka alone. Out of this, 322 instances were of moral policing by vigilantes. According to Vidya Dinker, a Mangaluru based activist who has been fighting moral policing known as “love jihad”, a term used by some Hindu groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, came to Karnataka way before it became familiar across the country. “The Hindu-Muslim divide was often used (by political/religious outfits) to convince people that there was an attempt to steal girls to convert them. This thought has been institutionalised over a period of time and this is now resulting in such brutal murders,” she said. Sri Ram Sene Hindustan chief Ramakant Konduskar earlier distanced his organisation from the alleged murder, saying the members had been targeted for “being Hindutva workers”. “Our members don’t indulge in murders. We do charity work. The men who have been arrested acted on their own,” he said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-sri-ram-sene-s-chequered-past-back-under-lens-after-hate-crime-101633724006025.html
09-10-2021||India||CBI skipped initial enquiry. It doesn’t vitiate FIR, rules SC in corruption case||NEW DELHI: A First Information Report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation in a corruption case without holding a preliminary enquiry does not vitiate the case against the accused, the Supreme Court held on Friday and set aside the Telangana high court’s February 2000 verdict quashing the FIR against Andhra Pradesh education minister A Suresh, and his wife, an income tax commissioner, over a disproportionate assets case registered against her in 2017.“If CBI chooses not to hold a preliminary enquiry, the accused cannot demand it as a matter of right,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna ruled, upholding the agency’s appeal against the high court judgment.The court examined the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act and the CBI Manual and held that institution of a preliminary enquiry is not made mandatory before the registration of an FIR.To be sure, the PC Act was amended in 2018. One of the changes brought about by this amendment was that it barred a police officer from conducting any enquiry or inquiry or investigation into any offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant without the government’s sanction if the alleged offence is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken by such public servant in discharge of his official functions or duties. It is not clear how these changes will impact a procedure to be adopted by CBI in a disproportionate assets case.In this case, CBI argued that it did not feel the need to hold a preliminary inquiry (PE) referred to in CBI Manual because the material against the I-T commissioner TH Vijaylakshmi was collected during its investigation into another case where she was one of the accused. During the earlier investigation, CBI conducted searches at four places belonging to her during which documents were seized. She was later examined and on basis of such information and documents, the FIR was registered.“We hold that in case the information received by CBI, through a complaint or a “source information” discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, it can directly register a regular case instead of conducting a preliminary enquiry, where the officer is satisfied that the information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence,” the three-judge bench said.However, the bench left the choice open to CBI whether it decides to file a regular case or preliminary enquiry. “We hold that since the institution of a preliminary enquiry in cases of corruption is not made mandatory before the registration of an FIR under the CrPC, PC Act or even the CBI Manual, for this court to issue a direction to that effect will be tantamount to stepping into the legislative domain.”CBI alleged that TH Vijayalakshmi, the MLA’s wife who was a central government officer, was found to possess disproportionate assets to the tune of over ₹1.1 crore which was 22.86% of the income earned during the check period between 1 April 2010 to 29 February 2016. The high court examined the FIR and the material and concluded that the allegations were not made out and set aside the FIR and proceedings under it on several grounds, one of which being no preliminary enquiry preceding lodging of FIR.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for CBI, argued that CBI Manual does not make it mandatory to conduct a preliminary enquiry before the registration of the FIR. She stated that a PE cannot be made mandatory for all cases of corruption and is only conducted when the information received is not sufficient to register a regular case. The court reserved its orders on September 22.The agency also said if the accused is confronted with the evidence before the registration of an FIR by filing a PE, there would be a risk of tampering with or destruction of evidence.The case against the legislator, A Suresh, who is the education minister in the YSR Congress government in Andhra Pradesh, was alleged to be that of being an abettor under Section 109 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). He argued that CBI registered the case against him without taking the Speaker’s sanction, alleging that the entire case was part of a conspiracy hatched by his political rivals.The court noted that registration of a regular case can have disastrous consequences for the career of an officer, if the allegations ultimately turn out to be false. “In a preliminary enquiry, CBI is allowed access to documentary records and to speak to persons just as they would in an investigation, which entails that information gathered can be used at the investigation stage as well. Hence, conducting a preliminary enquiry would not take away from the ultimate goal of prosecuting accused persons in a timely manner.”However, the court clarified that it was for CBI to choose not to hold a preliminary enquiry, underlining its order should not be seen as taking away “the value of conducting a preliminary enquiry in an appropriate case”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-skipped-initial-enquiry-it-doesn-t-vitiate-fir-rules-sc-in-corruption-case-101633723678129.html

It is customary for the IAF to announce ‘unit citations’ on IAF Day (October 8).In an address on the occasion of the Air Force Day, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said the year gone by was “quite challenging yet extremely rewarding”. “The prompt actions in response to developments in eastern Ladakh were a testament to the Indian Air Force’s combat readiness. Our efforts in completing all Covid-related tasks was also a major achievement in support of national efforts.”India and China have been locked in a border standoff for 17 months and both sides are carrying out negotiations to reduce tensions.“In May 2020, the No. 47 Squadron was deployed for air defence as well as air-to-ground operations in the northern sector, and carried out extensive operations at high altitude,” said one of the citations.After the February 2019 Balakot airstrikes by the IAF, the MiG-29 squadron was deployed in an air defence role and flew extensively to ensure that there was no misadventure by Pakistan.After the Galwan Valley skirmish in June 2020, the 116 Helicopter Unit was deployed for offensive operations at a high-altitude airfield in the Ladakh area. “The unit quickly established the first-ever high-altitude attack helicopter detachment in the region and executed day and night operations, including air-to-ground weapons delivery at high altitude,” said another citation. A trust deficit persists between the Indian and Chinese armies after their soldiers were involved in the brutal clash along the contested LAC. The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along LAC in more than five decades, and it pushed the bilateral relationship to a breaking point - it left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.The 2255 Squadron Det was mobilised for air defence activation in Ladakh following the Galwan Valley skirmish.“Since then, the squadron has undertaken various innovations to sustain serviceability and reliability of its equipment. This has enabled it to maintain its operational readiness in harsh climatic conditions,” said a third citation.The IAF played a critical role when border tensions with China peaked last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-chief-hails-iaf-actions-during-ladakh-standoff-101633720185950.html

Apart from this, the government also sought more Covid-19 vaccines for Karnataka as it aims to inoculate 70% of its population with the second dose by December-end.“The Karnataka government is planning to upgrade and modernise all PHCs in the state and we have sought additional allocation under NHM for the purpose. The Centre has responded positively to our request,” Sudhakar told reporters after the meeting.The minister said he has also discussed about strengthening trauma care, secondary and tertiary care in all districts across the state.The health minister further said that Mandaviya appreciated Karnataka’s efforts in Covid-19 management. State has an inventory of over 5 million doses of vaccine and has achieved 82 per cent coverage in first dose and 37 per cent coverage in second dose among eligible population. Sudhakar said the state government is awaiting Centre’s guidelines on vaccinating children.“The vaccine for children is in trial phase and the Centre will soon decide after discussing with vaccine-manufacturers. We must not let our guard down against the pandemic,” the minister said keeping in view the approaching festival season.He added that the state is conducting about 100,000 Covid tests everyday and the positivity rate is less than 0.4 per cent. So, there is no need to panic, said Sudhakar. Bommai after the meeting with Mandaviya informed that Centre has assured it will supply more Covid-19 vaccines to Karnataka. “The minister assured us that he will give more (vaccines) if required. We have a stock of 5.1 million doses and a special drive is being undertaken. We are focusing on giving the second dose to people,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-seeks-more-covid-vaccine-doses-from-centre-funds-to-upgrade-phcs-101633723285820.html
09-10-2021||India||Bengaluru civic body: Will finish old buildings’ audit in 15 days||Bengaluru Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said on Friday that the audit on old and dilapidated buildings in the city would be completed within 15 days, giving an extension to its own initiative that adds risks to the lives and property of people living in unstable structures. After two buildings collapsed in Bengaluru on two consecutive days in September last week, Gupta had instructed zonal joint commissioners and chief engineers to form a committee to conduct a resurvey of dilapidated buildings and submit a report within 15 days.“We had to do it within 15 days. On September 30, the revenue minister asked us to do it within 15 days,” Gupta said.On September 30, revenue minister R Ashok held a meeting with BBMP, the city’s civic body, to take stock of old and dangerously unstable buildings in the city. The civic body chief commissioner said the corporation was asked to take action on the earlier survey and demolish unstable structures. He added that the structures that can be fixed would be regularised. The statements come as another multi-storied building collapsed in Bengaluru on Thursday, making it the third such incident in the city in the last couple of weeks. A surge in population led to rapid and unplanned expansion of Bengaluru as land sharks and builders encroached upon lakes, storm water drains, roads and other unapproved spaces for construction of residential and commercial buildings. According to a 2019 survey, there were at least 185 dilapidated buildings identified by the civic body in Bengaluru of which only 10 were demolished. Gupta said a probe will be undertaken by structural engineers into the collapse of the multi-storied building in Kasturinagar, in east Bengaluru, on Thursday, and that action will be taken on the basis of the report. “I think there is a need for a proactive approach, like the 15-20 year car policy, with regular checks on old and ageing buildings,” V Ravichandar, a Bengaluru-based urban infrastructure expert, told Hindustan Times. Experts also point out violations of building permits by builders that is often neglected or has the tacit approval of officials. “Because of the violations, the foundation of a building does not have the capacity to take the load,” Ravichandar said. “It is important to involve the community and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) for early identification of any signs of cracks or damage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-civic-body-will-finish-old-buildings-audit-in-15-days-101633722926045.html

Khattar had made the remark at a BJP Kisan Morcha meet, a video of which had surfaced on social media, with farmers bodies alleging that he was telling party supporters to “pick up sticks” against farmers protesting the Centre’s agriculture laws.Apparently referring to the agitation, Khattar had said, “Form groups of 500, 700, 1,000 farmers and make them volunteers. And then at every place, ‘sathe sathyam samacharet’. What does it mean--it means tit for tat (jaisa ko taisa).””Do not worry...when you remain there (in jail) for a month, three months or six months, you will become big leaders, your names will be etched in history,” he added.Withdrawing his remark on Friday, Khattar said it was publicised that he suggested “picking up sticks”.The statement had been “misconstrued”, he told reporters in Panchkula after paying obeisance at the Mata Mansa Devi temple on the occasion of Navratras.The remark had been made in the “context of self-defence” and not out of ill-intention towards anyone, Khattar said.“I want to tell my farmer brothers who are hurt that I am taking back my statement,” said Khattar, who was accompanied by Speaker Gian Chand Gupta.The CM further said he does not want any breach of peace or law and order problem in the state.“Everyone has a right to hold protest in a peaceful manner but only thing is that no one should cross the limit. No one should be harmed, vehicles should not be damaged,” he said.Khattar also said he won’t be attending a programme of the Aggarwal community in Kaithal as farmers have said they will oppose his visit.The protesting farmers have said they have no objection if a BJP leader from the community attends the event, the CM said.“Speaker Gian Chand Gupta will attend the event on my behalf,” he said.Khattar also said his government has been taking pro-farmer initiatives.Referring to reports of crop damage due to recent showers in parts of Haryana, Khattar said a special “girdwari” has been ordered to assess the extent of damage.

09-10-2021||India||Kerala to add backlog of 7,000 deaths to Covid toll||The Kerala government said on Friday that it will soon add a backlog of around 7,000 Covid-19 deaths, or old fatalities that had previously gone unreported or misreported, to its toll.The move, announced on Friday by state health minister Veena George, will result in a massive spike in the state’s Covid-19 death toll. She said these uncounted deaths occurred before hospitals started uploading data of such fatalities online before June this year. Till Friday night, a total of 26,072 people are reported to have lost their lives to the viral disease in the state. This number does not yet include the roughly 7,000 uncounted deaths that occurred between March 2020 and June 2021, according to government data.George also denied the Opposition charge that there were deliberate attempts to underplay the death rate to keep the state’s mortality rate low. “There was no deliberate attempt to exclude deaths of so many from the tally. We have been following ICMR guideline regarding Covid-19 deaths, but due to some technical glitches these deaths were left out. We will revise the list again,” the minister said while replying to an adjournment motion moved by the Opposition. The massive reconciliation will dent Kerala’s reputation as the state with one of the best case fatality rates (CFR) in the country – 0.5% against a national average of 1.5%. After the reconciliation is issued, this number is expected to rise to around 0.7%, data shows.Kerala reported 10,944 new cases on Friday after 95,510 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 11.45% – the highest in the country. With an active caseload of 116,645, the state remains, by far, the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in the country.Several other states such as Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, have all issued such statistical corrections to incorporate previously uncounted fatalities in their Covid-19 death tolls. Such exercises have not only pushed up the country’s death count in recent months, but also implied that the fatalities reported during the peak of the outbreak in the country were grossly under-reported.When the matter of unreported deaths came up in the state assembly on Friday, Opposition members insisted for an explanation and later walked out of the house. “The government did it deliberately to maintain its record on low mortality. The list is incomplete as many Covid deaths fail to figure in the list. Its public relations exercise fell flat. No government should have done such a disservice to its people,” said Congress leader VD Satheesan. He said the government was even denying the paltry relief to victims due to its indifferent attitude, a charge that the health minister rejected.Experts expressed the need for more transparency in reporting of such deaths. “The government is slowly admitting its mistakes. It has done a grave injustice to victims. We need more transparency and these measures should not be politicised,” said public health expert Dr SS Lal, who was earlier with the World Health Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-add-backlog-of-7-000-deaths-to-covid-toll-101633722446768.html
09-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Farm unions allege Uttar Pradesh police allowed main accused to flee||Farm unions on Friday alleged the Uttar Pradesh police went soft on the main accused of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni and “allowed him to abscond” after the October 3 incident in which eight people, including four farmers were killed. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella platform of the farm unions, cited the Supreme Court’s displeasure of the ongoing investigation and blamed police helping the main accused, Ashish Mishra. “The police allowed the prime accused to go missing by not acting immediately to arrested even though an FIR was filed,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, head of Haryana unit of Bharatiya Kisan Union. He said farmers would demonstrate against UP police in front of police stations.Notably, on Thursday, the state police arrested two of Mishra’s aides -- Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey -- and sent summons to Ashish Mishra to appear before it on Friday, after the Supreme Court’s order. However, Mishra failed to appear before the police. The minister, on Friday, reiterated that his son, who faces a murder case, was “innocent” and will appear before Uttar Pradesh Police on Saturday to record his statement.Eight people were killed on Sunday, including four farmers, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws started last year.The farmers alleged that the protestors were knocked down by a convoy of vehicles, one of which belonged to Mishra. However, the minister has denied all the charges.In a statement released on Friday, the SKM stated that the one-member judicial commission set up by the state government was not as per their demands and “does not instil confidence in farmers of the country”. “The UP government’s notification dated 6th October 2021, setting up the judicial commission of inquiry into Lakhimpur Kheri Farmers’ Massacre appears to have been put out due to the SC hearing on the matter apart from mounting public pressure,” reads the statement. The SKM has demanded the resignation of the Union minister. “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha demands that Uttar Pradesh government should immediately impose cases with murder charges against all those involved from the side of Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni. The Union MoS should be dismissed immediately,” Chaduni said on Friday. He said farmers would also organise protests across UP until the minister was dismissed. Chaduni said, “The Yogi Adityanath-led UP government was responsible for protecting the prime accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-farm-unions-allege-uttar-pradesh-police-allowed-main-accused-to-flee-101633721845572.html
09-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Yogi vows justice but says no arrests without evidence||Lucknow/Gorakhpur Amid growing pressure to arrest Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni’s son in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath asserted on Friday that justice would be done but no arrests will be made without sufficient evidence. Describing the October 3 violence, which claimed eight lives, as unfortunate, the chief minister said that no action will be initiated under any pressure. “There is no place for violence in democracy and when the law is giving guarantee to secure everyone, there is no need to take it into one’s hands, whosoever they be,” he told a news channel.On allegations that efforts are being made to shield the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, in the case, Adityanath said: “There will be no injustice with anyone. No one will be allowed to take the law in his hands but no action will be taken under any pressure.” “We will not arrest anyone on the basis of allegations. But yes, if someone is guilty, he will also not be spared, irrespective of who he is,” he said.The chief minister added that even “the Supreme Court has said that before arresting someone, we should have sufficient evidence against him”. Teni’s son Ashish Mishra, along with others, were booked on murder and other charges after a vehicle belonging to the Union minister allegedly mowed down four farmers during a protest against the agricultural laws on Sunday. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters, while a local journalist was also killed in the violence that ensued. Farmers maintain that Ashish was in the lead car that ran over people. The minister and his son have denied the latter’s alleged involvement in the incident.Earlier on Friday, Ashish failed to turn up at the crime branch office in Lakhimpur Kheri at 10 am for questioning, prompting the police to issue a fresh summon and warning of legal action if he does not appear again. “We did this all over the state.. We take action against someone whenever evidence is found.. Be it a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA or an Opposition MLA... We never hesitated in taking action… In Lakhimpur also, the government is doing the same thing,” he said. “A special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted by the government and a judicial commission has also been formed to probe the case… The arrests of those whose videos have come and involvement was confirmed have started,” he added. Former Uttar Pradesh CM and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday tweeted, “By doing the formality of sending summons to a named accused (of murder accused) by the UP government and administration has further increased public anger against the government.” Earlier in the day, Yadav said the minister’s son should have been arrested. Priyanka wields broom againMeanwhile, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday made a surprise visit to a Valmiki temple at Luv Kush Nagar in Lucknow and picked up a broom to clean it, hours after Adityanath’s dig at her act of sweeping of floor at a Sitapur guest house in detention.

09-10-2021||India||Son innocent, will appear before police today: MoS on Lakhimpur Kheri violence||Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra ‘Teni’ on Friday insisted that his son Ashish, who faces a murder case in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3, was “innocent” and will appear before police on Saturday to record his statement. The minister’s remarks came hours after police issued a second summon to his son, Ashish Mishra, who failed to turn up at the crime branch office in Lakhimpur Kheri at 10 am for questioning. Alleging that his son was unwell, Teni told reporters at Lucknow airport, “We have full faith in law. My son is innocent. He got a notice on Thursday but he said he was not well. He will appear before the police tomorrow and give his statement and evidence as he is innocent.” The developments came after Supreme Court was exceptionally harsh while commenting on the police’s lenient handling of Ashish Mishra, although it didn’t name him.The apex court said it was “not satisfied” with the action taken by the state government and sought to know why the accused was not arrested. Ashish, along with others, were booked on murder and other charges after a vehicle belonging to the Union minister allegedly mowed down four farmers during a protest against three central agricultural laws on Sunday. Two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters, said Ashish, while a local journalist was also killed in the violence that ensued. Farmers maintain that Ashish was in the lead car that ran over people. The minister and his son have denied the latter’s alleged involvement in the incident and said they were not at the spot. On Thursday night, the state police made their first arrests in the case by taking two people, Luvkush Rana and Ashish Pandey, into custody -- hours after the Supreme Court sought a report in this regard. Rana and Pandey are said to be associates of Ashish Mishra.On the Opposition’s demand for his resignation, Teni said, “Opposition can demand anything. This is a BJP government which works in an unbiased manner. Action will be taken against those found guilty.” The latest police notice to Ashish warned of legal action if he failed to appear before the probe team on Saturday. “The notice to Ashish was issued under Section 160 (police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses) of code of criminal procedure and he was asked to appear in person and present evidence that he is aware of about the incident. Ashish has failed to appear. We will now adopt other legal procedures,” Lakhimpur Kheri superintendent of police Vijay Dhull said. A police official, on condition of anonymity, said Ashish continued to remain untraceable as several reports suggested that he fled to Nepal. The official added that the accused’s last location was traced near Banbirpur village under Tikunia police station limits, somewhere near India-Nepal border. “The investigation committee headed by deputy inspector general, police headquarters, Upendra Agarwal and senior member of the committee Sunil Kumar Singh, a commandant at 10th battalion PAC, Barabanki, are discussing the next course of action,” the official said. A few reports also suggested that Ashish was planning to surrender before a local court on Saturday. Hitting out at the government, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said sending summons to the minister’s son for questioning was only a formality and insisted he should resign for an unbiased probe into the incident.“The government has woken up after the Supreme Court intervention. The minister should resign,” Yadav told reporters outside his residence in Lucknow before leaving for Bahraich to meet families of two farmers who were killed in the violence.“Otherwise, the officer who will be questioning him will have to first salute him and then interrogate him. Before leaving, the officer will have to again salute him due to his post,” he added. Internet services restartMeanwhile, internet services were restored in Lakhimpur Kheri on Friday, six days after they were suspended following violence in the district on Sunday. The services were restored for a few hours on Tuesday morning, but were again suspended the same day. Most markets, schools and other educational institutions were also opened in the district, including those closer to Tikunia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/son-innocent-will-appear-before-police-today-mos-ajay-mishra-on-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-101633720525383.html

He said it was never expected from a teacher and sought strict action against him.“We want action against the teacher for making such an irresponsible and highly communal statement. He can’t simply get away by making such a baseless statement,” the minister said, adding that the teacher later justified it in interviews with various news channels.Activists of the CPI(M)-backed Students Federation of India (SFI) took out protest rallies in many parts of the state on Friday.In a Facebook post, Pandey, a physics teacher of Kirorimal College in Delhi, wrote: “A college had to admit 26 students in a course having 20 seats only because they all had 100 per cent marks from the Kerala education board. For last few years Kerala board is implementing #marksjihad#.”Later he justified it saying he was only mentioning about the “improper paper evaluation system” in Kerala and has no plan to withdraw it or apologise. What angered the Left leaders is his justification that he did not differentiate between leftists and jihadis.“What do you mean by ‘love jihad?’ It means you start misusing love for spreading religion. This ‘marksjihad’ is when you misuse marks to spread leftist ideology. For me, leftists and jihadis are same. I don’t differentiate between them. Jihad has wider meaning, not just religion alone, which fits into this slot,” he told a Malayalam news channel justifying his position. Pandey is a member of the RSS-affiliated teachers’ body, National Democratic Teachers’ Front.Many academics, writers and leaders have decried his statement. In a series of tweets, Congress leader and writer Shashi Tharoor said the use of “jihad” as a synonym for any trend one doesn’t like “is exceeding all limits.” “Now a DU teacher has got attention by absurdly decrying ‘marksjihad.’ It is ridiculous. Kerala students scoring 100% have struggled against all odds to get to DU,” he tweeted.“It is part of the Sangh Parivar agenda. A well-planned strategy is on change the secular and democratic fabric of the country. It is sad, no action is taken against the teacher,” said CPI(M) Politburo member M A Baby, also former state education minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marks-jihad-kerala-minister-seeks-action-against-du-teacher-101633720406811.html
09-10-2021||India||Dowry death: Kerala HC rejects husband’s bail plea||KochiThe Kerala high court on Friday rejected the bail plea filed by a man who was arrested in connection with the death of his wife due to alleged dowry harassment.Vismaya, an Ayurveda medical student, was found hanging in the bathroom of her husband’s house at Sasthamkotta in Kollam district on June 21 this year. Her parents and brother had alleged torture and harassment by her husband S Kiran Kumar over dowry. Following the outrage over the woman’s death, Kiran, who was working as an assistant motor vehicle inspector, was dismissed from service.Dismissing Kumar’s bail plea, Justice M R Anitha observed that the petitioner has been charged with a grave crime of dowry death, which is a social evil.The court rejected his bail plea, accepting the prosecution argument that he was likely to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if he was granted bail.The Court also evaluated the nature of allegations against the petitioner and the gravity of accusation-- the death of his wife within 13 months of their marriage out of the cruelty and harassment in demand of dowry, which drove her to commit suicide-- before taking the decision.Kumar had been in jail ever since his arrest on June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dowry-death-kerala-hc-rejects-husband-s-bail-plea-101633719804651.html
09-10-2021||India||High court quashes charges against key accused in Kerala gold smuggling case||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala high court on Friday quashed the imposition of Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa) on Swapna Suresh, main accused in the gold smuggling case. Her mother had moved the court three months ago seeking quashing of the continuous detention of her daughter under Cofeposa. In her petition, Swapna Suresh’s mother said Cofeposa can be applied on habitual offenders and that the gold smuggling case was first case against her. A division bench of Justices A K Jayashankaran Nambiar and C P Mohammad Nias allowed the mother’s plea. Though Cofeposa was quashed, Swapna Suresh will remain in the judicial custody as many other cases are pending against her. The Customs probing the gold smuggling case had invoked provisions of the Cofeposa against two accused in gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, in October last year. Sooraj T E, counsel of Suresh’s mother, said the preventive custody under Cofeposa was “illegal, arbitrary and vitiated by improper application of mind”. He said usually habitual offenders will come under its ambit and Suresh was wrongly included in the list. Later the court overruled the customs department’s objections and quashed Cofeposa charges. The sensational gold smuggling case came to light in July 2020 after the seizure of 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in state capital. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency and it arrested Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bangaluru. Now a multi-agency team headed by the NIA is probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far. One of the alleged key funders of the smuggling racket, Rabins Hameed, was extradited from the UAE and another key suspect Faizal Fareed is still at large. The case invited enough embarrassment to the Left front government after the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. Later he was suspended and he secured bail from the High Court later. Though four central agencies (NIA, ED, DRI and Income Tax) are probing the case, other than initial arrests, investigation failed to make much headway, officials of the central agencies admit. Main beneficiaries and dispatchers are still at large and some politicians whose names cropped up in the course of investigation also remain untouched. The union and state governments locked horns several times over the case and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a first of its sort, alleging bid to implicate many senior leaders including CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the case. But later the HC had squashed the judicial commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-quashes-charges-against-key-accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-101633719745237.html
09-10-2021||India||TN police challenge IAF’s custody of flight lieutenant accused of rape on campus||Chennai: The Coimbatore city police have said that their department has filed a petition before the district court seeking custody of the flight lieutenant accused of raping his colleague and challenging a lower court’s order that handed him over to the Indian Air Force (IAF). After a 28-year-old woman officer filed a complaint to the IAF against the accused, she said was unhappy with the manner in which her case was handled, so she went to the Coimbatore city commissioner Deepak M Damor on September 20 to file an FIR against him. The All-Women’s Police Station in Coimbtaore’s Gandhipuram carried out preliminary enquiries, registered a case against the accused officer and arrested him on September 25. This was challenged by his counsel as well as representatives of the IAF who argued in the Additional Mahila Court that the local police have no jurisdiction in the case as the complainant and the accused belong to the armed forces and therefore subject to the Air Force Act, 1950. The lower court on September 30 ordered that the accused be handed over to the IAF custody allowing a court martial. “The investigation on the woman’s complaint is still with us. The case was not handed over,” said a senior police officer of the Coimbatore city police. The investigation officer of the case from the All-Women Police Station on Thursday filed a revision petition in the Court of Principal District and Sessions Judge against the order of Judicial Magistrate of the Additional Mahila Court handing over the accused to IAF. “The revision application is to set aside the order of the magistrate and to keep the accused in judicial custody. And subsequently to direct the judicial magistrate to pass orders on the police custody application,” the officer quoted above said.The contents of the appeal will be known only when it’s numbered by the court, said N Sundaravadivelu, counsel of the accused. “The police are incorrect to say that the case is not transferred and only the custody has been exchanged. When the court made the order under section 124 of the Air Force Act which is for the purpose of the investigation and enquiry, so the entire case stands transferred,” says Sundaravadivelu. He added that the process for the court of inquiry under the IAF is going on. He had previously argued that the court martial is the right authority to investigate the case. According to the woman’s FIR, she was sleeping in her room after taking medicines for her ankle injury when the accused entered and committed the crime on September 10. She also made a serious allegation that the IAF medical doctors subjected her to a two-finger test to examine rape which has been banned by the Supreme Court in 2013. Reacting to the allegations, during a customary media interaction, the Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari on October 5 said that no illegal two-finger test was conducted on the woman IAF officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-police-challenge-iaf-s-custody-of-flight-lieutenant-accused-of-rape-on-campus-101633719504557.html

The highest executive body of the party is also likely to address some of the questions related to the political turmoil in its Punjab unit, as demanded by G23 leaders earlier, the people cited above added. “The CWC meeting will take place but it is unclear when it will be held. The schedule is yet to be finalised,” two senior leaders told HT on condition of anonymity. The meeting is likely to focus on the farmers’ issues after party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited the kin of farmers who died after they were allegedly mowed down by a car belonging to Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3. With farmers alleging that Teni’s son, Ashish Mishra, was in the car that ran over the people, the Congress has demanded the sacking of the minister and the arrest of his son. Last month, senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had written to party interim chief Sonia Gandhi, seeking a CWC meeting to discuss the political situation in Punjab and Goa units as well as the “mass exodus” in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-may-meet-over-lakhimpur-clashes-internal-row-this-month-101633719030055.html
09-10-2021||India||Telangana assembly adopts resolution urging Centre for caste census||The Telangana state assembly on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution requesting that the Centre take up a caste-wise census of backward classes as part of the general census for 2021.The resolution was introduced by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao soon after the question hour. It was passed by the members cutting across parties through a voice vote.“Telangana Legislative Assembly, with a view to ensuring welfare of backward classes, urges the Central government that caste-wise census of backward classes be conducted while holding the general census for 2021,” the resolution said.KCR, as the chief minister is known, said the OBCs constituted nearly 50% of Telangana’s population. In the absence of an accurate census of the OBCs, the welfare schemes being implemented by the state were not reaching all sections.“It is necessary to maintain accurate statistics for taking up various welfare schemes for the uplift of the backward classes. Various political parties across the country also demanded caste-based census of OBCs and several state assemblies also passed resolutions in this regard,” he said.The chief minister first mooted the proposal during a debate in the state assembly on Monday. He demanded that the Centre take up enumeration of castes while taking up the nation-wide census.“I don’t understand why the Centre is refusing to take up the enumeration of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the country. It even submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court in this regard,” he pointed out, adding that the state assembly would adopt a resolution on caste-based census and send it to the Centre for necessary action.KCR also demanded that the Centre increase the percentage of reservations for Scheduled Castes in tune with their growing population.“The Centre has fixed a 15 per cent reservation for the SCs in education and employment at the national level as well as in the states. Over the years, the population of SCs has gone up considerably all over the country. Therefore, the Centre should also consider increasing the quota of the SCs,” he said.He said a Comprehensive Household Survey conducted in Telangana six years ago had revealed that there were 10.03 million families in the state, of which 1.82 million families belong to the Scheduled Castes, accounting for 17.53% of the total families.“The survey was six years old and the Dalit population in the state might have gone up substantially. Therefore, there is a need to increase the reservations for SCs in tune with the increase in their population,” KCR said.Meanwhile, the Telangana Backward Classes Commission welcomed the resolution urging the Centre to take up caste-based census.Commission chairman Vakulabharanam Krishnamohan said the demand for enumeration of OBCs across the country has been a long-pending one. Though the Centre took up the exercise in 2011, it did not disclose the details of the case-based census.“Supreme Court, high courts of various states and OBC commissions in several states also suggested to the Centre to take up caste-wise census and enumerate the OBCs based on their socio-economic conditions,” Krishnamohan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-assembly-adopts-resolution-urging-centre-for-caste-census-101633719028812.html
09-10-2021||India||Want to make helicopter a vehicle for common people: Scindia||Dehradun: Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Friday announced nine key decisions as part of the Centre’s new helicopter policy, under which dedicated hubs and corridors would be established to boost air connectivity, as he highlighted the plans to make “helicopter a vehicle of common people”.“A momentous day for India as we set out to expand helicopter operations with the following 9 key decisions,” Scindia stated during his speech at the third Helicopter Summit organised by industry body the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), in association with the Union civil aviation ministry and Pawan Hans Ltd.As part of the new policy, he added, the central government is going to put together a dedicated helicopter-acceleration cell in the Civil Aviation Ministry that will look at the helicopter industry’s issues and help instil ease of doing business. “It is going to be a resource that you can use to facilitate your growth,” he said.The new policy also exempts helicopter operators from landing charges or parking deposits.Officers of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) will engage with the helicopter industry stakeholders so that adequate training is given to all individuals regarding helicopter issues, he added.Under the new policy, an advisory group has been set up in the Civil Aviation Ministry to discuss any pain points of the industry. A booklet, titled Heli-Disha, was also inaugurated during the event to help district collectors understand all rules and regulations regarding helicopter operations. “This will ensure ease of operations at all levels”, he said. A centralised Heli-Seva portal will be upgraded to a level so that all permissions for a helicopter flight could be granted online. The government has also decided to build Heli-hubs in Mumbai, Guwahati, Delhi and HAL airport in Bengaluru. “As a beginning, we are going to start with three dedicated corridors for helicopters -- Juhu-Pune-Juhu, Mahalakshmi race course-Pune-Mahalakshmi racecourse and Gandhinagar-Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar,” Scindia said.He added that the ministry has identified 10 cities and 82 routes to develop helicopter corridors across the country, starting with six between Juhu and Pune; Malakshmi Race Course and Pune; Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad.To further strengthen the helicopter emergency medical services in India, heliports will be developed alongside three expressways (Delhi-Bombay, Ambala-Kotpuli and Ambala-Bhatinda-Jamnagar) to ensure timely evacuation and medical treatment for accident victims, he said. Scindia said Helicopter penetration is a priority in India and with this thought must come action. “This is epitomized by the Prime Minister’s actionable ideas, ways of thinking and working.” “We are trying to make helicopters a vehicle of common people. We aim to provide the best service when it comes to helicopters,” he added.Minister of State in the ministry of civil aviation and former chief of Army Staff Gen (Retd) VK Singh in his address said Helicopters are extremely effective in hilly areas with limited space. “We are trying to make it economically viable for the common people”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-to-make-helicopter-a-vehicle-for-common-peoplescindia-101633718725065.html
09-10-2021||India||Grant permanent commission to women officers with no pending issues: SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday told the Union government and Army to come back with orders granting permanent commission to those among the 72 women short service commission officers (WSSCO) who do not have any disciplinary or vigilance issues pending against them. Hearing the contempt petitions filed by the 72 officers who were declared unfit for permanent commission (PC), the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna directed the Army to segregate the names of those officers who face doubtful integrity or serious disciplinary issues. “You have to set your house in order,” the bench told army. Directing this exercise to be done by the next date of hearing on October 22, the court reminded the army that no additional factors could be introduced to deny PC under the March 25 order of the court that prescribed 60% marks based on their track record as decided by the Selection Board, medical fitness, and vigilance/disciplinary clearances. Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain said the 72 officers have been declared unfit as their service records show serious charges such as “disobedience of orders, lapses in government procurement, forging medical documents, poor work ethics, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct, poor performance in courses” that render them unfit under the Army Policies of 1983 and 2012. In June, the army filed a clarification application in the top court to know whether the judgment of the court requiring the women officers to clear the 60% merit benchmark and medical fitness will automatically mean they are fit for PC or the army can declare them unfit on the above issues of integrity and discipline. The application was dismissed on August 2 as “not maintainable” and the court directed the army to comply with its March 25 order. The bench said, “We are conscious of the fact that this is the Army. If there is a problem on vigilance or disciplinary grounds, you can remove them. But for the rest of the officers, come with order granting PC on the next date. If an officer has issues relating to vigilance/discipline, we make it clear we will not interfere.” It was only on September 28 the army had released the results of the 72 officers when it came to light that they had achieved the 60% threshold fixed by the court judgment. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing in the contempt petition, said, “The fact that these officers have been issued release orders shows that they do not face any discipline or vigilance issues. Now, there are new grounds being brought in to deny us PC.” The court reiterated, “All women officers who have attained 60% marks shall be entitled to PC, subject to medical fitness, disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The question is can there be supervening or additional factors to be considered beyond what the Court has stated. You wanted this but did not get this in your clarification application.” ASG Jain told the court that the Special No 5 Selection Board held in September 2020 that considered the grant of PC for these officers considered even their vigilance and disciplinary clearance. “We are willing to share the confidential records of each of the 72 officers to the Court to satisfy the grounds on which they were denied PC. These pertain to serious questions of integrity as per Army policies,” Jain said. It was the army’s claim that out of the 529 WSSCOs opting for PC, 514 fulfilled 60% marks criteria and 72 among them were held ineligible on other grounds. The army filed an affidavit explaining that all orders passed in the March 25 judgment were complied with. “We are not faulting you but we do not want to get behind our judgment and scrutinise each file. We have already undertaken a long exercise,” the bench said. The court directed Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for army, to scrutinise each case and examine where there are serious vigilance or disciplinary grounds to reject PC. “We would trust you as officers of the court to carry out this exercise,” the bench added. Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, who appeared in one of the contempt petitions, informed the court that the army has asked the 72 women officers to put in their papers or else their pension benefits will be withdrawn. The court said, “Tell your clients not to be anxious about these issues. We understand the feeling of humiliation they have suffered. Till the next date, hold your horses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grant-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-with-no-pending-issues-sc-to-centre-army-101633718305195.html
09-10-2021||India||India, US to discuss defence, Afghanistan crisis in slew of meetings||India and the United States are set to hold a series of meetings in the coming weeks that will take forward cooperation in key areas such as counter-terrorism, defence and the Indo-Pacific and help shape the response to the situation in Afghanistan.These meetings, including the 2+2 ministerial dialogue, are being scheduled against the backdrop of US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman’s remarks that the US does not see itself “building a broad relationship” with Pakistan.Defence secretary Ajay Kumar is expected to travel to the US this week for a meeting of the bilateral Defence Policy Group (DPG), people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The DPG is the highest body that oversees cooperation in areas such as exercises, defence technology, joint research and development and production, and military exchanges.The India-US joint working group on counter-terrorism is set to meet during October 26-28, and the two sides will also hold the bilateral homeland security dialogue and talks on designation of terrorist individuals and entities in the coming weeks, the people said.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is also expected to visit the US, and a meeting of the Trade Policy Forum, which is co-chaired by the US trade representative and India’s commerce minister, is on the cards. The 2+2 defence and foreign ministers’ dialogue is expected to be held in November though the dates are yet to be locked in, the people added.India will also participate in the Summit for Democracies to be hosted by the US during December 9-10.Speaking at a virtual event organised by the Ananta Centre on Thursday, Sherman highlighted the importance of the relationship with India for the US.“With so much that unites us, I truly believe that there is no challenge so great that the US and India cannot overcome it by working together,” she said.At the same time, she said she was travelling from India to Pakistan on the last leg of a four-nation trip for a “very specific and narrow purpose”.“We don’t see ourselves building a broad relationship with Pakistan and we have no interest in returning to the days of a hyphenated India-Pakistan. That’s not where we are, that’s not where we are going to be,” Sherman said. She indicated her visit to Pakistan was largely focused on the situation in Afghanistan, and the need to get the Taliban to deliver on their commitments.“But we all need to know what’s going on in Afghanistan, we all need to be of one mind in the approach to the Taliban. We all need to make sure that we have the capabilities that we need to ensure everybody’s security, including India’s of course,” she said.The frostiness in US-Pakistan relations was on display when Sherman was received by a mid-ranking official on her arrival at the Foreign Office in Islamabad. In marked contrast, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had personally received Taliban leaders during recent visits.US state department spokesperson Ned Price said Sherman and Qureshi had “discussed areas of bilateral cooperation, the importance of the US-Pakistan relationship and the way forward in Afghanistan” during their meeting. Sherman also “emphasised the importance of a coordinated approach to Afghanistan and other issues vital to regional stability”, Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-to-discuss-defence-afghanistan-crisis-in-slew-of-meetings-101633717944880.html
09-10-2021||India||Three convicted in rape case that shook Rajasthan||New Delhi: A court in Rajasthan on Friday convicted three people for the rape and suicide of a Dalit girl in a college in 2016 -- a case that had sparked widespread public anger and conversations on caste discrimination and women’s safety. The 17-year-old girl, the daughter of a primary school teacher in Rajasthan’s far-flung Barmer district, was found dead inside a water tank on the roof of her college. Her parents alleged that a teacher raped her, and accused the college authorities of trying to hide the crime by making her sign a statement defending the teacher. The district court in Rajasthan’s Bikaner district convicted Pragya Prateek Shukla, the principal of the college where the victim studied, his wife Priya Shukla, the warden of the hostel where the victim resided, and Vijendra Singh, the physical education teacher who raped the victim. “After five years, justice has been served, especially in a case involving a minor from an underprivileged community,” said the victim’s lawyer, Anwar Ahmed. Singh was convicted for abetment of suicide, abduction, rape, and under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Pragya Prateek Shukla and Priya Shukla were convicted for abetment of suicide and under the SC/ST and Pocso acts. A copy of the judgment had not been uploaded till the time of going to print. The lawyers for the convicted said that they will wait for the written order before deciding on appealing the conviction. The sentencing for the three was set for Monday. The maximum punishment they face is the death sentence.“According to us, there was no natural evidence to convict them. To maintain discipline in an institution, the management has to take some steps. Definitely we are considering appealing in the high court,” said Vivek Sharma, who represented the Shuklas. Singh’s lawyer, Raviratan Godara, refused to comment. THE CRIMEThe victim hailed from a remote village just a couple of kilometers from the India-Pakistan border, and was the first Dalit girl in the region to pursue higher education. She got admitted to a college roughly 400km away to pursue a Basic School Training Certificate and moved to stay in a hostel, according to case documents and police first information report (FIR) seen by HT, and corroborated by the victim’s lawyers. At the time, the girl was hailed as a model to be followed in the remote region and inspired many other girls to study, said her family.But in college, the young student started facing discrimination, the family told the police, after the principal and the warden of the hostel repeatedly made her clean teachers’ rooms, especially that of the physical education teacher Singh. She was in her second year when tragedy struck. On March 28, the victim’s father travelled from their village to the college to drop her off at the hostel around 11am at the end of the Holi vacation, according to the FIR. That night, around 8pm, she called him back.“She told me that the hostel warden Priya Shukla sent her to Vijendra Singh’s room on the pretext of cleaning it, and there he raped her. Later, he threatened to kill her if she told anyone,” the father told the police at the time. Around 8am the next morning, her body was found floating in the water tank of the building. “From the beginning, we wanted to hold the Shuklas accountable, along with Singh, for their role in making the minor victim sign a document that made the incident look like her fault,” said Anwar Ahmed, the victim’s lawyer. The documents in question – called “mafinama” in court records -- were two statements signed by the victim and Singh, respectively, and addressed to the principal and warden. The victim was forced to sign the document when she brought the rape to the attention of the principal and the warden, the family told police. “I made a mistake, and please forgive me for it,” said the coerced statement of the victim, who was allegedly forced to write it by the Shuklas. “Instead of supporting the victim (a minor and a Scheduled Caste girl), the accused Priya Shukla, the warden, and her husband Pragya Pratik Shukla, the principal, shamed her by forcing her to write an apology in the middle of the night. The accused were in a position of power (as in-charge of the institute), who misused their authority in contravention of the law,” said the written submissions made by the victim in court. THE TRIALThe case triggered uproar across the state, and put the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under pressure, with top Opposition leaders making a beeline for the remote border village where the victim’s family lived. But delays dogged the investigation, and trial finally began in Bikaner in 2017 – this meant that the victim’s father had to travel 400km from Barmer district for every court hearing.As the trial progressed, other challenges emerged, showed case documents and conversations with lawyers. At least 10 witnesses listed by the police turned hostile in court, dealing a blow to the prosecution. “Many of these witnesses were either students in the college or employees of the institution, and therefore were liable to be pressured by the accused at the time,” said Ahmed.Such problems in cases involving Dalits is common across India, and especially in Rajasthan, where roughly 50% of cases under the SC/ST Act don’t reach the charge sheet stage. This is the worst rate among major states, according to data by the National Crime Records Bureau.The victim’s lawyers, instead, focused on documentary and other evidence. They proved that on the night of the crime, there were only four people in the premises and accounted for all of them, and additionally proved that all gates were locked – meaning only Singh could have had access the girl’s hostel. They were also helped by the forensic laboratory report, which HT has a copy of, which showed that traces of semen were found on the victim’s clothes, bedspread and underclothes. The medical examiner also said that the victim’s body showed signs of recent forced intercourse. “What stood in our favour was that the victim’s roommate, who was also a minor, was the only major witness who didn’t turn hostile. She withstood all pressure to say that the victim told her that night that she was raped,” said Ahmed. In the five years between the crime and the conviction, a lot changed. A new government came into power and named the Dalit-dominated village, where the family lived, after the victim. The father, who was a vocal proponent of education for girls in the area, fell silent. And, many young women in the area stopped going away for higher education, stymied by the grisly crime and fearful families.This judgment, hope experts and activists, will change that. “This is a very important judgment given that cases involving Dalits fall through the cracks many times. It shows the importance of good legal representation and is a testament to the fighting spirit of the victim’s family,” said Anurag Bhaskar, a professor at Jindal Global Law School. “To us, it is a message to all girls who want to pursue education, that they need not fear,” said Ahmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-convicted-of-rape-that-shook-rajasthan-101633717483411.html
09-10-2021||India||Tatas bid 39% more than floor price for Air India; transaction likely to be completed by December||Tata Sons won the country’s flagship carrier Air India (AI) for ₹18,000 crore after bidding 39% higher than the reserve price and surpassing the offer by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh-led consortium by little more than 19%, the government announced on Friday, putting an end to a five-year struggle to privatise the debt-laden airline. The transaction is expected to be completed by December this year as the share-purchase agreement (SPA) was already agreed between the government and the bidder, disinvestment secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said. The financial bid, was submitted on September 15, was opened in presence of bidders on September 29 and after due process, an empowered ministerial panel -- Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) – on October 4 (Monday) approved the highest price bid of Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, for the sale of government’s 100% equity shares in AI, Pandey said. AISAM is headed by home minister Amit Shah. finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, commerce minister Piyush Goyal and civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia are its members. In line with the approved procedure for strategic disinvestment, a reserve price was fixed after the receipt of sealed financial bids for the transaction, based on valuation using methodologies as per the established process, Pandey said. After the reserve price was fixed, the sealed financial bids were opened in the presence of the bidders. Talace Pvt Ltd quoted an enterprise value of ₹18,000 crore, while consortium led by Ajay Singh quoted an EV of ₹15,100 crore, he said. The reserve price was ₹12,906 crore. “The transaction does not include non-core assets including land and building, valued at ₹14,718 crore, which are to be transferred to government-owned special purpose vehicle (SPV) Air India Asset Holding Ltd (AIAHL), he said. According to Pandey, the successful bidder (Tatas) will take over debt worth ₹15,300 crore and the rest, ₹46,262 crore, will go to government-owned SPV, AIAHL. This remaining debt will have sovereign guarantee. Consequent to the acquisition, the Tatas will own 100% stake in Air India as well as its subsidiary Air India Express Ltd (AIXL), and 50% in the joint venture Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt Ltd (AISATS), a Tata Group statement said. AIXL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, operates an eponymous low-cost carrier and is headquartered in Kochi. AISATS is a 50:50 joint venture between AI and SATS Ltd, providing ground handling services and food solutions. “This is a historic moment, and it will be a rare privilege for our Group to own and operate the country’s flag bearer airline. It will be our endeavour to build a world-class airline which makes every Indian proud. On this occasion, I would like to pay tribute to JRD Tata, pioneer of Indian aviation, whose memory we cherish,” Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said. Through this acquisition, the Tatas will get ownership of iconic brands like Air India, Indian Airlines and the Maharajah, the company said in a statement. Air India has a fleet of 117 wide-body and narrow body aircrafts and AIXL has a fleet of 24 narrow body aircrafts. Air India also has a frequent flyer program with more than 3 million members.According to the government, AI is one of the most extensive flight service providers in India with network coverage of 98 destinations (56 domestic destinations with around 2,712 departures per week and 42 international destinations with around 450 departures per week) as of November 1, 2019. AI offers 75 additional destinations through its secondary network of code share operations covered under 25 agreements with foreign carriers. During FY2019, AI carried around 22.1 million passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tatas-bid-39-more-than-floor-price-for-air-india-transaction-likely-to-be-completed-by-december-101633717482883.html
09-10-2021||India||Maharaja boards return flight||Air India will return to the Tata Group, where it was born as India’s first air service 89 years ago, marking the end of an era in which India ran a national carrier from shortly after Independence, but also the start of a new chapter that could end years of taxpayer-funded life support that kept the airline afloat.Tata Sons, the holding company for the autos-to-steel Tata conglomerate, will pay ₹18,000 crore for a 100% stake in Air India, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, said at a briefing on Friday.The bid amount includes Tata’s taking on of about ₹15,300 crore of the national flag carrier’s ₹61,562 crore debt. The remaining will be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Limited (AIAHL), Pandey added. AIAHL is a special purpose vehicle formed by the government.Also Read| Tatas bid 39% more than floor price for Air IndiaThe deal is a big boost for the government’s disinvestment drive, as well as its financial books – it will fetch the Centre ₹2,700 crore in cash in addition to the debt that will now be offloaded. In the 2021 financial year, which was battered by the pandemic, the airline is estimated to have lost ₹27 crore a day.“Air India’s return to the Tata group marks a new dawn for the airline! My best wishes to the new management, and congratulations to DIPAM secretary and the civil aviation ministry for successfully concluding the difficult task of paving a new runway for the airline to take off!” civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Twitter on Friday.“I hope the airline will continue to deliver on its mission of bringing people closer through its successful operations,” he added.The airline’s current fortunes are far removed from its storied early years. Established by JRD Tata, who was India’s first licensed pilot, the airline originally flew mail in the 1930s between Karachi, in then-undivided British-ruled India, and Bombay, now Mumbai.It soon turned commercial, began to fly domestic and international destinations, and was taken over when the government nationalised the sector in its entirety in 1953. JRD Tata would continue to steer the carrier – and its domestic wing Indian Airlines which was hived off after the government takeover – for 25 years, without accepting a salary, until a messy dismissal in 1978 when the then Morarji Desai-led government appointed retired Air Chief Marshal Pratap Chandra Lal as the chairman for both airlines.“Welcome back, Air India,” Ratan Tata, JRD Tata’s successor and chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, said in a tweet on Friday. “On an emotional note, Air India, under the leadership of Mr JRD Tata had at one time gained the reputation of being one of the most prestigious airlines in the world,” Ratan Tata added.Also Read| ‘Big challenge, as well as strong potential in future’: Ratan Tata on AI bidIn the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Air India led the charge of the world’s aviation boom. Those were the golden years for air travel — still considered a luxury and a novelty, not a chore — and Air India’s service, replete with champagne and (for a lucky few first-class passengers) porcelain ashtrays designed by Salvador Dali, was legendary. Its advertising was equally famous; its hoardings in Mumbai (then Bombay) used to make headlines at one time. And even into the 1980s and 1990s, the airline was profitable.But the advent of private carriers in mid 1990s, a rush of low-cost, no-frills airlines in the mid-2000s, an ill-advised merger (with Indian Airlines), and poor management, Air India lost its edge in both domestic and international markets. The carrier, known for its Maharaja mascot, began to bleed money.Air India hasn’t turned a profit since its 2007 merger with Indian Airlines.An empowered ministerial panel — Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) — on October 4 approved the highest price bid of Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, for the sale of government’s 100% equity shares in AI, Pandey said.AISAM is headed by Union home minister Amit Shah. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, commerce minister Piyush Goyal and civil aviation minister Scindia are its members.The government first announced a plan to sell a part of Air India in 2018, when in March it said it wanted to offer a controlling stake of 76%. In June, having received no interest from bidders, it shelved the plan.In December 2019, it revised the plan, offering 100% stake and flexible debt assumption terms. On September 15, the finance ministry said it received two bids.Tata Sons and SpiceJet chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said they were among the bidders. “I congratulate the Tata Group on winning the bid for Air India and wish them all the success. It was my honour and privilege to be shortlisted for bidding for Air India,” Singh said on Friday after the winning bid was announced.For Tata Group, Air India adds a third airline to its stable – it already holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd. It will also fetch the company the prized landing and parking slots. At present, Air India has control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas such as London’s Heathrow.“While admittedly it will take considerable effort to rebuild Air India, it will hopefully provide a very strong market opportunity to the Tata Group’s presence in the aviation industry,” Ratan Tata said in his statement.The airline has a 172-strong aircraft fleet at present, with 128 in the Air India colours, 25 that make up the Air India Express fleet and 19 in service for Alliance Air.The fleet is a mix of narrow body and wide body jets from Boeing and Airbus, configured differently so that it can fly routes as short as Jammu and Srinagar (a distance of 123km) and as long as Delhi-San Francisco (15,300km in the trans-Pacific route).“This is a major development which will have positive impact on investors’ sentiment and bail out the government from losing taxpayers’ money every day, which accumulated to a total debt of ₹61,562 crore as on August 31. Tatas have both experience and passion to turn it around. It is a prudent decision which will help the Maharaja regain its lost glory,” said Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharaja-boards-return-flight-101633717346797.html
09-10-2021||India||Virtual hearings cannot be a norm: Supreme Court||Virtual courts cannot become the norm as this would envisage that the building in which we sit should be closed, the Supreme Court observed on Friday, expressing its strong reservations on a petition that asked for continuation of virtual court hearings as a matter of fundamental right.“It is one thing to demand live telecast of court proceedings, and quite another to say that when Covid is receding, people need not come to courts and instead continue with virtual hearing,” the bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said.The bench, however, went ahead to issue notice to the Union government, pointing out that the court will take up the petition after four weeks along with a similar plea filed earlier by a group of lawyers.The court on Friday was hearing a petition by National Federation of Societies for Fast Justice, an advocacy NGO that campaigns for judicial reforms, along with former Central Information Commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi and former Mumbai Police Commissioner Julio Ribeiro.The petition, drafted by lawyer Siddharth R Gupta, also wants the top court to bar high courts from discontinuing virtual court hearings without the Supreme Court’s approval, pointing out that high courts of Uttarakhand and Gujarat have already issued orders to this effect on August 10 and 16, respectively.“For more than 70 years, we all understood courts to function physically. It was in view of Covid-19 pandemic that we thought that courts should continue to function and developed this new system of virtual hearing of cases. But virtual courts cannot become a norm as courts have to function physically when normalcy gets restored. The result of seeking virtual hearing as a norm is to envisage that the building where we sit should be closed down.”Senior lawyer Manoj Swarup, appearing for the petitioners, said virtual courts allowed litigants to address the courts and get justice at a very cheap cost. “They also have the advantage of engaging a lawyer of their choice and all this promotes access to justice which no system of governance can ignore,” Swarup said, urging the bench to allow the option of virtual courts to continue.The bench wondered what would happen to the provisions in Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) which talk about open courts and open justice, referring to the 18th century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham who advocated for courts to be open for the public to enhance public confidence in the justice delivery system.The top court also countered a suggestion that physical court hearings put people living in remote areas at a disadvantage since they have to travel all the way to Delhi for hearings.“Nobody in remote areas is being denied access to justice. There is only a small percentage of cases that reach the Supreme Court from trial courts. Litigants already have the facility to approach those courts. If we allow virtual courts that will be sounding the death knell for physical functioning of courts,” the bench remarked, and asked Swarup if there was any study to back up its argument.The petition referred to findings of the Supreme Court E-Committee which propagated virtual courts as the most accessible, affordable, transparent, and cheap mode of justice available to litigants of the country, especially those coming from the marginalized sections.The bench referred to the standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the Supreme Court on Thursday, by which virtual hearing of cases would be discontinued on two days in a week beginning October 20. “So, you want us to set aside that SOP also,” the bench told Swarup, stating that it is a huge challenge the top court is facing to resume physical functioning.“You ponder over how physical courts have to resume after normalcy returns. We started a hybrid hearing in the Supreme Court, but lawyers are not coming to court. What norms can be laid down; we can think over it at the next date of hearing.”At one point, the bench questioned whether this petition was driven by the interest of lawyers. “You want this happy option to remain so that lawyers can argue from Mussoorie, Shimla or London,” the bench remarked, to which Swarup responded saying this petition is by citizens who genuinely feel that keeping the option of videoconferencing open is in the interest of access to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virtual-hearings-cannot-be-a-norm-supreme-court-101633717287679.html
09-10-2021||India||Protect EWS students’ right to e-learning, SC tells states||The digital divide due to online teaching has produced stark consequences with underprivileged children forced to discontinue their studies or, worse, drop out, the Supreme Court lamented on Friday as it urged the Centre and states to put together a “realistic and lasting solution” for protecting the right to receive online education of children belonging to economically weaker sections (EWS).“The states must come out with a plan, otherwise there will be massive dropouts and as a result, there will be dangers of child marriage, child labour and child trafficking. Threat is so grave that the State has to act quickly and take this with utmost seriousness, and come out with some kind of policy to make sure children continue in schools,” observed a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna.“It is heart-rending that on one hand we are merging children belonging to EWS and DG with other children in good schools but on the other, how do we get the laptops and tablets for their parents who could be drivers or house maids. There is a real and grave threat of dropout of children because of lack of resources like devices and connectivity,” added the bench.“If Article 21A (right to free and compulsory education between the age and 6 and 14) is to become a reality, the needs of children from the underprivileged section to receive online education cannot be denied,” asserted the court.The bench was dealing with an appeal by a group of private unaided schools against a Delhi high court order that directed these schools in the national capital to provide free gadgets and internet connections to poor students for online classes and claim reimbursement from the Delhi government.The Delhi government and the Centre have also filed appeals against this judgment.The concerns of the top court have come two days after a report released by the Union education ministry said that 29.6 million school students do not have access to digital devices, as per data collected from 24 states and Union territories (UTs) until June. The numbers could be higher. Seven states and UTs, including the densely populated Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, have not submitted the data.Representing NGO Justice For All, advocate Khagesh B Jha cited before the bench the government’s report, containing startling numbers that highlighted the extent to which students have been disadvantaged over the past year and a half when almost all education has been online in the shadow of the Covid pandemic. The high court order on September 18 had come on a petition by the NGO.Agreeing with Jha, the bench said that it is a “crucial issue involving young citizens of India who could be deprived of their right to free and compulsory education under the RTE Act due to a lack of resources”.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, who appeared for the private schools, said that the issue is complex as they cannot go on burdening parents of general category children if the Centre and states throw their hands in the air.The court found merit in Divan’s submissions. “Mr Divan is right that we can’t burden private schools with everything. They will cross-subsidise it with other parents. But it is not like parents not belonging to EWS can pay for everything. What is the Delhi government doing? They should have a plan of action,” it said. On his part, the Delhi government counsel replied that financing the devices and internet are the chief issues.At this, the court said that it will record its concerns in the order and would request the Chief Justice of India to list all the petitions on these issues as soon as possible so that “a practical solution can be found” while it expects “the central government and state governments to take up the matter in close coordination on an immediate basis and come out with a realistic and practical solution.”Asking the Delhi government to come out with a plan to achieve the salutary purpose of the RTE Act, the court said in its order that “the need to provide adequate computer-based equipment together with access to online facilities for the EWS/DG children is of utmost importance”.The education ministry’s data, which was released on Wednesday and is a part of a report titled “Initiatives by school education sector in 2020-21 for continuing teaching and learning”, is the first set of official statistics on the digital divide.As reported by HT on October 7, of the 29 million, 14 million are from Bihar, with the number translating into 58% of total students in the state. This is followed by 3.2 million from Jharkhand, which is 43% of total student strength in the state; 3.1 million from Karnataka, 27% of the total strength of students in the state; 3.1 million from Assam, 44% of students in the state; and 1.75 million from Tamil Nadu, which is 14.5% of total student strength in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protect-ews-students-right-to-e-learning-sc-tells-states-101633717178391.html
09-10-2021||India||Denmark PM to meet PM Modi on climate change ahead of COP 26||New Delhi: Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday and the two sides will review the Green Strategic Partnership and discuss collaborations on climate change mitigation ahead of the Glasgow (COP 26), people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity.A joint statement, spelling out how the two countries will collaborate on climate change, is expected at the end of the meeting.“The Green Strategic Partnership guides the discussion on how to meet the climate challenges, and how to turn words into action,” said Freddy Svane, Denmark’s ambassador to India, adding that it will be the “greenest summit”.On Thursday, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the Danish PM’s visit, beginning Saturday, is “very important” as it is the first head of state or head of government level visit since the onset of Covid-19 pandemic.Frederiksen and Modi co-chaired a virtual summit between India and Denmark on September 28 last year, following which a joint statement was issued, stating that the green strategic partnership was a mutually beneficial arrangement to advance political cooperation, expand economic relations and green growth, create jobs and strengthen cooperation on addressing global challenges and opportunities; with focus on an ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.“India and Denmark agree to be at the forefront in the global fight against climate change. Both countries have set very ambitious national targets on climate and energy that will contribute to an ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement. Together, the two countries will show the world that delivering on ambitious climate and sustainable energy goals is possible,” the joint statement had said. The partnership has four tracks—climate, energy, water, and green financing.“There will be talks on taking the partnership to the next level. One of the key areas will be climate finance. In 2009, when we (Denmark) hosted COP 15 in Copenhagen, developed countries had made a commitment to mobilise $100 billion for developing countries by 2020 for climate mitigation and adaptation. We are quite far from that goal still. But the PM (Frederiksen) has said Denmark is committed to delivering its commitment to finance. We will honour our commitment and hopefully, the rest of the world will follow,” a senior official from Denmark said on Friday. said during an informal press briefing on Friday on the eve of Frederiksen's three-day visit.“Denmark stands out as an example and proves we can fight climate change and at the same time expand our economy. Our economy has grown from the early 1980s to double its size. Our energy consumption has been more or less stable,” the official added.Denmark’s energy minister Dan Jorgensen visited India last month when he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principal secretary PK Mishra, power minister RK Singh and environment minister Bhupender Yadav. One of the main areas of partnership for Jorgensen was setting up an offshore clean and wind energy hub in Tamil Nadu of about 1 gigawatt (GW).“All eyes are on India. If India really wants to consolidate its role in climate change mitigation, it will enhance its NDC (Nationally determined contributions). India is already in a good place with its expansion in renewable energy. It has sought more financing from the developed world which I support. We need strong NDCs from big emitters to keep the 1.5 degrees target alive. The IPCC has already made it clear that all countries will need to transition to net zero at some point,” Jorgensen had said following his meeting with Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/denmark-pm-mette-frederiksen-to-meet-pm-modi-on-climate-change-ahead-of-cop-26-101633690390716.html
09-10-2021||India||Lalu Prasad among RJD’s star campaigners for by-polls||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, who was released on bail this year after serving four years in prison following his conviction in cases related to the multi-crore fodder scam, was listed as one of the star campaigners for the party’s nominees ahead of the by-elections to Tarapur and Kusheshwarsthan assembly seats on October 30. The names of his son, Tej Pratap Yadav and daughter, Misa Bharti are missing from the list.The list of 20 RJD star campaigners was submitted to the Election Commission of India on Thursday. State RJD president Jagdanand Singh said the omission of names of Prasad’s family members had nothing to do with Tej Pratap Yadav’s outbursts. He said the campaigners have been chosen considering the social composition of the constituencies so that the party could connect with the voters more effectively. “ We have picked leaders for the campaigning who have been regularly working in these two constituencies and have a connect with the electorate so that the party does well,” Singh said.Prasad’s name tops the list followed by Tejashwi Yadav and Abdul Bari Siddiqui, the RJD’s national principal general secretary. The name of former chief minister and Lalu’s wife Rabri Devi is also missing from the list.Siddiqui said Prasad has approved the list. The 20 names in the star campaigner list include Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, Abdulbari Siddiqui, Jayprakash Narayan Yadav, Uday Narayan Chaudhary, Shyam Rajak, Bhola Yadav, Tanveer Hassan, Trishan Patel, Lalit Kumar Yadav, Manoj Kumar Jha, Bharat Mandal, Ram Kumar Sahani, Alok Kumar Mehta, Shiv Chandra Ram, Lovely Anand, Chandrahas Chaupal, Bharat Bind, Ramvraksh Sada, Anil Kumar urf Sadhu Paswan.RJD leader Bhola Yadav said Prasad is expected to address a few election meetings on October 25 and 26 and return to New Delhi. He added all will depend on Prasad’s health condition.Tej Pratap Yadav and Bharti were the star campaigners for the party in the 2020 assembly polls. Earlier this week, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwary said Tej Pratap Yadav, who has alleged Prasad was being kept “hostage” in New Delhi, was not in the party as he has formed his own outfit, Chhatra Janshakhti Parishad. Tej Pratap Yadav and Misa Bharti could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Chief minister Nitish Kumar and Janata Dal (United) president , whose party seeks to retain both the seats, has accused Prasad of steering the RJD’s election campaign from the jail during the 2020 assembly elections. Taking potshots over Prasad’s planned campaigning, he said, ”He (Lalu Prasad] used to run his party and plan election drives sitting in the jail.” Bharatiya Janata Party leader Nikhil Anand said Tej Pratap Yadav’s omission suggests he has been ousted from the party. He added there is a clear indication that Bharti would not get another Rajya Sabha term. “It is also unfortunate that state president Jagdanand Singh’s name is also missing. It shows how senior leaders are just being side-lined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalu-prasad-among-rjd-s-star-campaigners-for-by-polls-expected-to-electioneer-after-years-101633673469101.html
