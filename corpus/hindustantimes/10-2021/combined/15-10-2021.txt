The accused are Amandeep Kaur of Takhtupura village, her father Gurbachan Singh and a relative, Amarjit Singh of Sekha Wala Chowk of Moga. The complainant, Jagmohan Singh of Sardarpura village of Sidhwan Bet, said initially he was supposed to marry Amarjit’s daughter, Jaspreet Kaur, on March 28, 2010. However, on the day of the marriage he was told that Jaspreet was nowhere to be found and that she had run away. He was asked to marry his niece, Amandeep, instead. He was told that she had passed Class-12. Later, he was told that she had passed Class 8 and was shown a certificate, which was found to be fake. Jagmohan said after their marriage Amandeep started saying that she would leave him in a couple of months. “On June 20, 2011 Amandeep’s mother took her to their house, saying that she would return in a day or two, but she did not return. Later, we found that she had taken all her jewellery and clothes and was refusing to return,” said Jagmohan.“In 2014, I filed a complaint with the child and women cell, but she did not return. Later, I found that she was illiterate and the certificate produced by her parents was fake. When I objected, her parents threatened to file a dowry harassment case and demanded ₹15 lakh,” he said, adding that he was hoodwinked into marrying an illiterate woman as they could not find a match for her. Inspector Bikramjit Singh, Sidhwan Bet station house officer, said a case had been registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 ( use a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hoodwinked-into-marrying-an-illiterate-woman-ludhiana-man-files-fir-after-11-years-101634322359989.html

This is the first time that the district has not been able to meet a state-given target during a mega vaccination drive.During the three-day mega vaccination drive, 62,254 beneficiaries were inoculated--36,233 were administered the first dose and 26,021 were administered the second dose of the vaccine.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram district, said, “Due to the festive season, many people in the district were not willing to take the vaccine as they were fasting. Due to this, the pace of vaccination pace was slow in the district. This is the first time that Gurugram has not been able to meet its vaccination target, but we are continuously working to vaccinate as many people as possible to develop herd immunity.”District officials also said that many residents wanted to avoid the vaccine’s side effects, such as fever, and hence they did not get vaccinated during the festive season.So far, Gurugram has always topped the state vaccination rankings--it was the first district to have fully vaccinated its eligible population with the first dose.The district health department had planned to inoculate at least 80% of the eligible population with both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by Dussehra, and 85% of the eligible population with both doses by Diwali. So far, 68% of the eligible population in the district has been vaccinated with both doses. Until last week, 64.5% of the eligible population in the district had been administered both doses of Covid-19 vaccines.Earlier this month, the Centre issued vaccination targets to all states so they could administer a total of 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses this month. India is likely to reach the milestone by October 18 or 19.In Gurugram, over 3.37 million beneficiaries have been vaccinated so far. On Friday, vaccination did not take place at government sites across the district due to the festival of Dussehra.On Saturday, vaccination will continue at 129 centres across the district, officials said. The first and second doses of Covishield will be administered at 122 sites and the second dose of Covaxin will be administered at five centres.

15-10-2021||Mumbai||Pankaja Munde to Maha BJP: Stop saying we’ll return to power, start working for people||Bharatiya Janata Party’s national secretary and prominent Other Backward Class (OBC) leader Pankaja Munde, in her annual Dussehra rally, advised her party colleagues to stop saying every day that they will return to power soon and instead work for the people of Maharashtra. She also took dig at her detractors from within the party saying that they will not be able to put roadblocks in her way for long.Munde, who is disgruntled with the party for being sidelined by the leaders at state level, addressed a huge Dussehra rally at Savargaon in Beed on Friday.She was joined by Ahmednagar Member of Parliament (MP) Sujay Vikhe Patil, her younger sister and Beed MP Pritam Munde and a number of BJP legislators from central Maharashtra. In an emotional appeal to the locals, especially voters from her Wanjari community, Munde said that her entire life was for them.Munde avoided hitting out directly at the state leaders from within BJP like she had been doing of late, but advised the state unit to avoid talking about collapse of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government every day. “Every leader from the opposition rises up each day and gives a new date to say that our government will soon come to the power. Then the leaders from the ruling parties get up and say their combine will complete the five-year term and their government is stable. Both the sides should stop indulging in the tug-of-war over stability of the government. This should not be your motive [forming the government], people are not interested in it. They want to know what you’re doing for them. The political parties should concentrate on the welfare of the people,” she said.Munde said her father and former deputy chief minister (CM), late Gopinath Munde, had left no stone unturned (in the early 1990s) to dislodge the then Congress government on the issue of criminalisation of politics.The former state minister, who is locked in a cold-war with ex-CM and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, also took a dig at her detractors from within the party. “….main sagar se gahairi hun kitne kankar tum fekoge, tum kab tak mujhe rokoge…”she uttered in Hindi to iterate that she is determined in her resolve and it was not possible to stop her for long. Munde is believably unhappy as she feels that party’s state leaders such as Fadnavis and Maharashtra unit chief Chandrakant Patil have been deliberately cutting her to size over the past few years. Munde believes that her defeat in the 2019 Assembly poll was “sponsored by people from within the party”. Other OBC leaders in the party are being promoted to reduce her importance despite she being the OBC face of BJP. Ignoring the contention of her younger sister, the party leadership inducted Bhagwat Karad, another OBC face, as Union minister and it had been like rubbing salt on the wound for Mundes.She also hit out at her cousin and social justice minister Dhananjay Munde without naming him and said the people of Beed are unhappy with his performance. Dhananjay, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, had defeated Munde in last Assembly elections and is now a minister in MVA government. She said Dhananjay has failed as a minister and his department is being by someone else. She also attacked MVA government and said that the three ruling parties – Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – are busy making each other happy by leaving the people of the state to suffer. “The recent package announced for the flood affected-people of central Maharashtra is inadequate. Nothing is done for the general public. Crimes against women are on the rise and women are unsafe. We expect a lot from CM Uddhav Thackeray,” she said.She also announced not to accept garlands if Marathas are given the reservation back and not wear a feta (headgear) until OBC reservation is restored.Dhananjay, while replying to her remarks against him and the state government, said, “People of Maharashtra know what Pankaja Munde has done when she was the minister. If she thinks the package given for the flood-affected people is inadequate, she should pursue the issue with the Centre and announce a special package from the Central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pankaja-munde-to-maha-bjp-stop-saying-we-ll-return-to-power-start-working-for-people-101634319719868.html

15-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police provides security cover to NCB zonal director||The Mumbai Police have increased the security cover of Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of the narcotics control bureau (NCB) soon after he complained to Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey that some people have been following him. As per the written complaint given by Wankhede, the Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale has ordered a probe and an additional commissioner of police rank level officer has been given the task to conduct an investigation and submit a report.Wankhede claimed in his complaint that two people were following him on Monday when he visited Oshiwara to pray at his mother’s grave. The agency even submitted the evidence including CCTV footage of him being followed, said an NCB officer. The agency claims that they are suspecting that the Mumbai Police were following Wankhede in plain clothes. Sources in the agency said, “Four armed guards have been provided to Wankhede for his security. Earlier he was using a sedan car, now his official vehicle has been changed to an SUV.” Wankhede has been investigating several high-profile cases including the cruise drug bust case, in which he arrested actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and several others. Earlier he had arrested actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother and several drug suppliers in the alleged drug connection linked to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Wankhede had also arrested NCP leader and minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law in a drug case from the Bandra area in January, this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-provides-security-cover-to-ncb-zonal-director-101634319299889.html

15-10-2021||Mumbai||Plea of CFO of Nirav Modi’s company rejected by special court in Mumbai||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Thursday rejected a plea filed by former chief financial officer (CFO) of Nirav Modi’s company Firestar Diamonds International Private Limited for cancellation of a look-out-circular issued against him. The court observed that the investigation is still ongoing, the agency has found the prima facie, role of the present applicant in committing huge fraud. The court said the look-out-circular in the matter is not issued by this court and has been issued by the investigating authority, so this court does not have any inherent jurisdiction to cancel the same.Ravi Shankar Gupta, 53, a resident of Noida, Uttar Pradesh had approached the court in a plea to cancel the circular issued by CBI against him. However, special CBI judge AS Sayyad rejected the plea of Gupta and disposed of his application. Sajal Yadav who argued for Gupta had told the court, “That the applicant is not related in any manner with Nirav Modi. He was appointed as the CFO of the accused company in August 2016. Prior to working with Firestar, he worked with another company. He terminated his employment with Firestar, the moment he came to know about the alleged PNB fraud and is a reputed professional for the past 26 years. He was shocked and surprised to learn about the look-out circular issued by the CBI against him, due to which he is prevented from travelling outside India and carry work.”Yadav further told the court, “The CBI had registered a case for conspiracy, cheating and under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, wherein the applicant was named as accused number 2. They alleged that the accused persons entered into a criminal conspiracy pursuant to which the Punjab National Bank, Brady House branch, Mumbai was cheated to the tune of ₹321 crores. The agency has already carried out a search at my house on March, 7, 2018, and found nothing incriminating. I have cooperated with the investigators and have appeared before the agency more than 31 times, the CBI very fairly did not arrest me. It’s more than three years of investigations and they have not filed a charge sheet yet.”The application was opposed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Counsel Sumedh Wankhade.Wankhade told the court, “There was a criminal conspiracy pursuant to which PNB was cheated. The two companies Firestar International Limited and Firestar Diamonds International Private Limited has been sanctioned credit limits by banks under consortium arrangements. In the matter of limits sanctioned to Firestar International Limited, Punjab National Bank is the lead bank and in the matter of limits sanctioned to Firestar Diamond International Private Limited, Union Bank of India is the lead bank. The bank has found that there were fraudulent transactions with these companies and firms. As per allegations in these complaints shows the intention of the accused was to cheat a consortium of banks as a whole. Gupta was CFO of Firestar International Limited and was in a key position. The investigations are still on, there is every likelihood that the applicant might fly away if the LOC against him is cancelled. This court is not having jurisdiction to cancel LOC issued during investigations, the same is applicable only if LOC is issued during the trial. The issuance of LOC is purely an executive action, to secure the presence of a suspect. Since the court is not vested with any inherent powers the application cannot be entertained. The prosecution prays for rejection of the application.”Wankhade further argued, “That the accused is a key person working for the main accused who defrauded the banks in multiple crores. The accused was working on a key post for the main accused, an investigation is still going on and in the investigations, there is the involvement of this accused.”The court while rejecting the plea observed that in this case, it appeared that the investigation was still ongoing. While investigating the officer has found prima facie involvement of the present accused in committing huge fraud. In pursuant to the said involvement of the applicant the investigating officer has issued the LOC, the LOC is not issued by the court but it was issued by the officer. Charge-sheet against the accused is yet to be filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/plea-of-cfo-of-nirav-modi-s-company-rejected-by-special-court-in-mumbai-101634319119896.html
15-10-2021||Mumbai||Max temperature touches 36.4 degrees Celsius, Mumbai sees hottest October day||Maximum daytime temperature in the city touched a season-high on Friday, settling at 36.4 degrees Celsius (up from 34.8 degrees Celsius the day prior) at the India Meteorological Department’s monitoring station in Santacruz. This surpasses this month’s previous record of 35.8 degrees Celsius on October 7. In 2020, the highest October temperature was recorded at 35 degrees Celsius on three days— October 10, October 28 and October 29.The IMD had forecast a week ago that there will be a steep rise in mercury coinciding with the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon over Mumbai. “As the cloud cover clears up, there is more penetration of sunlight which heats up the surface of the earth. It is a typical phenomenon in October. With the monsoon withdrawing from Mumbai on Thursday, there was bound to be a spike in temperature today,” said an official with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.Friday’s temperature was three degrees above normal for the day and follows a period of near-normal temperatures owing to post-monsoon showers between October 7 and October 14. However, IMD officials said that citizens can expect consistently above normal temperatures over the next week. “But it may not be as high as it was on Friday. Humidity will reduce and wind speeds will also become faster and may have a cooling effect,” said the official cited above.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Santacruz, which is taken as representative of the city, the maximum temperature will hover around 35 degrees Celsius until October 21, while the minimum temperature will hover around 24 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature on Friday stood at 24.4 degrees Celsius.Mumbai’s highest October temperature ever was recorded at 38.6 degrees Celsius in 2015. The phenomenon of October heat is typically exacerbated by a slowing down of onshore winds after the monsoon and a reduction in relative humidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/max-temperature-touches-36-4-degrees-celsius-mumbai-sees-hottest-october-day-101634319059905.html
15-10-2021||Mumbai||Covid cases in Mumbai go down in October, positivity rate go up marginally||Though the number of Covid cases has dropped slightly in October compared to the previous months, there is a marginal rise in the daily positivity rate in the past few days, states the data from the state health department. Dharavi, Asia’s one of the largest slum clusters, has reported a surge with active cases doubling in the last one week.According to state health department data, in the first 14 days of September 8,894 cases and 52 deaths were reported, while the same dropped to 7,086 cases during the same period in October. Furthermore,​ in October the number of deaths went up to 56 from 52. In the case of Dharavi, the active cases have gone up to 30 cases from the previous 16 cases a week ago on October 8.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “In the case of Dharavi, there is not anything alarming that we have witnessed yet. The spike in the active cases is the result of focused testing. We are preparing for upcoming festivals.”On September 1, a positivity rate of 0.99% was reported which went up to 1.28% on September 14 and further to 1.47% on October 14. At the same time, there has been a marginal decrease in the number of tests conducted in October, compared to that of September.

On Friday, 37,978 tests were reported taking the daily positivity rate to 1.28%.Experts said that the BMC should increase the number of tests. Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of microbiology at BYL Nair Hospital said, “The cases may be going down, but we are witnessing a surge in daily positivity rate in urban centres compared to that of rural areas. The reason for the increased positivity rate is people moving around. In the past few days, there have been several relaxations, and this could have led to a surge. However, I feel that the number of tests in the city is low.”Sathe added, “I strongly feel that as Diwali is nearing the civic administration should increase testing.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, The testing more or less remained the same. The cases are also almost the same, but currently, the testing may be less due to festivals and again around Diwali, testing will be less, and gradually it will increase. Citizens have to continue following Covid-appropriate norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-cases-in-mumbai-go-down-in-october-positivity-rate-go-up-marginally-101634319001140.html

15-10-2021||Mumbai||Hands donated from Ahmedabad, transplant on at Mumbai hospital||A team of doctors from the Parel’s Global Hospital began a bilateral hand transplant procedure on Friday night. The hands were donated by the kin of a 52-year-old man who was declared brain dead at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital. The recipient is a 22-year-old man from Ajmer who had lost both his upper limbs and lower limbs after suffering from severe electrical burns while working on the farm.This is Mumbai’s third hand transplant and the second one to be carried out at the Global Hospital. The first bilateral hand transplant procedure was carried out in August 2020 on train accident victim Monika More. The second such procedure was conducted by a team of doctors at the civic-run KEM Hospital this August on 21-year-old Rahul Ahirwar from Madhya Pradesh, who had lost both his hands in a power press machine accident. The KEM Hospital doctors could transplant only the right hand as Ahirwar developed a problem with the blood vessels on the left side. The hand transplant procedure at Global Hospital began at around 8pm on Friday. The complex procedure is also known as composite allotransplantation and involves connecting the main arteries, bones, multiple veins, nerves and tendons. A doctor from Global Hospital said that it was too early to comment on the procedure. According to Dr SK Mathur, president of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), this is second hand donation from Ahmedabad this week. “It is a good sign that families are willing to donate hands, in addition to the other organs like kidneys, liver, heart etc. It shows that there is increasing awareness among people about organ donation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hands-donated-from-ahmedabad-transplant-on-at-mumbai-hospital-101634318939796.html
15-10-2021||Mumbai||Only 342 new vehicles registered across Mumbai on Dussehra||The registration of the new vehicles on the occasion of Dussehra saw a significant dip in the city on Friday. A total of 342 new vehicles were registered across the city’s four regional transport offices (RTO).The number of registered vehicles were slashed by half as compared to last year. In 2020, a total of 599 vehicles were registered in the city on Dussehra, while 469 vehicles were registered during the festival in 2019.Registrations of new four and two-wheeler vehicles in the city are done at Tardeo, Wadala, Andheri and Borivli RTOs.The Borivli RTO registered 44 new vehicles, as opposed to only 28 vehicles registered in 2020. Andheri RTO registered 169 new vehicles on Friday as opposed to 241 registration in 2020.Tardeo and Wadala RTO witnessed a significant dip in the number of vehicles registered and Tardeo RTO registered 65 vehicles as opposed to 160 vehicles registered in 2020. The Wadala RTO registered 64 vehicles only as opposed to 170 vehicles registered in 2020.In a fortnight, over 7,500 new vehicles were registered in the city.Transport experts have stated that the economic crisis and the constant rise in fuel prices is the reason that the number of vehicles has significantly decreased.“One can understand the impact on four-wheelers but two-wheelers have also been impacted this year. The rise in fuel prices in Mumbai and the financial impact of coronavirus could be the reason for the lower number of vehicles being registered this year. People are investing in real estate, so the drastic decrease in the number of new vehicles is surprising,” said transport expert AV Shenoy.“The decrease has been drastic in vehicle registrations during Dussehra this year. Many people bought vehicles much before and got the delivery of the vehicle on Dussehra,” said a senior RTO official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-342-new-vehicles-registered-across-mumbai-on-dussehra-101634318879855.html
15-10-2021||Mumbai||JEE Advanced Results: 18-year-old from Mumbai gets AIR 7, is Maha topper||Eighteen-year-old Kartik Nair emerged Maharashtra topper with an All-India Rank (AIR) of 7 in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced results 2021 that were announced by the National Testing Agency on Friday. Neeraja Patil, 17, from Mumbai stood first among girl candidates in the state with an AIR of 266. Both Nair, student of Kandivali-based Ryan International School (CBSE board) and Patil, student of Dixit Road Junior College of Science at Vile Parle, plan to pursue computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. A total of 141,699 candidates appeared in both papers 1 and 2 this year, of which around 41,862 candidates have qualified. This year, the eligibility and admission guidelines were tweaked owing to the pandemic. As against an aspirant having to score 75% or more in Class 12 board exams to be eligible for JEE-Adv, the criterion was tweaked, considering all school education boards in the country scrapped Class 12 exams this year. Candidates should have cleared their class 12 exams and should be among the top 2.5 lakh successful candidates including all categories in JEE-Mains 2021. The number of spare seats in various programs will be decided by individual IITs ensuring that every institute has at least 20% female enrollment in undergraduate programmes. Nair aspires to pursue research in artificial intelligence. He likes listening to music and playing football. He has been preparing for JEE for the past two years. “I enjoy studying, constantly solving assignments and focusing on a lot of practice. I studied only during the day and at night would focus on sleep and relaxing my mind and body. The most important thing was to eat healthy and use gadgets only for academics. Sometimes I would watch informative videos on music and football,” said Nair, who resides in Kandivli. Nair, whose father is an IT consultant and mother a computer science professor, is the only child. Similarly, Santacruz resident Patil has always been academically inclined. She started training for JEE from Class 9 onwards. Last year, she received a rank of 400 in JEE mains. “It has been a great leap for me in terms of my overall rank. I strictly followed my study timetable and ensured that I practised to the core. Every morning I indulged in yoga which calmed my mind,” added Patil, whose father works for Tata Power (Solar) and mother is employed with Mahagenco. “The online classes this year did not deter my spirit. To be away from excess screen time, I focused on playing chess with my twin sister. I would also play the keyboards in my free time. My parents always motivated me and ensured that I took care of my diet and sleep patterns,” said Patil, whose twin sister is pursuing medicine and both of them often discuss common subjects like chemistry and physics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jee-advanced-results-18-year-old-from-mumbai-gets-air-7-is-maha-topper-101634318762144.html

15-10-2021||Mumbai||60% patients in Thane asymptomatic, under home quarantine; mild symptoms because of vaccination||Almost 60% of active patients within Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) are asymptomatic and under home quarantine. It has been noted that among the asymptomatic positive cases, most are 41 years and above. This shows an increased possibility of vaccinated individuals being asymptomatic.According to the TMC records, Thane city has around 6,60,000 people in the 45 years and above age group. Among these, 93.22% have been vaccinated till now. This includes 3,69,106 or 55% with the first dose and 2,46,194 or 37.30% with the second dose of vaccination.The increasing asymptomatic cases have also resulted in many Covid beds lying vacant. On a regular basis, TMC records around 650 to 720 active cases. Among these, more than 450 are asymptomatic and around 400 would be in home quarantine.From among the active cases, around 168 are in the 31-40 years age group, 164 are among senior citizens, 148 are among the 41-50 years age group, 102 cases are in the 21-30 years age group, 97 in the 51-60 years category and 87 are below 20 years.“With increased number of people being vaccinated in the city, most positive cases have mild symptoms and health also does not deteriorate drastically as they are vaccinated. This could be one of the reasons for the increase in asymptomatic cases,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.The case fatality rate within the city is at 1.50% currently and the weekly growth rate of positive cases within the city continues to be at 0.05%.“As most citizens testing positive have received one vaccination dose or in some cases, fully vaccinated, they are able to recover quickly.

This shows that there is increased recovery in the city,” said a medical officer from TMC health department.From among the total vaccine eligible population, those above 45 years are the most vaccinated in the city. However, there continues to be around 18% who have not yet received the second dose of vaccination.“From among the target population, there could be a possibility that some may have received vaccination from outside Thane city while a few others from outside must have inoculated within the city. If we look at it in that manner, there will continue to be a certain margin that will be left. But we have reached out to as many as possible till now,” said a medical officer from TMC.Meanwhile, the number of vacant beds in the city has also increased to more than 90%. Almost 98% of ventilators, oxygen and beds for quarantine are available currently. Around 95% of beds for serious or moderate patients including the jumbo Covid facilities are lying vacant. ICU beds are still occupied as the recovery time is more. Still, 93% of the beds are available.The number of asymptomatic cases within the city is lower if compared to neighbouring cities of Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli. “Depending on the number of tests, the number of asymptomatic cases has always been between 60% and 80% across the city. Even during the peak of the second wave, we had around 75% of asymptomatic cases. So, this has been a constant figure for Thane city. The number of tests currently is at 2,500 daily, we are not forcing anyone to test unless they have any symptoms,” said a senior officer from TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/60-patients-in-thane-asymptomatic-under-home-quarantine-mild-symptoms-because-of-vaccination-101634310421811.html

He was later released on bail. Earlier, five people including three police constables were arrested in the case. On Thursday, he was called by Thane Vartak Nagar police to record his statement. Later he was arrested under section 365, 324, 143, 147, 148, 506. Somaiya said, “I went to meet Karmuse and supported his fight. The minister was arrested and released immediately as the IPC sections were not so stringent. Why such a different treatment to the minister?”On Thursday, a senior police officer of Thane police confirmed Awhad’s arrest and Vartak Nagar Police recorded his statement and then he was produced in Thane court. The court released him on bail on the bail bond of ₹10,000 and one surety.Karmuse, 40, alleged that he was beaten up inside Awhad’s bungalow by 10-15 persons for posting a morphed photograph of the leader on social media for his stand against the call by PM Narendra Modi to have a candlelight vigil on April 5 at 9pm to applaud the efforts of all those involved in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic. After Karmuse posted the morphed photograph of Awhad, two people in police uniform came to his house and asked him to accompany them to the police station. Karmuse alleged that instead of police station he was taken to Awhad’s bungalow in Thane, beaten up around 10 to 15 people and was made to apologise for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-leader-somaiya-meets-karmuse-in-thane-a-day-after-awhad-was-arrested-and-released-on-bail-101634307599678.html
15-10-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Business As Usual?||‘Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.’ How easy it is to forget: washing, scouring, scrubbing one’s hands, over and over again, ‘out, out, damn spot’; disinfecting groceries, hard won groceries, basic everyday items, sourced through the collective efforts and resources of an entire family, as if they were jewels; scrubbing and wiping vegetables over and over, until the very flavour leaches out of them, then, leaving them outside your door until they’re rendered ‘safe’ for consumption ; that horrifying shaky, footage, smuggled out of Wuhan, of a wind-battered ambulance, making its way through an empty road delivering life-saving medicines and food to the sick. Then, the inside of a tiny home in which a young husband, fortified in a PPE (personal protective equipment) suit as if he were going to battle, or an astronaut into space, trying to take care of his dying wife, who lies beneath a pile of blankets and behind a padded door; news of hospitals being overrun with patients and medical supplies running out; rumours circulating about which colony or building is now quarantined; endless queues outside provision stores; that crazy moment when we stood clanging kitchen vessels thinking it would somehow help, and then those heart-breaking endless lines of migrants dragging their tragedy across India’s landscape…. remember those days? When silence, despair and anxiety seemed to be one’s only companions and where the simple act of hugging a loved one, or meeting an ailing parent was fraught with danger and dystopian fears? Remember feeling trapped inside a long dark tunnel when there was no light in sight at the other end? *************************************************************************************************************It is only a popular meme, among the millions that daily travel the planet on social media platforms, but like others of its kind, it conveys a certain zeitgeist. This one has two swarthy men poised over a drink at a bar. “What’s up bro?” asks man number one to man number two. “Great,” he responds, adding, “I’ve just had my first shot and waiting for the second one.” “Covishield or Covaxin?” enquires the first man. “Tequila” replies the second, poker faced. Only a popular meme, but one that appears to mirror today’s reality. Because, looking around as things are in the city, and in areas of the world that begin opening up and going back to normal – or the new normal – it appears that a collective cavalier amnesia has settled on many people about how things were not too long ago. Indeed, looking around, it often appears as if a whole lot of folk have emerged from the pandemic, determined to pretend it never happened and that it’s back to business – almost with a vengeance. And why not, you might say. After all, so much has been lost during those months of enforced hibernation and so much needs to be redeemed – from floundering careers and enterprises – to lost time with family and friends, and so, who will really begrudge people their opportunity to revive their fortunes and festivities? After all, only the very naïve would expect that the post-pandemic world would bring forth savants and saints, or a changed species…responsible, mature and conscientious. But whereas survivor’s guilt is as pernicious as brassy buoyancy, and no one is required to don sackcloth and ashes, for the rest of time, it will be a shame if some of the lessons that we learnt during those long hours of our isolation were lost, lessons such as humility, gratitude, kindness and compassion and an appreciation for simplicity, inclusivity and our shared humanity. ************************************************************************************************************Last month, the world witnessed how it has taken 20 years after the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks to painfully, gradually begin to come to terms with the tragedy, through the lens of distance and time. If it took two decades to come to some semblance of processing a tragedy of that proportion, how long before people process something of the magnitude of a pandemic that took in its thrall the entire planet – rich and poor, powerful and weak, first world and the third? A phenomena that stopped planes mid-flight, left millions across the world dead, left the planet’s economy running on dire, empty tanks and disrupted life as we knew it. Perhaps it will take many lifetimes. Which could explain why barely a few months out of the second wave, it seems as if many have forgotten how low things had sunk and how far we’ve come… ************************************************************************************************************Looking around as things begin to go back to normal, it appears that even while there are those who have emerged from these challenging months with a new found wisdom and appreciation for life, the pandemic has also exacerbated a cynicism and brutishness in others, almost as though once the tidal wave of the pandemic recedes, it is taking in its wake people’s outer garments, exposing them for who and what they really are. As if those months spent in survival mode have spawned a ‘dog eats dog,’ ‘do or die,’ ‘devil-may-care’ impulse. Now, the brazen appear to be more brassy, the wily more grasping and the scheming even more Machiavellian. *********************************************************************************************************So, after months of isolation and solitude, how does one negotiate oneself in a world that is beginning to open up and often appears to have learnt nothing at all? Extremely cautiously, I would say. Feel uneasy with the pace of things opening up? Apprehensive about certain activities? Uncomfortable with the things people say or do? Respect those feelings. Take a step back and try to figure out why you feel that way. Because, just as the juggernaut of the pandemic appears to have heightened people’s innate characteristics, rendering some even more odious and lamentable, in many others, it has amplified their awareness and sensitivity not only to life’s beauty and bounty, but to the schisms and limitations of people. Now more than ever, it is time to be true to yourself and the hard lessons you learnt through the pandemic, the ones of strength and humanity kindness and inclusivity. Or in the words of yet another popular meme remember, as you go back in to the swim of things: ‘Do not let the ugly in others, kill the beauty in you’…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-business-as-usual-101634307059241.html
15-10-2021||Mumbai||ACB begins enquiry into forest officer’s assets in bribery case||The Mumbai unit of the Maharashtra Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) has started a Preliminary Enquiry into the assets of Assistant Conservator of Forests, Baliram Kolekar, who was arrested earlier this week for allegedly accepting a bribe of ₹5.30 lakh.Officials said that based on an extra packet of cash seized from his office, the Enquiry has been started to explore legal grounds for booking him in a disproportionate assets case.Kolekar (57), a Class I officer with the Forest Department, was allegedly caught red handed by an ACB team while accepting the bribe from his subordinate, a Class II officer in charge of the Tokawade range. A subsequent search of his office had revealed ₹12.46 lakh in cash.“Based on the seizure of the extra cash, we have started inquiries into Kolekar’s assets. The amount was a significant one and following his arrest, Kolekar was asked to account for the cash that we had found, and was unable to do so. Hence, we have now started a Preliminary Enquiry in which his assets will be evaluated and compared against his earnings over the span of his career as a government servant,” an ACB officer said.The officer added that the evaluation of all his assets will include cash, jewellery, vehicles and real estate in his as well as his family members’ names. Simultaneously, the ACB will calculate all the income, including salary and benefits that Kolekar has earned. Out of this amount, one-third will be deducted as per the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Act stipulates that while evaluating a suspect’s assets, it should be assumed that one-third of a government servant’s earnings were spent for day to day expenses.“The total value of Kolekar’s assets will be compared against the total value of his earnings, with expenses deducted. If the value of the assets is more than his income, he will be given ample time to account for the difference. If he is unable to do so, an additional case of disproportionate assets will be filed against him,” the officer said.The complainant in the case against Kolekar had approached the ACB’s Mumbai Unit on September 6 this year. He had alleged that Kolekar was demanding a total of ₹6.22 lakh in exchange for releasing state-sanctioned funds to his office. After verifying the complainant’s claims, the ACB had set a trap and arrested Kolekar while allegedly accepting ₹5.30 lakh in his office in Naupada, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/acb-begins-enquiry-into-forest-officer-s-assets-in-bribery-case-101634306714234.html

If they overcome this, they will get ahead of men," he had said. Many have called out the leader for his ‘misogynistic’ statement.Terming the comments “objectionable”, Anuradha Maheshwari, Jaipur president of BJP Mahila Morcha, launched a march from the BJP office in Jaipur till the Civil Lines railway crossing, where the protesters burnt the minister's effigy."Today on Dussehra, we burnt the effigy of Dotasra. He should apologise to women and resign," she said.Earlier this year, Dotasra made headlines for allegedly influencing the interview process of the RAS-2018 recruitment examination for his relatives. The BJP Yuva Morcha members had held a demonstration near the Civil Lines railway crossing in Jaipur demanding action against the minister.

The civic body has several grounds in which other sports activities are conducted. A dedicated ground for the kabaddi is something very motivating for the players,” said Avinash Ombase, KDMC sports committee member.“Accordingly, there is also a need to develop other playgrounds in Kalyan-Dombivli region in such a way that there are all the facilities they need to practice and not depend on any other city for the same,” added Ombase.The playground located in the rural area of Kalyan will cater to several kabaddi teams from the region.“The playground has been developed and is ready to use. The sportsmen can utilise the space for their regular practice and competitions in the coming days,” said Rajesh Sawant, ward officer, KDMC.Kalyan-based Ravindra Sakpal, NIS kabaddi coach for the disabled, said, “For many years, the kabaddi players in the area like Titwala, Mohane, Ambivli and Vadavali were deprived of a proper facility to practice the sport.

The block announced is to carry out the work of launching cement girder of a flyover on Desai creek at Palava Junction.However, small vehicles will be allowed to ply on the parallel, existing old flyover.“The work of the launching of the girder will be done by deploying a crane. To ensure the work is done smoothly, we have decided not to allow heavy vehicles on this route and also set diversion of the same,” said Surendra Shirsat, senior traffic police inspector, Kalyan (E). The work of the new flyover is being undertaken by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) as a part of the six-lane project of the 21km long Kalyan-Shilphata stretch.The traffic police have imposed a ‘no entry’ at Kalyan phata for heavy vehicles coming from Kalyan phata to Kalyan and will divert them to Mumbra Bypass-Kharegaon toll naka. The vehicles going towards Kalyan phata from Kalyan will be diverted from Badlapur Chowk- Khoni naka-Taloja MIDC route.“There is a need to have less movement of vehicles on the existing bridge during the launch work and hence this block is imposed for the heavy vehicles,” added Shirsat.As per MSRDC, the work of the bridge is expected to be completed by March 2022. As of now, the authority will be carrying out the work of launching 12 girders.“The launching work will be done during night hours using a crane. We have plans to launch 12 girders as of now. The length of the flyover that crosses the creek and the railway track is 900m. This work is a part of the widening of the 21km-long Kalyan-Shilphata stretch for which the estimated cost is around ₹212Cr,” said an officer of MSRDC.“We will deploy adequate manpower to direct the motorists. A total of 25 traffic cops will be at the spot with two of our officials.

15-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai’s Turbhe residents demand reconstruction of pavements||The residents of Turbhe are miffed as the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) is turning a blind eye to the old and crumbling pavements in their area.A 38-year-old pedestrian fell in the gutter below after a huge chunk of pavement gave in at Sector 19 last week. That man suffered minor injuries in the accident and was later taken to a nearby hospital.The local residents claim that the pavements in the entire area are in a bad shape and if requisite measures are not taken soon, more people would meet with similar accidents.The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) developed those pavements in the 1980s, before they handed over the area to NMMC. No major repair has been conducted by the civic body after that.Dheeraj Jadhav, 37, a resident of Turbhe, said, “As these pavements have not been repaired for years, they have gradually started giving in. You can see such crumbling pavements along the Palm Beach Road, near Turbhe Store, and along the roads that lead to the APMC market. From an economic point of view, this is a crucial place as thousands of people come to the markets here from different places of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai.“On Saturday, a young man met with an accident and he came out of the gutter without much difficulty. Had it been a child or a senior citizen, the scenario would have been quite different. So, taking the seriousness of the issue into consideration, NMMC should do something in this direction as early as possible.”Manoj Patil, executive engineer of NMMC (Turbhe division), said, “We have plans to reconstruct the pavements of the whole area and have already sent a proposal to the civic body. The work will be started soon after we receive approval for the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-s-turbhe-residents-demand-reconstruction-of-pavements-101634298124733.html

About 60% of UMC area falls under the NAD safety zone.The Court had, on October 8, taken a serious view of the photographic evidence of the continuous dumping on mangroves as produced by the petitioner, The Hanuman Koliwada Machhimar Vikas Sanstha’s lawyer, and directed UMC to file its affidavit. The Court also noted the “breach” of the earlier order basis the UMC declaration that the dumping would be stopped.The affidavit, however, claimed that the photograph was taken from a long distance and that no damage was done to the mangroves as alleged by the petitioner. Teji also denied any breach on part of the Municipal Council.The civic body has been dumping garbage only on the one-hectare plot allotted to it at Bori Pakhadi. Moreover, the municipal council has been requesting the government, through the Raigad district collector, for an alternative plot due to the opposition from ONGC and local residents to the ongoing dumping. The government is yet to decide on the new plot, the affidavit said.Teji said the UMC set up a 5-tonne capacity wet waste recycling unit with the help of BARC. The civic body is dumping 1.5 tonnes of dry waste at Bori Pakhadi plot, he said.Meanwhile, the MPCB counsel mentioned about the Board’s notice to UMC, the Court asked him to file a detailed affidavit.The court directed the petitioner to file its response to the UMC affidavit by next Wednesday. “We will respond to each and every point,” the Sanstha spokesperson said.The Court also directed the Raigad District Collector to be present during the next hearing, fixed for October 25, via video conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/for-garbage-dumped-on-mangroves-mpcb-issues-penalty-notice-on-uran-civic-body-101634297038637.html

15-10-2021||Bangalore||Tremors in North Karnataka an outcome of hydro-seismicity: Report||The series of tremors in Bidar and Kalaburagi districts in North Karnataka were related to a phenomenon called hydro-seismicity, which occur post monsoon, revealed a preliminary study by NGRI."We had asked the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) to take up a detailed analysis of the micro tremors that we are experiencing in Kalaburgi and Vijayapura region," Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority commissioner Manoj Rajan told PTI on Friday."Their preliminary observations indicated that the micro tremors of this nature normally occur during the post monsoon period. It is related to a phenomenon called hydro-seismicity after a heavy rainfall," Rajan said.He also said that within crustal volumes having fracture permeability, a natural increase in hydraulic head due to the elevation of the water table in recharge areas of groundwater basins increases the stress in earth.This event triggers micro tremors and in some cases it is accompanied by sound, the officer said."These are due to shallow earthquakes that generate high-frequency surface waves. This type of seismic activity is very common and nothing to worry about, since it may not cascade into a large devastating earthquake," the officer said.Rajan added that the NGRI is sending a team of scientists to these regions in the next two days to study and ascertain the field conditions.Villages near Basavakalyan in Bidar and Chincholi in Kalaburagi witnessed at least six tremors ranging between 2.5 to 4 magnitude on Richter scale from October 1 to October 12.While most of the panicked villagers spent their night under the open sky fearing a major earthquake, a few others went to some other place till things are normalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/tremors-in-north-karnataka-an-outcome-of-hydro-seismicity-report-101634292659852.html

The ministry said, “pursuant to the appeal of the Prime Minister, this Gandhi Jayanti saw a massive sale of Khadi products in Gujarat, the land of the Mahatma.”This year, the sale of Khadi in Gujarat has increased by ₹33.12 lakh, which is 11.32% as compared to the year 2020, when the gross sale of Khadi in the state on 2nd October stood at ₹2.92 crore. “The sales figure this year is significantly high given the pandemic situation after the second wave of Covid-19 which severely affected Gujarat just a few months ago,” the ministry noted.In order to increase Khadi sales, Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) set up “exhibition cum sales outlets” at Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot railway stations as part of the “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”.

The workers, including a large number of Dalit Sikhs, are being relocated as per recommendations of a deputy chief minister Prestone Tynsong-led panel.DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said they discussed the decision for the eviction within a week and added Malik assured the delegation that no one would be relocated without due process.“Even if they are illegally occupying the place, the government cannot evict them forcefully. For that purpose, the government has to file a civil suit before the civil magistrate, and then the order for eviction can be passed. This cannot be done forcefully.” He said the decision for relocation should have been taken in consultation with the stakeholders. “Did the government or (the panel)... ever have a discussion with the residents of the sweeper’s colony? The government should sit with the residents of the colony and discuss. A decision on the issue should be taken with mutual understanding or as per the law.”Sirsa said if there is any proposal for relocation, the government should bring it forth. “What is the proposal? Where is the proposal? There is no such proposal. They did not even call the residents for a meeting,” said Sirsa. He added they will approach the appropriate court again and take up the matter with Union Home Minister Amit Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sikh-delegation-meets-meghalaya-guv-over-relocation-of-shillong-sanitation-workers-101634271839608.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||In a first, Delhi to mark ‘virtual’ Dussehra today with electronic fireworks||In the nearly 225-year-old history of Ramlila celebrations in Delhi, the national capital will for the first time around mark the auspicious occasion of Dussehra on Friday with ‘virtual’ celebrations, which will include the unique digital or electronic fireworks, in view of the prevailing coronavirus pandemic in the country. Residents of Delhi will be able to watch the Dussehra night festivities—when the giant effigies of the mythological demon king Ravana are burnt—from the comfort of their homes and view the electronic fireworks on their television screens.Also Read | On Vijayadashami, PM Modi set to inaugurate 7 new defence firms for IndiaAccording to a report by HT's sister publication Live Hindustan, Ramlila committees in Delhi have reduced the size of these folklore re-enactments effigies this year due to the Covid-19 situation and concerns regarding pollution. For much of the same reason, firecrackers, which are typically burst along with the burning effigies, will not be used this time either. The committees will instead opt for virtual firecracker celebrations on digital screens, accompanied by the sound of the bursting crackers. In some places, the effigies will also be burnt virtually, according to the report.Ramlila at Red Fort: Size of effigies reducedAshok Agrawal, the chairperson of the Lav Kush Ramlila Committee—one of the oldest in Delhi that has been organising Ramlila at the Red Fort—said that due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation and concerns over pollution, the length of the effigies has been reduced to 30 feet this time around. Before the pandemic, the effigies used to be up to 110 feet tall. However, in line with instructions on staging the Ramlila celebrations this year, the size was reduced. Agrawal added that firecrackers will also not be used during the burning of Ravana's effigy and said the audience will get to see ‘digital fireworks’ for the first time in history. A recorded soundscape will be used for this purpose instead of actual firecrackers; the virtual celebrations will be shown on screen for all.Also Read | Dussehra 2021: Wishes, messages, images, greetings to share on this dayDelhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to attend celebrationsThe chairperson of the Lav Kush Ramlila Committee said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will be the guest of honour at the Dussehra function this year, too.

15-10-2021||Mumbai||Active Covid-19 cases drop below 30,000 in Maharashtra||As an indication of a decline in the Covid-19 cases, the active infections in Maharashtra have now dipped to below 30,000. Meanwhile, as schools and colleges reopened in the state, the government on Thursday allowed children to travel on trains.The notification is significant as the state permitted only fully-vaccinated commuters to travel by trains and so far, vaccination is allowed only for those above 18 years of age.On Thursday, the state recorded 29,560 active cases. The active cases started to decline below the 30,000-mark from Wednesday, when 29,555 active cases were recorded, as compared to 30,525 active infections registered on Tuesday. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the decline in the active cases indicated a drop in Covid-19 cases.“The reduction in active cases indicates that we have been able to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. We have been able to bring down the numbers due to ramping of tests, quick isolation of patients as well as timely medication,” said Dr Awate.Currently, the state has 29,560 active patients, of which, Pune tops the list with 8,296 active infections, followed by Mumbai (6,212), Thane (3,744), Ahmednagar (3,148) and Satara (1,424).Pune has been leading in the number of active cases, followed by Thane, for months together. The third position has been alternated by Mumbai, Ahmednagar or Satara. However, in recent days, owing to a surge in the cases, Mumbai has now overtaken Thane and has the second-highest number of active cases.The number of active cases in the peak season had reached 600,000 this year.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said “We are seeing the thick tail of the second wave which was prolonged for a very long time. The history of the pandemic shows that we will be getting multiple waves but the severity will all depend on the behaviour of the citizens as well as the government.”“While citizens have to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, the government has to ramp up all the medical infrastructure in anticipation of the future waves,” said Dr Shaikh.On Thursday, Maharashtra recorded 2,384 Covid-19 new cases and 35 deaths. Mumbai recorded 558 cases and five deaths.The total number of Covid-19 patients since the outbreak in March last year has now reached 6,586,280. The state conducted 136,952 tests on Thursday and clocked 2,343 recoveries.The toll reached 139,705, with Pune recording the highest fatalities – 19,529 – followed by Mumbai (16,172) and Thane (11,398).Meanwhile, the state government relaxed some more restrictions on Thursday. Till now, the government regulations for closed halls only allowed for 50% of the seating capacity or a maximum of 200 attendees, whichever more. The new notification has removed the 200-limit and has allowed 50% of attendees of capacity in closed halls. This will be beneficial for bigger establishments as they will get to accommodate more people which was not possible owing to the 200-people cap. The rule will be applicable for public/private, ticketed or any event. The government, however, has made it mandatory for all organisers, attendees as well as staff to be fully vaccinated. They have also decided to fine the organisers as well as facility managers ₹50,000 for any violation of rules.The state has also relaxed rules for railway travel as currently only those who have taken both doses of vaccine 14 days before their travel are allowed. With schools and colleges reopening, students below 18 years have also been permitted to travel by train. In addition, even those who are not allowed to take a vaccine due to their medical condition will be allowed, provided they have a certificate on their condition from a recognised doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/active-covid-19-cases-drop-below-30-000-in-maharashtra-101634269258616.html

15-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Grandmother of chaat stalls||Without doubt, this has to be the naani of all the roadside snack stalls. The unusually huge counter is filled with multitudinous dishes—aloo chaat, dahi bhalle, papri chaat, pao bhaji, aloo tikki, burger, Ram laddu, and dahi puckha. (Any item left unmentioned is deeply regretted.)This is Dilli 6 Chaat Bhandar. It’s not in Dilli 6, aka Old Delhi, but in south Delhi, just outside the Siri Fort Auditorium, on August Kranti Marg. “Originally we were in (Old Delhi’s) Chandni Chowk,” explains Brijesh, while shallow-frying the tikkis on the tava. His elder brother, Ram Avtar, with whom he runs the establishment, is briefly away on some errand. The stall was founded by their grandfather Tika Ram, whose son, Ek Ram, moved it to the present site more than three decades ago.It will however be unfair to say that the business is managed by the brothers alone. The women in the family—mother Kalawati with daughters-in-law Sunita and Kranti Devi—have an equally active role, though they stay invisible. The stall’s daily work begins every morning at 5 in the owners’ residence in nearby Gautam Nagar. Together the three women and the two men perform all the cooking that can be executed in advance—such as boiling the aloos and channas, preparing the papris and golgappas, and grinding the many chutneys. Everything is made afresh the same day at home or at the stall, insists Brajesh, emphasising that nothing comes from outside. That’s certainly a convincing reason to drop by this stall. Another is to enjoy the chance of marvelling at its gigantic proportions. Try to stand behind the counter. It’s so wide that the view might look somewhat distorted, the way the phone screen appears when its camera lens is set to ultra-wide mode.The place appears to be wildly popular. A long silver-grey car comes to a halt, the lady sitting behind the uniformed chauffeur opens the window and asks in baba-log Hindi for several plates of papri chaat to be packed. Moments later a scooterist stops by for golgappas (his Hindi is fluent). Attending to these customers, Brijesh is simultaneously piling up dozens of partially fried aloo tikkis into a metal platter perched atop an adjacent brick wall. The sight is startling, as if somebody forgot to carry his tikki hamper. All you have to do is to pick it up and run.The stall serves daily from 2pm to 10pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-grandmother-of-chaat-stalls-101634259959284.html

Mandour village and the adjoining area is the most affected where notices have been served, he added. Dinesh Gaba, executive engineer of PHED in Ambala said that a joint team of his department and the MC are also checking the sewage lines and drains, to minimize the problems arising out of it.“Notices and reminders are also being served to the residents through SAKSHAM Yuva, who will also inform them about the benefits of taking sewage connections. Finally, we can recommend action on households with no connections, to the MC that has the enforcement authority,” he said. As per the latest data available, the department has served 550 notices and 248 second reminders to the residents, an official said. At several wards, the residents complained of waterlogging, lighting, stray animals, garbage collection, poor situation of roads and parks etc to Khadgata during his visit.“The situation of roads and lighting is fine. We found some encroachments on a sewer ditch that will be demolished. The process to shift dairies at two designated locations has been started. For maintenance of parks, the Residents Welfare Associations (RWA) can avail the facility of funds from MC at ₹3 per square meters,” the MC Chief had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-public-health-dept-serves-household-notices-after-mc-chief-flags-fewer-sewage-connections-101634250354313.html

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Mobility plan for Chandigarh: Fix road map for consultant selection by next week, directs adviser||For expediting the resolution of the city’s worsening traffic woes, UT adviser Dharam Pal has directed the UT transport department to finalise by next week the the road map for appointing a consultant for preparing a mobility plan.Having started preparing modalities, the transport department will examine in detail whether Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) can be again allotted the work, or a new agency will have to be hired.After years in cold storage, the mass rapid transport system (MRTS) plans were revived in August this year with the Chandigarh administration deciding to go in for a fresh study on the comprehensive mobility plan for the city.With 15 lakh registered vehicles among a population of over 12 lakh, Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles per household in the country, leading to traffic congestion and snarls. In addition to these, over two lakh vehicles on interstate routes cross the city daily.Since the metro rail plans were shelved, the administration has not been able to opt for any other alternative such as monorail, skybus or metrolite.The decision to study the MRTS afresh was taken after UT officials held a meeting with representatives of RITES, who made a presentation on its 2009 report.“RITES had prepared a report on the city’s mobility needs in 2009, but it is outdated now. The city’s needs have changed dramatically in the last decade. Also, the guidelines set by the housing and urban affairs ministry for the MRTS project have changed, which necessitates a fresh look at the problem. Therefore, the administration will go in for a new study,” said Pal.RITES had proposed that Metro would cover a distance of 52.4 km, of which 40.4 km will be in Chandigarh and the rest in Mohali. The alignments were proposed both above as well as underground. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had prepared the detailed report of the first phase of the project.Pal said, “We will prefer RITES as it has already done a study of the city. But in case we have to go for another agency, we will invite tenders for the same. The tendering process is likely to take around six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mobility-plan-for-chandigarh-fix-road-map-for-consultant-selection-by-next-week-directs-adviser-101634248613795.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Mandi bypoll | We don’t need helpless leaders:Jai Ram’s jibe at Pratibha Singh||With his prestige at stake in the Mandi bypoll, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur took a dig at Congress candidate Pratibha Singh saying that the state needed strong Lok Sabha members, not helpless leaders. Speaking at a public meeting at Chaulthach, hes said, “In her speeches, Pratibha has time and again said she did not want to contest the elections. The Mandi Lok Sabha seat extends from Bharmaur to Kinnaur, including Rampur.”While Pratibha has been speaking of the development work carried out by her husband, Jai Ram also spoke of leaders from the party that had passed away. “Many leaders are not with us today. BJP lost Mandi Lok Sabha member Ramswaroop Sharma. He is the man who popularised Mandi as Chotti Kashi, which also finds mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches. Virbhadra Singh has been the state’s chief minister several times. Sure, we had ideological differences but he also praised me when warranted. I never had a bitter fight like this with him,” he said.“I am first a legislator and then a chief minister later. I have been serving the people of this constituency for 24 years, I am indebted to the public of Seraj” said the CM, getting emotional. On rampant unemployment, he blamed the Congress for not doing anything in all the years it was in power. “ Our government provided pension to mothers who had attained the age of 65 years. We started a HimCare scheme for the poor, under which 1.75 lakh people were treated. Launched the Sahara scheme, in which ₹3,000 is deposited in their account,” said BJP candidate Khushal Thakur, who was also also accompanied him.Pratibha questions Mandi MP’s death Shimla Congress candidate from Mandi Pratibha Singh hit out at the government saying that the elections were a referendum against the rising inflation and unemployment in the state. “The BJP had earlier tried to evade the byelections and now was using the valour of the Indian army to deflect people’s attention from the core issues concerning the public,” she said, while addressing a series of rallies in chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s assembly segment, Seraj. “Virbhadra Singh had contributed a lot to the development of Seraj. I am saddened the see the poor condition of roads. It appears that BJP pays no attention towards the problem of the common man,” she said. Pratibha also questioned Mandi Lok Sabha member Ram Swaroop Sharma’s death. “What circumstances led to Ramswaroop’s death. His family members demanded an inquiry into the death. The government must tell people what happened of the investigation,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandi-bypoll-we-don-t-need-helpless-leaders-jai-ram-s-jibe-at-pratibha-singh-101634247175011.html

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Despite cracker ban, Chandigarh BJP calls for Dussehra celebrations as usual||Going against the UT administration’s decision, the Chandigarh unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday said bursting of crackers was allowed on Dussehra.The Chandigarh administration had recently imposed a complete ban on sale and use of crackers of any kind throughout the UT, while citing a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order in this regard.The NGT order had stated that any violation would invite penal action under Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and other provisions as applicable.However, in a press statement on Thursday, city BJP chief Arun Sood said there was no ban on use of crackers during Dussehra celebrations.The statement further stated that after different organisers of the Dussehra events approached him on the UT’s cracker ban, Sood talked it over with the senior UT officials, including the administrator and the adviser.Sood told them that the NGT order was not applicable on the Dussehra festival. “Dussehra is an important Hindu festival. Burning of Ravana’s effigy is a long-established tradition and crackers are always used. That’s why it is not correct to ban crackers,” the statement said.A senior UT official, however, confirmed that there will not be any change in the order. Till late evening, there was no modification of the ban order.UT adviser Dharam Pal, on October 12, had issued orders under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, banning, with immediate effect, the sale and use of firecrackers in the city till further orders. Later that day, the administration had clarified that during the Dussehra celebrations burning of effigies was allowed, but not the use of firecrackers.Effigies will be burnt at around 10-15 places on Friday; in previous years, the number used to be over 40. Speaking about this, president of the Sector-20 Ramlila, Gulshan Kumar said, “The cash crunch has hit many associations, which is why they haven’t built effigies. We will hoist our effigies at the Sector 34 exhibition ground and various associations will come to celebrate.” Their Ravana, which stands at 65 feet tall, is likely the tallest in the city this year.The Sector-17 Ramlila Association will also hold a function. As per its director, Rajinder Bagga, they have already built effigies without crackers as per the administration’s order and will follow all rules. UT finance secretary Vijay N Zade will be the chief guest here and their Ravana is likely to be the second tallest in the city at 60 feet.The Sector-46 Ramlila Association said they will not hold any function of burning effigies. General secretary Sushil Kumar said, “We will take out a Shobha Yatra and will burn a 25-foot effigy at the Sector-46 ground. This function is just for the members and will be closed to the public. There will be no seating arrangement as we cannot ensure a gathering under 300.”While most associations said they will adhere to all Covid protocols, many remained sceptical about whether these will actually be followed to a tee.Director of one of the Ramlilas, who wished to remain anonymous, said people often misbehaved with the organisers when they were asked to leave seats vacant alternatively for social distancing. “Only the police can issue challans to those without masks, but their presence is also not adequate and we can just request them,” he added. With fewer functions this year, it is expected that big crowds can gather at the select venues. Over 100,000 people had turned up when the 221-foot Ravana was burnt in Dhanas in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-cracker-ban-chandigarh-bjp-calls-for-dussehra-celebrations-as-usual-101634246638492.html

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Half way through October, Chandigarh tricity’s dengue cases already double than last year’s tally||While the tricity has got a breather from the raging Covid-19 pandemic, its dengue cases this year have already doubled compared to last year.Only half way through October, tricity’s dengue infections have shot up to 1,718, a 111% spike from the 814 cases last year, and 155% higher than 673 cases reported in 2019.Through these years, Mohali remains the worst-hit. The district has reported 1,161 cases so far this year, compared to 303 in Chandigarh and 254 in Panchkula.Among these, 99 dengue cases surfaced in Mohali on Thursday, 31 in Chandigarh and 25 in Panchkula.Mohali has also recorded 10 suspected deaths this year, including one on Thursday, while the toll remains zero in the UT and Panchkula.Last year, Mohali saw 471 infections, the UT 265 and Panchkula 286. The numbers were much lower in 2019, when the three areas logged 254, 78 and 33 cases, respectively.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “A spurt in dengue cases is seen every four years. Most of the cases are being reported from Mohali city, including Phases 7, 10 and 11, and other urban areas in Kurali, Dera Bassi and Kharar, reflecting residents’ apathy towards the severity of the disease. Health teams have surveyed 1.7 lakh houses since March and slapped fines on over 3,000 violators.”Covid arrangements to the rescueBuckling under the sudden surge, government hospitals in Chandigarh have started utilising their near-empty Covid wards for the treatment of dengue patients, most of whom are being referred from the tricity and other states.“On an average, 50 patients, suffering from fever and similar symptoms, are getting admitted in the paediatric and medicine emergency wards daily. Currently over 200 patients are admitted, while the medicine emergency has only 30 beds. So they are being treated in Covid wards. Despite the patient load, we are ensuring proper treatment and have made arrangements for adequate platelets in blood banks,” said Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32. Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said, “The institute is admitting more dengue patients as compared to Covid. The internal medicine department is attending to over 200 patients at present, almost double than its capacity, and most of the patients are suffering from fever.

As many as 23 Ram Lila committees have taken consent from the police for ‘Ravan Dehan’ with the tallest Ravana effigy (100-ft) being erected in Daresi ground.With 50% gathering allowed for outdoor events, the Ram Lila committees have opened the gates for residents who missed the festivities last year due to the raging pandemic.Out of the total 23 sites, major events will take place in Daresi, Giaspura, Sector 39 on Chandigarh road, Dugri among few other areas. The celebrations will also be witnessed at Aggar Nagar, Jamalpur etc. While Dussehra fairs were being organised in different parts of the city, including Daresi, Chandigarh road, Upkar Nagar, Dugri etc for over a week, the committees remained occupied in making arrangements for Ravana Dehan. At a few places including Daresi, closed-circuit television cameras have also been installed to keep vigil.Kamal Bassi, member of Shri Ram Lila Committee, Daresi, said, “Residents are very excited about Ravana Dehan this year, as they missed the celebrations last year due to restrictions on gathering. Daresi ground has been holding Dussehra celebrations for over a century.” The effigy of Meghnath was burned on Thursday.“Ravana Dehan will take place on Thursday evening at around 5:30pm and the event is open to public. Permissions have been sought from the administration. However, we appeal to the residents to follow Covid-appropriate behavior during the celebrations,” said Bassi.Few committees have cut short the celebrations, but are still excited about Ravana Dehan, which remained a low-key affair last year.Upkar Nagar Dussehra committee president Channi Gill said, “The Dussehra celebrations have been toned down this year too due to the pandemic and no procession was organised in the area, unlike the past. However, Ravana Dehan will take place as it used to in the pre-Covid era. A 55-ft tall effigy is being erected and the event is open for everyone.”Joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezhian said 23 Dussehra/Ram Lila committees have taken permission to organise Ravana Dehan. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said no fresh guidelines have been received from the government regarding Dussehra celebrations this year. “As per the previous guidelines, 50% gathering is allowed at an outdoor event. The committees, however, have been told to ensure that the Covid guidelines are followed strictly.” Ravana Dehan sites reducedThough the committees and residents are excited over Dussehra celebrations, the number of Ravana Dehan events being organised in the city have been reduced in comparison to the past due to the pandemic. As per information, Ravana Dehan was organised at around 80 sites in the city in 2019, while the celebrations took place only at eight sites last year due to the pandemic and gathering restrictions. This year, the permission has been sought by 23 committees.General secretary of Krishna Mandir Trust in Model Town Extension, KP Gosain said they will not be organising a mega event this year too as it is difficult to manage the rush of visitors. “Only a symbolic celebration will take place by burning around 10-15-ft Ravana effigy,” he said.Over 70 firefighters on stand-byTo ensure residents safety from any sort of fire mishap, as many as 70 firefighters will remain on standby. Assistant divisional fire officer Swarn Chand said fire tenders will also be stationed in different points of the city during Dussehra and Diwali celebrations to reduce reaction time.

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Despite civilian killings in Valley, migrant workers refuse to give in to fear||Ten days ago, Virender Paswan, a street food vendor from Bhagalpur in Bihar, became a victim of targeted killing when he was shot dead by militants in the busy Alamgiri Bazaar in the Zadibal area of Srinagar. His killing, one in a spate of attacks on civilians, sent shivers down the spine of fellow migrant workers in the Valley, but despite their apprehensions most continue to go about their work as usual. This is not the first time that migrant workers have found themselves in the crosshairs of militants. In October 2019, soon after the imposition of governor’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir, six migrant workers had been killed in South Kashmir, in a single attack at Katersoo Kulgam, while another worker from Bihar had been killed in Kulgam in September. After each attack, some migrant workers leave the Valley fearing for their lives, only to return in the next season. Say Kashmir is like home“When the situation is normal, Kashmir feels like Kashmir, but whenever a migrant worker is killed, we cannot help but worry,” says Sonu Singh, who works as a labourer in Natipora.“I have been coming to the Valley for five years with my neighbours. We spend our summers in Kashmir, but return in winters. Whenever an attack takes place, I get calls from friends and relatives asking me to return. However, I tell them things are not so bad.” The Jammu and Kashmir labour department says approximately 1.4 lakh migrant workers come to Jammu and Kashmir each year, and most return once winter sets in, only to return next year. They mostly hail from Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab and work at construction sites, road works, paddy fields, and apple orchards. Many have setup small roadside kiosks and many are engaged as barbers, masons, jewellers or work in residents’ homes. The migrant workers did not stop coming to the Valley even at the heights of militancy. After the 2014 floods, the number of migrant workers increased in the Valley due to hectic construction activities. Sawan, a worker from Chhattisgarh, says, “I had also heard about the killing of a street vendor but my employer assured me that it was an odd incident. Besides, I work at a local resident’s house and do not venture out.” A recruiter, who brings migrant workers to the Valley, on condition of anonymity, said, none of the migrant workers have been harassed or have asked to return home. “Every time there is a killing, our employees feel insecure and we assure them of their safety and apprise them of the standard operating procedure to be followed if the situation turns bad,” he said. ‘Focus on earning before winter sets in’ After the spate of killing, the government has asked local police stations to ensure places frequented by migrant workers are secure. Mostly the workers stay in groups at private accommodations. A cobbler, Munna Lal of Rajasthan, has been coming Kashmir for 15 to 20 years and has set shop at the busy Khayam chowk in the Old City. Asked about plans to leave the Valley, he says, “People are leaving as winter has set in and it is their usual time to leave. There are many migrant workers here. What is there to fear? Death is in the hands of God. I will not be going. I will leave in my own time when winter completely sets in.” He says he cannot understand why the vendor was killed last week. “Most people here are good. The vendor who was killed had come here to earn money for his family like all of us,” Lal said. Another migrant worker, who hails from Rajasthan and polishes shoes for a living, requested anonymity fearing reprisal, and said, “People are afraid after the Golgappa vendor was killed. Many people have left earlier than usual. My uncle who also works here is also forcing me to leave,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/despite-civilian-killings-in-valley-migrant-workers-refuse-to-give-in-to-fear-101634244054947.html

While Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann attended the event, other Sikh hardliners like Sarbat Khalsa-appointed parallel jathedar Dhian Singh Mand and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) president Baljit Singh Daduwal, who led the Bargari Insaaf Morcha, gave it a miss.Sukhraj Singh, son of Krishan Bhagwan Singh who died in the police firing, said people voted for the Congress in the previous assembly election as it promised to punish the guilty. “But the government failed to give justice and is providing security to the accused. We have no hope of justice from this government. The people of Punjab must unite,” he said.Six years were more than enough to act against the culprits and if any political party seeks votes on these issues this time, people should oppose it, he added. Mann said, “Since July, more than 100 groups of Sikhs have offered arrest every day at Bargari as part of the morcha to protest against delay in justice. I appeal to one and all to participate in the morcha and offer arrest till culprits are punished.” After the event, a group of SAD (A) leaders, along with others, marched from the gurudwara to the Dana Mandi at Bargari and were detained by the police. Since July, SAD (A) leaders are offering arrest after marching to the 2015 sacrilege epicentre every day to protest against the delay in providing justice. Dal Khalsa spokesperson, Kanwar Pal Singh said all the political parties are doing politics on this issue. “They are only looking for personal gains. First, Amarinder Singh became chief minister by using this issue and now Navjot Singh Sidhu has used it to become Punjab Congress president. But no one has provided justice,” he said. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who was a member of the previous special investigation team (SIT) which probed the 2015 police firing cases, also attended the event but he did not address the gathering.Talking to mediapersons, Kunwar Vijay said he had come to pay homage to the victims. “It’s been six years since the incident, but justice has not been served. Even the Amarinder Singh-led government acted to save the Badals. The truth was revealed in the investigations conducted by me in Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing incidents. While chargesheets have been quashed in the Kotkapura firing case, the court proceedings in the Behbal Kalan case are still undergoing in the court and justice can be served if the government properly prosecutes this case,” he said. “I have filed an appeal in a double bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court against the quashing order. Earlier, I was hoping that the state government will help me but since they have appointed the accused’s counsel as advocate general I have lost that hope. Even now I think they will get my appeal rejected. Justice will be served if AAP forms government in Punjab,” he added. Earlier in the day, a protest was held at Kotkapura terming the day as ‘lahnat dehadda’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-sixth-anniversary-will-keep-fighting-for-justice-till-culprits-punished-say-victims-families-sikh-hardliners-101634243573295.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir among SAD leaders detained during protest against new BSF role||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, along with party leaders and workers were taken into preventive custody on way to the Raj Bhawan here on Thursday while they were protesting against the Centre’s decision to extend BSF’s jurisdiction. They were taken to a police station and later released. “The manner in which chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has colluded with the Centre to surrender half of the state is condemnable,” Sukhbir said while addressing the party cadres outside the governor house. Former ministers Bikram Singh Majithia, Daljit Singh Cheema and Surjit Singh Rakhra, MLA NK Sharma and youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana also courted arrest. Akali workers raised slogans against the Congress party and the BJP for hatching “anti-Punjab” conspiracy. Earlier, addressing a gathering when stopped from proceeding towards the Raj Bhawan, Sukhbir said this was the second time that the Centre impinged on the rights of Punjab after three farm laws enacted last year. Now, it is taking control of the law and order in half the state,” he added. Terming the move as an attack on the federal structure of the country, he said now the Darbar Sahab, Durgiana Mandir and Ram Tirath temple will come under control of central forces. He said chief minister Channi in a meeting with the Union home minister Amit Shah on October 5 had allegedly agreed to the move of enhancing BSF jurisdiction. Majithia said the move reminded of the militancy days when central forces controlled the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-among-sad-leaders-detained-during-protest-against-new-bsf-role-101634243514556.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt amends transfer order, MP Dimpa’s brother posted as SSP again||In a late-night twist, the Punjab government on Wednesday amended its order to transfer SBS Nagar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmanbir Singh Gill as assistant inspector general, Punjab Armed Police (PAP) in Jalandhar. The decision was taken after Gill’s brother and Congress’ Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Dimpa took up the matter with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, it is learnt. In the earlier orders issued by the state government around 8:30pm, Gill was shifted out as SBS Nagar SSP. As many as 50 IPS and PPS officers, including 14 SSPs, were transferred. But Dimpa saw the order as an embarrassment as Gill, an IPS officer, had locked horns with ruling party’s Nawanshahr MLA Angad Singh over the arrest of the latter’s supporters by the local police only a few days back. The MP also expressed his strong displeasure with home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa, source said. MLA Angad’s family has had old rivalry with the Dimpas over a dispute over the ownership of a transport company in Amritsar. Later, the state home department was asked to issue separate orders to post Gill as Fazilka SSP in place of Deepak Hillori. Gill joined duty on Thursday. Gill was not accommodated as SSP as most of the Congress MLAs consulted over postings are learnt to have raised questions over the cop’s style of functioning. Anagd, supported by some MLAs, also put his foot down with Channi insisting on Gill’s removal as SSP. The matter has also reached Congress leader Harish Chaudhary who has a strong say in the party’s Punjab affairs as the high command’s nominee. Dimpa, when contacted, denied having put any pressure on the government regarding his brother’s posting. “I have learnt that there was some confusion over the first orders,” he said. “This charge of PAP AIG was with him when he served as SSP in Moga and SBS Nagar. The earlier orders must have mentioned this charge only and this mistake was rectified,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-amends-transfer-order-mp-dimpa-s-brother-posted-as-ssp-again-101634243333170.html

Barjinder Singh, a US citizen, who runs Narao Punjab Mission NGO and hails from Hussainpur, will bear the entire cost of the school, estimated to be around ₹25 lakh per year. Barjinder had immigrated to the US around 25 years ago. “We have signed an agreement with the Red Cross Society to bear the expenses of the school’s operations for two years. We have cleared the pending salaries of the teachers, renovated the infrastructure and also got financed two buses for transportation of the special kids,” Barjinder said. Former SBS Nagar deputy commissioner Shena Aggarwal said since the administration was short of monetary grants, the NRI approached at the right time with the proposal to adopt the school. “I am hopeful that the kids will be able to continue their education and have access to better facilities at the school,” Aggarwal said. School principal Lakshmi Devi said the new arrangement has given a new hope to the school. “The staff is now motivated to serve the special kids with more zeal and passion,” she said. Barjinder said currently there were 31 kids in the school as many left in absence of transportation facility and other issues. “We will try to get them back to touch the figure of 50 students. We will rope in specialist staff and doctors for the students and also run vocational and skill-development courses,” he said. Five years ago, Barjinder had adopted the primary school at his native village. His NGO has also been organising sports events for the youth in the nearby villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nri-adopts-school-for-special-children-in-sbs-nagar-101634243213130.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal befooling people with eye on Punjab polls: Channi||A day after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal made a slew of promises to industrialists in Jalandhar, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday said the Delhi CM was making false promises to the people of Punjab with eyes of next year’s assembly polls. Terming Kejriwal as an “opportunist”, Channi said “such ill-conceived and politically motivated moves” will not help the AAP convener to capture electoral ground in Punjab. He said Kejriwal is not even remotely concerned with the development of state and welfare of its people being an “outsider” and was solely eying on the vote bank of “one or another section”. In a statement, Channi said Kejriwal was unaware that Punjab government was already providing round-the-clock electricity supply. On Delhi CM’s promise to end ‘inspector raj’, the CM said it was already a thing of the past as 17,589 inspections were conducted in the last four-and-half years through central inspection system. On Kejriwal’s comments on VAT refunds, the CM said ₹1,700 crore were released to the business community under the said head in the last three years and only ₹70 crore was pending. He said Punjab enjoys peaceful labour relations and no major strike was witnessed in the last three decades and there are no domicile restrictions in hiring the labour. Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra and industries and commerce minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli also countered the Delhi CM on a number of issues he had raised in Jalandhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-befooling-people-with-eye-on-punjab-polls-channi-101634242973003.html

In a letter to the chief secretaries and chief electoral officers of the poll-bound states on Wednesday, the commission pointed out that the terms of the legislative assemblies of Punjab, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa are ending on different dates in March, 2022. The term of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly ends on May 14 next year. It is usual for the poll panel to issue such directions ahead of Lok Sabha or assembly elections to ensure that officials do not interfere in the poll process in any way and the democratic exercise remains free and fair. “The commission further desires that no officer/official, against whom a criminal case is pending in any court of law, be associated with/deployed on election-related duty,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/assembly-polls-shift-officials-posted-in-home-districts-ec-tells-punjab-4-other-states-101634242793074.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||HC seeks reply from Punjab on plea for FIR against Bathinda hospital staff over HIV positive blood transfusion||The high court on Friday sought response from Punjab government and Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) on a plea seeking registration of an FIR against hospital staff members of the civil hospital for alleged transfusion of HIV+ blood to a woman in May last year.The court, acting on the plea of the Bathinda woman, has sought response by November 30. The plea seeks registration of FIR against Dr Maninder Singh, senior medical officer (SMO), civil hospital, and two former officials of the blood bank for alleged transfusion of HIV+ blood to her.The court was informed that when she was admitted in the civil hospital for treatment of anaemia on May 6, 2020, she was transfused HIV + blood by Richu Goyal, former medical laboratory technician. It was further alleged that Dr Krishna Goyal, in-charge of blood bank, came to know about this episode, but she did not inform about it to her superior officers. According to the plea, it was on October 5, 2020 that a committee of doctors submitted an inquiry report to Dr Maninder Singh confirming these facts. Dr Maninder Singh, the plea alleges, did not take any steps to locate the petitioner. When she was contacted at a very late stage in August, 2021, the woman tested HIV +ve. Upon further examination, her husband, and seven- year- old daughter, too, tested HIV +ve, having been infected from the petitioner, the plea says, adding that all the three were granted admission for regular treatment in ART Centre of Civil Hospital, Bathinda on August 28. In this manner, the life of all the three victims has been ruined due to the gross negligence on the part hospital authorities. The Bathinda police registered an FIR on October 10 against one Baldv Singh Romana, senior medical technician, who had handed over blood bags containing HIV + Blood to Richu Goyal, and Krishna Goyal, the plea says. The gross negligence on the part of SMO, in not contacting the patient for about 10 months, after coming to know of transfusion of HIV+ ve blood, resulted in delayed treatment, and during the intervening period, her husband and daughter also got infected. Thus, criminal proceedings must be launched against these staff members as well, the plea stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-reply-from-punjab-on-plea-for-fir-against-bathinda-hospital-staff-over-hiv-blood-transfusion-101634242252992.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chattopadhyaya gets additional charge of vigilance bureau chief director||In a significant development on a day when Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu met central party leaders in Delhi, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday gave additional charge of chief director, Vigilance Bureau, to 1986-batch IPS officer S Chattopadhyaya. According to the order, Chattopadhyaya, who is currently posted as special DGP, PSPCL, will be in-charge of bureau till BK Uppal is on leave. This is the second time in three days that the in-charge of vigilance bureau has been changed. BK Upppal had proceeded on one-month leave after Channi replaced Capt Amarinder as the chief minister. On Monday, the government had given the charge to ADGP LK Yadav, who even started sitting at the office, it is learnt. He also released a press statement on Wednesday being bureau’s chief director, ordering issuance of a WhatsApp number for the citizens where they could raise the issue of corruption by officials of his department. Appointment of Chattopadhyaya, who is also a frontrunner for the post of Punjab Police chief, is being seen as a important development at a time when the UPSC is about to send names of three officers from among the panel sent by the state government for appointment of the police chief. 1988-batch IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota had been given the additional charge of the Punjab DGP by chief minister Channi, ignoring Chattopadhyaya despite Navjot Sidhu backing him. The latest move is being seen as the result of Sidhu pulling the strings in Delhi. Sidhu met party’s Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat and Congress general secretary KC Venugopal on Thursday. Chattopadhyaya had also challenged the appointment of previous DGP Dinkar Gupta and took his fight to the Supreme Court, which reserved the judgment in the case. In 2018, he got mired in a controversy while carrying out a Punjab and Haryana high court-mandated probe, when he, in a move where he apparently overstepped his brief, informed the court that he was also probing the role of the then Punjab DGP Suresh Arora and DGP (intelligence) Dinkar Gupta in the drugs case allegedly involving SSP Raj Jit Singh. On May 8, 2018, a Chattopadhyaya-led SIT submitted its final report to the court. He sprang a surprise by submitting a second report that was not signed by the other two SIT members. The matter is still pending with the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chattopadhyaya-gets-additional-charge-of-vigilance-bureau-chief-director-101634241773011.html
15-10-2021||Chandigarh||HC defers hearing in Bhola drug racket to October 26||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday deferred the hearing in the 2013 suo motu plea in the multi-crore Bhola drug racket case to October 26.The case was taken up on Thursday afternoon by the newly constituted bench of justice AG Masih and justice Ashok Kumar Verma and after a brief hearing, it posted the matter for October 26. The judges told lawyers that during the Dussehra break, they would examine the case record and orders passed from time to time so that they can acquaint themselves with the case.The bench was to frame various issues on the drug menace in the state so that it can be dealt with separately, but the hearing had to be adjourned due to paucity of time. The court is yet to decide whether the sealed cover reports filed by various agencies are to be opened. Earlier, appearing for former DGP (prisons) Shashi Kant, senior advocate Gurminder Singh listed out issues related to drugs menace in Punjab and submitted that sealed cover status reports are one part of it and exhorted for holistic approach for eradication of the menace. In 2013, suo motu proceedings were initiated on his letter.In his submissions, senior advocate Anupam Gupta said the sealed cover status reports dealt with culpability of people in high places. If the issue is not dealt with on priority, it would be a tragedy. He also suggested that the court can open the reports for its own understanding of the issue and if it do not find any substance, can act accordingly, but the reports ought to be opened.Punjab advocate general APS Deol reiterated the state’s resolve to act against the drug menace and highlighted immediacy of action against those involved and importance of sealed cover reports so that prosecution agencies can act swiftly. In August, an application was filed by advocate Navkiran Singh seeking opening of three crucial reports, one by then head of the special task force HS Sidhu, another by then assistant director, enforcement directorate, Niranjan Singh and the third report/opinion by a committee headed by then additional chief secretary (home) Dr Nirmaljeet Singh Kalsi. All these reports are mainly on allegations of involvement of some high-profile politicians of the state. Acting on the plea, the court had advanced hearing by a almost a month from November. During the hearing, Deol has also referred to another set of reports submitted in 2018 by an SIT led by Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, to probe role of police officers in the drug racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-defers-hearing-in-bhola-drug-racket-to-october-26-101634241292803.html

Channi’s wife Dr Kamaljit Kaur and elder brother Manmohan Singh were also present. The CM’s family stayed at the farmhouse for around 45 minutes and had tea with Amarinder. The former CM had not attended the wedding last week as he was in Delhi. The chief minister’s office termed the visit personal. However, some Congress leaders say it was an effort by the CM to placate Amarinder, who is upset the way he was displaced by the party high command from the top post last month. “He (Channi) is trying to project his image as the one who takes everyone in the party along,” said a cabinet minister requesting anonymity. Channi took over from Amarinder last month after a prolonged political slugfest within the state Congress unit when some cabinet ministers opposed his style of functioning and sought his removal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-calls-on-amarinder-at-his-farmhouse-in-siswan-101634240335778.html

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ issues, unemployment key topics ahead of Ellenabad bypoll||The three farm laws enacted by the Union government last year, water issues and unemployment are the key topics being taken up ahead of the Ellenabad bypoll (October 30).The Opposition parties – the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Congress – are raising the issue of farmers’ stir against three farm laws while the ruling BJP has been making promises of providing canal water for irrigating the fields and ensuring development of the constituency.The agrarian community in the constituency is talking about farm laws, paddy procurement, damaged cotton crop, dilapidated roads, rise of drug cases among youth, canal water, rise in prices of diesel and shortage of fertilisers, etc.While canvassing in the Ellenabad constituency, INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala, who is seeking fourth consecutive term from the rural dominated seat, said this is not an election to elect an MLA but to give a referendum against the Centre’s three farm laws.“The Congress had given birth to these farm laws and the previous Haryana government led by former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had adopted contract farming law by allotting land on lease to Ambani and Adani. The BJP has enacted the laws proposed by the previous Congress government and it is the right time to teach them a lesson,” he said.“More than 700 farmers have lost their lives but the government is still adamant and not accepting the farmers’ demands. The ruling government has resorted to lathi-charge on farmers on eight occasions and farmers will not forget this,” he added.Ellenabad constituency is witnessing third bypoll since 1967 after the formation of Haryana. On previous two occasions, Om Prakash Chautala in 1970 and his son Abhay Singh Chautala in 2010 had won from this seat.No family member of the Chautala clan has faced defeat from here and the INLD has been on the winning side here since 1996.Meanwhile, Abhay Chautala’s former aide and Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal has been attacking him and the rulling BJP for “betraying the voters”.“Farmers have been camping on Delhi borders for a long time and the Union government is not paying heed to their demands. The farmers are facing irrigation and drinking water problems and Abhay Chautala has failed to sort out these issues. The roads are also in a dilapidated state. The voters have decided to get rid of Abhay Chautala,” Pawan said, while canvassing in his constituency on Wednesday.Pawan is also banking on the Beniwal clan and appealing to them to elect their “son” as the next MLA from Ellenabad.But, experts believe, his uncle and former Darba Kalan MLA Jagdish Beniwal and his wife Vidya Devi (ex-Rajya Sabha MP and former Darba MLA) are a cause of problem for him as they are still associated with the INLD.On the other hand, BJP nominee Gobind Kanda and his brother Gopal Kanda, an MLA from Sirsa, have launched high-level canvassing in village. They are facing protests from farmers but still are able to make their speeches in villages.Gobind Kanda said the BJP government has fulfilled 20-year-long demand of farmers by releasing water in Dhani Sheranwali distributary canal and this will help in irrigating fields.“The BJP-JJP coalition has given a transparent government and Haryana is the only state in country to procure 11 crops on the minimum support price. Some people are misleading people over the farmers’ issues. The BJP has in fact, strengthened the farmers. Chautala has dragged people in a bypoll which has no major significance on the government’s performance,” he added.As per information, INLD supremo OP Chautala, Congress’ former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the ruling government’s star campaigners, led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and other senior leaders, will start canvassing for their nominees from next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-issues-unemployment-key-topics-ahead-of-ellenabad-bypoll-101634240153393.html

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||BSF jurisdiction row: Don’t politicise issues of national security, says BJP||Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma on Thursday condemned opposition parties for criticising the Union government’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) to a 50-kilometre belt along the International Border. He said the national security was of utmost importance and leaders should refrain from politicising the issue. In a statement, Sharma castigated the opposition parties for indulging in politics in which the nation and nationhood were secondary. Sharma said the incidents of drones, tiffin bombs and drug trafficking had increased immensely and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had gone on record repeatedly that Punjab, being a border state, was being targeted by Pakistan . Sharma also flayed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for criticising the Union government’s decision. “He (Channi) himself met the Prime Minister and home minister appraising them of the grave security situation in the state. All border states have come under this notification as national security was most pivotal to the survival of the country. Politicians should refrain from petty politics,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-jurisdiction-row-don-t-politicise-issues-of-national-security-says-bjp-101634239792789.html

We are supporting the farmers’ protest for a long time and will continue to do so until their demands are met,” he said.“We have also decided to oppose the BJP in poll-bound Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and other states.

15-10-2021||Chandigarh||Army hawildar held for ‘sharing sensitive information’ with Pakistan||Police have arrested Rohit Kumar, 35, a hawildar working with the army in Bhopal, from his village in Ambala on Wednesday night for allegedly leaking sensitive information to Pakistan through internet.Police said Kumar has been working with the 68 Engineering Regiment and had come on holiday to his native Korwa Khurd village in Shahazadpur block.The arrest was made after Rajesh Kumar, station in-charge of Shahazadpur police station, received a tip-off from his source that the suspect is working as an informer in exchange for money and has relations with the intelligence agents of the Pak army.“He was sharing intelligence information to the neighbouring country through his mobile phone and other means on the internet. He has already shared such information with Pak agents and has two mobile numbers on which the agents usually contact him,” the police officer said in his complaint.Rohit Kumar was booked under the Official Secrets Act at Shahazadpur police station.Police said due to seriousness of the case, a joint team was constituted by SSP Hamid Akhtar to raid his house and later transferred the investigation to CIA, Naraingarh.“He was presented before a court and sent to seven-day police remand. He joined the army in 2012,” a police PRO said.Inspector Surender, in-charge of the CIA unit, said he had come on leave to his home and reached here around Sunday.“Other details like his service tenure with the army and information shared are part of the investigation that will come up during his remand,” he said.DSP (Naraingarh) Anil Kumar said agencies concerned have already been informed about the development and will take up their part of the investigation accordingly.After the arrest, the suspect’s father Narayan Singh also wrote to the SHO stating that his son is innocent and had gone to bank with his passbook.“My wife Anita Devi is in a serious condition and might die anytime,” he said, in his appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/army-hawildar-held-for-sharing-sensitive-information-with-pakistan-101634238832516.html

15-10-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to provide location monitoring wrist-bands to trekkers for emergencies||The Uttarakhand government is planning to provide location monitoring wrist-bands to trekkers and mountaineers so that their location can be tracked through satellite devices during emergency situations. This will help the authorities to rescue such people if they go missing or get caught in extreme weather conditions in the higher reaches of the Uttarakhand Himalayas. Chief Secretary SS Sandhu gave directions to officers concerned during the review of the tourism department on Thursday. Sandhu said such location monitoring wrist-bands should be provided to trekkers and mountaineers so that their location can be tracked during emergency situations and they can be saved by rescue teams swiftly. Many mountaineers have lost their lives in the state, after they went missing or were caught in extreme weather events during mountaineering and trekking expeditions. Earlier this month, rescuers recovered the bodies of four Indian Navy personnel who went missing during an avalanche on Mt Trishul at an altitude of 6,700 metres in Chamoli district. Earlier on September 24, an expedition of the Indian Army to scale Satopanth peak in Gangotri National Park, found the body of a mountaineer who was part of an expedition of the army sent to scale the same peak in 2005 in which a few mountaineers had gone missing. Satopanth peak which is 7075 m high is the second highest peak in the Gangotri National Park situated in the Garhwal Himalayas in the state. In June this year, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) rescued two trekkers, including one foreigner from Slovenia (a country in Central Europe), from the Hemkund Ghangaria trek route in Chamoli district. In September 2019, a 37-year-old Hungarian mountaineer Peter Wittek had gone missing during an expedition to the 7120-metre-high Mount Trishul located in Garhwal Himalayas in Chamoli district. The missing mountaineer was part of the six-member Singaporean-Vietnamese-Hungarian-Mauritian mountaineering expedition to Mount Trishul between September 13 to October 8. IDuring the review meeting on Thursday, the chief secretary, while saying that the Char Dham yatra is seasonal, emphasised that Uttarakhand has immense potential for off-season tourism too. “Schemes should be framed to promote off-season tourism in the state and officials should explore more possibilities in this regard,” he said. Stressing on tourism promotion in the state, Sandhu said more work needs to be done on improving connectivity in the state. “Work should be started at the earliest on the construction of helipads and heliports in the state. Priority should be given to building helipads and heliports in and around tourist spots in the state. Those areas, which have lagged in tourism development due to connectivity issues should be brought under focus,” he said The chief secretary also pointed out that while providing facilities for tourists, care should be taken that all age brackets are catered to. “Young tourists love technology. apps and a website should be designed where young tourists get all sorts of information. But for elders, who are not so tech-savvy, information should be provided through offline means. The tourist spots should also be made child-friendly,” he said Sandhu also directed the officials to develop resorts in such areas which have good tourism potential but have not been developed due to lack of facilities. “These resorts should be initially run by the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam and Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam and later after they should be promotable, or should be sold to private players. The money raised should then be used in the development of these tourist places The chief secretary said his directions should be implemented under||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-to-provide-location-monitoring-wrist-bands-to-trekkers-for-emergencies-101634236733382.html
15-10-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Why Queen’s gambit pawns victory for steady (forever) learning curve||At the moment, I have 659 wins against 612 losses and 58 draws in online competition play in the Blitz format. A win percentage of just about 50%.But that’s not why I play chess.I started playing at 16 (terribly old to have any prospects of making any waves) and lost close to 25 games before I won my first. It was in junior college (Grade 11-12) that I got to play chess regularly with my childhood friends Abbas, Satyan and Jitendra Singh Tomar (Jitu), Saju Sebastian and JP Shukla. Most days we played in the college gymkhana after badminton and then at Saju’s place or at JP’s, since they lived nearby. Matches were intense and heated arguments and tantrums were common.It wasn’t until the first year of professional college that I made a wave in any chess playing circles. I was 19 and in the intra-college tournament, I somehow made it to the quarter finals where I defeated one of our college professors, who happened to be the defending champion, 2-1 (a draw, a draw and a win over three games in that order, which gave me the match).I think it was the shock of the first-game draw that threw the professor since it was rare for him to be beaten or held. It made me an instant celebrity, but my 15 minutes of fame lasted only till the semi-finals where I lost 3-0.The real story for me was Kim Loon Lee’s quarterfinal loss. Kim was a chess whiz among us first-year students, apart from being a mischievous and polite teenager. He was one of my first friends in hotel management college. He and Sandy (Sandeep Nadkar) were chess buddies and could be found playing chess whenever they had any spare time in that first year.Kim lived in Khar with his father and elder brother, Henri. I remember my visits to Kim’s house and his father preparing garlic noodles and soup and chicken stir-fry. His father was a treasure trove of philosophy and life-stories and I enjoyed conversations with him. He also had a fantastic collection of vinyl records, all of which I got when they shifted to a new music system and CDs a couple of years later. I still have the collection of vinyls, as much for the eclectic music as for the kind gesture.A creative, diligent and multifaceted person, Kim taught me many things, many, many, things. We used to spend time working, studying, discussing life, philosophy, strategy, cooking styles, evolution of culinary styles in different regions, palmistry, graphology, numerology among other matters. And we discussed all this while hanging out, while working at a food stall in between serving customers, while cooking and tending bar at a party that Kim was catering for, while waiting tables after college, or while studying for exams.In chess, he introduced me to the Sicilian Defence, which I practiced for many years after. He was also the person who introduced me to anti-chess, for which as it turned I had a natural gift given its destructive, army-devouring purpose! I had finally found my calling in chess: playing the opposite of chess on a chess board.I played little chess thereafter and then eventually forgot all about it. Till a few years ago when our kids wanted to learn to play chess. So we got ourselves chess.com accounts and all of us are attacking, defending, moving forward and diagonally and backward at least for half-an-hour every day. We have a hand-crafted chess board with brass pieces, but we avoid that since most days one or the other of the kids smashes the board after a loss with the opponent rubbing it in. The online chess account is good because you get to play people from all over the world. There are a lot of puzzles and computer bot practice buddies and theory and study material, but the biggest advantage is the opportunity to improve by playing rather than by studying games played by others. The kids watch some of my games and they seem to understand that even when I lose game after game, what is important is that I am aware of my mistakes and eliminating the weaknesses in the game and that speed comes from knowing what you are going to do for every move your opponent plays and not to get fazed if there’s a surprise. They are learning that it is important to forget victories and defeats since both are a distraction and to focus only on performance and improvement and to enjoy the playing of the game. They are learning to vent their anger when they lose, throw a tantrum when they are on a losing streak, enjoy their wins and to improve their behaviour along with their play.I don’t invest much time analysing my games. I play. The same opening and the same subsequents again and again. I have been with the Queen Pawn opening for more than three years now. As a result, my first 20-odd moves for any set of black or white opponent moves are now automatic. It’s a work in progress and whether they will lead to victory is not my concern. The focus is to reduce uncertainty.A classic test of this is to play the 3-minute Blitz. Or the 1-minute Bullet or the 30-second Hyper formats. 20 moves run out pretty fast in a short format. I lose games regularly and no shame in it. Chess was always about improving my real-life decision making response time.As a thumb rule, I never resign even when the position seems hopeless. This is because I take play as seriously as life, and live life as care-freely as I play. I have learned that just as I make mistakes, so do others. So I keep playing to my game plan and two out of five times, opponents give me an opportunity to get back into the match. Life, on average, can be fair if you stay the course.It was Jitu who reminded me of our childhood underlying philosophy of play a few years ago. As of the last decade, he’s taken up badminton and Iron Man preparations seriously to keep himself active and healthy. “It’s all in self-belief and desire to keep pushing your limits. Winning is a byproduct. Learning about myself is the most important part of the journey.”If I can improve my understanding of myself and of my real-time performance in life, then a win percentage of just about 50% seems a fair outcome in life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-why-queen-s-gambit-pawns-victory-for-steady-forever-learning-curve-101634236552751.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||SDMC launches smart parking app for real time parking info, booking||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday launched a smart parking mobile application, MyParkings, which will allow users to remotely view slot availability at 145 surface parking lots and eight multilevel parking sites and book slots accordingly.The app has been developed with the help of BECIL, a public sector undertaking of the ministry of information and broadcasting, and will be available for download from next week. Gradually, more parking sites will be added to the app, the civic body officials said.SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said the app will enable cashless payments of parking fee and the database will be linked with Vahan app, Fastag and the traffic police’s e-challan database.SDMC and BECIL have signed a memorandum of understanding according to which the BECIL will be the implementing agency for the app-based smart parking system in the jurisdiction of SDMC.Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said the parking app will smoothen the process of booking parking slots. “With the use of this app, which has cashless and paperless transaction mode, a lot of paper will also be saved on a daily basis,” he added.Of the five local bodies in Delhi, only New Delhi Municipal Council currently operates a parking management app and the south corporation, which manages 25,000 parking lots, will become the second body to do so.SDMC commissioner Gynesh Bharti said, “BECIL will bear the complete cost of development and maintenance of the app-based system, the capital cost of the server and its allied hardware and software.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-launches-smart-parking-app-for-real-time-parking-info-booking-101634234873237.html

The daily fire counts in Punjab and Haryana combined are less than 250 at the moment. We are already in mid-October, only a week away from the peak stubble burning window from late October to early November, when the count is expected to go up to 3,000-4,000 fires a day,” said L.S. Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW.She added, “In the coming weeks, with changes in meteorological conditions, emissions from local and regional sources will only cause deterioration in air quality. Therefore, the Delhi government should use the air quality forecast and the Decision Support System developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) to target prominent sources of pollution and roll out the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures in advance to prevent severe air quality conditions in the city.”Officials in Punjab too said stubble burning has picked up pace in the border belt of Majha, including Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran districts, where the harvest of paddy is on in full swing.On October 13, a total of 132 events were captured by the satellite in Punjab. On the same day in 2019, 117 active fire events were captured, while there were 240 active fire events in the state in 2020.While Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) secretary said they have begun imposing fines of violators, officials from the pollution body, on the condition of anonymity, said they are wary of taking action against farmers who have been protesting against the three controversial farm laws across Punjab and at Delhi’s borders.PPCB secretary Krunesh Garg said, “The PPCB has started the process to identify farms where stubble burning has been identified by satellite and fines have been imposed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stubble-fires-count-likely-to-hit-4-000-by-month-end-experts-101634234813259.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||DDA to hold two-day public hearing on draft Delhi Master Plan 2041||The Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) plan to hold a public hearing on the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 -- expected to be attended by 17,162 people -- over two days next week has come under criticism from civil society members who claim that the hearings are hurried and demanded more time for the discussions. The public hearing, which will be held online due to Covid-19 pandemic, will be held on October 18 and 20.Rajiv Kakria, convener of Save Our City campaign, a collective of RWAs, activists and others, said, “We all have spent so much time carefully going through the MPD-2041 provisions and drafting our suggestions/objections. If 7,000-8,000 people are put in one slot, how much time will one get?”The draft MPD-2041, which is the vision document for the city’s development for the next two decades, was put in the public domain in June this year.The land-owning agency received over 33,000 comments on the MPD-2021 but only 17,162 people have been given slots in the two-day public hearing.“The schedule represents only 17,000 names instead of 33,000 citizens who filed suggestions and objections... going by the schedule, each person will not even get 30 seconds to voice their feedback,” read a statement by Mein Bhi Dilli Campaign, a collective of over 40 civil society groups.Sabyasachi Das, former planning commission in-charge at DDA, said, “...the public hearing should be held for at least 20 days so that people get a chance to share their viewpoint.”When contacted, a senior DDA official said, “All those who have registered queries and suggestions will be heard. If more time is required, DDA is open to that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddato-hold-two-day-public-hearing-on-draft-delhi-master-plan-2041-101634234512938.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||Allow Chhath Puja festivities in Delhi, CM Arvind Kejriwal urges LG Anil Baijal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday wrote to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and urged him to allow Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi with adherence to Covid-19 protocols.“People of Delhi celebrate Chhath Puja every year with a lot of devotion and with a strong belief that it would bring good health and prosperity. In Delhi, the Covid-19 situation has been under control for the past few months. In my opinion, people should be allowed to celebrate Chhath Puja with the necessary regulations. Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, and other neighbouring states have allowed it with necessary protocols. I request you convene a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and consider allowing Chhath Puja in Delhi too,” said Kejriwal in his letter to Baijal.Baijal is the DDMA chairperson and Kejriwal is vice-chairperson.The chief minister shared a copy of the letter on Twitter.In a statement issued later in the day, the chief minister’s office highlighted how the city used to have 72 spots for celebrations of Chhath Puja five years ago, and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government increased that to 1,200-odd locations, with facilities such as drinking water, toilets, changing rooms, power connections, shower areas, proper drainage, medical camps, adequate lights, concrete pathways, etc.A senior official in the lieutenant governor’s office said, “The chief secretary has been asked to convene a meeting of DDMA for consideration and decision on the issue.”On October 12, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, urging the Centre to draft protocols and issue necessary orders with regard to the festival, essentially asking for broad guidelines for Delhi to draft its own regulations regarding Chhath Puja.The Bharatiya Janata Party has been protesting over the prohibition of Chhath festivities, and asked the Delhi government to urge the DDMA to allow the celebrations just as Durga Puja and Ramlila were allowed with adherence to Covid protocols.The festival celebrated with fervour involves taking a dip in the water bodies and worshipping the Sun. It is a major festival for people from Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, who have a sizeable presence in Delhi.On September 30, the DDMA issued an order prohibiting the celebration of Chhath Puja at riverbanks, near water bodies, open grounds, in temples, and other public spaces. Chhath Puja in public spaces was prohibited last year too because of the pandemic. This year, it will be celebrated on November 10 -- which is six days after Diwali.Between last year’s festive season and this year’s, Delhi witnessed two distinct waves of Covid-19. At its worst, the capital city recorded a seven-day average of 25,000 new cases per recorded per day and a test positivity rate exceeding 30% in the last week of April this year, which left the city’s health care infrastructure overwhelmed and a severe crisis of medical oxygen further contributed to high number of deaths.This year, however, the DDMA left room open for celebration of other festivals such as the ongoing Ramlila, Durga Puja, and Dussehra, with limited restrictions such as no rallies, professions, fairs, carnivals and shops inside and outside the venues, restricitng maximum crowd size in proportion with the setting capacity, and complete ban on firecrackers.On October 9, Kejriwal said the DDMA prohibited the celebrations because of the inherent risk of transmission in the rituals which involve gathering in large numbers.On October 12, BJP member of Parliament from Northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari was injured while protesting near Kejriwal’s residence in Civil Lines against a ban on the celebration of Chhath Puja.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said on Thursday: “It is because of the pressure created by the BJP that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal -- whose government was against Chhath celebrations -- has today written to the lieutenant governor to allow Chhath celebrations to take place. I congratulate all devotees from Poorvanchal (region) who live in Delhi and celebrate the festival.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/allow-chhath-puja-festivities-in-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-urges-lg-anilbaijal-101634234511803.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||Pre-emptive Grap measures may not be implemented in Delhi from today||A day after the air quality commission recommended pre-emptive curbs and restrictions to check pollution in Delhi under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) from October 15, senior officials of the Union environment ministry on Thursday said the matter was still under consideration.Officials aware of the matter said the sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM) were reviewing the Grap measures that will be implemented in Delhi pre-emptively in the coming days.HT reported on Thursday that CAQM members, in a meeting on Tuesday, suggested that curbs such as ban on use of coal-fired ovens, and activities such as routine mechanised sweeping should begin in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) from October 15 irrespective of the air quality at the time. They suggested that all ‘poor’ and some ‘very poor’ protocols of the Grap may be activated.On Thursday, a senior ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) official who asked not to be named said, “Grap is already there, and to implement the same a sub-committee has already been formed. However, whether any modified Grap, unlike what used to be in earlier years will be there, is still under consideration.”A CAQM member also said, “We are considering if it’s feasible, and we do want to take strong action.”Grap is a set of emergency measures approved by the Supreme Court in 2016, to list out a set of institutionalised measures to be taken when air quality deteriorates and reaches a certain level. The emergency action plan kicks in from October 15 and continues to be in force till March 31 depending on the air quality of the region.The Capital and its adjoining areas are plunged into a health crisis in the days leading to winter as winds bring in toxic smoke from farm fires in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab. Local pollution, such as dust and transport emissions, as well as a dip in the temperature, make the problem worse, often pushing pollution levels to alarming levels.On Thursday, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was at 182, worsening from Wednesday’s 171. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.This year, Delhi recorded an AQI under ‘poor’ category last on July 2, when it was recorded at 245. On July 1 too, the AQI was 266, under the poor category. Till then, the air quality in Delhi has remained under either satisfactory or moderate categories.In a meeting chaired by the CAQM with the government agencies in Delhi-NCR on Tuesday, the pollution monitoring body recommended that even though the updates from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) suggest that the air quality in Delhi is likely to remain in the ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ zone in the coming days because of high wind speed and a forecast of rain on October 17-18, the Grap measures listed under the ‘poor’ category and some measures under the ‘very poor’ bracket should kick in pre-emptively from October 15, to control the local pollution sources.“The subcommittee was of the view that in addition to actions under ‘poor’ to the ‘moderate’ category, some of the actions under the ‘very poor’ category should also commence from October 15, though the air quality index (AQI) is expected to remain in the ‘satisfactory’ to the ‘moderate’ category range in the national capital,” said the CAQM recommendations.Environment experts said while Grap lists measures that can be enforced when a city’s pollution reaches a certain level, the pollution control agencies and the CAQM has the authority to enforce these measures pre-emptively if they think that these measures can prevent deterioration of the air quality.“Grap lists very clearly the actions that need to be taken by each agency when the air quality slips below a certain level, but the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has the authority to suggest restrictions pre-emptively. So, if the CAQM also thinks that certain measures can control pollution levels in the coming months, they can recommend and enforce pre-emptive curbs,” said Rahul Choudhary, senior environment lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/preemptive-grap-measures-may-not-be-implemented-in-delhi-from-today-101634234451953.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||2 railway cops on patrol duty run over by train near Delhi's Anand Vihar station||Two railway police personnel – one from RPF and the other from RPSF – patrolling railway tracks near Anand Vihar railway station were killed after they were run over by the Dehradun Shatabdi train around Wednesday midnight, the railway police unit of the Delhi Police said.The deceased were identified as head constable Kailash Chand (58) from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and constable Ranjan from 10th battalion of Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF). Chand originally belonged to Bulandshahr while Ranjan was a native of Gaya in Bihar. They were posted at Anand Vihar railway station from 2016 and 2019 respectively.“Their families have been informed about the deaths,” said deputy commissioner of police (railways) Harendra Kumar Singh.DCP Singh said that they received information regarding the accident at around at 12.40 am on Thursday.During enquiry, the DCP said, it was learnt that the two were on patrolling duty from 7 pm to 6 am as per duty roster of the RPF.“The driver of the train (Dehradun Shatabdi), Malkhan Singh, stated that the two were standing on the track on which the train was passing, and checking a train on the other track with a flashlight. Malkhan pressed the horn but the two failed to notice it and came under it. Their bodies were shifted to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital mortuary,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi2-railway-cops-on-patrol-duty-run-over-by-train-near-anand-vihar-station-101634234091528.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||Cameras, bag scanners not working, security infrastructure at Delhi courts still||Even as Delhi Police are on high alert in the seven district courts in the Capital since the sensational and shocking killing of gangster Jitender Gogi in a Rohini courtroom last month, several CCTV cameras and x-ray scanners are not functioning in court complexes, according to officials aware of the matter.At the Rohini complex, for example, 25 of the 55 CCTV cameras installed were not functioning, according to the district bar association. And at Tis Hazari court, as many as 68 of the 88 cameras are not working, according to the its bar association.HT spoke to officials in all six of Delhi’s district bar associations (Rouse Avenue court does not have one) on the status of their security equipment. In all, of the 533 CCTV cameras and 48 x-ray scanners across the courts, only 365 and 32 were working, according to the information gathered.The recent killing of gangster Gogi by two gunmen, who posed as lawyers to enter the court, has exposed the loopholes in the security at the courts.When contacted, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana said the police have started auditing the security infrastructure in district courts.Many district courts have reported incidents of shooting earlier as well. In December 2015, a head constable was killed when members of a rival gang opened fire at notorious northeast Delhi gangster Irfan alias Chhenu Pehalwan when he was brought to Karkardooma court. Irfan escaped, but the constable was killed trying to protect the judge. In May 2018, an undertrial was injured when a gangster shot at him at the Tis Hazari court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/many-cameras-and-scanners-don-t-work-at-delhi-courts-101634234033158.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||On Dussehra, RWAs go for light and sound shows to simulate effigy burning||Several resident welfare associations in Delhi, which also organise Dussehra events, have cancelled the effigy burning ritual this year, with the prominent ones going for light and sound shows in adherence to a complete ban on sale, purchase, storage and use of firecrackers in Delhi in the light of potential threat of severe air pollution.“In usual years, we burnt 150-feet high effigies. This year, we have effigies that are 30-feet high. We have light and sound arrangements to act as substitutes for firecrackers. And we are sure that people will enjoy the show. But there will be no real firecrackers in the light of the ban imposed because of the air pollution which affects every resident,” said Arjun Kumar, general secretary of the committee that organises the Luv-Kush Ramlila and Dussehra in the Red Fort ground.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is scheduled to attend the Dussehra event at Red Fort on Friday, and participate in the light and sound show to mark effigy burning without firecrackers, said senior functionaries of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).In Dussehra, effigies of Ravan, Meghnad and Kumbhkarn are commonly burnt in public spaces as a symbolic gesture to mark the victory of good over evil. The annual festival is celebrated across the city – in open grounds, markets, parks, etc – in different scales of grandeur. While some of the most prominent ones are celebrated at Red Fort, old Delhi, GTB Enclave, Shastri Park, Dwarka, and Rohini localities, most neighbourhoods in the city have some minimum arrangements with local resident welfare associations (RWA) acting as organisers.However, most residents’ bodies are not organising Dussehra this year.“One reason is Covid-19 regulations. There can be crowding. There can be violations of mask compliance rules. What if something goes wrong? Who will take the responsibility? Resident welfare bodies are rather trying to avoid unnecessary risks,” said Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, a collective of around 1,800 RWAs in the city.BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA Joint Front, another collective of residents welfare bodies, said: “Another reason is the ban on firecrackers. People in Delhi have to suffer because of severe air pollution every year and now they are quite aware of it. Residents welfare groups are doing their best to avoid contributing to pollution. So, most of them are serious about the restrictions.”The complete ban on fire crackers is part of the Delhi government’s currently applicable action plan to fight air pollution. A similar ban was imposed last year ahead of Diwali. This year, it was imposed on September 15, ahead of the entire festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/on-dussehra-rwas-go-for-light-and-sound-shows-to-simulate-effigy-burning-101634233491374.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||2.5k civil defence volunteers to enforce Delhi’s ‘red light on, gaadi off’ drive||At least 2,500 civil defence volunteers will be deployed at 100 traffic intersections across the city to encourage people to switch off their vehicle’s ignition while waiting at traffic signals, as part of the Delhi government’s ‘red light on, gaadi off’ campaign, environment minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday.Rai, who held a joint meeting with senior officials of the environment, revenue departments and Delhi Police to discuss the implementation of the campaign, said the drive will begin on October 18 and will go on till November 18.“Around 10 volunteers each will be deployed at 90 intersections of Delhi and 20 environmental marshals each will be deployed at the 10 major intersections of the city,” Rai said.He added that the campaign will be run in two shifts — the morning shift will be from 8 am to 2 pm, and the evening shift from 2 pm to 8 pm. “Pamphlets appealing to the public on the chief minister’s behalf will also be distributed at intersections,” Rai said.The major inspections where the campaign will be promoted on a large scale are Chandgi Ram Akhara (Ring Road), ITO Chowk, Rajghat Chowk, Tilak Marg-Bhagwan Das Crossing, Kadkadi Mod, Barakhamba-Tolstoy Marg Crossing, Rajesh Pilot Marg-Prithvi Road Crossing, Madhuban Chowk, Moti Bagh (Ring Road) and Peeragarhi Chowk.Noting that the aim of the campaign is to encourage behavioural change among people and to reduce vehicular emissions in the Capital, the minister said that the success of the campaign will be determined by public participation.“We will do our best to ensure maximum public participation in the campaign. To make this campaign successful, we are also reaching out to residents’ welfare associations,” he said.The campaign was first launched last year to save fuel and reduce air pollution in the city and was part of the number of measures by the Delhi government to tackle the annual pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/25k-civil-defence-volunteers-to-enforce-delhi-s-red-light-on-gaadi-off-drive-101634233191164.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||South Delhi civic body to ask proof of debris dumping for building plan approval||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) plans to make it mandatory for builders to produce proof that construction and demolition waste (C&D waste) was disposed of at designated facilities, while applying for building plan approval for new structure. Leader of the house Inderjeet Sehrawat said the move will help in curbing the illegal dumping of C&D waste, which is a major contributor to the dust pollution in the city. “In cases where old structures are being demolished for fresh construction, a deposit slip/receipt for the C&D waste deposited at the designated site will be mandatorily required for processing the new building plan. The approval will not be granted without documentary proof. The works committee has approved the proposal and it will soon be implemented,” he said.The four zones falling under the south corporation are estimated to generate more than 925 tonnes of C&D waste every day. A senior SDMC official explained that 65 designated C&D waste collection sites have been set up where small quantities of waste can be deposited. “Bulk generators are expected to dump the debris at C&D waste processing plant or the sanitary landfill site in Okhla,” the official said, asking not to be named. “After dumping the debris at designated site, the builder would get a receipt as proof which will be later collected by the engineering or building department.”If one takes into the account all five local bodies of the city — the three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board — together they produce more than 3,711 tonnes of construction waste every day and 255 designated sites have been earmarked for depositing such waste. Delhi has four operational C&D waste processing plants while another three are in the pipeline, officials said. The processing plants are located in Jahangirpuri (Burari), Shastri Park, Mundka and Bakkarwala. “The total capacity of these plants is 4,150 tonnes per day (TPD),” the official quoted above said. A 1,000 TPD plant is soon expected to be commissioned in Ranikhera, while another 1,000 TPD plant will be coming up in Tehkhand. The public works department plans to set up a 500 tonne per day plant in Libaspur for which the agency has applied for a change in land-use to the Delhi Development authority.Last week, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) commissioner also said the civic body may cancel approved building plans if owners/builders fail to safely dispose of C&D waste. In the view deteriorating air quality, the junior engineers JEs (building) have been directed to undertake fortnightly inspections of construction sites in their areas. “The owners/ builders will deposit the waste in Shastri Park facility and collect receipts. The JEs will be responsible for collecting the receipts,” an east corporation official said.The lack of sufficient takers for recycled products made from C&D waste such as tiles, bricks, kerb stones etc remains a challenge, officials said. The Delhi government has mandated that local bodies will have to use 5% of such construction material in their various projects while 10% of recycled products need to be used for road works.Highlights and stats:SDMC to make it mandatory to show proof that demolition waste was deposited at designated sites before sanctioning building plansSDMC areas generate 925 tonnes of C&D waste every day65 designated sites for dumping C&D wasteOverall, Delhi generates 3,711.6 tonnes of C&D waste a day, and there 255 dumping sitesFour C&D waste processing plants are operational: Jahangirpuri, Shastri Park, Mundka, BakkarwalaTotal capacity of these plants: 4,150 tonnes per dayUpcoming processing plants: Ranikhera, Tehkhand, LibaspurCity’s handling capacity to increase by 2,500 tonnes per day||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cd-waste-processing-proof-to-be-made-mandatory-for-building-plan-nod-delhi-civic-body-101634232891088.html

The patient’s kin also allegedly assaulted other medical staff and damaged hospital property, police said.A video of the alleged assault was circulated on social media on Wednesday, eliciting condemnation from net users.Police said a case of voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraint with common intention under relevant IPC sections was registered at the Subhash Place police station against the woman’s family members. A counter complaint regarding the death of the newborn, allegedly due to the negligence of the hospital staffers, was also filed by the woman’s family, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani said.“The body of the baby has been preserved at Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital mortuary. We have requested the Delhi government to constitute a panel of doctors for conducting the autopsy,” said DCP Rangnani.Dr Kanti Shamsukha of Kuber Hospital, on whose complaint a case was registered, said the baby’s heartbeat was low and the patient’s family was informed about the risks in her having a normal delivery before the operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-doctors-of-delhi-hospital-injured-after-being-assaulted-by-patient-s-kin-101634232531044.html
15-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi man tries to frame lover’s husband in fake robbery case, 2 arrested||The Delhi Police has arrested a wholesale vegetable supplier and his friend for allegedly trying to frame the husband of a woman he was in a relationship with in a false case of armed robbery in south Delhi’s Okhla. The suspect allegedly wanted to get the man jailed so that he could move in with the woman, police said on Thursday.The incident happened on October 10 and the first information report (FIR) -- under sections of criminal conspiracy, wrongful confinement, threatening, assault and producing false evidence -- was registered against the suspects at the Amar Colony police station on the same day. Police said they have not arrested the woman yet as they are still examining her role in the crime.“The woman is also an accused in the case but she has not been arrested yet. She wanted to do away with her husband as he had been stopping her from calling or talking with her boyfriend. Our investigation is still on,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey, adding that the woman was getting updates on the assault from the suspects.Explaining the crime, DCP Pandey said that on October 10, head constable Ram Prasad of the Amar Colony police station received a call on the phone from one of the suspects, Akash alias Ashu, a multi-tasking staff of a government institution, who claimed that he had caught a robber who was trying to rob a vegetable vendor at Okhla Mandi with a pistol, along with Himanshu, the wholesale vegetable vendor.Later, Akash and Himanshu brought the victim, Mohit (25), to the police station and also presented a pistol that, they claimed, was used in the robbery bid.However, upon finding bruises on Mohit’s body, police questioned him and were informed of the plan to frame him.In his statement, Mohit alleged that Akash and Himanshu, along with their associates, forcibly took him and a friend to the basement of the Okhla vegetable market and held them hostage there. He further claimed that they were assaulted and subsequently, forcibly filmed with bundles of ₹500 notes and the pistol to make it seem like a case of armed robbery, said the DCP. Mohit’s friend was subsequently dropped off elsewhere by Himanshu’s associates.“Police found the assault videos on Himanshu’s phone. It seems he was also chatting with Mohit’s wife during the assault. Responding to the assault video, the woman asked Himanshu to make a proper video of Mohit with the pistol so that he can be framed in a false case of robbery. She also asked Himanshu to ensure that Mohit is not booked under theft charges, pointing out that he may get relief in a day,” said DCP Pandey.When questioned about the videos, Himanshu and Akash became evasive, and allegedly confessed during subsequent interrogation. A case was registered and the two were arrested.Police said Mohit had found out about his wife’s relationship with Himanshu, following which the latter lured him to Okhla Mandi in the guise of “resolving the problem”. Once there, they allegedly attacked him and went ahead with the plan to frame him in a false case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiman-tries-to-frame-lover-s-husband-in-fake-robbery-case-2-arrested-101634232050982.html
15-10-2021||Noida||Notices to over 900 bulk waste generators in Ghaziabad to scale down by 400MT||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation issued notices to owners of 968 bulk waste generators for allegedly failing to comply with the norms for daily solid waste disposal. Officials of the corporation said that included 436 residential societies and high-rises, and 532 establishments, such as banquet halls and industrial units.Ghaziabad currently generates about 1,200 metric tonnes of daily solid waste and, according to official estimates, has the facilities to get rid of about 400 metric tonnes of daily solid waste. Corporation officials said that a reduction of about 400 metric tonnes in generated waste every day would help the agency efficiently get rid of the rest of the daily solid waste.As per Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, bulk waste generators include buildings occupied by central government departments or undertakings, state government departments, local bodies, or private buildings with the average waste generation rate exceeding 100kg per day.Following bulk waste generator norms is also a requirement for buildings constructed over a 2,000 square metre or larger area to get map clearances.“The purpose of us sending notices is so that bulk waste generators comply with norms. If the bulk waste generators start processing waste, there will be a substantial reduction in the quantity of waste the corporation processes daily. The bulk waste generators have to simply segregate dry and wet waste and convert the wet waste to manure,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.“We have asked for compliance within two weeks, else we will start levying financial penalties ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh, and submit the list of erring bulk waste generators before the National Green Tribunal. The charges have been determined in accordance with the different directions given by the tribunal and also include environment compensation cost (ECC). We will take the police’s help to enforce compliance,” said Mithilesh Kumar, city health officer.“We issued three notices regarding ECC earlier this year as well. Erring bulk generators had then deposited ₹26 lakh. We have now written to the Ghaziabad Development Authority and Uttar Pradesh Housing Board to keep the corporation in the loop so that projects which received completion certificates on the basis of declarations of bulk waste processing can be inspected. Once we get the list of issued completion certificates, we will be able to check if installed facilities are operational or not,” Kumar added.During the Swachh Survekshan, a countrywide cleanliness survey, Ghaziabad slipped from the 13th rank in 2019 to the 19th in 2020.The rank fell largely because the city currently has no landfill site--the one at Pratap Vihar was shut down in January 2019 on the directions of the UP solid waste monitoring committee.Residents said that they would have to check if they received any notices or not.“The corporation must create awareness and their officials should tell us the process of segregation and processing. Then our societies will surely initiate the process. Further, there are societies who do not have extra space and face difficulty in creating a separate space for waste processing,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of the federation of association of apartment owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/notices-to-over-900-bulk-waste-generators-in-ghaziabad-to-scale-down-waste-by-400mt-101634230970653.html

The announcement comes on the heels of a targeted attacks that left seven civilians dead in the region this month. Around 3,000 such employees are posted across Kashmir and a bulk of them stay in guarded transit government accommodations. A teacher from Jammu was among the civilians killed in the targeted attacks, which prompted many displaced Kashmiri employees to leave the Valley. Divisional commissioner (Kashmir) Pundurang K Pole on Wednesday said he had instructed deputy commissioners and senior police superintendents to regularly visit colonies and accommodations of displaced Kashmiris. “The officers have been issued clear-cut directions to preferably post these migrant employees in safe and secure zones instead of far-flung and vulnerable areas for the time being,” Pole said. Office bearers of employees’ unions have visited some of the transit accommodations to express solidarity with the displaced Kashmiri employees. The Centre had told the Parliament in July that 3,841 displaced Kashmiris have moved back to Kashmir and have taken up jobs across Kashmir under the Prime Minister’s Rehabilitation Package. It added 6,000 residential units were being constructed for the Kashmir Pandit employees in the Valley and 1,000 of them have been allotted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/staff-recruited-under-scheme-for-displaced-kashmiris-not-to-be-posted-to-far-flung-areas-101634218066840.html

Those crew members conducted two spacewalks and deployed a 10-meter (33-foot) mechanical arm before returning to Earth in mid-September.The new crew includes two veterans of space travel. Pilot Zhai Zhigang, 55, and Wang Yaping, 41, the only woman on the mission, and Ye Guangfu, 41, who is making his first trip to space.The crew was seen off by a military band and supporters singing “Ode to the Motherland,” underscoring the weight of national pride invested in the China’s space program that has advanced rapidly in recent years.The crew’s scheduled activities include up to three spacewalks to install equipment in preparation for expanding the station, assessing living conditions in the module and conducting experiments in space medicine and other fields.China’s military-run space program plans to send multiple crews to the station over the next two years to make it fully functional. Shenzhou-13 is the fifth mission to the structure, including trips without crews to deliver supplies.When completed with the addition of two more modules — named Mengtian and Wentian — the station will weigh about 66 tons, a fraction of the size of the International Space Station, which launched its first module in 1998 and will weigh around 450 tons when completed.The two additional Chinese modules are due to be launched before the end of next year during the stay of the yet-to-be-named Shenzhou-14 crew.China's Foreign Ministry on Friday renewed its commitment to cooperation with other nations in the peaceful use of space.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said sending humans into space was a “common cause of mankind,” and China would “continue to extend the depth and breadth of international cooperation and exchanges” in crewed spaceflight and “make positive contributions to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe.”China was excluded from the International Space Station largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese program’s secretive nature and close military ties, prompting it to launch two experimental modules before starting on the permanent station.U.S. law requires congressional approval for contact between the American and Chinese space programs, but China is cooperating with space experts from countries including France, Sweden, Russia and Italy. Chinese officials have said they look forward to hosting astronauts from other countries aboard the space station once it becomes fully functional.China has launched seven crewed missions with a total of 14 astronauts aboard since 2003, when it became only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to put a person in space on its own. Two Chinese astronauts have flown twice.Along with its crewed missions, China has expanded its work on lunar and Mars exploration, including placing a rover on the little-explored far side of the Moon and returning lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s.China this year also landed its Tianwen-1 space probe on Mars, whose accompanying Zhurong rover has been exploring for evidence of life on the red planet.Other Chinese space programs call for collecting soil from an asteroid and bring back additional lunar samples. China has also expressed an aspiration to land people on the moon and possibly build a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects. A highly secretive space plane is also reportedly under development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-3-person-crew-to-its-space-station-on-6-month-mission-101634317567797.html

The mission was the second successful human spaceflight conducted by the company that was founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, one of the front runners in space travel.Following this, the Duke of Cambridge William, in an interview to the BBC, said that earth should first be fixed instead of trying to find the next place to go. “We need some of the world's greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” he said during the interview on Thursday. “I think that ultimately is what sold it for me - that really is quite crucial to be focusing on this [planet] rather than giving up and heading out into space to try and think of solutions for the future,” he further said. However, he made no direct reference to Bezos or Shatner in his comment.Also read | ‘Space? We have a lot to do here’: Bill Gates explains why he is not ‘trying to escape planet earth in a spaceship’In response, Shatner said that William “got the wrong idea” in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “The idea here is not to go, 'Yeah, look at me. I'm in space’...No,” Shatner said defending his journey. Further, he also gave a message to William in which he said that the efforts were the first step in taking polluting industries off of earth.“I would tell the prince, and I hope the prince gets the message, this is a baby step into the idea of getting industry up there, so that all those polluting industries, especially, for example, the industries that make electricity... off of Earth,” Entertainment Tonight quoted Shatner as saying. But he also agreed with the argument that some issues need to be addressed.Certainly William is not the first person who has expressed his criticism for space travel on air. Recently Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates too, during an appearance in a late night talk show, expressed similar opinions and popularly said, “Space? You know, we have a lot to do here on earth.”Also, Bezos is not the only billionaire experimenting on space travel. Previously Virgin group’s Richard Branson himself travelled to space while Tesla founder Elon Musk was a part of the Inspiration4 mission. On their part, Bezos and Musk have both publicly acknowledged the criticism directed at them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/got-the-wrong-idea-william-shatner-responds-to-british-prince-william-s-criticism-on-space-race-101634317747821.html

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s new set-up is likely to again feature four Indo-Canadian ministers after that number dropped to three earlier this year following a resignation.The date of the swearing-in ceremony was announced in a statement issued by Justin Trudeau. The newly-elected House of Commons will meet for the first time on November 22 as parliament will return on that date.Justin Trudeau precipitated mid-term polls hoping to turn his minority government into a majority one. But the elections held on September 20 gave the ruling Liberal Party 160 seats, 10 short of the majority mark, and just three more than what it had captured in 2019. The results were also almost similar for the principal opposition Conservative Party, which ended up with 119 seats, two fewer than in 2019.Justin Trudeau has already said that deputy prime minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland will retain her twin portfolios in the new Canada cabinet. However, there is speculation over some changes that are likely. Most important among them is the potential shifting of defence minister Harjit Sajjan to another ministry, as fallout of a sexual misconduct crisis that erupted in the Canadian Armed Forces under his watch.Of the other Indo-Canadians in the outgoing Canada cabinet, public services minister Anita Anand is almost certain to be promoted after she featured as a star campaigner leading up to the elections as Justin Trudeau referred to her as his government’s “minister of vaccines”.Diversity, inclusion and youth minister Bardish Chagger is also expected to return to the Canada cabinet, but whether she retains that portfolio remains to be seen.There is a strong possibility Trudeau will appoint another Indo-Canadian to the cabinet, since it always featured four in total until then minister Navdeep Bains retired from electoral politics in January.A statement from the PMO said the new Canada cabinet “will remain gender-balanced” and that could provide an opportunity for a promotion for either former parliamentary secretary Kamal Khera, outgoing chair of the House of Commons standing committee on Procedure and House affairs Ruby Sahota, or Sonia Sidhu, who was a member of the House of Commons standing committee on health. Each of them is from the Greater Toronto Area, which played a crucial role in keeping Justin Trudeau in power.Another Indo-Canadian, Harnirjodh George Chahal, who was elected from Calgary Skyview in Alberta, may have been a certainty for a cabinet berth, but as he is being investigated for alleged electoral malpractice, his chances may have receded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-indo-canadians-likely-to-feature-in-pm-justin-trudeau-s-new-cabinet-101634309039175.html
15-10-2021||World||UK MP David Amess dies after being stabbed multiple times in eastern England||British Conservative lawmaker David Amess has died after being stabbed Friday during a meeting with constituents at a church in eastern England. A 25-year-old man has been arrested.The Essex Police force said officers were called to reports of a stabbing in Leigh-on-Sea just after noon Friday. It said “a man was arrested and a knife recovered.“We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the wider public," police said.The force said later that a man injured in the stabbing had died. It did not release his name. The suspect is being being held on suspicion of murder, police said.Sky News and others said Amess was attacked during a regular meeting with constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in a residential area of Leigh-on-Sea, a seaside town east of London.Aerial footage showed several ambulances and an air ambulance was waiting nearby to the church.John Lamb, a local councilor, said Amess had not been taken to hospital more than two hours after the attack and the situation was “extremely serious.”Amess, 69, had been a member of Parliament for Southend West, which includes Leigh-on-Sea, since 1997, but has been a lawmaker since 1983. He was a well-liked member of Parliament, best known for his ceaseless campaign to have Southend declared a city.Politicians from across the political spectrum expressed shock at initial reports of the stabbing. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer tweeted that it was “Horrific and deeply shocking news. Thinking of David, his family and his staff.”Former Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, tweeted: “Very alarming and worrying news reports coming from Leigh-on-Sea. My thoughts and prayers are with Sir David Amess and his family.”Violence against British politicians is rare, but in June 2016 Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox was fatally stabbed and shot in her northern England constituency. A far-right extremist was convicted of her murder.Cox's widower, Brendan Cox, tweeted that “Attacking our elected representatives is an attack on democracy itself. There is no excuse, no justification. It is as cowardly as it gets.”British lawmakers are protected by armed police when they are inside Parliament, but have no such protection in their constituencies. Amess published the times and locations of his open meetings with constituents on his website.Two other British lawmakers have been attacked this century during their “surgeries,” regular meetings where constituents can present concerns and complaints.Labour legislator Stephen Timms was stabbed in the stomach and injured in May 2010 by a female student radicalized by online sermons from an al-Qaida-linked preacher.In 2000, Liberal Democrat lawmaker Nigel Jones and his aide Andrew Pennington were attacked by a man wielding a sword during such a meeting. Pennington was killed and Jones injured in the attack in Cheltenham, England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmaker-stabbed-during-meeting-with-constituents-reports-101634303748026.html
15-10-2021||World||US allows entry to fully vaccinated foreigners from November 8||The US will open its borders to vaccinated foreign travelers on Nov. 8, a White House official said, a move that will expand travel options for those who’ve gotten their shots and clamp down on those who haven’t.The measures are the biggest changes to US travel policy since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, and replace a system that flatly barred most foreign nationals coming directly from certain places, including Europe, India, Brazil and China.Instead, under the new system, vaccinated people who have had a negative test in the prior 72 hours will be able to board a flight to the US as long as they share contact tracing information. Unvaccinated foreigners will be generally barred from entry, while unvaccinated Americans will need a negative Covid-19 test.The move was first announced Sept. 20, but the Biden administration didn’t immediately say when the measures would kick in. Airlines, battered by the coronavirus crisis, have applauded the move. Transatlantic flights between the US and Europe -- filled with premium travelers -- had been the single most profitable part of the global aviation market. The Nov. 8 date applies to a change in air travel rules, as well as an opening along land borders with Canada and Mexico announced earlier this week.The US will consider people arriving by plane vaccinated if they received shots that are either authorized by the Food and Drug Administration or have an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization. The same will likely apply to those arriving by land, the official said.The decision to accept WHO-cleared shots not used in the US means millions of travelers who have received doses developed by AstraZeneca Plc, as well as China’s Sinopharm Group and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., will be allowed to enter.It’s not yet clear how the US will treat people who have mixed shots -- one dose of one vaccine followed by a dose of another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-vaccinated-foreigners-to-enter-from-november-8-101634303789989.html

The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and Brexit have led to a shortage of workers up to a point that thousands of animals had to be culled on farms.The government will also enable meat processors to store slaughtered pugs for up to six months in a bid to ease up pressure on farms, reported Bloomberg. The move will allow the industry to preserve the slaughtered meat for a longer period and process it later on. The UK’s National Pig Association (NPA) said that the industry continues to be in a “very difficult phase” but the latest measure shows the government has finally listened.”“The NPA believes that around 6,000 pigs have been culled so far on farms due to space pressures, which are continuing,” it said in a statement. “But this will help and it shows the Government, finally, has listened.”According to Bloomberg, about 120,000 pigs had nowhere to go at the start of October which could have resulted in massive “welfare” culls. Such measures are taken to ease pressure on farms but the animals are killed to use them as pet food instead of pork.NPA chief executive Zoe Davies said in a statement that the announcement aimed at reducing the significant pig backlog on farms has come as a huge relief."We are working with the processors to understand the impact of these new measures and to determine exactly what will happen now, and how quickly, so that we can give pig farmers some hope and stem the flow of healthy pigs currently having to be culled on farms," Davies said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-offers-visas-to-foreign-butchers-after-farms-forced-to-kill-6-000-pigs-101634294553174.html

Currently, Britain carries out about a million Covid-19 tests in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) confirmed that multiple testing sites across might have faced this problem.The UK health security agency (UKHSA) announced that the lab in Central England’s Wolverhampton has been suspended from carrying out RT-PCR tests after reports of false-negative test results. According to a report by the Guardian, the problem came to light after a probe was conducted into reports of people receiving negative RT-PCR test results after they had tested positive for Covid-19 on a lateral flow device (LFD).“Around 400,000 samples have been processed through the lab, the vast majority of which will have been negative results, but an estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative PCR test results mostly in southwest England,” the UKHSA said in a statement. These 43,000 people received false Covid-19 test results between September 8 and October 12.The health agency pointed out that it was an isolated incident which is attributed to one lab, adding, the National Health Service (NHS) will contact the affected people and urge them to take another test.Dr Will Welfare, the public health incident director at UKHSA, said that there is no proof of any faults with the PCR or LFD test kits and people should remain confident in using them and other lab services which are being provided at present, the Guardian report also said.Meanwhile, the West Berkshire Council, a local authority in England, instructed residents who were tested for Covid-19 at the government-run Newbury Showground site between October 3-12, to undergo fresh tests after they were given false-negative test results. Close contacts of such residents have also been told to take another test.The United Kingdom has so far reported 8,317,439 cases due to coronavirus disease which include 138,237 deaths, 6,802,672 recoveries and 1,376,530 active cases. On Thursday, the UK saw another high of 45,066 new cases while 157 patients died due to the viral disease.

India, Germany, Australia and the UK played a leading role in organising the two-day talks. The joint statement on cybersecurity said governments “recognise the need for urgent action, common priorities and complementary efforts to reduce the risk of ransomware”.The participating countries also said efforts will be made to improve network resilience; address the abuse of financial mechanisms to launder ransom payments or conduct other activities that make ransomware profitable; and to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem via law enforcement collaboration and diplomatic engagement.On the need to show resilience against ransomware attacks - the discussions on which were led by India at the summit on cybersecurity - the statement said efforts will be made to address it not just as a technical issue but as one that “requires effective policy frameworks, appropriate resources, clear governance structures, transparent incident response procedures, a ready workforce, partnership with the private sector, and consistently enforced legal and regulatory regimes”.On countering illicit finance - discussion on which were led by the UK - the statement said efforts focus on “enhanced international cooperation to inhibit, trace and interdict ransomware payment flows, consistent with national laws and regulations, which will drive down economic incentives for ransomware actors”.On disrupting the ransomware ecosystem through law enforcement - a subject was anchored by Australia - the participating countries said the focus will be on “timely and consistent collaboration across law enforcement, national security authorities, cybersecurity agencies and financial intelligence”.And on diplomacy - the cybersecurity discussions on which were led by Germany - the countries resolved to leverage “diplomacy through coordination of action in response to states whenever they do not address the activities of cybercriminals”.Other governments that participated in the cybersecurity initiative, apart from the EU bloc, are Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ushosted-india-led-summit-identifies-ransomware-as-major-cybersecurity-threat-101634292718249.html

But the local affiliate of ISIS, known as Islamic State Khorasan, have stepped up attacks after the Taliban's takeover.

15-10-2021||World||Biden administration plans to reinstate 'Remain in Mexico' policy in November||The Biden administration said it plans to reinstate a Trump-era border policy next month to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in US immigration court, complying with a judge's order.It hinges on approval of the Mexican government, which has raised concerns that US officials are working to address, the Justice Department said in a court filing late Thursday. Mexico wants cases to generally conclude within six months and ensure that asylum-seekers have timely and accurate information about hearing dates and times and better access to legal counsel.Mexico also wants exemptions for “particularly vulnerable populations” and better coordination on locations and times of day that asylum-seekers are returned to Mexico.About 70,000 asylum-seekers have been subject to the “Remain in Mexico” policy, known officially as “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which President Donald Trump introduced in January 2019 and Biden suspended on his first day in office. A federal judge sided with the states of Texas and Missouri by ordering the Biden administration in August to reinstate the policy “in good faith.” The court filing says it should be in effect around mid-November.US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas, a Trump appointee, left open the possibility that the administration could try again to end the policy, and officials say they will release a plan soon that they hope will survive legal scrutiny.US Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas ended the policy in June after an internal review, saying it achieved “mixed effectiveness.”Illegal border crossings fell sharply after Mexico, facing Trump's threat of higher tariffs, acquiesced in 2019 to the policy's rapid expansion. Asylum-seekers were victims of major violence while waiting in Mexico and faced a slew of legal obstacles, such as access to attorneys and case information.The administration will rebuild tent courts in Texas border cities of Laredo and Brownsville at a monthly cost of $24.6 million to operate, according to the court filing, and is working to ensure there is capacity in a system that is backlogged with 1.4 million cases.Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said Thursday that it has concerns about asylum-seekers getting fair treatment in court under the policy, having access to legal counsel and being safe.Mexico said it also has raised questions about another U.S. policy to expel migrants without a chance to seek asylum. Trump invoked those powers, known as Title 42 authority, in March 2020 on grounds of preventing spread of the coronavirus. The Biden administration has strongly defended the special powers.“Mexico will continue discussion with the US executive branch, with the aim of achieving a regional migration policy that is safe, orderly and regulated,” the Foreign Relations Department said.US officials say the renewed “Remain in Mexico” policy will be applied to people who don't qualify for Title 42 authority. The policy was last used largely on people from Spanish-speaking countries but officials say eligible nationalities have not been determined.Broad outlines of the reinstated policy come as the Biden administration has yet to develop the “humane” asylum system that the president promised during his campaign after quickly dismantling many Trump policies. Illegal border crossings have soared under Biden's watch, with record numbers of unaccompanied children and, in September, the arrival of about 15,000 mostly Haitian migrants at a camp in Del Rio, Texas.Homeland Security said in a statement that it “remains committed to building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system that upholds our laws and values.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-plans-to-reinstate-remain-in-mexico-policy-in-november-101634284739958.html

At least four people were killed during clashes at Hajiganj sub-district in Chandpur bordering Cumilla on Wednesday and dozens injured in clashes in multiple districts so far. The violence later spread to a number of Durga Puja venues in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.People familiar with the matter said the Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) was behind the violence in Durga Puja pandals in southern Bangladesh and that the attacks were perpetrated with the motive to embarrass the Sheikh Hasina government and stoke communal fires.Authorities in Bangladesh moved promptly and deployed paramilitary forces in several districts to stop the violence from spreading, a move acknowledged by India.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that anyone involved in the attacks on Hindu temples and Durga Puja venues in Cumilla will not be spared irrespective of which religion they belong to. "The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn't matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished," she said on Thursday, reported Dhaka Tribune.Hasina made the remarks as she exchanged greetings with people of the Hindu community during an event at Dhakeshwari National Temple in Dhaka on the occasion of Durga Puja. She said the vandalism of temples in Cumilla was” very unfortunate" and that those who are unable to earn the confidence and trust of the people and have no ideology can carry out such attacks."We are getting a large amount of information. We will definitely trace those who carried out the attacks... This is the age of technology," she added. "They must be found. We did so in the past and will do it in the future, too. They must face due punishment. Exemplary punishment will be given so that none can dare to engage in this type of incident in future," she said, according to the Dhaka Tribune.India has said it is in “very close contact” with Bangladesh over the attacks on Durga Puja gatherings and that the neighbouring country’s government “reacted promptly to ensure control of the situation, including the deployment of the law enforcement machinery”. “We also understand that the ongoing festive celebrations of Durga Puja continue in Bangladesh with the support of the government of Bangladesh agencies and, of course, a large majority of the public,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-on-edge-after-durga-puja-violence-security-tightened-101634276449027.html

(Petrobras), may be privatized, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday."I want to privatize Petrobras, yes, I do. I shall see together with the economic team what we can do," Bolsonaro told Novas de Paz radio.The president's comments have already led to a more than 1% increase in the state-owned company's share price, according to Brazilian news portal Suno.Brazil's largest energy company has been the subject of numerous corruption scandals. On October 4, Petrobras paid the Brazilian authorities, as well as the United States, a fine of $853 million as part of a 2018 agreement following an investigation into the Lava Jato corruption case.The anti-corruption investigation into Petrobras money-laundering began in 2014. The company's senior management was accused of receiving a 3% commission from a number of contracts. These funds were allegedly later used to bribe politicians and officials. According to the Brazilian authorities, through overpricing and bribes, the participants in the money-laundering scheme gained up to $3.8 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-president-bolsonaro-considers-privatization-of-petrobras-101634266603216.html

"The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn't matter which religion they belong to.

Three people were killed and several others injured during clashes at Hajiganj sub-district in Chandpur bordering Cumilla on Wednesday and the fourth person succumbed to his wounds later. The police have said that two others were critically injured in the clashes.

Violent attacks were also reported on pandals in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.Officials also said that the elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and armed police were also ordered to be on guard along with the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) in 22 of the 64 administrative districts and elsewhere to contain any violence.

State Premier Daniel Andrews has said some curbs will ease next week as Victoria's double-dose vaccination levels race towards the 70% mark from 63% now.Australia had stayed largely virus-free for most of this year until a third wave of infections fuelled by the fast-moving Delta variant spread across its southeast from late June, forcing a months-long lockdown in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.Canberra, the national capital, on Friday exited its more than two-month lockdown, allowing cafes, pubs and gyms to reopen with strict social distancing rules.Sydney lifted its stay-home orders earlier this week and the city's 5 million residents could enjoy more freedoms from Monday, as double-dose vaccination rates are expected to top 80% over the weekend - the level at which officials have promised to relax more restrictions.However, travel to regional areas from Greater Sydney will be delayed until Nov. 1 due to lower vaccination rates there versus Sydney, New South Wales Deputy Premier Paul Toole told radio station 2GB on Friday.Daily infections in New South Wales eased further to 399 from 406 on Thursday, well down from the state's pandemic high of 1,599 in early September.The federal government has been pressing states to reopen their borders but some virus-free states have said they may delay reopening plans amid concerns that a rapid reopening could overwhelm their health systems.The country's overall coronavirus numbers are still relatively low, with some 139,000 cases and 1,506 deaths.(Reporting by Renju Jose; editing by Richard Pullin)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-continues-to-report-high-number-of-covid-19-cases-101634259197881.html

The 193-member UN General Assembly elected all 18 candidates proposed by the world organisation’s five regional groups. Benin was the top vote-getter with 189 votes, followed by Gambia with 186, while the United States with 168 and Eritrea with 144 was at the bottom of the list.“The absence of competition in this year’s Human Rights Council vote makes a mockery of the word `election,’” said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director for Human Rights Watch. “Electing serious rights abusers like Cameroon, Eritrea, and the United Arab Emirates sends a terrible signal that UN member states aren’t serious about the council’s fundamental mission to protect human rights.”He said Cameroon’s government has suppressed the opposition, crushed dissent, and persecuted lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Eritrean troops have committed widespread atrocities in neighboring Ethiopia’s Tigray region and other serious rights violations, and the rights situation in the UAE “remains dire” with prominent Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor imprisoned without a mattress in near-total isolation, he said.The Geneva-based Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to replace a commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including one over the fact that rights abusers sought seats to protect themselves and their allies.Under the Human Rights Council’s rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation.The United States has criticised the selection of candidates with poor rights records on uncontested slates as well as the Human Rights Council’s excessive criticism of Israel. This culminated in the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the council in June 2018.When US secretary of state Antony Blinken announced in February that the Biden administration was re-engaging with the council, he said Trump’s withdrawal “did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but instead created a vacuum of US leadership, which countries with authoritarian agendas have used to their advantage.”In a statement Thursday thanking UN member states for allowing the US to serve on the 47-nation body, Blinken said the United States together with other countries “must push back against attempts to subvert the ideals upon which the Human Rights Council was founded.”He said the council has an important role in “documenting atrocities in order to hold wrongdoers accountable,” but added that “it also suffers from serious flaws, including disproportionate attention on Israel and the membership of several states with egregious human rights records.”State Department spokesman Ned Price said later that the Biden administration will “vigorously oppose the council’s disproportion attention on Israel, which includes the council’s only standing agenda item targeting a single country" and will work against the election of countries “with egregious human rights records.”The 18 countries elected for three-year terms starting January 1 were Benin, Gambia, Cameroon, Somalia, and Eritrea from the Africa group; India, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Qatar, and UAE from the Asia group; Lithuania and Montenegro from the East European group; Paraguay, Argentina, and Honduras from the Latin America and Caribbean group; and Finland, Luxembourg and the United States from the mainly Western nations group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-uncontested-election-us-wins-back-seat-at-un-human-rights-council-3-years-after-quitting-101634257570210.html

Shares in the company fell 13% in afterhours trading.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sept. 2 had barred Virgin Galactic from flying its SpaceShipTwo pending completion of a report into the flight of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane that carried British billionaire Richard Branson to the edge of space.Branson was among six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the July flight, soaring more than 50 miles (80 km) into space.The FAA on Sept. 29 closed its mishap investigation into the July 11 Virgin Galactic Unity 22 launch, which deviated from assigned airspace on descent, and lifted a grounding order it had imposed earlier.Virgin Galactic had said in September it was planning another SpaceShipTwo flight from New Mexico, Unity 23, pending technical checks and weather. The company said last month the earliest it expected "to open its flight window for Unity 23 is mid October."But Virgin Galactic on Thursday said it will now begin its planned enhancement program first and will conduct the Unity 23 test flight after this work is complete and before starting commercial service.The enhancement program is designed to improve vehicle performance and flight-rate capability.The company said on Thursday one recent laboratory-based test "flagged a possible reduction in the strength margins of certain materials used to modify specific joints."The company added the "new lab test data has had no impact on the vehicles, our test flight protocols have clearly defined strength margins, and further analysis will assess whether any additional work is required to keep them at or above established levels."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virgin-galactic-to-delay-commercial-space-travel-service-until-q4-2022-101634257406670.html

15-10-2021||World||Robert Durst sentenced to life for murdering his best friend Susan Berman||New York real estate heir Robert Durst was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without chance of parole for the murder of his best friend more that two decades ago.Durst, 78, was convicted in Los Angeles Superior Court last month of first-degree murder for shooting Susan Berman point-blank in the back of the head at her home in December 2000.Durst silenced Berman to prevent her from incriminating him in the reopened investigation of his wife’s 1982 disappearance in New York, prosecutors said.Berman provided a phony alibi for Durst when Kathie Durst vanished, prosecutors said.Durst testified that he didn’t kill either woman, but said on cross-examination that he would lie if he had.Prosecutors also presented evidence that he intentionally killed a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, in 2001, though he had been acquitted of murder in that case after testifying that he shot the man in self-defense.Durst is the grandson of Joseph Durst, who founded the Durst Organization, one of Manhattan’s largest commercial real estate firms. His father, Seymour, took the reins of the company and later handed control of it to a younger brother, Douglas.Robert Durst settled his share of the family fortune and was estimated by prosecutors to have $100 million.Durst's lawyer said they plan to appeal.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.LOS ANGELES (AP) — The bitterly fought murder trial of Robert Durst stretched over the better part of two years. His sentencing will be comparatively brief and could lack the fireworks that erupted between the lead prosecutor and defense lawyer.The eccentric New York real estate heir faces a mandatory term of life in prison without parole Thursday for the first-degree murder of his best friend, Susan Berman.“Now that the jury has found whodunnit, the punishment is quite clear,” Loyola Law School Professor Laurie Levenson said. “I'm not sure there’s a lot more left for (the prosecutor) to say."Durst, 78, was convicted last month in Los Angeles Superior Court of shooting Berman point-blank in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home just before Christmas 2000.Durst, who has numerous medical issues, on Thursday was rolled into the courtroom in a wheelchair wearing brown jail scrubs. His eyes were wide open and he had a catatonic stare.Several of the jurors returned to the courtroom to witness the sentencing and were seated in the jury box.The trial began in March 2020 and was adjourned for 14 months as the coronavirus pandemic swept the U.S. and courts were closed. It resumed in May with the jury that reached its verdict Sept. 17.Berman, the daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, was Durst’s longtime confidante who was preparing to tell police she provided a phony alibi for him after his wife vanished in New York in 1982.Kathie Durst has never been found. Robert Durst has never been charged with a crime related to her disappearance.But following his conviction in Berman's death, which relied on evidence that he killed his wife, a New York prosecutor is prepared now to seek charges against him in her death, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Durst testified in the LA case, denying he killed his wife or Berman, but he said he'd lie if he had done so.Kathie McCormack Durst's family had hoped to present statements to the court Thursday about their loss, but prosecutors denied the request, according to emails sent to their lawyer.Attorney Robert Abrams said the McCormack family was disappointed, and he was outraged. He said family members would not attend the sentencing.“The family is not going to go travel 3,000 miles to be a prop in some Hollywood production and sit there and not be able to make their victim impact statements," Abrams said. “This is not some movie where it’s gross spectacle. This is their lives, and they’ve suffered for 40 years.”A spokesman for the district attorney's office did not return a message seeking comment.Levenson said it was questionable whether Kathie Durst was a victim in the Los Angeles case because Robert Durst wasn't charged with her killing. Allowing her siblings to speak at sentencing would create another issue for an appeal.Defense lawyers argued in court papers that Durst deserved a new trial, saying there was insufficient evidence to prove the case and listing 15 ways the judge erred.Judge Mark Windham rejected the motion and said the prosecution had overwhelming evidence and proved Durst's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in at least five ways, including several admissions Durst made. He rejected all the arguments that he had ruled incorrectly."You said the court erred so many times it made me feel self-conscious,” Windham said.The motion was mainly to preserve issues for appeal and likely to fail, Levenson said, though some of their arguments could get a higher court's attention.The defense said Windham should have declared a mistrial when the jury was sent home and the case adjourned. They said the length of the delay was unprecedented.Many of the other issues revolve around admission of evidence, such as allowing prosecutors to present testimony that Durst killed a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, in 2001 and chopped up his body and tossed the parts out to sea. Durst was acquitted of murder after testifying that Morris Black pulled a gun on him and was killed in a struggle for the weapon.They also objected to testimony and exhibits that showed when Durst was arrested in New Orleans in 2015, he had a mask, fake identification, drugs, $40,000 and a loaded handgun in his hotel room.They also objected to showing jurors a feature film, “All Good Things" based on Durst's life and starring Ryan Gosling as him and Kirsten Dunst as Kathie Durst.They incorrectly said jurors were shown the six-part documentary, “The Jinx: The Life and Crimes of Robert Durst," though jurors were shown excerpts, including a portion that many took as a confession.In a moment off camera but with a live microphone, Durst muttered, “Killed them all, of course.”To limit the number of appellate issues, prosecutors may be more restrained in their sentencing presentation, Levenson said, particularly when the prison term is already set.Deputy District Attorney John Lewin was asked by a reporter after the conviction what he had to say to Durst.Lewin, who was aggressive and frequently scrapped with defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin over the six years it took from arrest to conviction, initially said he didn't have anything to say to the man he had pursued for years.Then he called Durst a “narcissistic psychopath” who “killed his wife and ... had to keep killing to cover it up.”“He’s 78 years old. He’s been walking around for a long time," Lewin said. "He had a lot more of a life, you know, Kathie didn’t make 30. On balance, considering what he’s done, he got a lot more of a life than he was entitled to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-durst-sentenced-to-life-for-murdering-his-best-friend-susan-berman-101634249644773.html
15-10-2021||India||RSS chief Bhagwat flags need for population policy||New Delhi: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday expressed concern over India’s growing population, calling it a “predicament” that could give rise to “many problems in the near future” and renewed his demand for a national population policy. Delivering his annual Vijaydashami speech in Nagpur, Bhagwat said, based on the “demographic changes and imbalance” that is being noticed worldwide, there is a need for a policy “applicable to all”. “There should be a population policy. There has been some discussion on the issue before. Based on the view of experts, the government agreed to a 2.1 children per family formula. But we feel there is a need to revisit the issue,” Bhagwat said. He said the country will need a policy that will take into account the next 50 years and strike a balance – even assessing how many people will be needed to feed the aging population after 30 years. Bhagwat referred to a resolution passed by the Sangh in 2015 demanding a population policy; and said it was in line with a resolution on population control passed in Cairo in 2005 (check) when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister. This is not the first time that the Sangh chief has voiced the demand for a law to check population. In 2018, he underscored the need for a common law to ensure “demographic balance”, pivoted on the principle of a uniform policy that would be applicable to all and implemented without exception. The Sangh’s repeated mention of a population policy, while mentioning the perils of a large population, is also built around the belief that the Hindu population of the country isn’t growing as fast as the Muslim or Christian population, one reason why Bhagwat’s older comments on this, as well as those from his speech on Friday, emphasise terms such as demographic imbalance and universal applicability of any policy.Such a policy, the Sangh says, will serve the multiple purposes of checking illegal infiltration, conversions through coercion and ensure an equal right to natural resources.A 2019 report by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs said that India would add around 273 million people to its population between 2020 and 2050, around 13.7% of the increase in the world’s population in the same period. The report put India’s population in 2050 at 1.64 billion. India’s population is expected to exceed China’s by 2027.India will retain a demographic advantage till the middle of the century with the median age of its population increasing to 38 from 29; by then, China’s median age is expected to be 55-56 and the US’s 44-45.In 2004, at the Akhil Bhartiya Karyakarini Mandal or the executive board meeting, the Sangh referred to Census 2011 to buttress its claims of changes in numbers of Hindus and other communities. At the same meeting, it also sought laws against anti-conversion as it blamed illegal infiltration and forced conversions for changes in the population of Hindus, Muslims and Christians.According to census data, the population growth rate in the decade 2001-2011 was lower than in the 1991-2001 decade. The overall 17.7% growth rate in 2001-2011 was 0.82 times of the 21.5% growth rate in the 1991-2001 decade. While growth rates of all major religions also decreased, they did not decrease in the same degree. The Hindu population grew by 0.87 times as it had the previous decade, while in the case of the Muslim population, the growth was slightly slower: 0.84 times of the previous decade. In case of Christians and Sikhs, the dip was larger. The Christian population grew at 0.69 times the previous decade and the Sikhs’, the increase was nearly half. To be sure, these figures are dependent on 1991 projections for Jammu and Kashmir, where the census was not conducted in 1991 due to unrestIn 2005, at the All India Pratinidhi Sabha, the highest decision-making body of the Sangh, the issue of “declining Hindu population” came up for discussion. In a resolution passed at the meeting it called upon heads of religious institutions of all sects, sub sects, temples, monasteries, gurdwaras to “play an important role in mental transformation …and call upon the brethren who have converted from their sects to return to the sects of their ancestors.” In 2015, a year after the BJP-led NDA government came to power at the Centre with a clear majority, the Sangh at its Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal held in Ranchi, passed a resolution demanding that the government should “reformulate the national population policy keeping in view the availability of resources in the country, future needs and the problem of demographic imbalance” and that this policy should be “applied uniformly.” It was this resolution that Bhagwat read from in his speech. Following the Sangh’s concerted campaign for a population policy, at least three BJP-ruled states -- Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam -- recently announced their intent to introduce the population control policy. The move is perceived to be in line with the Sangh’s push to address what it calls challenges of demographic changes and its impact on natural resources. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in the country with an estimated population of 220 million, has announced a policy that seeks to incentivise population control; in Assam, with a population of 36 million, the government wants to link a two-child policy to access to social welfare schemes and government jobs. Uttarakhand, which, like UP, goes to the polls next year, has also begun examining the draft population control bill prepared by the latter to come up with its own version of a law to check the growing populace and ensure “demographic balance”. In the election-bound states, the perception of demographic imbalance has emerged as a key issue. In Uttarakhand, for instance, opposition parties claim the motive behind the population policy is to polarise. While the Congress said the BJP was “targetting a particular community under its (policy) garb”, the Aam Admi Party labelled it as “divisive politics”. A functionary of the Sangh who has served as a pracharak, or full-time worker, in several states said the issue of “changing patterns of demography have triggered concerns in states such as Uttarakhand where land and natural resources are scarce” and should not be viewed as “political or communal”. The functionary said in states along the borders, “rapid changes in demography” also rings alarm over issues “of security and stability”. This concern was echoed by the Uttarakhand government in September in a statement where it alluded to instances of migration due to a demographic change in specific areas and referred to these as grounds for checking “illegal land deals”. The government said, “…due to unprecedented rising population in certain areas of the state, the demography of those areas has been majorly affected. And due to this demographic change, members of certain communities are forced to migrate from those areas. Also, there are possibilities that the communal harmony in those areas may be disturbed.” SS Jodhka, professor of sociology at the Jawaharlal Nehru University however, said the anxiety about changing demography is a mechanism that the Sangh uses to push its ideology. “Changes in demography have been one of the foundational anxieties of the Sangh. It is a political strategy to mobilise anxiety among the Hindus that they are a persecuted majority. There is no data-based evidence to suggest that Muslims are outnumbering the Hindus. The birth rate of Hindus in the lower socio-economic demographics has been nearly equal to the Muslims in the comparable stratum. Poorer populations tend to have higher birth rates, across religions,” Jodhka said. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP, Rakesh Sinha said Bhagwat’s demand was an “expression of the collective sentiments of 130 crore Indians who face the challenges imposed by the growing population on a day-to-day basis”. Sinha, also said Bhagwat’s appeal was to the political class to rise above politics and without delay frame a central law which is “essential and urgent in terms of the detrimental impact of the population imbalance in the border areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-chief-bhagwat-flags-need-for-population-policy-101634321880713.html
15-10-2021||India||Mansukh Mandaviya faces heat over picture with ailing Manmohan Singh||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya’s visit to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to enquire about former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh’s health drew flak on Friday over a picture that was allegedly taken inside the ward without the family’s permission. The Congress slammed the health minister for the act, accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of always looking for a "photo op".The party’s attack came after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's daughter, Daman Singh, accused Mandaviya of getting a photographer against the wishes of the family. She told ThePrint that her mother was “very upset” and when she insisted that the photographer leave the room, "she was completely ignored".Daman Singh said her parents had expressly insisted that visitors be restricted as her father was suffering from dengue and his immunity was low, increasing the risk of infection.“It was nice of the health minister to visit and express his concern,” Daman was quoted as saying by ThePrint, adding, “However, my parents were in no state to be photographed at the time.”"My parents are trying to cope in a difficult situation. They are elderly people. Not animals in a zoo," she said.Meanwhile, the Congress has demanded that the health minister apologise."Everything is a ‘Photo Op’ for BJP. Shame on Health Minister, who made a visit to meet Former PM in AIIMS, a ugly ‘PR Stunt’," Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet. "This is.. Negation of every ethical norm, Breach of ex-PM’s privacy, insult of established tradition, reflects absence of basic decency. Apologise now!" he added.Everything is a ‘Photo Op’ for BJP.Shame on Health Minister, who made a visit to meet Former PM in AIIMS, a ugly ‘PR Stunt’This is..Negation of every ethical norm,Breach of EX PM’s privacy,Insult of established tradition,Reflects absence of basic decency. Apologise Now! pic.twitter.com/ZQdmw2H2XPRajya Sabha MP and senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh also slammed the BJP saying “photo op” is the “hallmark of the Modi government”, while Congress leader Manickam Tagore said the minister's actions were a "serious breach of privacy".It’s a serious breach of privacy, why Union Health Minister @mansukhmandviya walk with cameras in to the Hosipital and publish it ? When former PM Vajpayee was in hospital whether we got pictures from AIIMS? It’s crime @crpfindia must answer ? AIIMS must answer? #ManmohanSinghji pic.twitter.com/7uMiBFfFahTagore said he will write to President Ram Nath Kovind to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers to stop these "petty things".Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi also reacted to the picture, saying: "I know you all are concerned about the health of former PM Manmohan Singh but kindly do stop sharing photos of him from his hospital bed. It's invasion of his and his family's privacy and not good conduct in any way."Singh was admitted to the AIIMS in Delhi on Wednesday evening after he complained of fever and weakness. The 89-year-old Congress leader is currently admitted to a private ward in the cardio-neuro centre of the hospital and is under the care of a team of cardiologists led by Dr Nitish Naik.The former prime minister had contracted Covid-19 in April, when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak in Delhi. He was fully vaccinated against the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mansukh-mandaviya-faces-heat-over-picture-with-ailing-manmohan-singh-101634316797591.html

"All they are interested in is to catch celebrities, get their pictures clicked and make some noise," Uddhav Thackeray said in his first comment regarding the ongoing drugs issue in Mumbai after the arrest of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan in connection with a cruise rave party."They have painted a picture that Maharashtra has become a drug capital. That is not the case. In Mundra, there was a drug haul of crores. While your agencies are recovering pinch of ganja, the Maharashtra cops have recovered drugs worth ₹150 crore. You are interested in is to catch celebrities and get their pictures clicked," Uddhav said.The chief minister said that there is an attempt to defame Maharashtra, to project a picture of Maharashtra as if it is the hub of drugs. "Maharashtra is being looked at through a different lens. While we are being targetted, why are places like Uttar Pradesh, where rapes happen, not criticised as well?" Uddhav said adding that politicians who have now lost power are trying to malign the state's image like 'rejected lovers sometimes throw acid on a girl who spurns them'. "If they call the Mumbai Police ‘mafia’, then what will you term the UP Police?” he said.Since Sushant Singh Rajput's death last year, Bollywood has come on the radar of the NCB for its alleged nexus of drug dealing. Apart from actor Rhear Chakraborty, scores of Bollywood actors, including Deepika Padukone, have been summoned by the NCB for interrogation; many have been detained and arrested. NCB's latest raid on a cruise rave party is now in the news as Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan has been arrested in connection with the case. The agency has made so far 20 arrests in the case, while it is probing other Bollywood-drugs cases parallelly.Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik has earlier pointed out several alleged loopholes in NCB's operation which the agency refuted and clarified. This is the first time after Aryan Khan's arrest that Uddhav broached the issue.The NCB has recovered 6 gram of charas from Aryan Khan's friend Arbaaz Merchant, who was arrested along with Khan. Mocking the quantity of the drugs recovered by the NCB, Udhhav Thackeray said the state police have been recovering drugs worth crores of rupees while the NCB is only after celebrities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-catch-a-celebrity-click-photos-and-make-noise-uddhav-s-dig-at-ncb-101634315590839.html

Sidhu met Rahul Gandhi at the latter's residence in New Delhi after months of turmoil in the Punjab Congress which eventually saw the ouster of Captain Amarinder Singh as the chief minister. "He (Sidhu) shared his concerns with Rahul Gandhi. We have told him that his concerns will be taken care of here. He assured Rahul Gandhi that he has withdrawn his resignation and he will resume his duties as the PCC president," Rawat, AICC in-charge of Punjab, said after the meeting.Sidhu arrived at Gandhi's residence on Friday evening amid uncertainty around the former cricketer's future in Punjab Congress. “I shared all my concerns with Rahul Gandhi. Everything has been sorted out,” Sidhu said after the meeting.Sidhu was said to be unhappy with the appointments on some key postings under Channi's government. In his resignation letter that he shared on Twitter last month, Sidhu told Sonia Gandhi that he “can never compromise on Punjab's future and agenda for the welfare” of the state.Sidhu's surprise resignation, which wasn't accepted by interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi, came days after Amarinder Singh was replaced by Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab's chief minister. Several party leaders from the Sidhu camp also tendered their resignation in solidarity with the PCC president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-assured-rahul-gandhi-he-has-withdrawn-his-resignation-as-punjab-congress-chief-rawat-101634314242434.html

Saravjeet will be produced at the court on Saturday. The incident of mutilating and lynching a person allegedly for disrespecting Guru Granth Sahib has created unrest at the protest site as the farmers' unions have distanced from the incident and protesters at Singhu too are dissociated from the incident.What happened at Singhu?A Dalit labour from Punjab's Tarn Taran, identified as Lakhbir Singh, was found tied to an overturned police barricade near the main stage of the farmers' protest. His left hand was severed. A video of the incident also appeared on social media which showed the man lying in a pool of blood with his chopped off left hand lying next to him. In the video, the Nihangs were heard saying that man was punished for desecrating the holy book of the Sikhs. Lakhbir apparently put the holy book in an unclean place. The incident took place around 4.30am.

15-10-2021||India||Thackeray dares BJP to topple Maharashtra govt, takes dig at Fadnavis||In a no-holds-barred attack on the former ally, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday dared the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to topple the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.  Addressing party workers and functionaries during the annual Dussehra rally, Thackeray said that Shivaji Maharaj and Shiv Sena founder, Balasaheb Thackeray, had “taught us that we should not be afraid of anything.” “We are not scared of ED and CBI. We are not the ones to hide behind Police after making threats,” the Maharashtra CM said.Targeting the BJP for fielding a former Sena leader for the Deglur bypoll, Thackeray said that the “world's largest political party” has to import candidates even for assembly by-election. The chief minister also took potshots at his predecessor, Devendra Fadnavis, who had recently said that he still feels like he is holding the top office in the state.""I never think that I am the chief minister. Some people who said 'I will return', now thinks he has not gone [out of power]," Thackeray said, taking a veiled dig at Fadnavis' impassioned "Me punha yein" (I will return) assertion before the Assembly elections.Also Read | Still feel I am in Maharashtra CM’s chair, says Devendra Fadnavis; Congress slams remarkCriticising the ideological sibling, the Sena chief said that the BJP has neither understood Veer Savarkar nor Mahatma Gandhi.

Balasaheb had said that we're citizens first, religion comes later. When we step out of houses by keeping religion at home, nation becomes our religion. It's our duty to speak against anyone who does anything in religion's name,” the Maharashtra CM said.“Hindutva is social service. We don't think of religion or caste at the time of donating blood.

15-10-2021||India||'Could be a conspiracy': SKM leader on lynching of man at farmers' protest venue||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Friday claimed there could be a conspiracy behind the lynching of a man at a farmers' protest site near the Delhi-Haryana border, and demanded a thorough probe into the matter. "We are all very saddened at what happened. The Samyutka Kisan Morcha is fighting against the three farm laws. This (incident) could be a conspiracy. We condemn the incident in the strongest words," news agency PTI quoted Jagjit Singh Dallewal, a farmer leader from the organisation, as saying.The SKM is an umbrella body of 40 farm unions who have been spearheading the farmers' agitation against the Centre's three agri laws since last year. The statement came hours after the man, identified as Lakhbir Singh, was brutally lynched, his hand chopped off and the body tied to a metal barricade at a farmers' protest venue at Kundli.According to a report carried by PTI, a video is doing rounds on social media wherein some Nihang Sikhs, who are part of the protesters, are claiming responsibility for the killing. The PTI report further stated that Nihangs are heard saying in the clip that the man was punished for desecrating a holy book of the Sikhs. In the video, the Nihangs are seen standing as the man lies on the ground in a pool of blood with his chopped off left hand lying next to him, reported PTI.Speaking to the news agency further, Jagjit Singh Dallewal said they have learnt the victim had been staying with the Nihang Sikhs and had allegedly tried to steal the Sarbloh Granth, a holy book of the Sikhs. "We condemn disrespecting of any religion. We also condemn the reaction (killing)," he said.Dallewal alleged that a religious colour is being given to farmers' protest. The farmers' leader also called the killing "an internal matter between the Nihang Sikhs" as he sought to distance the farmers' movement from the incident.Meanwhile, another farmers' leader Yogendra Yadav tried to dissociate the farmers protest from the incident. "The leaders of SKM had earlier appealed the Nihangs that they had nothing to do with farmers protest and they should leave because it was not a religious agitation," Yadav said in a video message.Police said the deceased was a labourer from Cheema Khurd village in Punjab's Tarn Taran district. They said his body was found tied to an overturned police barricade near a stage put up by the farmers protesting at the site for over 10 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-be-a-conspiracy-skm-leader-on-lynching-of-man-at-farmers-protest-venue-101634307930837.html

The 31-year-old government school teacher also threatened the girl not to tell anyone. And she didn’t, for about nine days.On Thursday morning, she spotted a child helpline phone number on her school textbook and mustered the courage to give them a call. It probably helped that the teacher was on leave. “She narrated the entire incident to them. Soon after, members of the Child Welfare Committee reached out to the girl and approached the district superintendent of police, who directed immediate action,” said Bhajana Ram, station house officer (SHO) of Singhana police station.According to the girl’s statement, the teacher told her to stay back after school on October 5 and sexually assaulted her after other students left for the day. “He threatened her not to report what had happened,” Bhajana Ram said.The girl also told the police that the government school teacher had been sending obscene messages and photos to her for some time but made sure that these were deleted after the rape.Bhajana Ram said a team of police officers was quickly sent to Alwar district 200 km away to the teacher’s family home and arrested him on Thursday evening.The officer said the suspect, who comes from a family of educationists, was married to a school teacher posted in another district. He is the son of a retired teacher, and his sister and her husband are also lecturers in a government college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/class-7-girl-dials-helpline-number-she-found-on-textbook-says-teacher-raped-her-101634311139296.html

15-10-2021||India||US says India playing a crucial role in vaccinating world against Covid||US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman said India is playing a crucial role in the fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic as it is the world’s largest vaccine producer. Sherman applauded the decision made by India to restart the export of Covid-19 vaccines after a brief halt which was caused due to the nation facing a devastating second wave that required the embargo on vaccine exports.“We look forward to working together with India to vaccinate the world, including through the Quad vaccine partnership,” Sherman said on Wednesday (Oct 6). The ‘Vaccine Maitri’ initiative launched by the government aims at exporting vaccines under commercial exports, grants and vaccine dose contributions to COVAX – global vaccine sharing initiative co-led by Gavi, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to help lower and middle-income nations tackle Covid-19.According to data shared by the Union ministry of external affairs, India has exported 19.86 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine under the COVAX initiative to several impoverished countries as of May 29. It has exported 66.36 million doses of vaccines, in total, until May 29.Sherman also said that India and the US’ partnership remains indispensable at a meeting with foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. She said that both nations can overcome any challenge together. She further added that both nations are vital to each other and the relationship between both countries is central to security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the wider world.Sherman said that dealing with counter-terrorism and the Afghanistan issue was also discussed. She said that India and the US will meet again for security dialogue.The US deputy secretary of state also pointed out that India and the US are fighting the climate crisis together. “We cannot lose sight of the other crisis on our hands that is the climate crisis which is already fueling deeper droughts, the more intense storms, and rising sea levels in India and in the United States,” Sherman was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-says-india-playing-a-crucial-role-in-vaccinating-world-against-covid-101633516066511.html

According to J&K police, security agencies received the information about the presence of the terrorist, Shahid Bashir Sheikh, in the Wahibug area of Pulwama, prompting a search and cordon operation.Police said that the slain terrorist was a resident of Srinagar."One #terrorist of #Srinagar City involved in recent civilian killing, neutralised in #Pulwama #encounter," Vijay Kumar, IGP, Kashmir, tweeted.One AK-47 rifle, along with ammunition, was recovered from the site of the encounter, police said."He (Sheikh) was involved in the killing of a civilian, Mohammad Shafi Dar -- an employee of Power Development Department, on 2/10/21. An AK-47 rifle was used in that killing,” news agency PTI quoted police as saying.Security forces have intensified counterterrorism operations in the Valley after Pakistan-based as well as Pakistan-backed terrorist groups stepped up attacks in the region, particularly targeting the civilians from Hindu and Sikh communities.At least 11 terrorists from organisations ranging from Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to Hizbul Mujahideen and The Resistance Force (TRF) have been neutralised in the last 10 days.“After civilian attacks, we started offensive ops. 8 encounters took place and 11 terrorists killed.

15-10-2021||India||Kerala logs 8,867 new Covid-19 cases with TPR of 11.14%||Kerala on Friday reported 8,867 new Covid-19 cases after 79,554 samples were tested with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 11.14%, the state health ministry said adding that out of 94,756 active cases only 9.8% are in hospitals. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 16,862 fresh Covid-19 cases with a TPR of 1.43%. For more than five months, Kerala has been contributing the lion’s share of Covid-19 cases in the country. After Onam festivities in August, the cases multiplied and at one point claimed more than 70% of the total cases of the country. The state also reported 67 deaths on Friday taking the death toll to 26,774 though the health department added 7,000 deaths to the Covid-19 list recently these numbers failed to figure in the total fatality list. When asked about this, a senior health department official said some more formalities will have to be completed. Three districts-- Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur-- reported more than 1,000 cases. State Health Minister Veena George said at least 25% of the newly-infected had not taken the vaccine. At least 93.7% of the eligible population got one vaccine and 44.9% got both shots, she said adding the vaccination rate of the state is one of the best in the country. She asked the remaining people to take their jabs at the earliest. Kerala had conducted a sero prevalence survey last week. At least 82% of people above 18 years have antibodies against Covid-19 and over 40% of children in 5-17 age group are exposed to the virus. In the earlier sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July, Kerala’s sero positivity was the lowest in the country, 44.4% but the latest is pegged at 82.6%. Immunity among the population has been achieved either through vaccination or natural infection, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-logs-8-867-new-covid-19-cases-with-tpr-of-1114-101634308199187.html

Taking Delhi as a case study, the research found that the Delta variant was able to infect people who had previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. The study, published in the journal Science on Thursday, also found that prior infection gave only 50-90 per cent of the protection against infection with the Delta variant that it provides against previous lineages.The study also concluded that the Delta variant, which is said to have driven the 2nd wave of the pandemic in India, was 30-70 per cent more transmissible than previous strains of Covid-19 in Delhi.Delhi witnessed multiple Covid-19 outbreaks, in June, September and November 2020. However, the April 2021 outbreak, when the cases peaked at 20,000, was the worst as it saw a rapid rise in hospitalisations and ICU admissions with the medical infrastructure on the verge of collapse. The daily deaths saw a three-fold rise in comparison with previous waves.The study noted that Delhi's seropositivity, which was at 56.1 per cent, should have offered some protection against the Delta variant of Covid-19. But this remained insufficient in providing the protection expected due to the presence of the delta variant. The delta variant made it difficult to achieve the herd immunity, which works as an indirect protection from a disease when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection."The concept of herd immunity is critical in ending outbreaks, but the situation in Delhi shows that infection with previous coronavirus variants will be insufficient for reaching herd immunity against Delta," PTI quoted study co-author Professor Ravi Gupta from the University of Cambridge as saying."The only way of ending or preventing outbreaks of Delta is either by infection with this variant or by using vaccine boosters that raise antibody levels high enough to overcome Delta's ability to evade neutralisation," Gupta added.The work was led by the National Centre of Disease Control and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in New Delhi with collaborators from the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London, UK, and the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-covid-outbreak-shows-herd-immunity-against-delta-variant-difficult-study-101634293224242.html

Sharing a news clip about the pact between China and Bhutan, Rahul Gandhi said the government’s foreign policy is to “lose friends and influence nobody”.“GOI’s foreign policy: How to lose friends and influence nobody,” the Wayanad MP tweeted.The agreement on a “three-step roadmap” for expediting the boundary talks came four years after Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a weeks-long standoff. Bhutan foreign minister Lyonpo Tandi Dorji and China’s assistant foreign minister signed the MoU during a virtual ceremony on behalf of the respective sides. China’s ambassador to India, Sun Weidong, and Bhutan’s ambassador to India, Maj Gen Vetsop Namgyel, also joined the virtual event.During a regular news briefing on Thursday, the external affairs ministry said that India has taken note of the signing of the MoU between Bhutan and China, but didn’t answer the query whether New Delhi was kept in the loop about the agreement.“You are aware that Bhutan and China have been holding boundary negotiations since 1984. India has similarly been holding boundary negotiations with China,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.Bhutan foreign ministry said in a statement that two sides have held 24 rounds of boundary negotiations and 10 rounds of meeting at the “expert group level” since 1984. It stated that the pact will “provide a fresh impetus” to the negotiations.“It is expected that the implementation of this Roadmap in a spirit of goodwill, understanding and accommodation will bring the boundary negotiations to a successful conclusion that is acceptable to both sides,” the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-lose-friends-rahul-gandhi-takes-swipe-at-centre-after-bhutan-china-mou-101634305598533.html
15-10-2021||India||Global handwashing day: Importance of hand washing||One lesson that Covid-19 taught us was to adopt the practice of washing our hands as one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of germs and stay healthy.Each year on October 15, Global Handwashing Day highlights the importance of handwashing with soap and water at home, in the community, and around the world. The day was founded by the Global Handwashing Partnership in 2008.The theme for 2021 is “Our Future is at Hand – Let’s Move Forward Together.” With a focus on the importance of hand washing and to come up with “creative ways to encourage people to wash their hands with soap at critical times”.“Our hands are the biggest source of microorganisms as we use our hands to carry out the maximum chores from handling currency, carrying stuff around, handling cell phones and hence need to be clean so that they act as our body’s weapons to prevent microorganisms from entering our body,” says Jessica D Souza, Chief Nursing Officer, Global Hospital, Mumbai.Hand washing is one of the most important steps we can take to avoid getting ill or spreading germs. So, education about the risks and benefits associated with hand washing can considerably reduce the number of people who get sick and even die from infectious diseases.“Washing hands with soap under running water is a simplest technique which kills the germs and prevents gastric as well as respiratory infections like flu and diarrhea,” says Kshitija Jadhav, Assistant Nursing Superintendent, Masina Hospital, Mumbai.Hand washing tipsEach of us have our beliefs and follow practices. The number of times we wash hands varies from each individual and depends on the nature of our work. “Wash hands with soap and water, preferably liquid soap as bar soap has higher chances of harvesting harmful organisms, while washing hands make sure to interlace fingers as the space between fingers are great reservoir of organisms, drying the hands is equally important and of course not with a soiled or wet napkin,” says D Souza.UNICEF states that you can lessen the chances of being infected by Covid-19 by 36% by properly washing hands. It is the most effective way to avoid the spread of infections and keep sickness at bay.“One must wash their hands whenever they touch any visibly soiled area, after getting out from any transport, going for marketing and touching various places for selection of items, after using the bathroom, before preparation of food, before eating and after coughing or blowing nose,” says Jadhav.Hand hygieneFor people working in the health industry, 5 moments have to be followed strictly.Moment 1 - before touching a patient.Moment 2 - before a procedure.Moment 3 - after a procedure or body fluid exposure risk.Moment 4 - after touching a patient.Moment 5 - after touching a patient’s surroundings.D’souza adds, “If a person handles babies, they need to double up the frequency of hand washing and someone working in a health care industry is well aware of the 5 moments of hand hygiene.” She encourages us to exercise caution, “Always remember not to be obsessed with hand hygiene, use hand sanitizer when there is no access to soap and water, too much of chemicals can cause skin irritation and be harmful.”Developing hand washing behaviour in childrenPractising hand hygiene by parents in the presence of children can help them build up these practices.“Sometimes it’s difficult to get children follow handwashing so, parents can use few techniques like use of foam soap, blow soap bubbles, use of different shapes and colors of soaps, give them time up of 20 seconds, show them a video on handwashing, ask them to do handwashing dance,” opines Jadhav.D’souza believes it’s important to teach hygiene practices as early as and when they are toddlers. “Show them cartoons of harmful bacteria and reinforce the concept of washing hands by singing songs and reading books which can make the practise very interesting. Using water toys can add on to the fun in washing hands and yes of course guiding them not to waste water.``All of us should make handwashing as a part of our routine life which will really prevent maximum infection and prevent diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-handwashing-day-importance-of-hand-washing-101634304609998.html

The Union ministry of women and child development said that the publishing agencies have not done their “due diligence” before releasing the report.In a statement, the ministry claimed that the estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) regarding the proportion of undernourished population was devoid of “ground reality and facts.”“It is shocking to find that the Global Hunger Report 20201 has lowered the rank of India on the basis of FAO estimate on proportion of undernourished population, which is found to be devoid of ground reality and facts and suffers from serious methodological issues. The publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report, Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, have not done their due diligence before releasing the report,” the ministry said in the statement.Further, it also called the methodology used by FAO as “unscientific” and claimed there was no methodology to measure undernourishment.Also read | India slips to 101st rank in Global Hunger Index 2021; behind Pak, Bangladesh“The methodology used by FAO is unscientific. They have based their assessment on the results of a ‘four question’ opinion poll, which was conducted telephonically by Gallup. There is no scientific methodology to measure undernourishment like availability of food grains per capita during the period. The scientific measurement of undernourishment would require measurement of weight and Height, whereas the methodology involved here is based on Gallup poll based on pure telephonic estimate of the population,” the ministry argued. Gallup is an American analytics and advisory company that conducts opinion polls globally.Also, the ministry expressed doubts over the representativeness of the opinion poll, saying that the respondents were not asked anything about food support received from government or other sources. “The report completely disregards Government’s massive effort to ensure food security of the entire population during the covid period, verifiable data on which are available,” it added. However, HT has not seen or accessed the questions that were asked during the Gallup poll.The ministry also said that it was surprised by the FAO’s ‘State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021’ report, which said that Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have not been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and rather they have improved the proportion of undernourished population over the past year.In addition, the ministry also issued a list of 13 facts, which it said that the above mentioned report has “completely ignored” and also noted the facts were available in the public domain. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna (PMGKAY) and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS) were among some of the initiatives that found a mention in the ministry’s response. It also provided the data on the food grains disbursed to beneficiaries under the schemes. The ministry also listed the monetary assistance that was provided to farmers, farm workers and other low income workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocking-india-says-global-hunger-index-2021-methodology-unscientific-101634303534044.html

15-10-2021||India||Painful that some people are raising questions over Savarkar's life: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said it is painful to see that some people are raising questions over Veer Savarkar's life. Savarkar was bestowed on the title 'Veer' by no government, people added 'veer' to his name to acknowledge his courage and patriotism, the Union minister said as he addressed at the iconic Cellular Jain in Port Blair. His comments come amid a controversy triggered by defence minister Rajnath Singh's comment that Mahatma Gandhi asked Veer Savarkar to file a mercy plea with the British.On the first day of his visit to the Andaman and Nicobar islands, Amit Shah visited the National Memorial Cellular Jail and laid a wreath at the Martyr's Column. As part of the Centre's 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebrations, Amit Shah paid floral tributes at the cellular jail. He also visited the cell of Savarkar.Remembering Veer Savarkar's contribution to the freedom movement, Amit Shah said the man who was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment is now being questioned for his patriotism.Savarkar India’s first, biggest defence expert, says Rajnath Singh"No one can take away the 'veer' from his name as no government gave that. Savarkar was a learned person. He knew many languages, was a great speaker, writer. His cell in Cellular jail is a pilgrimage site, inspiration for India's youth," Amit Shah said."There cannot be a greater pilgrimage than this cellular jail. This place is a 'mahatirth' where Savarkar experienced inhuman torture for 10 years but did not lose his courage, his bravery," Shah said.Releasing a book on Veer Savarkar on Tuesday, Rajnath Singh said, “Time and again, it was said that he filed mercy petitions before the British government seeking his release from jail...The truth is, he didn't file mercy petitions to get himself released. It is a regular practice for a [jailed] person to file mercy petitions. It was Mahatma Gandhi who asked him to file mercy petitions.”The comment drew flak as politicians and historians termed thedefence minister's comment as an attempt to rewrite history. Posting the copy of the letter that Gandhiji wrote to Savarkar's brother on January 25, 1920, leaders pointed out that Savarkar wrote the first petition in 1911 and the second in 1913-14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/painful-that-some-people-are-raising-questions-over-savarkar-s-life-amit-shah-101634302983113.html

Stalin also asked the CMs to allow the sale of firecrackers that are in accordance with the directions set forth by the Supreme Court of India and the National Green Tribunal (NGT).Expressing his concerns about the crippling effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, Stalin said that the lives of around eight lakh workers who depend on the firecracker industry would be affected due to the ban.மாண்பமை உச்சநீதிமன்றம், தேசிய பசுமைத் தீர்ப்பாயம் ஆகியவற்றின் வழிகாட்டுதலின்படி, தயாரிக்கப்பட்ட பட்டாசுகளுக்கு அனுமதி அளிக்க வேண்டுமென்று 4 மாநில (டெல்லி/ஒடிசா/ ராஜஸ்தான்/ஹரியானா) மாண்புமிகு முதலமைச்சர்களுக்கு, மாண்புமிகு முதலமைச்சர் @mkstalin அவர்கள் கடிதம் எழுதியுள்ளார். pic.twitter.com/qY47nsfrPcHe also said that the firecracker industry, concentrated around the Sivakasi town in TN, was one of the “most important” industrial activities in the state. Mentioning that while he understands the concerns of the respective states about air pollution.“I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has already banned certain categories of polluting firecrackers and now, green crackers with significantly less emissions are being manufactured. Therefore a blanket ban on firecrackers is not reasonable,” Stalin wrote.Also read | Chandigarh imposes blanket ban on crackers this Diwali“Moreover, such a ban if imposed by other states also, would lead to the closure of the entire industry, jeopardizing the livelihood of around 8 lakh persons. You would also appreciate that bursting of firecrackers is an integral part of Indian festivals, especially Diwali. A balanced approach that gives due regard to environment, livelihood and public health is possible and necessary,” he further said.The Supreme Court had in July dismissed a plea challenging the NGT’s complete ban sale and use of all firecrackers in Covid-19 times in cities and said that the authorities may allow for the the sale and use of firecrackers based on the category of air quality index (AQI) in the respective cities, several news agencies reported.However, the top court also said that the production of crackers was allowed. People who want to celebrate by bursting crackers could do so with permission from the authorities based on the AQI, the court added. Further, it also said that there was no ban on the manufacture of crackers but only in places where the air quality is poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understand-air-pollution-concerns-blanket-ban-not-reasonable-mk-stalin-writes-to-4-states-on-firecrackers-ban-101634298194085.html

15-10-2021||India||Prasar Bharati to auction archival, premium content||In a move towards self-sustainability and digitization, public broadcasting body Prasar Bharati has decided to allow traditional channels and over the top streaming platforms to purchase archival content that dates back to the pre-Independence era. The content that will be up for e-auction will include footage of the Constituent Assembly debates, or even news recordings of several of India’s key milestones. “The policy will ensure that archival and premium content of Prasar Bharati is syndicated to third parties through an open and transparent mechanism of e-auction in order to fetch the maximum market value of content on demand basis,” Prasar Bharati said in a notification dated October 8. “Prasar Bharati, the Public Service Broadcaster in its mandate has played a key role in modern times for preservation and promotion of Indian culture, history and values. This has been the key factor in content creation since inception. Prasar Bharati has accumulated very rich and heritage content in its centralized repository at Archives as well as a number of Stations, Kendras located in all corners of nation. News division of AIR & DD too have illustrious recording of many important milestones of development of India,” it added. “The TV channels as well as the new channels on OTT are continuously looking for good saleable content. This has created a demand for programme content of Prasar Bharati in India and overseas for the purpose of broadcast as well as streaming on Digital Platforms.”According to Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, both Doordarshan and AIR have accumulated a lot of iconic content, which has been created over decades. “It has been lying idle on tapes and as the technology evolved, the world has moved to the digital sphere. One of the first steps taken by the broadcaster was to digitise this content. This includes many pre-Independence era events, the Constituent Assembly debates and parliamentary debates.”Vempati added that the broadcasting agency received several requests from various OTT platforms and news media channel to access this content. “What was lacking was that there was no enabling framework, so a policy was required by virtue of which content can be syndicated or monetized,” he said. The content will be monetised under both exclusive and non-exclusive categories. “Exclusive rights may be priced at a premium relative to non-exclusive rights; similarly longer-term syndication may be incentivized over shorter duration. Exclusive rights may be auctioned first before attempting auction of non-exclusive rights,” states the notification. While premium content may be auctioned only for a period of one year or less, archival content may be auctioned for a minimum period of 5 years. “Once the licensing period ends, the licensee shall not have any rights to own, share or use the licensed content in any form. He/she may need to participate in the e-auction process once again to obtain further rights after the licensing period,” it adds. Vempati said that the decision was taken keeping in mind the recommendations of the Sam Pitroda Committee, set up to look into the working of Prasar Bharti, and the Ernst and Young audit, which looked into making the organisation self- sustaining. “This way the content will have a global reach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prasar-bharati-to-auction-archival-premium-content-101634298598987.html
15-10-2021||India||Violates my right, says Goan’s plea to let him enter casino. Bombay HC rejects it||PANAJI: The Bombay high court at Goa on Thursday rejected a petition by a local resident who insisted that the law barring Goans from gambling at the coastal state’s casinos violated his constitutional right to equality before the law.Goa Public Gambling Act allows only adults with a valid “tourist permit” to enter a casino for gambling. Goa resident Shukr Sinai Usgaonkar said this provision discriminates against people domiciled in Goa and its permanent residents.A two-judge bench of justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar rejected this argument, holding that the classification between tourists, who come to Goa for a few days to entertain themselves, and locals domiciled in Goa is based on “intelligible differentia”, and is well-founded.“Gambling is totally prohibited but by way of some exceptions, a certain class of places and people are exempted from such prohibition. The object of the State is naturally to prevent the person domiciled in Goa to be lured into such chance games and to suffer poverty and mental trauma for their families. The classification is founded with the object of preventing the spread of gambling and transforming the exception into a rule,” the court said. The judges noted that the locals will have much greater opportunities to access the casinos as compared to tourists who visit the state for a limited period.“Therefore, there is nothing arbitrary or discriminatory in the object or the classification. The petitioner does not challenge the entry of tourists in casinos but insists on permitting him to enter in. Since the petitioner and the tourists belong to separate classes, no case of breach of Article 14 (equality before law) is made out,” the court ruled. Goa, like other Indian states has outlawed public gambling for years, but later amended the law to allow adult visitors holding a tourist permit issued by the state’s Gaming Commissioner to go to casinos.There are six offshore casinos in Goa, boats anchored in the Mandovi river that flows past the capital city.Another amendment in February 2020 made it an offence for any person to enter such a place or area for gaming, without a valid tourist permit. This, Usgaonkar, argued was violative of his personal rights, since he wanted to visit casinos that have started operating in the state.“The impugned provisions contravene Article 14 of the Constitution of India by prohibiting access to persons, who are permanent residents of Goa. The distinction being made between tourists and non-tourists miserably fails the test of reasonable classification which must be fulfilled by any classification to withstand the rigours of Article 14. What is good for tourists cannot be bad for the Goans or non-tourists,” Ugaonkar said.The state’s top law officer, advocate general Devidas Pangam, argued that gambling cannot be equated with any trade or commerce to assert any fundamental right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business.“There is no right vested where the business is dangerous or immoral; such a business may be absolutely prohibited or may be required to be licensed,” the law officer told the two-judge bench.“The State also must see that youth of the state be protected and do not overindulge or get addicted to such activities involving chance or luck. The restriction on people domiciled in Goa is in the interest of the welfare of society. In the absence of such restrictions, the person domiciled in Goa may suffer poverty, which ultimately will hamper the economic and social development of the State,” he said.The high court agreed, underlining that it is the discretion of the State to take a policy decision to restrict the entry of Goan domiciled or permanent residents to the casino. “It is in the public interest of residents of Goa so also in the interest of the State for the justifiable reasons. Thus, the decision to prohibit entry for persons other than the tourist, which excludes persons domiciled or permanent residents of Goa, is a conscious decision of the State, considering its evil consequences on its subject,” the high court verdict said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violates-my-right-says-goan-s-plea-to-let-him-enter-casino-bombay-hc-rejects-it-101634298118559.html

15-10-2021||India||Meditation cave to be built near famous Jageshwar temple in Kumaon||A meditation cave will be built near the ancient Jageshwar temple in Almora, Uttarakhand on the lines of the cave at the Kedarnath shrine area where Prime Minister Narendra Modi meditated in May 2019, officials said. The tourism department has been asked to identify the land for the proposed cave. “A meditation cave on the lines of Kedarnath shrine will be built near Jageshwar temple. The district magistrate and ex-officio president of the management committee have asked the district tourism officer to identify the land for the proposed cave,” said Hemant Bhatt, chief priest of Jageshwar temple in Almora. Jageshwar temple is an ancient temple complex around 35 km from Almora district headquarters. It is a group of 124 temples dated between the seventh to fourteen centuries. Pilgrims visit here round the year to offer prayer to Lord Shiva. District magistrate Vandana Singh visited the temple on Thursday and took the meeting of the management committee and the priests. She said to highlight and attract pilgrims across the country, new features must be added around the temple area. She stressed a meditation cave should be constructed so that pilgrims could find a suitable place for meditation. She asked the district tourism officer to identify the suitable land and send a proposal to the government for the proposed meditation cave. Apart from this, signage will be put along the way leading to the temple, depicting the historical and religious importance of the ancient temple. The signage will depict the tourist places around the temple and in Almora district. Bhatt said, “She emphasised preparing ‘Prasad’ and items for prayer at the local level for offering at the temple. She instructed CCTV cameras to be in operation round the clock and use of an alcohol-meter to check the entry of alcoholics and anti-social elements.” Prime minister Narendra Modi visited the Rudra meditation cave in Kedarnath in May 2019. He spent a day meditating at the cave, which is nearly a kilometre from the Kedarnath shrine. Following Modi’s visit, the cave received a significant number of bookings from across the country for meditation. Following this, the state government constructed three meditation caves in the Kedarnath area. Last month, the state tourism development board also decided to start cave tourism to attract tourists towards the newly explored caves in the hill district of Pithoragarh to diversify the tourism sector which is based majorly on religious tourism and hill stations. The development has come after the exploration of at least nine new caves situated near the Patal Bhuvaneshwar caves in Pithoragarh by the scientists of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meditation-cave-to-be-built-near-famous-jageshwar-temple-in-kumaon-101634296800064.html

15-10-2021||India||India to emerge as a powerful global military through self-reliance: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the country’s goal under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign was to emerge as a powerful military in the world and develop modern defence industry in the country under its own steam, and the steps taken by the government during the last seven years were driven by the self-reliance mantra and aimed at taking this resolve (to build military and defence capabilities) forward. “The transparency, trust and technology-driven approach” prevailing in the defence sector was never witnessed before.” the PM said. “For the first time after Independence, big defence reforms are taking place in the defence sector. Instead of policies that were a hindrance, a single-window system has been put in place, leading to an increase in the industry’s confidence. Indian companies are looking for opportunities in the defence sector, and now the private sector and the government are working together to achieve the national security mission,” Modi said. Policy changes have resulted defence exports shooting up to more than 325 % over the last five years, he said. PM’s comments came while dedicating to the nation on the occasion of Vijaya Dashami, also known as Dussehra; seven new defence companies carved out of the now dissolved Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). He said the new entities would play a critical role in helping the country cut down military imports in line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. In the 21st century, the growth and brand value of any country or company will be determined by its research and innovation, Modi said. “From software to the space sector; India’s growth, its new identity is the biggest example of this (research and innovation). I ask all companies and these seven new firms to make research and innovation a part of their work culture,” he said. “You have to not only match the big companies in the world, but also take lead in future technologies. That’s why it’s important that you have new thinking, give maximum opportunities to research-oriented youth and give them freedom to think. I also ask Indian start-ups to be a part of this new journey in the defence sector.” He said while cost competitiveness was India’s strength; high quality and reliability should be the country’s identity. Last month, the PM said India was shedding its image of being a major importer of military hardware and carving out an identity for itself as a defence exporter, at a time the government has taken several measures to boost self-reliance in the key sector as well as tap the potential of defence markets globally. The world had taken note of the strides made by the country in defence manufacturing with locally produced equipment ranging from modern grenades, assault rifles and drones to fighter jets and warships, PM said on September 14 at a public function in Aligarh. “I am confident that these seven companies will form a strong base for the military strength of the country in the times to come,” he said in a video address, adding that the corporatisation of OFB had been hanging fire for 15 to 20 years. The Union Cabinet, headed Modi, cleared the board’s corporatisation in June to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector. The OFB, which earlier controlled 41 ordnance factories, has been split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products. The government issued an order last month dissolving OFB with effect from October 1. “This year India has entered its 75th year of independence. The country is making new resolutions to build a new future, and completing work that was stuck for decades,” PM said. The new companies are Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, Troop Comforts Limited, India Optel Limited, Munitions India Limited, Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (AVANI), Gliders India Limited and Yantra India Limited. The restructuring would provide more autonomy to the new companies to nurture innovation and expertise, he said. Ordnance factories were engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers. The government expects the seven new professionally managed entities to increase their share in the domestic market through better capacity utilisation and also tap new export opportunities. During the last two decades, various high-level committees underlined the need to improve the functioning of OFB and making its factories vehicles of self-reliance for the country’s defence preparedness.PM said the ordnance factories had a glorious past, but their upgradation was ignored in the post-independence period, leading to the country’s dependence on foreign suppliers. “These seven defence companies will play a major role in changing this situation,” he said. PM said the government has ensured that the interests of the employees are fully protected. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the corporatisation of OFB will help overcome various shortcomings in the previous set-up and provide the new companies incentive to become competitive. “The objective of this restructuring is to transform Ordnance Factories into productive and profitable assets, improve expertise in product range, increase competitiveness, improve quality, enhance cost-efficiency and ensure self-reliance in defence preparedness,” Singh added. All the indents previously placed on OFB by various services, CAPFs and state police have been converted into deemed contracts. These deemed contracts numbering 66 have a cumulative value of more than ₹65,000 crore, as previously reported by HT. The All-India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) and three other workers’ associations boycotted the official inauguration of the new companies, said AIDEF general secretary C Srikumar. “We wore black badges and boycotted the function along with our families. We will decide the future course of our protests shortly,” he said. In a major push to the self-reliance campaign in the defence sector, India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹54,000 crore during the last one-and-a-half month to boost the military’s capabilities with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons. India has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases. The country has also decided to ban the import of 209 weapons and systems to boost self- reliance. The ban, to be implemented progressively till 2025, covers artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft and different types of helicopters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-defence-firms-to-help-import-substitution-pm-modi-101634295540310.html

They want to witness the anniversary of the October Revolution which marked the Bolshevik Party seizing power in Russia in 1917. KR Vijayan (71) and wife Mohana (69) had already put up a notice in their team joint announcing their much-awaited trip because they don’t want to put their regular customers in the lurch. Their Russia trip will begin from October 21 till the 28th. The globe-trotting couple has already visited 25 countries. The couple only planned to hop on this global adventure 14 years back. “In many Russian books (once many books were translated into Malayalam thanks to Commie connections) Volga river is a favourite theme. I am excited enough to see the quiet flowing Volga,” said Vijayan, while preparing tea for his morning customers. His wife was busy peeling coconut to make Puttu - a cylindrical-shaped, steamed breakfast made of rice powder. Their last trip was to Australia in 2019. “Since our hotel was closed on most days in the past two years, this time, I took a loan from the travel agency for tickets. Once I come back, I will pay ₹15,000 monthly and cough it up and start saving for the next adventure,” he said, adding, after every trip he turns wiser and stronger. “It is often said that experience is the best teacher. Travel is the best experience that makes you richer,” he said. The couple’s trips are well known and many celebrities like industrialist Anand Mahindra, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher and writer-politician Shashi Tharoor have lauded them. The Kongani couple’s first trip was to Israel in 2007 and there was no looking back since then. “Travel is in my blood. First, I visited all religious and tourist places in the country and later turned global. I visited Lord Balaji temple more than 100 times,” he said. He named his hotel in Gandhi Nagar, Kadavanthara, after his favourite deity, Sree Balaji. “Look, money will come and go but these memories will remain forever. We both will travel as long as our health permits. After every trip, we feel younger and that keeps us ticking,” said wife Mohana. Their two daughters and sons-in-law always supported their undying passion to explore and travel. After Russia, they have set their eyes on Japan. The elderly couple has a wish. “We would like to meet Prime Minister Modi once. He has a humble origin and started his life as a tea seller. We admire him a lot,” they said, adding they are ready to go to Delhi for this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-2-yr-break-globe-trotting-kerala-tea-vendor-couple-packs-for-next-adventure-101634290078124.html

"A Nihang group at the scene has claimed responsibility, saying that the incident took place because of the deceased's attempt to commit sacrilege with regard to the Sarbaloh Grant," the statement said."The Morcha is against sacrilege of any religious text or symbol, but that does not give anyone the right to take the law into their own hands," the farmers' union said adding that both the parties to this incident, the Nihang group and the deceased person have no relation with Samyukt Kisan Morcha.On Friday, the body of a man with a severed hand was found hanging at the Singhu border, the main protest site of the farmers. A spokesman for Sonepat (Haryana) Police said Nihangs, a Sikh group, were being accused of killing the man for allegedly desecrating Guru Granth Sahib. “They also made the video of the entire incident. Senior officials have reached the site,” the spokesman added. A video clip purportedly of the incident has gone viral on social media platforms. In that video, some Nihangs are seen standing in while the man lies in a pool of blood with his chopped off left hand next to him. The video clip shows the Nihangs asking the man where had he come from and who had sent him for committing sacrilege.

Raising concern over the matter, tea growers in West Bengal's Darjeeling district have now sent a letter to the tea board as well as to the state's chief minister Mamata Banerjee, requesting measures to curb the problem. A few of the producers even alleged that Nepal is purposely sending ‘substandard tea’, imported from China, to flood the Indian markets.The increasing inflow and availability of tea from Nepal has had a direct impact on the prices of prestigious Darjeeling tea. According to the report, the price of Darjeeling tea has fallen by 20-25 per cent in the span of just one year.Nepal accused of delivering ‘substandard tea’People in the tea industry allege that a section of traders, in particular, are selling Nepal's tea as Darjeeling tea. Under the free trade agreement, anyone in India can import tea independently from Nepal. The price of Darjeeling tea on average varies from ₹320 to ₹360 per kilogram in the wholesale market, but Nepal's tea leaves cost less than half this rate.“It is not possible for the consumer to understand whether he is drinking Nepali tea or Darjeeling tea,” the report quoted an official of a tea company that runs a plantation in Darjeeling. “Both these tea leaves have the same taste and even the aroma to a great extent.”Industry sources say about 160 million kilograms of Nepali tea arrive in India every year, of which about 30 to 40 million kilograms are ‘traditional’ in nature. This particular variety of Nepali tea is the one affecting the sale of the Darjeeling tea now, according to the report, which elaborated that traditional Nepali tea – especially the Elam variety – is a close alternative to Darjeeling tea in terms of taste, aroma, and even the appearance.Practice proving ‘difficult’ to stopThe nearly 87 established tea plantations in Darjeeling produce around 80-85 lakh kilograms of tea annually. People associated with the industry explained that when the tea gardens in Darjeeling remained closed for four months in 2017 due to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha agitation, the sale of Nepali tea in India increased.“It is difficult to ban Nepali tea because India has a free-trade agreement with Nepal,” said DTA president BK Saria. “We have asked the tea board to increase surveillance on Nepali tea so that it cannot be sold in the domestic market as Darjeeling tea.”He pointed out that Japanese buyers of Darjeeling tea also pulled out of a trade deal after facing irregular supply in 2017. Earlier, they used to buy 10 lakh kg of Darjeeling tea annually.The Tea Association of India, in the meanwhile, has appealed to the Union commerce ministry to take concrete initiatives to curb the problem. It has raised the issue regarding the sale of Darjeeling tea and pointed out that the brand's credibility is being damaged due to the growing dominance of Nepali tea.According to data from the National Tea and Coffee Development Board in Nepal, more than half of the 2.52 crore kg of tea produced annually in the 157 tea gardens of the Himalayan country is exported to India.Mamata Banerjee gets a letterThe Darjeeling Tea Association (DTA), an organisation of 87 tea garden owners in the Darjeeling area, recently sent a letter to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee demanding a complete ban on the import of “cheap and substandard tea” from Nepal, urging her to take proper measures to “save the industry”."Darjeeling tea production declined from 9.5 million kg to just 6 million kg in 2020 due to agitation in the hilly region in 2017," wrote Saria in the letter. “In the meantime, the salaries of the tea garden employees increased by about 50 per cent.”Following the agitation, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic arrived, further affecting the domestic and foreign markets due to the subsequent lockdown, the letter explained. Now the cheap tea being imported from Nepal has managed to flood the Indian markets, being sold as Darjeeling tea, it added.Demand to set standardsThe DTA estimates that about 9 million kilograms of tea imported from Nepal were sold in the name of Darjeeling tea during the year 2020. “The situation is really serious,” the report quoted says Sandeep Mukherjee, principal advisor to the DTA, as saying. “Darjeeling's tea industry is not being given enough attention. If the tea from Nepal keeps flooding the Indian markets like this, the situation of the entire industry will get worse and many plantations here will have to shut down. This will affect the daily livelihood of thousands of people.”According to DTA data, 67,000 people are directly employed while nearly 400,000 are indirectly associated with the tea industry in Darjeeling.Meanwhile, reports said that Mamata Banerjee has taken stock of the situation and sought a detailed report from the state's chief secretary on the matter. The issue is then expected to be raised with the central government. The tea board, too, has also urged the Union commerce ministry to prepare standards for the import of Nepali tea. It has demanded that the name of the manufacturing country be imprinted on imported tea to curb the practice of selling Nepali tea as Darjeeling tea. (With inputs from Deutsche Welle)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-substandard-tea-from-nepal-is-threatening-to-wipe-out-darjeeling-plantations-101634281407496.html

Addressing the launch event of these companies on the occasion of Vijaya Dashami, PM Modi said, “India is taking new resolutions to build a new future. The decision to revamp 41 ordnance factories and the launch of these seven companies is a part of this resolution journey. This decision has been pending for the last 15-20 years."The seven new companies which have been launched are—Munitions India Limited (MIL); Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (AVANI), Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited (AWE India), Troop Comforts Limited (TCL), Yantra India Limited (YIL); India Optel Limited (IOL) and Gliders India Limited (GIL). They will have 66 firm contracts worth ₹65,000 crore from the three services and paramilitary forces.Pointing out that India's ordnance factories were the most powerful globally at one period of time, Prime Minister Modi said that these factories had the experience of more than 100 to 150 years.“During World War, the world saw the strength of India's ordnance factories. We used to have better resources and world-class skills. Post Independence, we needed to upgrade these factories, adopt new-age technology. But it didn’t get much attention,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also urged start-ups to be a part of this journey in the country's defence sector. “You should think about your research, how your products can benefit from each other's capabilities in collaboration with these companies.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was also present during Friday's launch, said the Centre is aiming to bring India among the top countries across the globe in the field of the defence sector. "Today seven companies are being dedicated to the nation in the course of the reformative change. There could hardly have been a better opportunity for such reforms to achieve its new objectives," Singh said.According to a release from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Thursday, the Centre decided to convert the Ordnance Factory Board from a government department into seven 100% government-owned corporate companies to improve self-reliance in the defence preparedness of India.The release added that the above move will bring about enhanced functional autonomy, efficiency and will unleash new growth potential and innovation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-7-new-defence-companies-will-be-huge-base-for-military-power-pm-modi-101634281287322.html

Raut’s retort came after Mohan Bhagwat, during his annual Vijaya Dashami address at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, said that drugs were coming into India from bordering countries and the money generated is being used for anti-national activities.Bhagwat also said the Centre is doing its best to control the menace and urged families to incorporate the right values in their children so that drug addiction can be prevented“If he (Mohan Bhagwat) says something, it has significance. If money generated from drugs and narcotics is being used against the country, then what is the Centre doing. Who is heading the Centre?” Raut asked.Raut said that when it was decided that demonetisation will be enforced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that it will stop the drug mafia. “But if this (drug mafia) has not been stopped, then the RSS chief's concerns are correct and we support it as well,” the Sena MP told reporters.The political debate over the drugs issue comes amid two cases—the Mumbai cruise ship drugs raid involving Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and the Mundra drug haul case where 3,000 kilograms of drugs were seized.While Aryan Khan will continue to remain in Mumbai's Arthur Road jail for another six days and order on his bail plea will be passed on October 20, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday conducted raids at five locations in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) linked to the Mundra port case.

Describing the challenges he faced in this field during his tenure as the chief minister, he said, “Dropout rate among girl students was a challenge, and this was due to various reasons. One such reason was a lack of washroom facilities. However, with various schemes today, washroom facilities have been built, and the dropout rate among girls has declined.”The true power of “sabka saath, sabka vikas,” he said, he saw in Gujarat.PM Modi also praised the new chief minister of the western state, Bhupendra Patel, whom he described as a person who is attached to his roots. “He is a CM who has deep interest in technology.

Speaking at the Sangh's annual Vijayadashami address in Nagpur, where it is headquartered, Bhagwat also alleged that the money from such businesses is being misused for “anti-national” activities.Also Read | Ahead of talks with Taliban, RSS chief says India needs to be prepared for all possibilities“Consumption of different types of narcotics is rising across the country. How should this be curbed, we don't know. However, what we do know is who gets the revenue that is generated from this business. The money is misused for anti-India activities. This is encouraged by people sitting across the border,” Bhagwat said.Though the RSS chief called upon the government to put an end to the drugs menace, he also stressed that one can control the urge to consume these through what Bhagwat called “mann ka break, uttam break” (self control is the best control). “It's upon the younger generation to prepare themselves for this. However, what one should accept or refuse in front of others, all this should be taught at home,” Bhagwat said.He also slammed over-the-top (OTT) platforms and bitcoins, both of which, he said, are “uncontrollable.”Bhagwat's remarks come in the backdrop of controversy surrounding actor Shah Rukh Khan's son, Aryan, who was among several people arrested earlier this month by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) from a cruise ship in Mumbai.

In his annual Vijayadashami speech, Bhagwat said India should be militarily alert at all times in the wake of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. “…Keeping the channels for dialogue open and considering the scope for a change of (Taliban) heart, India must be prepared for all possibilities,” he said. “Taliban may have changed, but has Pakistan changed? Has China changed its intent towards India? Considering the possibility of a change of heart, of dialogue solving issues, we still need to be prepared,” he said. He cautioned against the support countries such as Russia, Turkey, China, and Pakistan have shown to the Taliban. India has opted for a wait-and-watch policy and stressed that Afghanistan should not become a safe haven for terrorists and terror groups should not be allowed to use Afghan soil. It has announced it will participate in the meeting being hosted by Russia involving the Taliban next week. China, Pakistan, and Iran will also attend the talks with the Taliban in Moscow.Some security analysts have linked developments in Afghanistan with the re-emergence of terror in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).Against this backdrop, Bhagwat underlined the need to “accelerate” the “emotional integration” of the people of J&K with the rest of the country.“Terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir have restarted the spate of targeted violence against national-minded people, especially Hindus to lower their morale and re-establish the reign of terror in the Valley. Efforts for curbing and finishing off the terrorist activities needs speeding up,” he said, days after targeted attacks left seven civilians dead in Kashmir amid a spike in violence there.Bhagwat also called for stepping up vigilance along borders from where intrusions and attacks have happened stealthily. He underlined the need for ramping up internal security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-talks-with-taliban-rss-chief-says-india-needs-to-be-prepared-for-all-possibilities-101634274658218.html

Has China changed its intent towards India? Considering the possibility of a change of heart, of dialogue solving issues, we still need to be prepared,” he said.Bhagwat said that population imbalance has become a problem in India and urged for the formation of a population policy for the next five decades which is applicable to all groups. “While reimagining the country’s development one predicament comes to the fore which appears to concern many viz. the population. A population policy that is applicable to all groups is therefore imperative,” he said.Mohan Bhagwat also alleged that the use of narcotics is rising in India and drugs are coming in from bordering countries. “Money from such businesses is used for anti-national activities. All of this should be controlled,” he said.His remark on narcotics comes amid the arrest of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan in connection with the alleged seizure of banned drugs from a cruise ship in Mumbai. Aryan Khan will remain in the city’s Arthur Road jail for another six days.Amid the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in India which has infected more than 34 million people and killed 451,814 till now, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh president said that the pandemic has reinforced the usefulness of the traditional knowledge systems and the vision emanating from ‘selfhood’.“We experienced the efficacy of our traditional lifestyle practices and Ayurvedic medicinal system in fighting and tackling the coronavirus,” the RSS chief said, adding the second wave of the pandemic was far more destructive than the first one and did not even spare the youth. He urged that everyone should be prepared for the upcoming third wave of Covid-19.As the pandemic pushed school and college students across India to opt for online classes and lectures, leading to increased use of mobile phones and other technologies,Bhagwat during his Vijaya Dashami address expressed concerns over the top (OTT) platforms.“There is no control over what is shown on OTT platforms. Due to Covid-19, children have been using mobile phones.

The 47-year-old woman moved the high court in 2012 after a family court refused to accept her claim of being the 66-year-old man’s legally wed wife.“Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the appellant [second wife] had been kept in dark about the first marriage of the respondent [husband] with Chandrakala in the year 1990, on proof of the said fact, the contention of the appellant that she is legally wedded wife of the respondent cannot be accepted,” said a division bench of justices AS Chandurkar and GA Sanap on Thursday.Chandrakala pleaded the family court discarded her evidence and testimony of witnesses supporting her claim that she married the 66-year-old in accordance with their rites and customs in August 2003. She added they lived together for over five years. She claimed the man deserted her in October 2008 when she refused to pay him ₹50,000. Chandrakala said the man’s relatives beat her when she eventually traced him.The man denied having married Chandrakala and said he got married in 1990 and divorced in 2009. Thus, he claimed, in any case, the second marriage was void. The high court accepted his contention and held Chandrakala was not his legally wedded wife as he was yet to get divorced at the time of the second marriage. Chandrakala admitted in her cross-examination that she knew about his first marriage.The bench rejected her contention that she was entitled to maintenance on account of the five years of cohabitation even if her marriage was held to be void.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wife-can-t-be-called-legally-wedded-spouse-even-if-hc-101634270878144.html

The normal date for its withdrawal from the entire country is October 15.The monsoon started withdrawing very late this year, on October 6 against the normal date of September 17, but then withdrew rapidly from different parts of the country, according to scientists.“We can say the monsoon’s withdrawal is complete when the withdrawal line reaches 15 degree latitude. We are close to that line. Very small portions of Goa, Maharashtra and the North-East are left. Two low pressure areas have developed over Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal which will bring rain to parts of central and east India but that cannot be categorised as monsoon rain,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.With the withdrawal of the monsoon, the northern plains get ready for the onset of winter, although, in recent years, this has also meant an increase in air pollution.The monsoon will completely withdraw by Friday, an expert said, but rains could continue over some parts of the country. “The monsoon is expected to completely withdraw during the next 24 hours. But due to the interaction of a western disturbance lying over north Pakistan and a low pressure area near Odisha coast which will travel inwards, scattered rain is expected over Uttar Pradesh and Delhi NCR and heavy rain over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand between Saturday to Monday,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate change and meteorology), Skymet Weather.And when the rain stops, he added, minimum temperatures are likely to drop over northwest India even as the northeast monsoon sets in over peninsular India. “We can expect pollution levels to increase over northwest India when wind direction changes to northwesterly once again October 18 onwards,” Palawat added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-complete-its-withdrawal-today-101634251106561.html
15-10-2021||India||Congress finalises succession plan for House panels||The Congress party, which has struggled to effect a smooth succession plan for organisational positions, seems to have managed the process efficiently in its parliamentary wings.Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi’s shift from the defence panel to the standing committee on home affairs is the latest evidence of this, a senior Congress leader pointed out. Singhvi, who headed the parliamentary panel on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice between August 2011 and April 2012, is slated to replace Anand Sharma, the current chairman of the panel on home affairs next year.“It was a deliberate move to bring him from defence panel, an equally important committee, to the committee on home,” confirmed a second senior leader. Anand Sharma, the deputy leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha, will retire from his current term in April next year.The convention is for parties to write to the Parliament secretariat , requesting that a certain member be moved from one panel to another.In this case, the move may be needed because it may be difficult for Sharma to immediately re-enter the house, from Himachal Pradesh (where he was elected from to the Rajya Sabha) which is currently ruled by the BJP.In April, his lone seat will be up for grabs in the biennial Rajya Sabha election from the hilly state, putting the BJP at a clear advantage. MLAs of a state vote to elect Rajya Sabha members.The situation is similar to that of former union minister Mallikarjun Kharge’s nomination to Rajya Sabha in July 2020.As Ghulam Nabi Azad was retiring in March 2021, the Congress brought Kharge into the Upper House to ensure a smooth transition. Azad, a popular face of the Congress, is yet to return to the Upper House as the J&K legislative body has been dissolved after the bifurcation of the state into two Union territories and the Congress has not been able to find any opportunity from any other state to bring him back.While both Azad and Sharma are among the 23 letter leaders who wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in 2019 seeking wholesale change in the functioning of the party, the former J&K chief minister has been given key responsibilities by the party.He was part of the delegation to Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday to submit a memorandum to the President over the incident at Lakhimpur Kheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-finalises-succession-plan-for-house-panels-101634250128965.html
15-10-2021||India||‘Could revoke Art 370 because had clear majority’: Amit Shah makes a point in Goa||PANAJI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday asked Bharatiya Janata Party workers in Goa to raise the bar and set their sights on getting a complete majority in next year’s assembly elections on its own, a feat that the BJP has achieved only once in the past.Shah said it is only when the BJP has a complete majority that it can provide a decisive government.“Why do we need a complete majority? How do two MLAs more, or less matter? It makes a difference. You tell me if Modi hadn’t got a complete majority, would the Ram Janmabhoomi temple be built in Ayodhya? If there was no full majority, would we have been able to revoke Article 370? If there was no full majority, would we have been able to take India on a path of development?” Shah said in his address at a convention of BJP workers.Nudging party workers to target getting a “complete majority’ was a recurring theme in Amit Shah’s address on Thursday. The only occasion when the BJP secured a majority on its own in Goa was in the 2012 general elections when the party won 21 of the state assembly’s 40 seats, while the Congress got just 9 seats.In the 2017 elections, the Congress emerged as the largest single party with 17 seats but was slow to tie up alliances to come close to the majority mark of 21, as compared with the BJP which won 13 seats but secured enough support from the newly-elected MLAs to clear the trust vote. Over the next few years, the BJP’s strength was bolstered by inducting 13 MLAs from the Congress and 2 from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) to raise the party’s tally to 27.At Thursday’s convention, Shah continued to convince the local BJP workers to focus on the ambitious target.“Everyone says double engine government (with BJP both in power in the Centre and the state). You form a double-engine government, but some compartments are falling short. Am I right or wrong? We do not want a government with fewer compartments. Step into the electoral fray to bring a government with a complete majority. Complete majority means stability, complete majority means the right to govern without hassles, complete majority means the right to rule corruption free, complete majority means the ability to implement antyodaya (compassion for the lowliest) principles,” Shah told a convention of around a thousand party workers. This is not important just for the BJP, but for Goa too, he said turning to the state’s voters.“Why should we be concerned about aaya raams gaya raams. Elect a government with a complete majority, and it will be our responsibility to double the speed of development…. It comes with many advantages; it also leads to transparency. Modi was able to transform India because of a government with complete majority, in 7 years, just 7 years against the Congress’ 60 years,” Shah said, appealing to the coastal state’s electorate to elect a BJP government.“Goa is already a model state, but we will make it a kind of model state which you may have not even imagined. It is a small state, it just needs some effort and one direction. It can only happen when there is a complete majority,” Shah said. Shah advised party workers to focus on polling booths where the party didn’t do well the last time.“We will have to explain to them how governments used to function with the help of horse-trading and corruption. Look at the transformation today. There is no sign of corruption,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-revoke-art-370-because-had-clear-majority-amit-shah-makes-a-point-in-goa-101634241832892.html

The 72-year-old priest will be the new Catholicos and Malankara Metropolitan--the religious titles of the supreme head of the church.He was elected unanimously at the meeting of the Malankara Syrian Christian Association, an apex body comprising priests and laity representatives from all parishes under the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.The meeting was held virtually and was attended by 3091 representatives from across the world, a church spokesman said.“There was only one candidate. There was no voting”, the Kottayam-headquartered Church’s spokesperson Fr Johns Abraham Konat told PTI after the election process got over at Parumala near here.Severios will be ordained as the Catholicos at a ritualistic function to be held later. His new name will also be declared then, he said.The date of his ordination as Catholicos will be decided at the ongoing Synod of the church.According to the Church, the word ‘Catholicos’ means “the general head” or “general bishop” and it can be considered as equivalent to “universal Bishop”.”This title and rank is much more ancient than the title Patriarch in the church”, the Church claims.All the metropolitans of the Church including Severios were present at Parumala during the election process while other members participated in the process virtually from across the world.Severios’s election to the supreme post of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church came as he was serving as the Metropolitan of the Diocese of Kandanad West of the church.Born in 1949 in Vazhoor near Kottayam, Severios took graduation in Chemistry from Kerala University before joining Orthodox Seminary, Kottayam. After completing his religious education in India, he pursued his higher studies in theology at the Theological Academy, Leningrad, Russia. Later he joined Oriental Institute, Rome, and completed his MTh and PhD from there.Ordained a deacon in 1976 and a priest in 1978, Severios was elevated to the post of an Episcopa in 1991 and metropolitan in 1993.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mathews-mar-severios-elected-supreme-head-of-malankara-orthodox-syrian-church-101634240093340.html

I can file a defamation case for this but I will just advise you to correct yourself,” Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter.He was reacting to the statements made by Bommai before the media on Wednesday wherein he appeared to be justifying moral policing and communal violence in the state. The CM even slammed Siddaramaiah on Twitter.“While you were the CM, you became the icon of anti Hindus by getting killed Hindu activists as Tipu Sultan did in his regime, I need not learn administration or policing from you, we have an able police force to tackle the law and order which was sitting Ducks under ur government,” Bommai had stated in his response to Siddaramaiah’s series of tweets on Wednesday.Siddaramaiah further went to say, “Mr @BSBommai, You have said that you need not learn administration or policing from me. Thank you. Had you learnt anything from your father Shri S R Bommai or me, you would not have joined a communal party just for power & support anti-constitutional activities,” Siddaramaiah posted on twitter.The former chief minister said that he never expected such “loose comments” from Bommai and that the latter was trying to make such statements to please the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) by “deviating from facts and logic”.“Mr @BSBommai, Like anti-social elements, you may be emotionally bankrupt and continue to light communal fires for political gains. But true Hindus are intelligent enough to see through your act of treason!! Initiate investigation based on the report released by our party,” Siddaramaiah said in his post on Thursday.Bommai had courted controversy with his statements that appeared to justify incidents of moral policing and communal violence on Wednesday.“There are several sentiments in the society. Those emotions should not be affected and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt there is likely to be an action and reaction,” Bommai said in Mangaluru, about 350 kms from Bengaluru on Wednesday.The statements come even as the number of instances relating to moral policing and communal violence have been increasing in the state.“Even youngsters should watch their actions to ensure it does not hurt sentiments of the society,” the CM had said, adding that there should be morality in the society and we cannot live without it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-feud-over-moral-policing-siddaramaiah-slams-karnataka-cm-bommai-for-loose-remark-101634239432612.html
15-10-2021||India||Actor Vijay’s fans win more 115 seats in Tamil Nadu local body polls||Chennai: Tamil actor Vijay has been hinting at his entry into politics for a decade and he silently tested waters in the recently concluded rural local body elections where members from his fan club have won in 115 of the 169 seats from where they contested, according results announced by the state election commission. Though the number is not big, this is the first time that members of the All Indian Thalapathy Vijay Makkal Iyakkam (AITVMI) contested an election and managed to outdo Kamal Hassan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and Seeman’s Naam Thamizhar Katchi (which emerged as the third largest party in the assembly elections) as they both drew a blank. The ruling DMK has trounced the opposition AIADMK in the 27,003 positions that were filled in the elections for which counting began on October 12. TVMI members have won in all the nine newly carved districts -- Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, Kallakurichi, Villupuram, Ranipet, Tirupattur, Tenkasi and Tirunelveli -- where two-phase elections were conducted on October 6 and 9. N Anand, the general secretary of AITVMI, said that the 115 seats they won included the post of a panchayat president in Vannur union in Villupuram district by one of their women candidates, Savithri. Vijay is the president of the AITVMI which was founded about 25 years ago and all of the actor’s fan clubs come under the umbrella association which has more than 1 million members, he added. Anand, known more by his prefix ‘Bussy’, was a former MLA from the Bussy constituency in neighbouring Puducherry where he belonged to the All India NR Congress which is currently ruling the union territory.Though the fans contested as independent candidates, actor Vijay allowed them to use his picture and the AITVMI flag during the campaign.This election performance is also surprising in part because there has been no announcements, campaigns from the actor even as he moved court against his parents seeking a bar on them from launching anything political by using his name. In September Vijay filed a petition in a Chennai city court against his father and film director, S A Chandrasekhar, and mother Shoba Sekar for trying to register an outfit, Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, with the Election Commission of India. He issued a public statement that he had no links with this outfit in November 2020 and he went to court this September seeking a restraint against them from conducting meetings or carrying out other activities in his name.In Tamil Nadu, which has pioneered for generations of silver screen idols to switch over to politics successfully, Vijay’s place has been widely anticipated. In chronological order, MG Ramachandran was able to straddle both films and politics as he remained chief minister until his death while his contemporary Sivaji Ganesan was a failure in politics. In contemporary times, while Kamal Haasan has been contesting elections since 2019, his peer Rajinikanth after several fits and starts backtracked from floating a party just ahead of the April 6 assembly elections. Vijay is often pitted against actor Ajith Kumar and the latter has also issued a public statement that he will always steer clear of politics. Another actor who tasted early success emerging as an alternative to the Dravidian parties but lost his way is Vijayakanth whose party, Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, was the second largest in the 2011 elections but won just one seat in the rural local polls. “Our time will come. Until then work tirelessly,” he told his party cadre in a statement on Thursday. Vijay, like his predecessors MGR and Rajinikanth, enjoys a mass appeal particularly among young men in Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring state of Kerala. Vijay has been thorny for the BJP because of his film dialogues against the BJP-led union government’s introduction of GST. State BJP leaders targeted him for being a Christian and in a couple of years I-T sleuths raided premises linked to him which his supporters called political vendetta as the searches didn’t find anything significant. On the day of assembly elections, Vijay cycled to his polling booth which was read as him protesting the high fuel prices although the actor distanced himself from that speculation. “The rural youngsters consider Vijay as a crusader,” says political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “It’s history repeating itself. Before the 2011 assembly elections, Vijayakanth also asked his fan club members to contest in the rural local body polls even before forming his political party and they did well. Similarly, for Vijay, the idea is to test the waters ahead of the bigger elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-vijay-s-fans-win-more-115-seats-in-tamil-nadu-local-body-polls-101634239372635.html

15-10-2021||India||Flooding in Bengaluru part of man-made problem: Experts||Bengaluru: The recent flooding in Bengaluru, experts said, is part of human-made problem as rains have been a constant feature in the city’s history, raising questions if the civic bodies have got their act together while approving major infrastructure projects.MN Srihari, a retired civil servant, expert on urban infrastructure and policy, on Thursday said that rains have been an integral part of the city but the bigger question is why flooding is happening only in recent years.“A lot of projects and houses have been built above the lakes. Dried rains do not have rain in summer but attract rains during monsoons,” he said, adding that the water has nowhere to flow.He added that cutting trees which traps a significant amount of water; and concretisation has exacerbated the challenges not only in Bengaluru but other parts of the world as well. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has denied that there has been any flooding in the city and heavy rains sometimes tends to leave water in one place for sometime before it naturally drains out.Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner said that heavy rains tend to loosen soil and cause structural damage.Srihari said that when rain water accumulates in the soil which were earlier lake beds, the soil tends to be affected, causing structural damages and adds to the possibility of them collapsing.Not monitoring engineering process, structural integrity and giving approvals to buildings on any piece of land, Srihari said, was adding to the risk in a city that has grown rapidly and in an unplanned manner, encroaching everything in its path to accommodate the needs of the increasing population.V Ravichandar, an urban infrastructure expert, said that several of these buildings have many violations which is against the building plan approval.From around 1.2 million population in 1960, Bengaluru is now home to over 12 million people with most of the spike being seen since 2006.Bengaluru has seen at least six buildings collapse since the last week of September with at least 400 more that need to be brought down at the earliest.Gupta said that apart from the 185 dilapidated buildings identified in its survey in 2019, only 10 have been demolished so far. On Thursday he said that there are at least 300 more such buildings identified in the rapid survey carried out this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flooding-in-bengaluru-part-of-man-made-problem-experts-101634239312751.html
15-10-2021||India||No respite for Bengaluru as heavy rains continue to wreak havoc||As heavy rains continue to lash Bengaluru, several areas were inundated leaving homes, cars and property submerged along with the lives and livelihoods of people residing in low-lying areas of the city. Since the beginning of October, Bengaluru has received 77% more rain at 140 mm as against the normal 79 mm, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) said. At least 21 lives have been lost till now since October, it said. Videos of the flooded basements and homes surfaced on Thursday with people sitting on elevated objects to avoid the water. There was at least three feet of water in several basements, damaging cars and other valuables. On Wednesday night, the overflow from Madiwala lake entered basements of homes and apartments, damaging cars, disrupting electricity and other valuables. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), however, said that there has been no flooding in the city and it has been less noticeable compared to earlier years. “There has been no flooding this year and almost very less noticeable this year,” Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP told Hindustan Times on Thursday. Gupta said that after heavy rains, water remains on roads for a couple of hours and drains out on its own. As citizens continues to face the brunt, social media was flooded with videos of people and their property inundated as heavy downpour continue to batter the city since the beginning of the month, which is said to be the highest in decades. Meanwhile, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Karnataka for the next three days. Earlier on Monday, the city started witnessing heavy rainfall which later cause a flood-like situation. Several areas, including the Kempegowda International Airport (KIAL), were waterlogged following heavy rainfall in the city. Bengaluru houses over 12 million people or nearly a quarter of Karnataka’s population and its rapid and unplanned expansion has led to encroachment of lakes, storm water drains and other natural wetlands that traps the water on concretised roads, damaging more than it can benefit. Officials from the KSNDMC said that the rules of disaster management applies even to Bengaluru during rains with ex-gratia paid to the families of people who have lost their lives, damaged homes and other repairs. The Karnataka government pays ₹5 lakh for a full demolished home in a city where the average per square feet cost is around ₹4,000-5,000. There have been at least six buildings that have collapsed in Bengaluru since the last week of September with two collapsing just on Wednesday. There have been several people who have lost their homes as buildings continue to collapse in the city on account of poor construction, low maintenance, violation of plan approvals and not following basic civil engineering principles. “What happened is that due to continuous downpour at a number of places, the soil and the strata have got saturated with water which has led to some kind of weakening of the binding strength of the soil or load that has led to certain building wall collapse,” Gupta said. Gupta said that there were 185 buildings that were in a dilapidated condition when the city corporation carried out a survey in 2019 of which only 10 have been demolished so far. The city corporation ordered a rapid survey on September 29 which has shown that an additional 300 buildings require urgent attention. Gupta said that the BBMP will not advise on how a building must be built as it would be difficult for the officials to vet every building in the city. He said that the BBMP can’t just tear down a structure and will have to serve notices to owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-respite-for-bengaluru-as-heavy-rains-continue-to-wreak-havoc-101634239073739.html
15-10-2021||India||Internal rumblings within the Congress in Karnataka as top leadership fight for dominance||Congress leaders in Karnataka casting aspersions on state president DK Shivakumar is adding to the growing challenge for the party, people aware of the development said. In a video, which has now gone viral, KPCC media coordinator MA Saleem and former Lok Sabha MP VS Ugrappa were caught on camera discussing an alleged corruption scandal of Shivakumar right before a press conference was to be addressed. The leaders thought they were whispering to each other, but the conversation was picked up on news channels’ microphones in front of them.Shivakumar on Thursday maintained his composure by not reacting harshly to the incident that has given more fodder to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to attack the Congress in the state.“Whoever wanted to talk, they have spoken. Whoever wanted to use it, whichever way, they have done so. I don’t blame BJP, media or anyone else,” Shivakumar said.The Congress was quick to expel Saleem, who was heard calling Shivakumar a “collection giraki” (a slang for corruption), for six years while Ugrappa, considered close to Siddaramaiah, has been served only a show-cause notice.Saleem on Thursday told local news channels that he regretted the entire episode and feigned innocence. He also said that he was a member of the KPCC and the bylaws indicate that he had to be served a notice before being expelled from the party.“I am embarrassed about the incident and it saddens me to show my face to Shivakumar. He is like a god to us. If I get an opportunity, I will apologise to him,” he said.The developments raise questions if all is well within the Congress party, in which the two tallest leaders, Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah, have been involved in a cold war of sorts for dominance within the party.Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka between 2013-15 and wants to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate again for the 2023 assembly elections. Legislators who support the leader have made overt statements such as calling Siddaramaiah the next “chief minister”. Shivakumar, too, nurses the ambition of taking up the top job if Congress does manage to secure a majority in the 224-seater assembly.There is a clear line of differences within the Congress with the president and leader of the opposition (Siddaramaiah) on either side. Several other factions within Congress have blunted their attacks on the BJP and its strategy in recent elections.The BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) have intensified their attacks against each other in the run-up to the polls in Hanagal and Sindgi on October 30, in which all three parties are testing waters before the yet-to-be-announced Zilla and Panchayat polls and the 2023 assembly elections.People aware of the developments do not write off the possibility that the entire episode was part of the Siddaramaiah camp to undermine Shivakumar and his authority.Repeated questions by the media to Shivakumar of the possibility that this entire episode was pre-meditated did not yield any specific response. One party legislator said that the conspiracy was a “possibility” and another worker said that this shows the collapse of the KPCC and Shivakumar losing control of the party. “The KPCC has become a den of gossip and no one come there to work for the party anymore,” said one person aware of the developments, requesting anonymity. There were reports that Saleem was getting threat calls from workers after the incident. A woman Congress worker was seen abusing Ugrappa after the incident on Wednesday.“It’s not about me and the party,” Shivakumar said, adding that he did not know of any threats.The infighting within Congress has given the BJP a free run in the state despite their troubles that began with BS Yediyurappa and refuse to die down even after the 78-year-old stepped down as chief minister on July 26, only to be replaced by Basavaraj Bommai, who has been in the party for just 13 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internal-rumblings-within-the-congress-in-karnataka-as-top-leadership-fight-for-dominance-101634239012640.html
15-10-2021||India||SIT to record statement of Italy-based woman from Kerala in Monson Mavunkal case||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the deals of arrested Kochi-based antique collector Monson Mavunkal on Thursday decided to record the statement of Italy-based Malayali woman Anitha Pullayil who reportedly introduced many senior police officers to the alleged conman. Later, he used his connection with the officers to cheat and intimidate gullible antique buyers. A senior SIT officer said her statement was crucial in the ongoing investigation and she has been asked come to Kochi to record it. After a series of cheating cases surfaced against Mavunkal; she appeared in a couple of Malayalam news channels saying that she advised many people allegedly conned by him to approach the police. Pullayil also said she was not aware of the shady deals of Mavunkal and stayed away from him after she got an inkling regarding some of them. “We feel her statement is important for further investigation. So we issued a notice to her,” said a senior officer of the SIT who did not want to be named. Officers expect questioning Pullayil will help unravel more about his shady deals. Mavunkal was arrested on September 26 after five businessmen approached chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office complaining that they were cheated by him of ₹10 crore by promising shares in the upcoming international antique museums in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Later, several other businessmen filed cheating complaints against him and a rape survivor also alleged that he had threatened her to withdraw the complaint against her tormentor. She said Mavunkal threatened to release her “inappropriate pictures and video” if she failed to withdraw the case. After several complaints cropped up, the government constituted a special investigation team under Additional Director General of Police S Sreejith. After his arrest, shocking details of cover up and laxity came to light. Many police officers were regular at his house and museum and there was even a police beat box outside his house where the patrol party would have to sign frequently. He also ran a cosmetology clinic in Kochi. However, his degree was found to be fake. After his photos with state Congress president K Sudhakaran surfaced, the leader said that he knew him personally and sought treatment from him but was not aware of his shady deals. The order of former police chief Loknath Behra giving directions to open a police booth outside his house was also leaked later. In the order, he mentioned that Mavunkal’s house- cum- museum holds many priceless antiques and it was worth giving police security. In one of the photos, Behra was seen sitting on a throne which Mavunkal said he obtained from descendents of Mysore king Tipu Sultan. All complaints against Mavunkal including intelligence reports were hushed up with the help of officers close to him. One inspector general of police, a DIG, two SPs and two station house officers are under scanner now. A motivational speaker, doctor, cosmetologist, art promoter, peacenik and human rights activist Mavunkal, only a matriculate, had donned many roles for more than five years and hoodwinked many. In 2019 the state intelligence had stated that Mavunkal was a fraudster and a high-level probed needed against him but thanks to his high connections nothing happened. In his YouTube videos he claimed that he owns many antique pieces like Mysore emperor Tipu Sultan’s throne, silver coins Judas received for betraying Jesus Christ, Soloman- era gold coins and rare books on Maratha warrior Shivaji and Mughal emperor Aurangazeb. He also claimed that he is a German-trained cosmetologist and treated many VIPs. There are also reports that many cine personalities frequented him quite often. Later police found that most of these antique were made in Kerala and Tamil Nadu by local craftsmen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-to-record-statement-of-italy-based-woman-from-kerala-in-monson-mavunkal-case-101634238952485.html
15-10-2021||India||Centre considers domestic operating system to boost cybersecurity infrastructure||The ministry of electronics and information technology is discussing creating a domestic operating system, to boost the government’s capabilities to deal with potential internal and external threats as it formulates a comprehensive cybersecurity framework, officials familiar with the matter said.“Microsoft, Apple have their own cybersecurity infrastructure from the primary layer onwards and have software to protect stored data,” an official said on condition of anonymity. “The government can build an operating system for itself to ensure protection from the primary level.”The Centre is also discussing setting up a dedicated team of professionals to evaluate how the infrastructure needs to evolve to keep with the latest developments in the technological field. “With the advent of 5G, internet of things and growth in cybercrime, there will be a reckoning,” a second official said. “There is a need for a more comprehensive framework that not only addresses national security threats but also other considerations such how the advent of such technologies will impact the citizens of the country.”The first official said it’s not just the primary layer, or the OS, that needs to be indigenous but also the software used for cybersecurity. To be sure, the idea is still at the stage of discussions.Kazim Rizvi, founder of think tank, The Dialogue, said the government should consider customising open source software based on its security requirements, rather than developing a new OS from scratch, as that may not be a practically viable option. “Open source software benefits from continuous scrutiny and improvements made by the community of programmers,” he saidRizvi added that the German government supports open standards and uses free open source Linux software for all its official purposes.HT in April reported several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyberattacks and the discovery of critical vulnerabilities in some government servers, underscoring the need for the country’s digital infrastructure to be made more secure. There have also been several data leaks, including one from Air India on the data of customers registered between August 26, 2011 and February 20 this year and including details such as name, date of birth, contact information, passport information and ticket information.The government has also started cybersecurity training for all officials. “There are many channels that transmit data, we have under sea cables, we have satellites in the sky, India really needs to upgrade its framework to deal with the vast amount of data being circulated,” the second official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-considers-domestic-operating-system-to-boost-cybersecurity-infrastructure-101634238352497.html
15-10-2021||India||Farmers loot fertilisers amid shortage in MP||Farmers looted bags of DAP fertiliser from a warehouse in the third such incident in Chambal division of Madhya Pradesh in the last five days, police said. There is an acute shortage of DAP, especially in the northern parts of the state just before the winter crop sowing season and farmers are becoming desperate, they added.The farmers in the region have also resorted to blocking roads, demanding distribution of DAP. Most of the warehouses are almost empty and the supply is not in consonance with the demand, said local government officials.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said there was no shortage of fertiliser in the state. MP requires 4 lakh tonne of DAP for the Rabi season and the state has already received 2.5 lakh tonne, the CM said.Home minister Narottam Mishra, however, said on Thursday that there were reports of illegal hoarding and supply of substandard fertilisers in DAP bags and the government has decided to invoke national security act (NSA) against the businessman for black marketing and illegal hoarding of fertiliser.On Monday farmers, who were waiting in the queue in grain market in Sabalgarh in Morena, looted more than 50 bags of fertiliser from a truck, police said. Police said a group of farmers stole fertiliser bags from warehouses of cooperative societies in Fup and Mehgaon area of Bhind in two separate incidents. An FIR has been registered only in one of these cases, said police.Bhind superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Singh suspended Fup police station in-charge Anita Gurjar for not registering FIR and taking action against farmers who stole fertilizers on Saturday night.State officials and experts said the major reasons behind the crisis are changes in crop pattern, black marketing and farmers defaulting on loan repayments. Farmers are eligible for fertiliser at subsidised rates only if they have repaid loans.Agriculture expert Vinayak Tomar said: “ 61% of total mustard production of the state takes place in Morena, Bhind, Sheopur and Gwalior. With the sudden increase in the price of mustard from ₹4800 per quintal to ₹8000/per quintal, many farmers, who used to sow wheat and bajra, have started sowing mustard for winter crop also. Mid-September and October is the best time for sowing mustard so the demand for fertiliser has increased suddenly.”Then there is black marketing.“The (state) agriculture department gives fertilisers to cooperative societies according to the agricultural land of registered farmers. There is a ban on open sale of fertilisers from the societies to stop black marketing in UP and Rajasthan (the fertiliser from the state is illegally shipped there). Similarly, societies are not providing fertilisers to defaulter farmers, who have not cleared their loans,” said Shiv Mangal Singh, former president of district cooperative bank in Morena. He added that the DAP has premium rate of ₹1200 per bag but being sold at ₹1500.Gwalior and Morena district administration raided warehouses of two traders in past two days and recovered more than 200 bags, which were being hoarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-loot-fertilisers-amid-shortage-in-mp-govt-to-invoke-nsa-against-hoarders-101634238234471.html
15-10-2021||India||India slips to 101st rank in Global Hunger Index 2021; behind Pak, Bangladesh||India has slipped to 101st position in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 of 116 countries, from its 2020 position of 94th and is behind its neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.Eighteen countries, including China, Brazil and Kuwait, shared the top rank with GHI score of less than five, the website of the Global Hunger Index that tracks hunger and malnutrition said on Thursday.The report, prepared jointly by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organisation Welt Hunger Hilfe, termed the level of hunger in India “alarming”.In 2020, India was ranked 94th out of 107 countries. Now with 116 countries in the fray, it has dropped to 101st rank.India’s GHI score has also decelerated -- from 38.8 in 2000 to the range of 28.8 - 27.5 between 2012 and 2021.The GHI score is calculated on four indicators --undernourishment; child wasting (the share of children under the age of five who are wasted i.e who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition); child stunting (children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition) and child mortality (the mortality rate of children under the age of five).The share of wasting among children in India rose from 17.1 per cent between 1998-2002 to 17.3 per cent between 2016-2020, according to the report.“People have been severely hit by COVID-19 and by pandemic related restrictions in India, the country with highest child wasting rate worldwide,” the report said.Neighbouring countries like Nepal (76), Bangladesh (76), Myanmar (71) and Pakistan (92) are also in the ‘alarming’ hunger category, but have fared better at feeding its citizens than India, according to the report.However, India has shown improvement in other indicators such as the under-5 mortality rate, prevalence of stunting among children and prevalence of undernourishment owing to inadequate food, the report said.According to the report, the fight against hunger is dangerously off track. Based on the current GHI projections, the world as a whole -- and 47 countries in particular -- will fail to achieve a low level of hunger by 2030.Food security is under assault on multiple fronts, it said, adding that worsening conflict, weather extremes associated with global climate change, and the economic and health challenges associated with the COVID19 pandemic are all driving hunger.“Inequality -- between regions, countries, districts, and communities -- is pervasive and, (if) left unchecked, will keep the world from achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) mandate to “leave no one behind,” the report said.Further, the report noted that it is difficult to be optimistic in 2021 because the forces now driving hunger are overpowering good intentions and lofty goals.Among the most powerful and toxic of these forces are conflict, climate change, and COVID-19—three Cs that threaten to wipe out any progress that has been made against hunger in recent years, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slips-to-101st-rank-in-global-hunger-index-2021-behind-pakistan-bangladesh-and-nepal-101634238112321.html
15-10-2021||India||Death in a Prayagraj math: Tension, confusion linger on the Ganga’s banks||In the heart of Prayagraj city lies the sprawling 10-acre campus of the Baghambadi Gaddi math. On the banks of the Ganga and just 3km from the Sangam – the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, one of Hinduism’s holiest sites – the campus’s high walls fence off around 100 ascetics and students of Hindu theology from the rest of the noisy city.Mango, guava, lemon and neem trees abound on the leafy campus, which also houses a temple and a Sanksrit college. Days begin at 5am with prayers and chanting of hymns, and end around 8.30pm with communal meals at the dining hall that can seat 500 people.Despite the unassuming appearance, the math is one of the most powerful seats of Hinduism and controls property and assets upwards of ₹1,000 crore – including plots, maths, temples and educational institutions in Prayagraj, Mirzapur, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Bhopal. Its chief priest controls several influential shrines, including the Bade Hanuman Temple, the most popular pilgrim spot in Prayagraj.Nowadays, however, the mood at the math is subdued. Many ascetics in residence have left, and classes suspended. Armed policemen stand guard outside and math workers, called sevadars, don’t greet outsiders anymore.The death of the powerful chief priest, Mahant Narendra Giri, on September 20 by alleged suicide, the controversies surrounding his former number 2, Anand Giri, the whispers of tussle over property and power, and the arrest of three people for allegedly pushing him to the brink of collapse, have left seers stunned and the atmosphere vitiated.A new chief priest, Balbir Giri, was appointed on October 5 but speculation over the veracity of Giri’s last will, suicide note, and the circumstances before his death, continue to swirl. The tension has even prevented the Akhada Parishad—the apex body of Hinduism’s 13 monastic orders – from naming its next chief.“There is palpable tension with workers, seers and saints being repeatedly questioned by CBI and every past and present dealings under the scanner,” said a sewadar, a worker at the math, who has been living on campus for eight years.The fateful dayOn September 20, Giri woke up as usual at 5am and spent an hour in mediation and yoga, according to his disciples. At 6.30am, he led all saints, disciples, servitors and staff of the math in offering prayers at the Lord Baghambeshwar Mahadev temple to Shiva located within the math. These prayers, held daily, were attended by around 250 students on the premises.But then he broke the routine and didn’t head to the Bade Hanuman temple at 8.30am. “He seemed normal and engrossed in his work as usual on his last day and no one had any inclination of what was to come,” said a second sewadar who has worked at the math for nine years.After lunch, he retired to his room around 1pm, and asked not to be woken him for tea, usually served at 4pm in his room.By 5pm, his disciples were growing uneasy. Evening prayers were upon them but there was no sign of Giri. Sumit Kumar, a sewadar, walked up to Giri’s room on the ground floor and knocked. There was no response.“When even loud knocking failed to evoke the response, the door which was bolted from inside was broken and we found him hanging from the hook of the ceiling fan by a rope,” said Sumit Kumar.He, along with other sevadars Sarvesh Dwivedi and Dhananjay cut the rope and laid him on the ground. “Despite our efforts, Maharaj remained unresponsive and we then informed the police,” he said. It was 5.25pm.Around 6pm, inspector general of Prayagraj range, KP Singh, reached the math and found a suicide note in the room. Almost immediately, the controversy began.Deeper conspiracy?On September 22, a post-mortem examination by a five-member panel of doctors concluded death by asphyxiation with no marks of external injuries. The same day, top seers dismissed the suicide note, hinting towards a deeper conspiracy.The eight-page note blamed three people: Giri’s once-protégé Anand Giri, the Bade Hanuman temple priest Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep. Giri wrote that Anand Giri fabricated some compromising photos and videos of the head priest with a woman, and planned to release them to mar his reputation.This set off suspicion. “This is not a letter written by the Maharaj (Mahant Narendra Giri) as he never used to pen anything so long,” said Niranjani Akhada chief Kailashanand Giri. Another top seer Ravindra Puri said Giri had a head injury and couldn’t have penned this note.Three weeks on, the doubts persist.Some seers say that the appointment of Balbir Giri – Giri named him as his successor in the note and in a video clip found on his mobile phone – indicated that people in the ashram were coming to terms that the top priest died by suicide.But others are not sure. Ravindra Puri said the seers reached a consensus to treat the note and Giri’s will as his last wish but felt the need to form a supervisory committee to decide on all future financial deals – from where the math draws its might.“It is still difficult to believe that a strong and outspoken person like Mahant Narendra Giri who had access to rich and powerful people got so upset and stressed by actions of his disciples that he took his own life. All eyes are now on CBI which hopefully would unravel the mystery once and for all,” said a senior saint of Niranjani Akhada on condition of anonymity.Officially, Giri’s cause of death is under probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. A second investigation by the Akhada Parishad, too, remains inconclusive. Handwriting reports and forensic analysis of the note have not been made public.Questions remainGiri left his home in Chautauna village of Prayagraj district when he was 22 and joined the math. He quickly rose through the ranks, courtesy his strong ties to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and his math’s decisive influence during the Kumbh Mela, one of Hinduism’s holiest events. In 2019, when Prime Miniser Narendra Modi took a dip at the Sangam, Giri led the rituals.Giri burnished his credentials by advocating key political causes – the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, a national population control bill, and cracking down on fake godmen.Giri’s advocate Rishi Shankar Dwivedi said the head priest made the first will on January 7, 2010 where he named Balbir Giri as his successor. But he made a revised will on August 29, 2011 and replaced Balbir with Anand. A third will was made on June 4, 2020 where Balbir was again named as the successor.“The will dated June 4, 2020 was signed by Narendra Giri in my presence and that is his last will, which is registered,” said Man Singh, one of the two witnesses to Giri’s last will.Still, many seers are waiting for CBI to make a final pronouncement on the death, and verify the note as genuine, before going back to usual chores at the math.Many say they are shaken by the death of the powerful godman, and admit that the scandal associated with Anand— he was expelled from the math in May by Giri for indiscipline, financial anomalies and breaking the rules of the monastic order — has hurt the math’s standing. “The recent developments have taken the focus away from the service being performed by it,” said Kailashanand Giri.The 35-year-old Balbir Giri faces a tough task in restoring calm.“I was pained by the sudden demise of my guru but I want to say that with the country’s top investigating agency probing the death, the truth behind it would come out, sooner or later,” he said. “I will put my decisions in front of my senior seers in the Akhara, and if they don’t agree, I will seek their guidance. If I am right, they would bless my decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-in-a-prayagraj-math-tension-confusion-linger-on-the-ganga-s-banks-101634237933299.html
15-10-2021||India||Gujarat: Woman tortured to death during exorcism ritual; five arrested||Dwarka: A 25-year-old woman was allegedly thrashed to death with a hot iron chain by an exorcist and some of her relatives during an exorcism ritual to “free her from the influence of an angry deity” in Gujarat’s Devbhumi-Dwarka district, police said on Thursday. The police have arrested all five accused involved in the alleged incident that took place on Wednesday, inspector P B Gadhvi said.According to the FIR, the victim Ramila Solanki and her husband Vala, who were residents of Arambhada village of Mithapur taluka, had come down to Okhamadhi village near Dwarka town to celebrate Navratri.“When the victim suddenly started shaking and behaving as if she had been possessed, exorcist Ramesh Solanki told others to beat her in order to free her from the influence of an angry deity. He warned that Ramila would kill everyone if they did not beat her. The accused started branding her with firewood,” the official said. The accused then allegedly took turns to thrash the victim using a hot iron chain, and eventually killed her, he said. Based on a complaint lodged by the victim’s husband, the police have arrested Ramesh Solanki and the woman’s relatives Arjun Solanki, Versi Solanki, Manu Solanki and Bhavesh Solanki on the charges of murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-woman-tortured-to-death-during-exorcism-ritual-five-arrested-101634237812321.html
15-10-2021||India||India backs fresh WHO probe into Covid origin||India on Thursday backed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) decision to create an expert group to examine the origins of new pathogens, including the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, and said all countries should cooperate with the probe.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the launch of the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago) at a news briefing on Wednesday, and Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said this represented the “last chance” to determine the origins of Sars-CoV-2.Responding to WHO’s announcement, China warned against any “political manipulation” of the renewed probe into the origins of Covid-19.India has consistently backed all moves by WHO to establish the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan, China, and called on all stakeholders, including China, to cooperate with such efforts. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi reiterated this position when he was asked about the new expert group at a regular news briefing on Thursday.“Let me just reiterate what we have stated till now – we have our interest in further studies and data on this issue of the origin [of the coronavirus] and the need for understanding and cooperation by all concerned,” he said, without naming China.The Indian side, he said, was gathering details of what the new move by WHO would entail.Raman Gangakhedkar, the Dr CG Pandit National Chair at the Indian Council of Medical Research in India, and Yungui Yang of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, are among the 26 members of Sago.Almost two years after it was first reported from Wuhan, the origins of Covid-19 are unclear, with scientists not being able to even find the so-called intermediary animal that was infected by the zoonotic virus, before it jumped to humans. In the case of the Sars epidemic in 2001-02, a bat virus first spread to civets, and then to people. In 2012, the Mers virus in West Asia similarly jumped from bats to camels to humans.The so-called lab-leak hypothesis has also gained currency because Wuhan is home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, one of the world’s top coronavirus research facilities. While scientists were quick to endorse a natural origin theory early on, with Beijing seemingly stonewalling a proper enquiry, and an intermediary not being found, some experts started questioning the science behind the endorsement.Indeed, it is still not clear which of the two theories is the correct one — which makes the role of the new expert group that much more important.Asked about the new probe, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said it should be conducted in the “spirit of science” and not used as a political tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-fresh-who-probe-into-covid-origin-101634237632539.html
15-10-2021||India||Govt makes elaborate plans to celebrate 1 billion jabs||Public announcements at airports, railways stations, shipping ports, bus stations and metro rails will be made at the moment when India administers a billion Covid-19 vaccine doses, said Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday, highlighting elaborate plans by the government to mark the occasion.“The way the vaccination drive is going, we expect one billion-mark to be achieved either on October 18 or 19. There are a lot of activities planned to commemorate this momentous occasion,” Mandaviya said at a press meet. He kick-started the one billion doses celebrations by launching a coffee table book, documenting the efforts of Covid-19 warriors who contributed in India’s Covid fight.The total vaccine doses administered in the country crossed 970 million on Thursday, with 73% of all adults having received at least the first vaccine dose, and 30% having been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, said the health minister.The moment to mark the 1 billion doses is likely to be made more easier to track by a countdown that will likely be incorporated onto the Co-WIN dashboard, people aware of the plans said.The health ministry is also creating a dedicated hashtag— #VaccineCentury— to promote the occasion on social media. Also, a location is being finalised to install the tallest Indian flag created by the Khadi Board in the national Capital — the shortlist includes the Red Fort and the area between the North and the South Block.“People are excited about this milestone not just in India but globally also as many countries have shown interest in knowing how India has made it possible to jab so many people. The number of doses that we have already administered is even greater than the population of many countries,” said the minister.To be sure, India will need to deliver nearly 1.9 billion doses to the over 940 million estimated adult population eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine at the moment.Mandaviya said that private airline, Spicejet, will wrap its planes with posters of one billion vaccine doses with images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and healthcare workers on the day the target of 1 billion doses is achieved.He also launched videos documenting efforts of Covid-19 warriors. From eight states, 13 Covid warriors, including doctors, ambulance drivers, volunteers and other healthcare workers have been identified as ‘Sentinels of the Soil’ and their experiences published in the book and through the videos.“As the vaccination drive picked up in India, the challenge was not only demographic but also topographic. The credit goes to the team of healthcare and frontline workers who took it upon themselves to ensure that everyone was covered. It was not an easy task as deep-rooted hesitancy had to be overcome and rampant myths about vaccination had to be countered. People have been working very hard to make this happen, and these people are an integral part of India’s Covid vaccine success story,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/announcements-at-airports-railways-stations-ports-govt-makes-elaborate-plans-to-celebrate-1-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-101634237392263.html
15-10-2021||India||Decision on Aryan’s bail plea in drug case on Oct 20: Court||A special court on Thursday posted the bail applications of Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmum Dhamecha to October 20, nearly 10 days after the three were arrested during a raid on a cruise ship by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court judge V V Patil, who heard arguments over October 13 and 14, said he would pronounce his order on October 20.Khan, 23, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, was among eight people arrested on October 3 from Cordelia, a holiday cruise ship anchored in Mumbai that was set to leave for Goa later that evening.Following the raid in which 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of charas, and 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy) and a sum of ₹1.33 lakh in cash was recovered, 20 people were arrested under various sections of the NDPS Act.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, representing the NCB, argued that there was evidence to show that Khan was a regular consumer of drugs for the past few years. “They were going to the cruise and had planned to have a blast. The quantity of hard drugs that is found can’t be for personal consumption. It’s not a case for bail as the accused are influential and might tamper evidence,” Singh said.Drug abuse is affecting youngsters, and being college-going boys should not be a consideration for bail, Singh said, adding that the future of the country depends on this generation.“This is not what our freedom fighters had in mind. This is the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Buddha. The investigation is at preliminary stage, this is not the stage for grant of bail,” he added.The NCB has maintained that though nothing was recovered from Khan personally, his WhatsApp chats reveal his links with drug peddlers. Singh claimed Khan’s WhatsApp conversations revealed that he was in touch with a person abroad who appeared to be part of an international drug trafficking network. The NCB was in touch with the external affairs ministry to identify people in the network, the ASG said.“Though there are independent recoveries they can’t be taken in isolation. They (all the arrested accused) are all part of illicit drug chain. Whether you are found with drugs or not found with drugs or found with minor quantity of drugs, you cannot say nothing was found on you. We have found commercial quantity from one of the accused... Charge of conspiracy has been applied, so accused can’t be segregated,” Singh said.Senior advocate Amit Desai who represented Khan argued that WhatsApp chats on which the federal investigative agency relied needed to be seen in context of the language of the youth, which may seem to be a “torture” for the older generation. “By no stretch of imagination, the boy can be said to be involved in illicit drug trafficking or international drug racket. These allegations are false. The chats... needs to be seen in complete context, and checked [whether] they are jokes or banter.”“Today’s generation youth are different, they chat, they joke. A casual communication can sometimes look suspicious to the agencies. He was out of India for long. In a lot of other countries, such consumption is legal,” Desai said. He countered Singh’s argument stating that NCB was pointing to an international trafficking racket, but if the consumer stated from where he procured drugs, then “the chain was complete”.The NCB itself had alleged that Khan disclosed the name of Achit Kumar, another arrested accused, Desai said. The agency can continue the probe, but the allegation of links to international racket against Khan is “inherently absurd and false,” he said.Desai said that NCB was claiming that they have seized commercial quantity of contraband material from one Abdul Kadir, but Khan was not in touch with him.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-on-aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-in-drug-case-on-october-20-ndps-court-101634237096754.html

15-10-2021||India||Row over expansion of powers of BSF escalates||The row over the Union government’s amendment of the Border Security Force (BSF) Act — extending the Border Security Force’s effective jurisdiction to 50 km from the international border up from 15 km in the border states of Punjab, West Bengal, and Assam — continued with the Congress, which governs Punjab, and the Trinamool Congress, which governs West Bengal, ascribing political motives to the change.Assam, ruled by a Bharatiya Janata Party government, has not complained about the change. The changes in the law have standardised the jurisdictional area under BSF to 50 km in other border states too, reducing it from 80 km to 50 km in Gujarat, and maintaining it at 50 km in Rajasthan.On Wednesday, a BSF spokesperson said the decision would enable “improved operational effectiveness in curbing trans-border crime.”Officials in India’s security establishment point to the increasing threat posed by drones, especially in terms off dropping money, drugs, explosives, and small arms well into Indian territory from across the border, and explain that this necessitated the change.But the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal hit out at the Centre for what they called an infringement on the state land. The Congress added that the move curbs the power of state police and its senior leader Manish Tewari, an MP from Punjab, even suggested the chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi “not accept” the new rules.West Bengal has the longest and one of the most porous international borders. The state shares 2216 km international border with Bangladesh. It also shares around 100km border with Nepal and 183 km border with Bhutan. Punjab shares international border with Pakistan.The Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala too criticised the move, tweeting that it went against “federalism”.Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress floor leader in the Lok Sabha termed it as a “brazen infringement” and warned union home ministry that if they don’t stop “Chherkhani” (interfering), they will face the consequences”.Some SAD leaders, including party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, were briefly detained by police on Thursday when they tried to march towards the governor’s residence to protest the Centre’s decision. Badal later met Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit and apprise him that the Centre’s move to “attack the federal structure” is not good.The Akali leader later claimed, “Through this order, Amritsar city, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Fazilka and virtually half of Punjab will come under their (BSF’s) domain. Law and order will eventually come under the Centre’s control.”Punjab CM Channi on Wednesday dubbed it as “unilateral decision” and a “direct attack on federalism”.“This is a condemnable decision. This is infringing upon the state’s land through the back door. The party is seriously looking into this,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson and the party’s state general secretary on Thursday.The Bengal BJP supported the new system, “We welcome this decision. The BSF should be given more teeth so that they can work independently and also should be given more man power,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-expansion-of-powers-of-bsf-escalates-101634236672783.html
15-10-2021||India||Police take minister’s son to site of Lakhimpur violence||The Investigation Committee probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Thursday took four accused, including Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, arrested in the case to recreate the sequence of events leading to the violence in Tikunia village here.Amid tight security, the four accused — Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das, his gunner Latif alias Kaale and his driver Shekhar Bharti — were taken to the site of the incident on the Tikunia-Banbirpur road, around 60 km from Lakhimpur city, said police.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Tikunia village on October 3. The farmers were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers travelling to welcome deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to the area. Two BJP workers – Shubham Mishra and Shyam Sundar – and Mishra’s driver Hari Om Mishra were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by angry protesters. A local journalist, Raman Kashyap, was also killed in the violence.The investigators recreated the scene by placing mannequins as per the information collected by eyewitnesses before making three four-wheelers run on the narrow road of Banbirpur village, where the four farmers were allegedly mowed down, leading to the violence killing four others, said a police official privy to the investigation. Three vehicles were placed one after the other to repeat the sequence of events on the day of violence, said the official. The entire exercise was video recorded for thorough analysis, the official added.The police official said the investigation committee later visited the minister’s village, Banbirpur, where the wrestling competition was to be inaugurated by Maurya during his visit to Kheri on the day of incident.So far, police have arrested six accused, including Mishra’s son, his two accomplices, Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, Das, Bharti and Kaale, in connection with the case. The minister’s son was arrested on October 9 after 12 hours of questioning, and a court sent him to police custody from October 12 to 15. Das, Latif and Bharti were in police custody from October 14 to 17.On Thursday, relatives of deceased BJP worker, Shubham Mishra, reached the crime branch office and demanded arrest of his killers. Shubham’s uncles — Anoop Mishra and Sanoop Mishra — along with defence lawyer Awdhesh Singh reached the police lines to lodge their complaint.Anoop Mishra told reporters on Thursday that no arrest had been made in connection with the killing of Shubham Mishra and others by mob.Two FIRs were registered in Tikunia violence. The first FIR on October 4 was against Ashish Mishra and 15-20 others while the second FIR was registered the same day against unidentified miscreants in the murder of Shubham and Hari Om Mishra.Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Lakhimpur, Yogesh Verma, demanded a thorough probe into the role of Kheri police in the violence alleging that police’s negligence led to the death of BJP worker Shyam Sundar and journalist Raman Kashyap.Talking to reporters, Verma said: “The death of BJP workers at the hands of goons had caused resentment among the families of these workers and also among the masses.” Police did not react to Verma’s allegations till late in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-take-minister-s-son-to-site-of-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-to-recreate-sequence-of-events-101634236612410.html
15-10-2021||India||Jamaat-e-Islami behind the pandal violence in Bangladesh, say officials||The needle of suspicion for the violent attacks against Durga Puja pandals in southern Bangladesh points towards the Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI), people familiar with tyhe matter said, with the motive being to embarrass the Sheikh Hasina government and stoke communal fires over the alleged desecration of the Quran in Cumilla, southeast of Dhaka.According to diplomats in Dhaka and New Delhi, there were attacks on mandaps, pandals and temples in Cumilla, starting the afternoon of October 13 after rumours started circulating that a copy of the Quran was placed near the feet of the idol of Durga at a pandal. There are more than 3,000 pandals in Bangladesh observing Durga Puja, one of the biggest festivals on both sides of the border in Bengal -- in Bangladesh as well as West Bengal. As the news spread through digital media, there were violent attacks on pandals in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram. However, there were none in Dhaka, Brahmanbaria, Jashore and other major cities.The police were initially slow to react but after the high commissioner of India spoke to the government, there was heavy deployment of armed police and local enforcement agencies. Three people, including two of those involved in the attacks, were killed in Chandpur and dozens were injured after the forces fired with rubber bullets in Cumilla.While Dhaka has ensured that heavy police deployment will continue till Friday, when the Durga Puja ends, it is quite evident that communal flames were being fanned by the opposition JEI, which, analysts say, has been encouraged by the Taliban taking over Afghanistan. JEI coined the slogan “ Bangladesh Banega Afghanistan” in a bid to radicalise the youth towards ultra-conservative Islam to achieve political objectives.“The basic idea behind October 13 incident was to embarrass Bangladesh’s government and force a reaction from India,” said a diplomat based in Dhaka. The Jamaat thrives on radicalised youth to oppose the Sheikh Hasina government and is networked with other pro-Taliban outfits in Bangladesh, this person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamaateislami-behind-the-pandal-violence-in-bangladesh-say-officials-101634236492307.html

15-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 15, 1998 — Amartya Sen bags Nobel for economics||Stockholm. Philosopher-economist Amartya Sen of India won the Nobel Economics Prize today for his contribution to welfare economics, and in particular his research into the causes of famine and poverty, report agencies. Prof. Sen, 64, is the first Asian to win the coveted prize since it was inaugurated in 1969. In its citation, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which adjudged the prize said that Prof. Sen had made "several key contributions to the research on fundamental problems in welfare economics. His contributions range from axiomatic theory of social choice, over definitions of welfare and poverty indexes, to empirical studies of famine," it said. Economists described Sen as a leftwing Professor who nevertheless pursued an independent line, leading him, for example, to his Nobel-winning work on famine. Speaking to PTI from a New York hotel, Prof. Sen said he was “very pleased" to receive the award, particularly because the subject for which he had been honoured touched the lives of ordinary people. "What pleases me most is that the subject has received recognition," he said. Prof. Sen said he had been woken by an early morning telephone call to be told he had won the award. "I thought there was some emergency when the phone rang," he said. He had flown into New York late on Tuesday to deliver a lecture. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said the whole of India would revel in the award. "The country is proud of your achievement," Vajpayee said in a message, expressing his "profound sense of joy" at the news.  The economics Nobel has been almost the private domain of American academics, with only the occasional win for their counterparts in Western Europe. For an Asian economist to be awarded the prize represents a radical departure for the Nobel Committee.  From the start of his career, Prof. Sen showed a "particular interest in the most impoverished members of society," the academy said.  He was born in Bengal in 1933 and received his doctorate from University of Cambridge in 1959. He has been a Professor in India, Britain and the United States. Currently a Professor at Trinity College, Cambridge, he is the first solo winner of the economics prize since 1995. Prof. Sen will be presented with a medal and a cheque for 7.6 million Swedish kronor (9,38,000 dollars) at an official ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the 102nd anniversary of the death of the creator of the prizes, Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Nobel.  4TH CALCUTTAN TO WIN NOBEL: Calcutta today took pride at having its fourth Nobel laureate in Prof Sen after Rabindranath Tagore, Prof C. V. Raman and Mother Teresa, a report from Calcutta said.  Prof Sen is the sixth Indian Nobel laureate and the country's first economist to win the coveted award.  Since 1913 when Tagore won Nobel Prize for literature, it was another 17 years before physicist C. V. Raman, who based his research here, won the Nobel.  In 1979, Albania-born Mother Teresa, who based her missionary activities in Calcutta bagged the Nobel for Peace. Now it is the turn of Prof Sen, who was initially educated in the city and conducted his basic research here. It was from Calcutta's premier Presidency College that Prof Sen graduated in 1953. From here, he went to Cambridge University for higher education and engaged in the study of welfare economics.  SEN'S MOTHER STOICAL: After several nominations and refusals from the Royal Swedish Academy for Science, Prof. Sen's selection for the Nobel Prize has come as a surprise to his mother Amita Sen. "When he called me earlier in the day to give the news, I told him I am not going to discuss this with anyone unless I see it in the newspapers tomorrow. Bablu (Amartya's pet name) laughed and told me this time the news was real," she told PTI. Asked with whom she would have liked to share this hour of joy, Amita said, "my husband. When he died in 1971, there already were talks of Bablu's chances of winning the Nobel." On his deathbed, her husband had regretted not being able to survive long enough to see their son win the Nobel Prize, she said.  Prof. Sen's mother said at the age 19, her son was diagnosed as having oral cancer and doctors gave him only five years to live. "It was then that I sent him to Cambridge for treatment."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-15-1998-amartya-sen-bags-nobel-for-economics-101634234145874.html
15-10-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh shows why MLAs do not matter in politics in states||What does it take to win a state election in India? Charismatic chief ministerial candidates or a committed, yet grounded set of MLAs? Logically, the answer should tilt towards the latter. After all, legislative majorities are gained or lost at the level of assembly constituencies.However, an analysis of incumbency level datasets prepared by the Trivedi Centre for Political Data suggests that becoming an MLA does not bestow much power, at least beyond the current term, to a person in the politics of states. This also means that state legislatures are structurally weak when it comes to keeping a check on the executive, the central doctrine of separation of powers in the Indian constitution.Part of the explanation lies in a political culture that favours the concentration of power in the hands of chief ministers. But there are aspects of electoral politics and features of the political class that contribute to weakening political representation.Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state, which goes to polls in early 2022, is a good case in point.Why has Yogi Adityanath dwarfed everyone else in UP BJP?The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a massive victory in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh elections, winning 312 out of the 403 assembly constituencies (ACs). The current chief minister Yogi Adityanath was only named after the elections; he did not even contest on an MLA ticket. However, Adityanath has been winning as a Lok Sabha MP from Gorakhpur continuously since 1998. His long stint as an MP is in sharp contrast to the profile of the average MLA, both within and outside the BJP, in the state.Out of 403 elected MLAs, a staggering 314 were elected for the first time. 59 MLAs were elected for a second time and only thirty MLAs, across parties, were elected for a third time or more. The Assembly counts only 7 four-time MLAs, 2 five- and six-term MLAs and so on. This pegs Uttar Pradesh’s stable political class (defined as all politicians who have been elected more than twice) at barely 7.4% of all MLAs.Of the 312 BJP MLAs who won their seat in the 2017 assembly election, only 19 had won twice or more times previously. Of these 19 MLAs, 9 come from other parties, including Biharilal Arya, a five-time Congress MLA from Mauranipur, Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh, from Tiloi(previously elected on an SP ticket,and a BJP one before that), and Fateh Bahadur, from Caimpiyarganj, who has been party-hopping between the Congress, BJP and BSP since 1989.The situation is not different with other parties. Only five of the current 47 SP MLAs have been elected more than twice, a score also held by 3 of the 19 BSP MLAs, and Raghuraj Pratap Singh, aka ‘Raja Bhaiya’, who won from Kunda as an Independent candidate.The current UP assembly is not an aberrationIt can be argued that the lack of experience in the current Uttar Pradesh assembly is a result of the massive BJP victory, which led to a loss of the more experienced MLAs from other parties. Historical data shows that this is not the case.Since 1977, the share of first-time MLAs has never been lower than 65%, and the share of experienced politicians (elected more than twice) has never been more than 15% of the assembly. Since 1977, 444 of the 4577 seats won were occupied by MLAs serving a third term of more. These 444 MLAs boil down to 274 unique individuals, scattered across parties and time: 73 with the BJP, 61 with Congress, 21 with the BSP and 105 with the SP and its previous socialist incarnations.What explains the un-experienced MLA syndrome?Both parties are voters are responsible for this. At the party level, most sitting MLAs do not even get a chance to keep their seat. In 2017, only 40% of all 403 sitting MLAs re-ran. And only 30% of those who re-ran got re-elected. This is what the voter-induced effect refers to. Once again, 2017 was not an exception on this count. Here again, historical data shows that this is another longstanding trend of UP politics. From 1977 to 2017, an average of 38% of all sitting MLAs get to re-run, and an average of 41% of these re-running incumbents manage to keep their seat.Upper caste men have a disproportionate presence in the rank of stable political classThe profile of this political class is also quite elitist. 45.3% of them belong to upper castes, against 22% of SCs and OBCs. Muslims make up only 9% of UP’s professional class, that is to say 24 individuals. Over the period, only four Jat politicians have made it to this list. This is also a male-dominated list, as only 9 women figure among these 274 professional politicians.Does a high political turnover in assembly help democracy?The high turnover of UP’s political class has implications for democratic processes. First, the UP assembly is and has for long been an assembly of newcomers. Such a large turnover of political elites translates into a loss of cumulative experience in the assembly. MLAs who come in with the knowledge that they will not be occupying their seat for long have little incentive to learn the ropes of the legislative aspect of their job. This weakens the legislative check on the executive. The extraordinary concentration of power in the hands of a small class of politicians, which includes of course party leaders, faction leaders, local dynasts and strongmen, who succeed in lasting in politics by dint of their grit and talent, but also at times through the control they exert over their constituency.Uttar Pradesh is not the only state when it comes to a high turnover of MLAs. In most states, this turnover hovers around fifty percent.This analysis helps put in perspective the phenomenon of concentration of power that we see in states across India. It reveals that the rise of strong, populist, chief ministers is not the sole factor behind the presidentialisation of state politics. There are factors that are structural to electoral competition that are also at play, across political parties. The high probability of defeat for re-running incumbents also reveals the difficulty of meeting voters’ expectations.The author is Assistant Professor of Political Science and Co-Director of the Trivedi Centre for Political Data.

15-10-2021||India||India cautious as Bhutan, China sign pact||Bhutan and China on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a “three-step roadmap” for expediting negotiations on their boundary dispute, prompting a cautious response from India against the backdrop of the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“We have noted the signing of the MoU between Bhutan and China today [Thursday],” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a regular news briefing to a question about the MoU.“You are aware that Bhutan and China have been holding boundary negotiations since 1984. India has similarly been holding boundary negotiations with China,” he said, without offering a response to a query on whether Bhutan kept India in the loop about the agreement with China.Bhutan’s foreign minister Tandi Dorji and China’s assistant foreign minister Wu Jianghao signed the MoU during a virtual ceremony earlier in the day. China’s ambassador to India, Sun Weidong, and Bhutan’s envoy to India, Maj Gen Vetsop Namgyel, also joined the event.The agreement came four years after Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a 73-day face-off within Bhutanese territory at Doklam. That face-off began in June 2017 after India sent in its troops to prevent the construction of roads and infrastructure by Chinese troops in violation of agreements between Bhutan and China.Given the extremely close coordination between India and Bhutan on foreign policy issues, it is unlikely that New Delhi was caught off-guard by Thursday’s development. Experts said India’s cautious response was understandable in view of the implications the MoU could have for New Delhi’s already fraught relations with Beijing because of the LAC standoff.China does not have a diplomatic presence in Bhutan’s capital Thimphu, and the Chinese embassy in New Delhi coordinates ties between the two sides.Following the standoff in eastern Ladakh, China claimed for the first time in July 2020 that it had a boundary dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, a region that borders Arunachal Pradesh, which is also claimed by Beijing. The text of the MoU was not made public by Thimpu or Beijing.A statement from Bhutan’s foreign ministry said the MoU on the “three-step roadmap for expediting the Bhutan-China boundary negotiations” will “provide a fresh impetus to the boundary talks”.“It is expected that the implementation of this roadmap in a spirit of goodwill, understanding and accommodation will bring the boundary negotiations to a successful conclusion that is acceptable to both sides,” the statement said.In response to questions on the LAC standoff, Bagchi said India expects China to work towards the speedy resolution of all remaining issues in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements . The situation on the LAC was due to China’s unilateral attempts to alter the status quo, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cautious-response-from-india-as-bhutan-and-china-sign-mou-on-boundary-negotiations-101634229770387.html
15-10-2021||India||Surgical strike showed era of talks is over, we now hit back at terror: Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday referred to the 2016 surgical strikes conducted across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and said the era of talks is over and that of “a fitting response” has started.India carried out the strikes in September 2016 by sending special forces to pre-empt more attacks from across the LoC days after 19 soldiers were killed after infiltrators crossed over from the Pakistani territory and attacked an Indian Army camp in Kashmir.Shah’s reference to the strikes came days after five soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire with heavily armed terrorists in a forested area at Surankote in J&K’s Poonch district on Monday amid a spike in violence in the region. The casualties came after a series of targeted attacks left seven civilians dead in the Valley this month. Shah cited the strikes and said for years, attackers from across the border would come and cause carnage. “But from the leadership in the Delhi durbars, there was no decision forthcoming,” said Shah after laying the foundation stone for the National Forensic Sciences University’s Goa campus. He added the surgical strikes were conducted under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and during Manohar Parrikar’s tenure as defence minister for the first time when there was an attack and Indian soldiers were killed along the border. “...For the first time, we told the world that it was not without consequence that you can attack India’s borders.”He said the message that India retaliates when attacked from across the border will stick around for generations, restoring India’s pride in the sanctity of its frontiers. “A new era was established in which no sooner they asked us questions from across the border, we gave them a fitting response.”Shah also credited Parrikar, who passed away in 2019 and also served as the Goa chief minister, for finalising the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme under which the armed forces personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service get the uniform pension, regardless of their date of retirement. He added it brought much relief to the soldiers guarding the borders. Shah said the soldiers could rest easy that their families will be well-taken care of after the finalisation of the scheme. He said Parrikar will always be remembered for OROP as well as the surgical strikes. “The former defence minister will be remembered for two things. Under the leadership of Modi, he did something that no one could do prior to him. (He) gave the OROP to the three services. Today, the jawans, who spend the best years of their lives under conditions ranging from -43 degrees Celsius to 43-degree census, are now confident that their families will be taken care of,” said Shah, who is on a two-day visit to poll-bound Goa. Shah is also scheduled to interact with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s state leadership ahead of the elections that are due early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-recalls-surgical-strikes-says-era-of-fitting-response-has-started-101634212667645.html
15-10-2021||India||Malabar Devaswom Board takes over Mattannur temple amid protest||Amid protest by a section of devotees, the Malabar Devaswom Board on Thursday took control of the famous Mattannur Mahadeva temple in Kannur district in north Kerala. Fearing the takeover, the temple’s current board locked the main gate and office but Devaswom board officials took the help of the police to break open the gate. Some of the devotees poured petrol and threatened to set themselves on fire but were prevented from taking the extreme step. Over the last decade, the board has been trying to take over the temple but devotees and the temple trust have foiled their attempts. Protestors said the board took over the temple without any consultation with stakeholders, but the Board said it has done so with the blessings of the Kerala high court. But the president of the temple committee, CH Mohandas, said the case was pending in the Supreme Court. “The takeover was quite arbitrary and we will inform the apex court about this,” he said. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Hindu Aikya Vedi have protested the takeover and said they will organise a week-long protest outside the temple. In Kerala, all Hindu shrines come under different boards controlled by the government. The Travancore, Cochin, Guruvayur and Malabar Devaswom boards are prominent among them and usually, those allied with the ruling party become chairmen of these boards. Many Hindu groups have been opposing government control of temples and argued that mosques and churches are controlled by independent bodies. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy’s petition questioning the government control over Hindu shrines is also pending before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malabar-devaswom-board-takes-over-mattannur-temple-amid-protest-101634212488969.html
15-10-2021||India||Women officers to soon command army units: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said women officers will soon command army units and battalions following being accepted for permanent commission (PC), while listing contributions of women in all spheres of security and nation-building, including that of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and former President Pratibha Patil.Addressing a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) webinar on the role of women in the armed forces, Singh Said, “Our approach to the induction of women in the police, central police, paramilitary and armed forces has been progressive. We have taken the evolutionary path of moving from support to combat support and thereafter to combat arms within the armed forces.”The opportunity to command battalions forms part of natural career progression for women officers after the army began granting them PCs following a Supreme Court ruling last year.The armed forces are preparing to induct women into the National Defence Academy (NDA), thus far a male preserve, following a landmark verdict by the apex court. “Women will be able to join India’s premier tri-service pre-commissioning training institute NDA from next year,” Singh said.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the Indian Air Force decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Earlier this year, the Indian Navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years. But tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women.“We have found that the process of induction, given its broad-based and progressive path, has also simultaneously prepared the society and the armed forces for this change. This is an important aspect to ensure a smooth and successful transition,” the minister said.He added that women had proved themselves in every field and excelled in the duties assigned to them. “Many barriers have been broken and many more imagined barriers should break in the years to come,” he said.Singh added, “There are a number of examples of women taking up arms to protect their country and the rights of the people through history. Rani Laxmi Bai is amongst the most revered and respected amongst them.”“India’s former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi not only led the country for a number of years, she also did so during times of war. And more recently, Pratibha Patil was the President of India and the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces,” Singh said.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace. As of February 2021, there were 9,118 women serving in the army, navy and air force.In his welcome address at the SCO seminar, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat said cyberspace and outer space were the new “revolutionary domains” of war fighting. He said the distinction between the roles of men and women in modern day war fighting was getting blurred by the day. “The notion of gender gap is passé. Women are no less suited to braving such challenging conditions and have proven themselves in the past,” Rawat said.In August, the army announced that a selection board had cleared the promotion of five women officers to the time-scale rank of colonel after the completion of the mandatory 26 years of service.It was the first time that women officers were promoted to the rank outside the medical, legal and education wings of the army.“With PC being approved, women are now picking up the rank of colonel and it shows they are no less than their male counterparts,” Captain Shalini Singh (retd), a former short-service commission officer had said in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-officers-to-soon-command-army-units-rajnath-singh-101634211586570.html

Hackers claim over 60GB data accessed||In what could be a second data breach at technology company Acer this year, a hacker group has claimed it has accessed over 60GB of data from its India servers. Desorden, the group, claimed the data includes individual customer information, corporate customer data, information of sensitive accounts, and financial data. It added the breach gives it access to over 3,000 login detail sets of Acer’s retailers and distributors in India.“We have hacked and breached Acer India servers (www.acer.co.in). We have stolen over 60GB of files and databases from their servers. This include their customer, corporate, accounts and financial data. Affected customer data are in the millions,” said Desorden on a popular hacker forum. Desorden added the data sets published so far do not include emails. “More data will be published.”"We have recently detected an isolated attack on our local after-sales service system in India. Upon detection, we immediately initiated our security protocols and conducted a full scan of our systems. We are notifying all potentially affected customers in India," confirms an Acer spokesperson, to HT."The incident has been reported to local law enforcement and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, and has no material impact to our operations and business continuity," the company confirms.Desorden said the affected users are mostly from India. It added Acer management will be able to verify the data to prove the authenticity of the breach.Researchers at Privacy Affairs said they have analysed the data sets publicly released. “We have found customer data that appears to be accurate and genuine after contacting multiple affected individuals from the released data,” said Miklos Zoltan, Founder, and CEO of Privacy Affairs, a data privacy and cybersecurity research firm.In March, a ransomware attack by the REvil group led to a data breach at Acer, with the demands for a ransom of $50,000,000. It was the biggest ransom demand till then. Acer initially denied any breach at its servers.It is unclear if Desorden is also demanding a ransom. Desorden, in a recent ransomware attack, accessed over 200 GB data from the Malaysian servers of ABX Express, a subsidiary of Kerry Logistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acer-india-servers-breached-hackers-claim-over-60gb-data-accessed-101634188425385.html
15-10-2021||India||Renewal of transport docs must from Oct 31||The Centre has decided not to extend the validity of expired transport documents such as driving licences beyond October 31 and has advised state transport departments to clear the backlog of applications within a month.State governments, however, can offer further extensions at their level if they deem it fit, people aware of the matter said. The Delhi government has already decided to extend the validity of expired transport documents till November 30 provided they were issued by the city government.The Union ministry of road transport and highways has already extended the validity of the transport documents that expired on or after February 1, 2020, seven times to ensure that the movement of goods and passengers was not impacted due to the Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdowns and restrictions.In an October 11 letter to transporters who requested the relaxation when the first national lockdown was imposed on March 25, 2020, the ministry said the relaxation granted last month to extend the validity of expired documents till 30 October was going to be the last one. Officials clarified that the current relaxation, which covers driving licences, registration certificates, fitness certificates and all permits, does not exempt people from driving vehicles with valid pollution under control certificates.Driving without a valid licence attracts a penalty of ₹5,000, while the penalties for other invalid documents are ₹5,000 (registration certificate), ₹10,000 (permit for commercial vehicles), ₹2,000-5,000 (fitness certificate for goods vehicles).Due to the pandemic, the ministry extended the validity of all transport-related documents for the first time until June 2020. The validity was subsequently extended to August 2020, December 2020, March 2021, June 2021, September 2021, and October 31, 2021.The ministry said due to the continuous extensions, there is a long backlog of applications awaiting clearance for renewal of such documents. “States and union territories (UTs) have also been advised to complete all the pending services in mission mode and a time-bound manner to achieve this,” the letter said.The letter added that state governments have been advised to “put extra resources” to complete the processes related to pending cases of renewal and reissue of documents such as fitness permits, DLs, RCs, etc. within one month.Also, states have been told to implement regulations such as online processing of documents, dealer point registration, online national permit for goods and passenger vehicles, contactless or faceless services through Aadhaar authentication to minimise the requirement for citizens to visit transport department offices and reduce physical interactions between citizens and officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-further-extension-to-expired-transport-documents-after-oct-31-centre-101634187345762.html

15-10-2021||Editorials||The seas versus the mountains||For the United States (US), and many countries in Asia, the key global threat at the moment is Chinese expansionism. This expansionism has been felt most acutely in the maritime sphere in the South China Sea. There is thus recognition of the need to keep sea lanes and smaller islands in the region free of Chinese ingress and militarisation. The coming together of four naval democracies in the form of Quad is an outcome of this assessment. And while Quad isn’t a military alliance, military exercises among Quad partners are now a regular phenomena in the Indo-Pacific. It is in this backdrop that India and the US have got to a stage where, from an era of distrust, especially in the defence realm, their respective naval chiefs now participate together in a joint exercise in the Bay of Bengal, as they did on Thursday. Their presence in the southern part of South Asia was meant as a signal to the power to the north of South Asia, and there is little doubt that China would have taken note.
