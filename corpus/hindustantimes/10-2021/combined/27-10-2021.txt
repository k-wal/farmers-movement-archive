It also asked that the forest survey of National Remote Sensing Centre should undertake remote sensing to ascertain the accurate number of felled trees in CTR.In September, the central empowered committee constituted by the Supreme Court also sought the response of Uttarakhand chief secretary and the union ministry to allegations of illegal cutting of trees for Pakhrau tiger safari, construction of structures and water body in Corbett tiger reserve landscape.Bansal, who approached the panel, said his complaint pointed to the felling of thousands of trees in the name of the establishment of Pakhrau tiger safari in CTR.Bansal said a tiger safari is being developed in the Gujjar Sot, Pakhrau Block, Sonanadi Range, Kalagarh Division in Corbett Tiger Reserve.Bansal said the union ministry’s forest advisory committee earlier recommended the proposal only after the written assurance from Uttarakhand forest officials that only 163 will be felled for the setting up of the tiger safari.“Contrary to its undertaking, forest department officials have uprooted thousands of trees in the name of establishment of Pakhrau Tiger Safari and that too within Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is one of the best and oldest National Park in the Country. It is not only against the statutory approvals granted by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) but is also contempt of the 2001 SC order in which the apex court expressly observed that no tree whatsoever shall be felled in the Corbett Tiger Reserve by the State or anyone else,” he said.According to the minutes of the meeting of the forest advisory committee (FAC) held on September 21, 2020, the proposal for seeking prior approval of the Centre for non-forestry use of 106.16 hectares of forest land for setting up of the tiger safari, was recommended by FAC on the condition that all requirements listed in the statutory approvals obtained from NTCA and CZA would be complied with and the state government will ensure the infrastructure of the tiger safari is created mainly from bamboo and other natural materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-hc-tells-centre-state-to-inspect-corbett-tiger-reserve-file-report-101635359199717.html

The sailing-cum-boat-pulling expedition was flagged off by Brigadier Ravi Kapoor, Group Commander, NCC Group HQ, Lucknow at a ceremony held at Dhori Ghat in Kanpur on October 18. On Wednesday, Group Commander, NCC Group HQ, Prayagraj, on behalf of NCC Directorate Uttar Pradesh, welcomed the contingent upon the successful completion of the expedition, at Saraswati Ghat here. The expedition was led by the Commanding Officer, Captain (Indian Navy) Navendu Saxena, along with his executive officer Lieutenant Commander Ashwani K Singh. A team of 10 combatant naval sailors headed by chief instructor Anand K Verma, and civilian officials from the Naval NCC Unit, Lucknow, trained the cadets and guided them during the voyage. A total of 63 NCC cadets, including 38 boys and 25 girls, participated in this highly challenging expedition using two DK Whalers and an Assault Boat, a Gemini craft and two Rescue Boats, informed PRO (Defence) Shantanu Pratap Singh. “The expedition provided a valuable experience to the cadets in boat handling, sailing, seamanship and navigation, and gave them a glimpse of the challenges faced by the Indian Navy personnel at sea. It also helped inculcate camaraderie and leadership amongst cadets under difficult conditions of river voyage. This is in accordance with the overall mission of NCC to develop strong character, unity and discipline amongst NCC cadets, and help them grow as responsible citizens who can positively contribute towards nation-building,” he added. The expedition passed through seven districts—Kanpur, Unnao, Fatehpur, Raebareily, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi and Prayagraj—touching over 50 villages in the riverine areas of Ganga. The prominent locations included Baksar Dham, Dalmau, Kalakankar Ghat, Kada Dham, Shringverpur, Rasulabad, and Sangam before culminating at Saraswati Ghat, Prayagraj. During the transit camps enroute, the cadets carried out unique social messaging campaigns on “Covid vaccination”, ‘Namami Gange” and “Clean Ganga Mission” to spread these nationally-relevant issues amongst the locals, particularly those belong to rural communities. The contingent also interacted with gram sabhas as well as students of schools and colleges on the way and spread awareness about the armed forces through motivational lectures and displays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-ncc-cadets-successfully-complete-river-sailing-and-boat-pulling-expedition-101635358719241.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Enforcing Covid SOPs among young students major challenge: Delhi schools||With the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) giving the go-ahead for the reopening of schools for students of all classes, both parents school authorities said the key challenge will be to ensure compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among younger children.All schools and educational institutes in the national capital will reopen from November 1 for all students, with online classes still continuing for those who wish to study from home, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said on Wednesday.Next Monday will be the first time that children in primary classes will be going to school since the pandemic broke out in March 2020. Students of entry-level classes (kindergarten and Class 1) started their schooling virtually and have only met their teachers and peers online; they have no experience of a physical classroom, and regulating their behaviour to ensure compliance with Covid SOPs, changing classroom dynamics, will be a challenge, principals said.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “Just like we teach alphabets to children, we will have to teach them Covid SOPs. We will have to inform them about the protocols in a manner that they understand. Little children need to be trained to follow the SOPs through reinforcement. Right now, since children have been studying at home, they may not be in the habit of wearing masks for a long period of time,” said Joshi.The school will be reaching out to parents to seek their feedback and consent before calling students to school for in-person classes. Joshi said while inculcating Covid appropriate habits in children will be a task, resumption of in-person classes was needed. “After sitting at home for so many months, the psyche of children has been adversely affected. Their social skills have not developed. Even senior students who have started coming to school don’t sound very confident. With children in primary grades, the challenge would be to ensure that they get adjusted to the normal school life,” said Joshi.She said the school will brainstorm with key stakeholders and take a decision on when to reopen. Teachers will also be counselled to ensure that they help children gently ease back into school life, especially those who started schooling virtually. “Children in kindergarten started school virtually. It will be a big challenge to make them sit in the classroom. The teacher will need to assist and keep a close watch on children in line with the changed scenario amid the pandemic,” said Joshi.While most parents agreed that a physical classroom experience was crucial for shaping children’s growth and development, they are not ready to send younger children to school just yet.Driyana Aggarwal, a parent whose child started kindergarten this year, said she was wary of sending her child to school. “I don’t feel confident enough right now and will wait for my child to get vaccinated before I send her to school,” said Aggarwal. She said while there were challenges in online classes, vaccination of children was crucial. “Children are not able to concentrate much during online classes. They struggle to sit in one place. There is no interaction with peers or practical experiences. School is necessary but I’d prefer to wait for vaccination,” said Aggarwal. Yogendra Singh, another parent, whose child studies in class 2, said he would wait for some more time before sending his son to school. He said while online classes were fraught with challenges, sending younger children to school was a difficult decision to make.“As a family, we are still taking Covid-19 seriously. My son can continue with online classes for some more time. He is young and I am not sure if he will be able to comply with all Covid SOPs. Online classes are not easy either and my son has become physically weaker over the past year His eyesight has also been affected but we will wait and see how the Covid situation pans out in the coming weeks,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/enforcing-covid-sops-among-young-students-major-challenge-delhi-schools-101635358599173.html

In a recent drive, police arrested some persons and recovered banned firecrackers which they were selling without any license and permission. On Tuesday, Sarai Mamrez police arrested an illegal firecracker trader and recovered nine sacks of banned crackers, manufactured locally. SP (Crime) Ashutosh Mishra said, “Strict instructions have been issued to all police stations in the district to keep an eye on illegal manufacturing and sale of banned firecrackers under their jurisdiction. Strict action will be taken against those found involved in the illegal trade.” In a meeting held on Monday, senior officials issued strict instructions to cops, to enforce the guidelines as per the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Officials said, no new firecracker shops would be allowed to open in the district and licensed holders would have to follow all the rules for selling the crackers. During the last few years there have been a series of small and big incidents of explosions and fire incidents at illegal firecracker manufacturing units which claimed lives of workers. “Permission for selling firecrackers has only been given at the designated spots and only to the licensed holders. The sale of firecrackers will be strictly monitored to check that only green firecrackers are on sale instead of traditional ones which contained pollutants harmful for environment,” the officials said. As per the guidelines issued by the NGT only those firecrackers can be sold which fulfil the AQI (Air Quality Eligibility). Despite the NGT guidelines, traditional firecrackers are still being made illegally and sold by some traders. These firecrackers are not only dangerous but also contain elements which are harmful for environment, and cause sound pollution as well. In a bid to control their manufacturing and sale, police officials have issued instructions to carry out rigorous checking drives across the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-police-begin-crackdown-against-sale-of-banned-firecrackers-101635357999637.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||Future of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha uncertain after SP-SBSP alliance||LUCKNOW The alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has raised a question mark over the future of the SBSP-led alliance of nine smaller political parties – Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha as the prominent constituents of the Morcha maintained distance from the rally organised by the party in Mau to cobble up a bond with the SP before the 2022 UP assembly election. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, an important partner of the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, organised a parallel rally in Muzaffaranagar, which was in the news in 2013 due to the communal violence.Before the SP-SBSP rally in Mau on Wednesday morning, the state unit president of AIMIM Shaukat Ali released a video message on various social media platforms to inform the party supporters that AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi would not participate in the Mau rally. “The supporters should attend the rally organized by the party in Muzaffaranagar in strength to make it successful. The party chief had not been invited by the SBSP to participate in the Mau rally,” said Ali.In Muzaffarnagar, Owaisi launched an attack on the Samajwadi Party reminding people about the 2013 communal violence when the SP was in power. “Muslims were targeted during the riots. They had to flee from home to stay in refugee camps. The BJP government withdrew cases against the accused, but the Muslim community has been left in the lurch. The SP, BSP, Congress and RLD use Muslims only as a vote bank,” he said.Launching a veiled attack on SBSP-SP alliance, Owaisi said whoever tried to get close with AIMIM or praised him was being wooed by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for pre-poll alliance. “SP chief knows that AIMIM has made inroads among the Muslims across Uttar Pradesh,” he added.Not only AIMIM, but other members of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha including Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar, Jan Adhikar Party president Babu Singh Kushwaha, Rashtriya Uday Party president Babu Rampal, Rashtriya Upekshit Samaj Party chief Premchanda Prajapati and Janata Kranti Party president Anil Singh Chauhan did not attend the rally. SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar said talks with the Morcha allies were continuing to join the larger alliance under the Samajwadi Party. Meanwhile, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) chief Shivpal Yadav said he had not joined the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha and urged SP chief Akhilesh Yadav to take a final decision over the pre-poll alliance between the two parties (PSP (L) and SP) soon. Once the SP chief makes his stand clear, the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) will decide over the assembly election strategy and alliance, he added.But SBSP says Morcha unitedVARANASI Despite the absence of prominent allies of the SBSP-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) at the mahapanchayat held in Mau on Monday, SBSP leaders said “all is well” and strongly ruled out any split in the Morcha.SBSP state unit vice president Shashi Pratap Singh said, “All is well in the Morcha. We invited each ally of the Morcha and requested them to attend the mahapanchayat. Everyone is free. Why they didn’t come to the Mahapanchayat, they can say it better. We cannot force anyone. Our mahapanchayat has been a great success because lakhs of people gave us their blessings by attending it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/future-of-bhagidari-sankalp-morcha-uncertain-after-sp-sbsp-alliance-101635357939111.html

A proposal for allocating the land was cleared by the civic body by the house in a meeting held on Wednesday. Leader of the house Inderjeet Sehrawat said the Metro Phase 4 segment, from Saket to Aerocity, is a crucial infrastructure project and the corporation has decided to provide municipal land in public interest. “If this pocket was not made available, the DMRC would have had to change the alignment of the line. The land will be provided on a no profit, no loss basis,” he said. The civic body will charge DMRC at the rate of ₹5.73 crore per acre, the proposal cleared by the house stated.The land pocket is managed by the horticulture department of the SDMC. “We received a request from the DMRC to allocate two pockets of land in Vasant Kunj. A land pocket of 175 square metres (sqm) will be allocated for three years, on a temporary basis, while 336.6 metres will be provided on a permanent basis for the construction of entry exit points and lifts to access the station. A joint inspection of the site was carried out by the land and estate department, horticulture wing and DMRC officials,” a senior municipal official said, asking not to be named.The proposal cleared by the corporation mandates that the allotted land will not be used for commercial purposes without taking prior approval from the corporation. “The DMRC shall not use the allotted land for commercial purpose without taking prior approval; otherwise it shall be liable to pay incidental commercial charges to the SDMC along with a penalty decided by the corporation,” the proposal stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisdmc-agrees-to-provide-land-for-phase-4-vasant-kunj-metro-station-101635357878952.html

Also, it could not be confirmed if vaccination against the disease had any role behind the high seropositivity rate, the official further said.Also read | Har ghar dastak: Govt to launch door-to-door Covid vaccination drive next month“We cannot say exactly if Delhi has achieved herd immunity because there are no studies or data to show that the virus won't spread after a certain percentage of population is affected,” PTI quoted an official familiar with the development. “However, the same variant of the virus (Delta) cannot lead to a major epidemic. So, we can say there won't be another wave of coronavirus as big as the second wave until a new severe variant emerges,” the official further said.The sample collection process for the sixth serosurvey began on September 24 and as many as 28,000 samples were collected from the 280 wards in the national capital.Further, the survey also showed that the seropositivity rate was above 85% in every district. More women were also found to be seropositive compared to men, the report further showed.After the fifth round of serosurvey conducted in January this year, 56.13% of the people were found to have antibodies against the disease. The national capital was one among the several places that was battered due to a deadly second wave of infections aggravated by shortage of medical oxygen in hospitals. At its peak, Delhi reported over 28,000 daily infections with the case positivity at one point reaching 36.2%.As many as 73,512 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the city in the last 24 hours and so far 7,251,851 people have been fully immunised against the disease, the Delhi health department bulletin on Wednesday showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-serosurvey-90-people-found-to-have-antibodies-against-covid-19-seroprevalence-over-85-in-every-district-101635356494486.html
27-10-2021||Noida||Yeida starts cleaning Dhanauri wetland ahead of arrival of migratory birds||With migratory birds slowly making their presence felt in the city’s wetlands but not in Dhanauri--one of the largest wetlands that was once home to huge number of bird species, the horticulture department of Yeida has started cleaning the wetland ahead of the birding season. Currently, hyacinth removal at Dhanauri is going on in full swing after a few birders approached Dhirendra Singh, requesting him to get the wetland cleaned before migratory birds start coming in by mid November. The MLA said he asked the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) to get the wetland cleaned. “We have deputed about 15 workers at the site; they will be clearing hyacinth from over 25 to 30 hectares of the lake. We have also taken the forest department in loop. It’s important to remove the hyacinth as birds get stuck in it. It will take maximum two weeks to complete the work,” said Anand Mohan, deputy director of horticulture department, Yeida. “It is a matter of pride that we have such a big wetland in our area. Now that the Noida International Airport is coming up at Jewar, we can also develop Dhanauri as a major tourist place. However, this time, the wetland suffered from lack of upkeep, with hyacinth covering the entire lake. We urged the Yeida’s horticulture department and now, they are removing hyacinth from the wetland. The work will be completed in the next few days,” said Singh. He added they had even approached the forest department. “The divisional forest department had some issues with regard to release of funds, so the work (cleaning Dhanauri) was getting delayed. We took help of the Yeida’s horticulture department to get the work done as migratory birds may start arriving soon,” said Singh. According to birders, migratory birds, especially waterfowls, start arriving in large numbers by November. Its population in the wetlands peaks in December. Many birders claimed that a few migratory birds have already been spotted at other habitats of the city while Dhanauri is completely devoid of such birds. “We observed some of the migratory bird species at Okhla bird sanctuary and Surajpur like Osprey and a few smaller falcons but not waterfowls yet. However, it’s compete silence at Dhanauri . Migration is yet to begin properly, though factors, such as hyacinth growth, slows down the process,” said Jaswinder Singh, a Noida-based birder.One of the major wetlands and birding hotspots of the city, Dhanauri is spread over 101 hectares. Once home to over 211 species of birds, the wetland has suffered in terms of habitat loss, which in turn has led to a drop in the bird population over the years. This April, the forest department rushed to fill the wetland using borewell after it ran dry for the first time due to lack of conservation efforts and heat. Yet, in September, maximum Sarus cranes (84) were found in this wetland out of the 170 spotted in the district. In January, the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2021, held by Wetlands International South Asia and the district forest department, found over four times drop in bird population as compared to 2020. The AWC 2021 found only 1,344 birds of 48 species (20 resident and 28 migratory) in Dhanauri against 6,227 birds of 59 species (21 resident and 38 migratory) found in January last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yeida-starts-cleaning-dhanauri-wetland-ahead-of-arrival-of-migratory-birds-101635357278850.html

Officials said that the district health department has identified 10 clusters in Noida and eight in Greater Noida which have reported maximum number of dengue cases this season.The officials also said that they are conducting the fogging exercise and making inspections in areas with such cases. “We reported seven dengue cases on Tuesday. Of the total 363 cases in the district, 39 are active. These patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. The officials said that the daily dengue tally is compiled a day late in the district, hence Wednesday’s count will only be known on Thursday. A 14-year-old boy died due to dengue at a private hospital on October 21, they said. This year’s dengue count is the highest in the past 10 years. According to official data, the district saw 14 cases in 2012, 69 in 2013, 0 in 2014, 176 in 2015, 17 in 2016, 13 in 2017, 28 in 2018, 40 in 2019 and 28 in 2020.According to the officials, the clusters identified by the health department include Sadarpur, Chhalera, Mamura, Nithari, Barola, Chhajarsi, Sector 5, Sector 9, Sector 22 and Sector 51 in Noida, and Sector Alpha 2, Sector Beta 1, Sector Gamma 1, Gaur City, Haibatpur, Kulesra and Surajpur village in Greater Noida. “Nearly 60% dengue cases have been reported from these areas. A cluster is the area from where five or more cases have been reported,” Sharma said. Residents have expressed concerns over the increasing number of dengue cases.Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of Sector 51 RWA, said, “There is an old water body -- developed for boating – in the sector where the water is stagnant for some months. We feel that it has turned into a hot spot for mosquito breeding, leading to high number of dengue cases. Although the RWA conducted fogging and anti-larval spray in the sector, we demand the health officials to dry up the water body and close the facility.” KK Jain, general secretary of Federation of Noida RWAs, said that the health department should conduct intense fogging and anti-larval spray in the affected areas. “We have also advised resident welfare associations in different sectors to observe precautions and maintain cleanliness,” he said. Dr DK Gupta, chairman of Felix Hospital, Noida Sector 137, said that prevention is better than cure. “People should wear full sleeve clothes and use mosquito repellent. Fogging is also very important. People should meet a doctor if they suffer symptoms like fever, headache and joint pain,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-70-dengue-cases-in-18-clusters-101635357220771.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s south municipal House suspended after ruckus||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) house meeting on Wednesday descended into chaos and was suspended after the Congress accused the civic body of not raising the salary of workers engaged in controlling vector-borne diseases, and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) charged the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of misbehaving with an IAS officer during a ward inspection. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan condemned the ruckus and said that the Opposition parties are “only interested in disrupting the house”. Senior Congress leader Abhishek Dutt, the councillor from Andrews Ganj, alleged that his party workers were allegedly manhandled by the ruling party when they tried to bring in a fogging machine to the house. “These machines, weighing around 15kg, are being operated by the domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) and contractual field workers (CFWs), who get a monthly salary of ₹12,000. This when their counterparts in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) are getting ₹21,060 per month there. Despite repeated requests, their salaries have not been matched. Not only that, the old and heavy fogging machines, running on kerosene oils, are causing health hazards to them,” he said. Dutt also said that his party councillors will continue their protest till SDMC brings the salaries of frontline corona warriors at par with their counterparts in other civic bodies. “The BJP-ruled SDMC has nothing to do with democratic values. Their leaders use muscle power, when anybody questions them,” he said. AAP councillors too protested against an alleged incident of misbehaviour by the husband of councillor when a deputy commissioner inspected his ward.“Is this a way to deal with the officer? The BJP leaders want to create fear among the common people,” said Prem Chauhan, the leader of Opposition.SDMC mayor Suryan said the Opposition parties have only an agenda to disrupt the House. “The behaviour of the Congress and AAP councillors is condemnable in any case. They don’t like to come forward for a healthy discussion, on the issues of development,” he said. Meanwhile, hundreds of employees of the SDMC west zone staged a “pen down, tool down” strike on Wednesday, against the alleged misbehaviour against the IAS officer. “We, the employees of engineering, sanitation, building, licensing, health and education departments of SDMC (west zone) strongly condemn and protest against the shameful act of the councillor’s husband,” the SDMC (west zone) employees’ group said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-municipal-house-suspended-after-ruckus-101635357218979.html
27-10-2021||Noida||GB Nagar court to provide free legal aid to victims of cyber, realty fraud||The chief judge of Gautam Budh Nagar court and president of the district legal services authority has decided to make the general public aware of the procedures to get justice and also provide free legal assistance to those who cannot afford it, especially those who have become victims of cyber fraud or have cases related to the realty sector. The move comes after the national legal service authority and the Uttar Praseh legal service authority directed the district authorities to start a campaign to connect directly with victims, who are unable to get justice amid ‘poor awareness’ among public about the legal remedies in urban or rural areas of every city. According to the district legal services authority, at least 70% of the total cases that are brought to the courts are of cyber crimes. “We have observed that the cyber crime cases, involving banks, online shopping, digital platforms, mobile app business and cheating via online transactions, are rising daily. The sad part is many people are unaware of what to do in case they become victims of a cyber fraud. The awareness level, with regard to available legal tools pertaining to all kinds of crimes, such as sexual harassment at workplace, financial cheating by realtors, cheating of different consumers and other such wrong doings, is poor. We want to make people aware about how easy it is to seek justice from the legal system,” said Ashok Kumar, who is about to begin an ‘outreach’ campaign to connect with victims. As part of the outreach campaign, the district legal services authority will publish and distribute booklets guiding people on how to seek help for a particular crime, start ‘legal aid vans’ and mobile apps in a month’s time. “We will provide free legal assistance to those victims, who are financially weaker and cannot afford the fee of legal services. Many accident victims do not get state’s financial support because they are not aware about the schemes available for them. With the help of the booklet and the awareness campaign, we will try to help as many victims as we can,” said Kumar. “If the district legal service authority has a will, then it can benefit thousands of victims who cannot afford fee of lawyers and are denied timely justice. There has been promises and discussions for justice to the needy in the past too but nothing has happened on ground,” said Atul Sharma, former president of Gautam Budh Nagar Bar Council. The state government set up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to address issues faced by the real estate sector, particularly the homebuyers, who have paid for their flats but have not gotten possession. There are around 6,500 cases pending in UPRERA, of which at least 70% of the cases are from Noida and Greater Noida. “We are trying to get in touch with the local authorities and UPRERA so that all such victims who have been duped can get speedy justice,” said Kumar. “We were happy and had set our hopes on the UPRERA when it was instituted to resolve buyers’ issues. But after five years, justice delivery is still late and troublesome. I bought a flat from the Greater Noida authority, which delayed handing over the possession. When I approached the UPRERA, they gave a ruling in my favour and asked the Greater Noida authority to do justice. But the authority is yet to implement an order, that will give me relief from unwarranted penalty,” said Suman Sharma, a homebuyer in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-court-to-provide-free-legal-aid-to-victims-of-cyber-realty-fraud-101635356438881.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||Making it to Lucknow IPL team will be no cakewalk for Uttar Pradesh players||Even though Lucknow now has an Indian Premier League team of its own, it won’t help Uttar Pradesh or the state capital’s cricketers get a chance to play for the new franchise next season unless they do “extraordinarily well” at the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy, beginning November 4 at Gurugram.Outstanding performance will be the only criterion for a cricketer to impress the talent scouts of different franchises. Inconsistent showing by the UP team in the last few seasons has raised doubts about the prospects of its players. Barring a few practice bowlers for the team nets, there is no chance of anyone new making it to the side.“It’s going to be big entertainment for cricket fans in Lucknow as well as in Uttar Pradesh, but saying that having an IPL team would benefit UP or Lucknow cricket is baseless as we don’t entertain cricketers on the basis of their location, but yes we pick them for their performances,” a talent scout official of an IPL team said on condition of anonymity.“Look at the performance of UP cricketers in the past few years. They couldn’t make it to the knockouts after 2016 and that’s the reason why no new player from UP (is) getting a chance to showcase their ability at the IPL for different franchises,” he said, adding, “Barring a few, most of the UP cricketers were made to sit on the benches during the just concluded IPL at UAE.”He, however, said that since the IPL family has grown to 10 teams now, a number of talent scout teams would be watching the 500-plus cricketers in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy next month, and only the outstanding performers will have a chance to be picked for the different sides. “Many new faces from UP will have a chance to play in the IPL next season only when the side wins the trophy this season,” he added.In the 13 editions so far, Uttar Pradesh could win the prestigious Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy only once in 2016 when Suresh Raina-led side defeated Baroda by 38 runs in Mumbai. Skipper Raina and opener Prashant Gupta batted well and helped the side put up a decent total of 163/7 and, thereafter pacers, Ankit Rajpoot and Amit Mishra, along with chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, bowled superbly to restrict Baroda to 125/7. In 2013-14, UP finished runners-up, losing to Baroda in the final.After the success of the Uttar Pradesh team at the national championship that year, franchises at the Indian Premier League found a good pool of talent among UP cricketers. Along with Raina, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Praveen Kumar, RP Singh, Piyush Chawla, many new faces found a chance to showcase their ability at the mega event.Thereafter, successive failures in the T20 Trophy, where UP struggled to make it to the knockout rounds, dashed all hopes of the state’s cricketers making it to the IPL teams. Except “old warhorses” like Raina, Bhuvneshwar, Ankit Rajpoot, Chawla, and, to some extent, the Under-19 pacers Shivam Mavi and Kartik Tyagi, none could impress the talent scout teams of different franchises.Raina, one of the top run-getters in IPL history who usually turned out for Chennai Super Kings, also played for the Gujarat Lions for two seasons, after the suspension of two teams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/making-it-to-lucknow-ipl-team-will-be-no-cakewalk-for-uttar-pradesh-players-101635356258999.html

27-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan case: Mumbai Police team records Sail’s statement over allegations against Wankhede||Mumbai Police team, which has begun an inquiry against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, based on the complaint of Prabhakar Sail, recorded Sail’s statement on Wednesday. Milind Khetle, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Azad Maidan division, recorded a detailed statement of Sail, one of the panch witnesses in the Aryan Khan-cruise drug bust case, who recently levelled serious allegations against Wankhede and others. Sail is the bodyguard of Kiran Gosavi, also a witness in the Aryan Khan-cruise drug case, who had previously courted controversy for accosting Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan at the NCB office. In a notarised affidavit, Sail has alleged that he overheard Gosavi talking to a person about settling the matter for ₹18 crore and that amount of ₹8 crore would be required to be paid to Wankhede. The recording of the statement took 17 hours. “He shared all details to substantiate his claims,” said Sail’s lawyer Tushar Khandare. Sail has also alleged that Gosavi took ₹50 lakh from an individual after the raid at the cruise ship. He said that he assisted Gosavi during the Mumbai cruise drugs case. Sail has levelled allegation of extortion against Wankhede and others. Wankhede has already denied the allegation. Sail has submitted a police complaint regarding the alleged extortion and misuse of power by the NCB officers in the Aryan Khan case. Based on this complaint, the Mumbai Police started an inquiry and recorded Sail’s statement. “We will verify the information shared by Sail with the help of phone call locations, messages shared, CCTV footage of the location where alleged meetings and sharing of cash filled bag exchanged hands. Once it is done and if prima-facie cognisable material is found against any individual, an FIR would be registered and further investigation would be commenced as per due procedure,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity. Mumbai Police are currently looking at four complaints (including that of Sail’s) it received against NCB officers, including zonal director Wankhede. On the basis of Sail’s revelations, the NCB too has initiated a vigilance probe. However, the NCB named Sail as a “hostile witness” in its affidavit in the court. Sail’s lawyer Khandare also said the NCB has not approached him for recording his statement and he is ready to share all information with them if they give him official intimation or summons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-khan-case-mumbai-police-team-records-sail-s-statement-over-allegations-against-wankhede-101635355778893.html
27-10-2021||Noida||UPPCB to conduct fortnight-long air quality monitoring for Noida, Ghaziabad||The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has decided to conduct a special air quality monitoring in Ghaziabad and Noida -- one week during the pre-Diwali period and again for another week after the festival concludes -- to find out the impact of toxic pollutants, which get generated during the festival. Officials said the special monitoring will be done at UPPCB’s regional offices in Ghaziabad’s Vasundhara and Noida’s Sector 1 and the inputs will be sent to Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), Lucknow, for further analysis. The IITR Lucknow is a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). “With this special monitoring, we will be able to find out the toxic elements and metals, which may arrive with the spike in pollution levels around Diwali. The pre-Diwali monitoring samples will have a certain level (of pollutants) while the post-Diwali samples will contain another set of samples. The increase in toxicity and the presence of metals in air will be ascertained,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “Presence of specific pollutantswill indicate to us the source, which could be stubble burning, vehicular pollution, road dust or even firecrackers,” he added. Another UPPCB officer said the difference between the two samples will ascertain the pollution level contributed by firecrackers, which are usually burst during Diwali. “The difference between the pre and post-Diwali samples will also help us ascertain the contribution of firecrackers to air pollution and accordingly, corrective measures can be taken. With the pre-Diwali samples, we will be able to ascertain the contribution of dust, vehicular pollution to air quality,” said Sharma. “The monitoring will be with the help of special filters installed at the three places and these will be sent to IITR, Lucknow for analysis. The monitoring will span out over 24 hours,” added the officer. Experts said air pollution during Diwali is loaded with organic compounds and metals. “These may include sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, benzene, lead, potassium nitrate and organic compounds, besides dust or particulate matter. These are harmful for human beings and may aggravate conditions of bronchitis, infection to kidney, liver and eyes among others. The sulphur oxides, when mixed with mist having high water content, leads to formation of sulphurous acid and may cause acid rain, which affects vegetation and human beings as well,” said Dr Chandra Vir Singh, retired scientist from Haryana pollution board. Over the past few years, it has been observed that there has been a considerable increase in air pollution during Diwali and the air quality in the cities falling in the National Capital Region often spike to “severe” levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/uppcb-to-conduct-fortnight-long-air-quality-monitoring-for-noida-ghaziabad-101635355658889.html

The traffic police said a Honda City car lost balance and overturned near Sector 147 in Noida, which slowed down the movement of vehicles on the Noida-Greater Noida side. “The incident took place at 3:30pm. A car going towards Pari Chowk from Noida hit the divider and overturned. The police team rescued the victim and rushed him to a hospital. The traffic police personnel cleared the road in 30 minutes,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ganesh Saha. The Noida traffic control room said a truck coming from Greater Noida to Noida overturned near Sector 154 on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway at 8am. “The truck had some goods which were scattered on the road. Some passerby informed police and a team soon reached the spot. The truck was removed using a crane,” the official said. Noida traffic police also shared the information and advised people to take alternative routes to avoid jam. The road was cleared in an hour. Meanwhile, due to construction of an underpass at Sector 126, one lane on both sides of the Noida-Greater Noida expressway has been shut for vehicles. Saha said this too slows traffic during peak hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-accidents-slows-traffic-on-noida-greater-noida-expressway-101635355358757.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Seven smaller parties back BJP after pact between SP, SBSP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got leaders of seven smaller parties with caste appeal to announce support for it in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls at about the time when Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar held a joint rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP) on Wednesday. Before entering into a pact with the SP, Om Prakash Rajbhar had put together a confederation of several smaller parties under the umbrella organisation of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha and BJP’s move is being seen as a counter to the SP-SBSP tie-up. The caste-based smaller parties that BJP roped in included Bhartiya Manav Samaj Party led by its chief Kewat Ramdhani Bind, Musahar Andolan Manch (Gareeb Party) led by Chandrama Vanvasi, Shoshit Samaj Party under its chief Babu Lal Rajbhar, Manavhit Party led by Krishna Gopal Singh Kashyap, Bharatiya Suheldev Janata Party of Bhim Rajbhar, Prithviraj Janshakti Party led by Chandan Singh Chauhan and Bharatiya Samata Samaj Party led by Mahendra Prajapati. These smaller parties were previously part of the Hissedari Morcha, with representation from various OBC groups including Bind, Gadariya, Kumhaar, Dhivar, Kashyap and Patel. Some of them, BJP leaders claimed, were earlier with the SBSP but have since parted ways. The BJP has also been holding a series of caste meets featuring members of Other Backward Castes (OBCs) and Dalits. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is the BJP’s election in-charge for UP, had recently said though his party had stitched alliances with Apna Dal (Sonelal) and Nishad Party, both influential OBC players from eastern UP, it was still open to more alliances with smaller parties. Responding to the SP-SBSP joint rally, UP ministers Sidharth Nath Singh and Anil Rajbhar accused the new alliance of bringing paid people to their rally. “The SP wants to play a game by projecting the SBSP here. All those people who came to attend the rally were brought by the SP. On November 23, we would respond to this mahapanchayat,” Anil Rajbhar said. “Na khela hobe, na khadeda hobe, vikas hobe (neither any twist, nor ouster. Only development would happen),” said Sidharth Nath Singh stating that in 2022 UP polls BJP will prevail again. Sidharth Nath was responding to the slogan “khadeda hobe” at the SP-SBSP rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-seven-smaller-parties-back-bjp-after-pact-between-sp-sbsp-101635355298674.html

27-10-2021||Noida||No honking in Gautam Budh Nagar’s silent zones, violators to be penalised ₹1,000||The Gautam Budh Nagar transport department, along with the traffic police, has launched a drive to check noise pollution in silent zones across the district. Officials said blowing horn or playing loud music will be prohibited in such zones and violators will be fined. Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the 100 square metre area around hospitals, educational institutions, courts, religious places, among others, is considered as a silent zone. “We have planned to ensure enforcement around all such places. Officials from the traffic and transport departments will conduct an awareness programme for a week and then they will start issuing fines for the violation,” he said, adding that the department is yet to figure out the total number of silent zones in the district.Tiwari said that a fine of ₹1,000 will be slapped on a violator for needless honking, while use of pressure horns will attract a penalty of ₹10,000.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that signboards will soon be placed in the silent zones for awareness. “We will also deploy traffic police personnel in such zones,” he said. The permissible noise limit in a silent zone is 50 decibel during the day and 40 during the night, the officials said. Tiwari said that the transport department is also conducting a drive against old diesel and petrol vehicles which have completed 10 and 15 years, respectively. “On Wednesday, we seized three trucks which were older than 15 years in Noida Phase 2,” he said. The DCP (traffic) said that the traffic police have also set up a grievance cell to address the traffic-related problems. “People can contact us at the control room number – 9971009001 – and register complaints like traffic jam, breakdown of vehicles, non-functional traffic light, wrong fines, among others. The control room will share the information to the grievance cell and the staff concerned will resolve the matter in a time bound manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-honking-in-gautam-budh-nagar-s-silent-zones-violators-to-be-penalised-1000-101635354998667.html
27-10-2021||Gurugram||Kanhai T-point to be turned into a roundabout for smoother flow||The Kanhai T-point, a major traffic bottleneck, is set to be revamped into a roundabout, along with pavements and cycle lanes by early 2022, officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said on Wednesday.Officials said that the T-junction of sectors 44, 45 and 52, known as the Kanhai T-point, will be made into a roundabout, for smoother traffic flow.Traffic from Vikas Marg, Sohna Road, Saint Thomas Marg, Golf Course Road, Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg and Huda City Centre converge at the intersection.“The Kanhai T-point is a busy intersection where traffic from all three sectors meet along with traffic moving towards Golf Course Road or Huda City Centre. There is a traffic signal there at present, but during peak hours, congestion is reported at times. We have now decided that this signal would be converted into a roundabout and free left turn would be allowed, further easing movement of vehicles. Tenders have been issued and the work will be completed within six months,” JS Sindhu, a traffic engineer with the mobility division of GMDA, said.Last year, the mobility division of GMDA had earmarked this area as one of the busiest junctions where measures to reduce traffic were needed. The authority will also construct footpaths and side lanes for the movement of non-motorised transport and pedestrians, while a dedicated cycle track is also likely to be developed as bollards for the same has been installed.In September, the issues at the intersection were discussed in detail during a GMDA meeting, with special emphasis on improving a left slip road and a right turn for commuters heading from Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg.Among the main issues is a boomerang-shaped free left near Sushant Estate, which is avoided by commuters heading from Saint Thomas Marg as it takes longer to navigate this stretch instead of taking a left turn on the main carriageway, despite the movement being regulated by a signal. Due to this, the number of vehicles taking a left tends to be higher than those moving straight, towards Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg, causing congestion on the carriageway.Mobility experts termed the turning of the signal into a roundabout a good decision, provided it is designed properly.“Roundabouts help in smooth movement of traffic and are also safer compared to traffic signals, but it can work only when they are designed properly. With a traffic signal, there are higher chances of accidents taking place, but in roundabouts, people generally slow down, reducing the chances of collision. A free left turn also helps reduce the traffic moving towards the junction and there is constant movement of vehicles,” Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said.He said that during peak hours, when there is heavy traffic movement, the roundabout can also be managed with traffic signals as is done at a few locations in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/kanhai-t-point-to-be-turned-into-a-roundabout-for-smoother-flow-101635354940222.html
27-10-2021||Gurugram||Temperature to dip next week, western disturbance may lead to early winter onset: IMD||Temperatures in south Haryana, including Gurugram, are likely to drop over the next week, with a possibility of light rain around Diwali, officials from India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday. According to the weekly forecast of the Meteorological Centre Chandigarh, between October 29 and November 4 (Diwali), temperatures in the district will remain below normal. “Over the next week till Diwali, temperatures in the south Haryana region, including Gurugram, will remain below normal with clear sky during the day.

If drop in temperatures continue, then we might see winter setting in early this year, instead of by third week of November,” Manmohan Singh, the director of MeT Centre in Chandigarh, said. A western disturbance is a wind originating over the Mediterranean region, which carries moisture in the form of rainfall or snowfall, while travelling up to northern regions. The official said that the exact intensity of rain can only be ascertained by the next weekend. With rain, the air quality is also likely to improve in the city around Diwali. Over the past two days, the air quality in the city was in the ‘moderate’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality bulletin. On Wednesday, Gurugram reported an air quality index of 168 with particulate matter, both PM10 and PM2.5, and carbon monoxide as the prominent pollutants. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature was five degrees below normal in Gurugram for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, recording a maximum temperature of 26.4 degrees Celsius (°C), and a minimum temperature of 16.5°C, two degrees above normal. As per IMD data, the normal temperature in the last week of October and the first week of November is 31.7°C for Gurugram. According to the weather bulletin issued by Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi on Wednesday, the air quality over the national capital territory is likely to deteriorate gradually but remain in the ‘poor’ category on Thursday and Friday. Over the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘poor’ to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category, with PM2.5 as the predominant pollutant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/temperature-to-dip-next-week-western-disturbance-may-lead-to-early-winter-onset-imd-101635354938727.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||Except Mumbai, Maharashtra municipal corporations to have 17% more seats||The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to a 17% rise in the members of 26 municipal corporations, except Mumbai and city councils, in proportion to the projected rise in population. The decision will result in collective number of seats in 26 corporations going up to 2,789, from the existing 2,509. After the decision, the number of corporators in poll-bound Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli corporations will increase to 142 from 131; 122 from 111 and 133 from 122 respectively. Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayander corporations will see the rise to 126 from 115 and 106 from 95 corporators respectively. Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad corporations will see a rise to 173 from 162, 156 from 151 and 126 from 115 corporators respectively. Maharashtra has 27 corporations, 26 of which are a government according to the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, while the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is a government under its own Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888. The increase has been initiated on the basis of formula which has been determined in Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949. Based on the population, the maximum number of corporators range from 96 to 185. For the corporations with more than 3 million population, the number ranges between 168 and 185, while for the corporations with the population between 3 and 6 lakh the number of corporators ranges between 76 and 96. “Keeping the rapid speed of population rise in mind and the need to ramp up urban development schemes , the state government has decided to increase the number of members in coporations and city councils. In the wake of the changes in the structures of the urban areas, expediting the pace of the development work is necessary. The decision of rise in the number of seats is to ensure overall development of these urban areas,” a statement issued by the govdrnment states. The statement further stated that since the 2021-census data has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic it was necessary to take the decision of the rise in the seats on the projected figure of the population growth. The projected growth of population in the past 10 years in urban areas is expected to be more than 15% in the last decade. The overall population growth reported in 2011 was 15.99%, against 22.57% in 2001. It is expected to be more than 129 million currently, from 112 million in 2011. An official from the urban development department said that the respective corporations will have to go for the delimitation on the basis of the change in number of seats and density of population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/except-mumbai-maharashtra-municipal-corporations-to-have-17-more-seats-101635354891389.html

Currently, RDF is occupying around 1.5-2 acres of the Bandhwari landfill. Once this land is vacant, we can place all trommel machines at one location, and also create space for starting the WTE project. This will further help expedite clearing of both fresh and legacy waste,” Sunder Sheoran, executive engineer, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) of MCG, who is overseeing the project, said.The MCG has floated tenders and bids will be opened on November 5, officials said on Wednesday. Sheoran said that the tender process is expected to be completed next month, following which transportation of RDF will commence right away.“In the tender, the carrying capacity has been defined. The contractor would have to transport at least 2,000 metric tonnes of RDF to the Sonipat WTE on a daily basis,” Sheoran said.The WTE plant in Sonipat is located nearly 90 kilometres from the Bandhwari landfill, which lies at the Gurugram-Faridabad border. It is Haryana’s first functional WTE project and was inaugurated by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on August 17.The development holds importance as the Bandhwari landfill has been struggling for space, not only to store solid waste but also RDF generated at the site.RDF is essentially derived from non-recyclable plastic and paper derived from municipal solid waste, and is burned in a WTE plant to produce electricity. Trommel machines are used for screening combustible items, such as metals and glass, which are removed from the waste pile and separated for RDF.Around 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste is estimated to be lying at the Bandhwari landfill, which receives around 1,900 tonnes of fresh waste daily from Gurugram and Faridabad. In addition, the landfill also has around 60,000 metric tonnes of RDF stored over two acres.Any waste dumped at a site for more than a month is considered legacy waste.In April, environmentalists and residents alleged that the MCG was dumping legacy waste and RDF in forest land near Mohtabad and Pali villages of Faridabad — an ecologically sensitive leopard corridor — due to a lack of space available at the landfill.MCG officials said that moving the RDF will clear space to accommodate all 17 trommel machines at one location as well as open up space for the civic body to set up its WTE plant.According to MCG officials, trommel machines are currently placed at different corners of the landfill, which is affecting its output. Also, a total of 10 acres is needed to set up a WTE plant.By September, the MCG had cleared six acres using trommel machines and is aiming to clear four more acres at the earliest.“Depending on the size of the vehicle, it will take at least 15-20 trucks to transport 2,000 metric tonnes of RDF on a daily basis. The journey from Bandhwari to Sonipat WTE takes around three hours one-way, and each truck will be expected to carry RDF on a one-time basis per day,” a senior MCG official said.The official said that if the daily target of carrying at least 2,000 metric tonnes of RDF to WTE is maintained by the contractor, it will take around two months for the MCG to clear the two acres where RDF is currently stored.During a public hearing over the Bandhwari WTE on August 31, several environmentalists had also suggested carrying legacy waste from Bandhwari to the Sonipat WTE.“On paper, the project of transporting waste from the Bandhwari landfill to the Sonipat WTE makes complete sense. If done properly, the need for setting up a WTE amid forest land in Bandhwari will no longer be required and instead, the Haryana government could focus on expanding the Sonipat WTE to cater to the waste load of Gurugram and Faridabad,” Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-landfill-processed-waste-to-be-burnt-at-sonipat-wte-plant-from-next-month-101635354880173.html

However, no arrests were made till Wednesday. The constable, identified as 27-year-old Ashwani Kumar, of Jhajjar, was assaulted with baseball bats and the butt of a pistol. However, he did not suffer major injuries.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that one of the suspects was identified and they are conducting raids to arrest him and his associates. “The suspects are regulars to the market and we have traced their car numbers,” he said. A case was registered at the Sector 56 police station against the suspects under sections (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (assault), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act. Kumar, presently posted at the Sector 53 police station, said that the incident took place around 8pm during his visit to the Sector 56 market to have dinner. “When I reached the market I saw a man was making fresh jalebis, so I ordered one plate. Before I could receive my order, a man in his early 30s started abusing me and started fighting to get ahead of me in the queue. Before I could react, he punched me in the face and called his friends who were standing nearby,” he said. As the situation escalated, Kumar said that the suspects pulled out pistols and threatened his life, following which he immediately tried to calm the proceedings. “I told him that I am a cop and had come to buy jalebis and that I was in a hurry, but they threatened to set the police station ablaze; they also threatened to drag me to the police station and assault me in front of senior police officers,” he said. Onlookers informed the police control room following which a nearby van rushed to the spot. In the meantime, the suspects fled the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cop-assaulted-in-row-over-sweets-at-sector-56-market-101635354878699.html
27-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram crime: 30-year-old held for extorting ₹20K a month from cleaning staff||The police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old man for allegedly trying to extort ₹20,000 per month from at least 10 car cleaners working at a society in Sector 67 and threatening to brutally assault them if they did not pay. The police said that the man also regularly called them to threaten them.The suspect was identified as Gaurav alias Rahul of village Bar Gujjar in Manesar. He was arrested from Sector 31 market when he was having dinner. The suspect was sent to 14-day judicial custody on Wednesday, said police. The police said they were able to zero in on the suspect, upon realising that the suspect was using the SIM card of a woman who had approached the Sector 10 police on September 5 to complain about her lost SIM. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the car cleaners had also complained to Sector 65 police station regarding the extortion calls. “During investigation, it was revealed that the mobile number used to make extortion calls was the same number that belonged to woman. We tracked the location and arrested the suspect,” he said. Sangwan said during questioning, they found that the suspect had picked up the SIM card from a local market in Sector 10 and started making calls to car cleaners. “We thought he would not get caught as he was not using his own mobile phone number and got the mobile recharged for three months. The police said that he had extorted money from car cleaners in Manesar area as well but none had complained to the police,” he said. The police recovered the suspect’s mobile phone and found around 400 cleaners’ contacts. They said he regularly used to harass 28 from the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-crime-30-year-old-held-for-extorting-20k-a-month-from-cleaning-staff-101635354759957.html

27-10-2021||Noida||Bursting of green crackers subject to air quality in Ghaziabad, GB Nagar||If the air quality of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad is “moderate” or better, people will be allowed to burst green crackers this Diwali, said administration officials of both districts on Wednesday.Diwali will be celebrated on November 4 this year.However, according to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) readings of both districts are already in the “poor” category--Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, and Noida on Wednesday recorded 278, 232, and 228, respectively.An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.RK Singh, the Ghaziabad district magistrate, said that the Supreme Court, as well as the National Green Tribunal, have given several orders with regard to bursting crackers.“We will comply with and strictly enforce the directions given by the Supreme Court and the tribunal. Bursting of any type of crackers will be subject to the levels of AQI. It is in the best interest of the environment and also to protect the lives of residents from harmful effects of crackers,” the DM said.Ghaziabad officials added that as of now they have not allowed anyone to issue licenses for the sale or manufacture of green firecrackers.Suhas LY, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, also reiterated that any bursting of crackers will be subject to AQI levels.“We will follow the directions of the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal--any bursting of crackers will be subject to the AQI levels. The issuing of licenses for the sale of green crackers is subject to the police’s discretion,” he added.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas had put together the norms for firecrackers with regard to AQI levels.The norms ensure a “total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of crackers, during the Covid-19 pandemic, where the ambient air quality falls under ‘poor’ or worse than ‘poor’ category”.“This means that bursting of crackers will be subject to the condition that if AQI remains ‘poor’ or worse, no bursting of crackers will be allowed. If the AQI is better than ‘poor’, bursting of green crackers may be allowed, but only for a limited period of time,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB for Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar.“The AQI readings of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, and Noida are already in the ‘poor’ category. So, it is likely that the AQI readings may remain ‘poor’ or worsen during Diwali,” he added.“There are several legal directions in place, but past experience shows that there is hardly any enforcement regarding bursting of crackers. The bursting of crackers has already started. There also seems to be hardly any enforcement against traffic snarls. Agencies are also taking up road construction during the period when the Graded Response Action Plan is in place,” said Akash Vashishtha, an environmentalist and lawyer in Ghaziabad.“If the AQI is not controlled now, there will be much deterioration around Diwali,” he added.Firecrackers traders have expressed dissatisfaction over the issue.“The AQI is already in the ‘poor’ category due to factors which do not include bursting of crackers. It shows that the agencies have failed to curb the rise in pollution, and, as a result, people will not be able to use green crackers. Further, there is no word from officials whether they will allow licenses for the sale of green crackers,” said Ashutosh Gupta, president of Footkar Cracker Association, Ghaziabad.“They have not been able to show us any written order which says whether there is a ban on the sale of green crackers. As a result, we are facing a grim situation and our investments are stuck,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/bursting-of-green-crackers-subject-to-air-quality-in-ghaziabad-gb-nagar-101635354638777.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||MH-CET results: 28 students score 100 percentile across PCM and PCB categories||Results for the state common entrance test (MHT-CET) were announced on Wednesday evening and 28 students from across Maharashtra have emerged as toppers at cent percentile. Kolhapur’s Tapan Chiknis and Mumbai’s Dishie Vinchhi were the male and female toppers in the physics-chemistry-maths (PCM) category whereas Fatema Ayman and Aniruddha Ainwale, both from Nanded, were the female and male toppers in the physics-chemistry-biology (PCB) category this year.State minister for higher and technical education, Uday Samant, on Wednesday tweeted news of the results. “MHT-CET 2021 results will be announced online and students can check their individual scores on the official CET website post 7pm,” tweeted Samant.17-year-old Neeraja Patil had already made her mark in the Joint Entrance Examination-Advanced (JEE-Adv) by bagging the first rank among female candidates in Maharashtra. She managed to score 100 percentile in MH-CET as well. “My focus was mainly on JEE exams because I eventually want to bag a seat in the computer science department of IIT-Bombay, but I had prepared for the CET exam as well and I’m happy with the results,” said Patil, a resident of Santacruz. Patil is one of 11 students who scored cent percentile in the physics-chemistry-maths (PCM) category.Of the 228,100 students who have registered for the PCM exam, 192,000 appeared for the exam. Similarly, of the 276,000 who registered for the PCB exam, 222, 000 students appeared for the exam in September this year. According to figures shared by the state CET cell, 180,000 out of these were female candidates and 234,000 were male candidates.In August this year, the state government announced that CET exams will take place in two phases and will be conducted over a week in both sessions to avoid malpractices and ensure social distancing. The total number of exam centres were also doubled this year from 190-odd to over 300 exam centres across the state.For years now, engineering course across institutes and states has witnessed a dip in interest among students. This year, figures released by the state CET cell revealed that the total registrations for the exam this year stood at 500,000, nearly fifty thousand lower than the numbers registered in 2020. Of those registered, 414,000 students finally appeared for the exam in September.“One of the reasons for a large number of registered students to not appear for the exam was because many competitive exams were scheduled at the same dates. It’s unfair to expect students to appear for such difficult exams around the same time,” said Anuradha Patel, mother of an engineering aspirant.18-year old Nikita Maurya bagged the 14th position in the PCB category in the state this year. She’s among the top 28 students scoring a 100 percentile in the exam. “I appeared for the state CET as well as the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) this year. I’m currently waiting for the NEET-UG results and really hope to get through a medical institute in the city,” said Maurya, who stands overall on the 14th position in PCB category.Janam Khandelwal, 19, has bagged the 10th position in the PCM category and is hoping to be allotted a seat in one of the top engineering institutes in the city. “I have appeared for JEE as well as CET, but my score on CET is better so I’m looking forward to the admissions process,” said Janam, a resident of Bhayandar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mhcet-results-28-students-score-100-percentile-across-pcm-and-pcb-categories-101635354583793.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||As Covid cases decline, over 700 hospital beds vacant in Lucknow, other patients need care||Over 700 hospital beds in Lucknow health facilities that were reserved for Covid patients during the second wave are now lying vacant, even as Covid cases have fallen to their lowest level with just four or five patients recuperating in hospitals in the state capital. On the other hand, the need for beds for admitting patients afflicted with other illnesses, especially dengue, is gradually going up.Sample this. There are 320 beds at King George’s Medical University’s department of physical medicine and rehabilitation (DPMR) and 200 hospital beds are kept for Covid patients at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences. Also, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) has 260 beds which are kept unused. No patient is admitted at these wards. Officials of these institutes say they are waiting for instructions to de-notify these wards as Covid wards and use them for other general illnesses. Experts say these hospital beds should now be used for other patients.Besides, a 40-bed paediatric unit made in anticipation of the Covid third wave at Balrampur Hospital, too, is kept in reserve. “The intimation about a third wave is still coming. Hence, these beds have been made ready for admission of children with all equipment and life support systems,” said Dr Alok Kumar Srivastava, director of Balrampur Hospital.Not just in Lucknow but in other places also, beds are kept in reserve in anticipation of a third wave. At the Rajarshi Dashrath Autonomous State Medical College in Ayodhya, 210 beds were reserved for Covid patients on three floors in a building and 70 beds are still reserved for Covid patients.“The ward made at the women and child wing of the institute has 140 ICU/HDU beds and, in all, there are 200 beds that were reserved for Covid patients for the past several months. We treated patients during the first and second wave,” said Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson for the Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.He said, “The beds are still reserved for Covid patients and we are waiting for instructions to use them for other illnesses.”He said once instructions from the state government come, the beds will be used for other patients. Senior officials at SGPGIMS say they are now planning to start admission of other patients on 170 out of the total 260 beds reserved for Covid patients at Rajdhani Covid Hospital that was made at the apex trauma centre of the institute, while a decision on the remaining beds will be taken later.Experts feel that with a rise in the number of dengue cases, there is a need is to arrange hospital beds for those suffering with high fever as dengue may cause more trouble in the coming four weeks.“If there are no Covid patients in need of hospital care, the beds should be used for dengue patients or patients suffering with other illnesses,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of Indian Medical Association, Lucknow.As per statistics, Lucknow had over 7000 beds for Covid patients during the second wave, including 3000 in private hospitals. All private hospitals are now using their Covid beds for non-Covid facilities. Dr Anoop Agrawal, president of the Lucknow Nursing Home Association (LNHA), said, “It is advisible to keep some beds for Covid even if there are no cases since Covid cases rise rapidly. But the need can be evaluated and the remaining beds should be opened fo other health need.”Dr Agrawal said another plan can be kept ready on how to add Covid beds if cases start rising rapidly.On the other hand, the Lok Bandhu hospital that had 150 beds for Covid patients reserved during the second wave is now admitting dengue patients in the Covid ward after disinfection and other formalities. “We are getting dengue and high fever patients; hence we are admitting them. We cannot refuse admission. We are admitting them in the ward that was earlier for Covid patients,” said Dr Ajai Shankar Tripathi of the Lok Bandhu Hospital. At the medical college in Ayodhya, two-thirds of the 210 reserved beds are being used for general patients.“We have started using Covid wards for other patients as there are no Covid patients now. Soon, the remaining 70 beds will also be used for general patients,” said Prof Vijay Kumar, principal of the college.Doctors have advised people that irrespective of whatever information is available on the species of mosquitoes causing dengue, there is only one solution to it and that is to avoid mosquito bites. “Mosquitoes thrive in areas close to human population and a spoonful of water is enough for mosquito breeding. The dengue mosquito lays its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house and the surrounding areas of dwellings including unused bottles, containers, discarded waste, tyres or any item which can hold water,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.Doctors said that information such as mosquito bite during the morning causing dengue or that they bite up to a certain height, say knee level, should not be considered and people should keep themselves protected all the time.“There is only one thing to follow and that is to avoid mosquito bite. After biting a dengue infected person, mosquito will transmit the disease to several others by biting more people. Hence, it is necessary that one uses all preventive measures such as mosquito nets,” said Dr PK Gupta.The hospital beds reserved for Covid patients in Lucknow include 320 at KGMU, 200 at RMLIMS and 260 at SGPGIMS. A total 850 dengue cases have been reported in Lucknow this year and over a dozen dengue patients are currently admitted in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/as-covid-cases-decline-over-700-hospital-beds-vacant-in-lucknow-other-patients-need-care-101635354399026.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||State cabinet decides not to hike property tax||Months before the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to not increase the property taxes for buildings and lands in Mumbai for the year 2021-22. The decision was taken in the wake of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Urban development department officials said that with the decision, people would continue to pay the existing property tax for any building or land as they were paying in 2021-20. “A similar decision was taken in November 2020, and it has now been extended by another one year,” said an official adding that the government will promulgate an ordinance to give effect to it. The BMC is estimated to lose revenue worth ₹1,042 crore through the decision. The civic revises the capital value of the properties every five years, based on which the property tax is levied.Officials added that the BMC had received several requests from various stakeholders about waiver or concessions in the property tax in light of the weak economy after Covid-19. The lockdown imposed by the government had impacted the financial transactions of many small businesses, educational institutions, development works, factories and industrial areas, among others.“Looking at the situation of the economy, which is trying to gain momentum post-lockdown, the decision, to not revise the capital value of any building or land in the current year, has been taken. The BMC could revise the capital value of the buildings and lands in the next financial year,” said an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-cabinet-decides-not-to-hike-property-tax-101635354158957.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||Task force set up to review Mumbai’s islanding system||Over a year after Mumbai experienced a power outage affecting lakhs of consumers, a committee that looked into the reasons found that the emergency standard operating procedures (SOPs) fall short to tackle the ‘failure’ and recommended the use of digitisation and automation to deal with such incidents in the future. A task force has also been set up to review the islanding system of Mumbai.The energy department on Wednesday submitted the action-taken report on the recommendations made by the committee constituted to look into the power outage in Mumbai on October 12, 2020.Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary, energy department, said the observations of the committee have been adopted and the department has taken corrective measures. “The committee observed that our SOPs in an emergency should be revised and we have revised the SOP. A task force has been set up to take corrective measures, regarding the Mumbai Islanding System and the transmission system. The present islanding system has to be reviewed as it was set up in the 1980s. We have formed a task force to review it. All stakeholders including MSEDCL, Tata, Adani, BEST will get covered in this task force,” he said.The islanding system, built by Tata Power in 1981, is designed to isolate its electricity network from the rest of the western grid during widespread grid disturbances. Under the system, power plants within the Mumbai region continue generating electricity during grid failures, supplying power for rail transport and essential consumers such as hospitals. However, it failed in October last year, causing an outage of up to 15 hours depending on the area within Mumbai.Waghmare added, “The committee had indicated that SOPs for outages and emergencies should be revised, which has been done now.” Several systems are working in analogue which has to be digitised. He further said that the department has adopted various other maintenance techniques including replacing insulator strings, its maintenance, use of drones and thermal cameras to monitor hotspots. “They had recommended identifying and monitoring of hotspots. We have identified over 250 locations where 140 thermal scanning cameras, both handheld and Drones, are used for 400 KV lines. We have 24 drones which have thermal scanning cameras in it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/task-force-set-up-to-review-mumbai-s-islanding-system-101635353618690.html

The Matunga Police have registered a case against the driver of the bus. “We have registered a case under Section 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code against the driver and recording of statements of witnesses is underway,” said Nitin Bobade, senior inspector of Matunga Police. Only the driver of the bus could tell what exactly went wrong and why the bus could not be stopped in time, another police officer said. “For now our priority is to pay attention to the injured passengers and the treatment of the staff. Inquiry and checking the health background of the driver will be done once they are all fine,” said Manoj Varade spokesperson for BEST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eight-injured-as-best-bus-crashes-into-dumper-in-mumbai-101635353078588.html
27-10-2021||Other||Prayagraj: Woman raped by former CWC president, FIR registered||PRAYAGRAJ: Kotwali police on Wednesday registered an FIR against a former president of Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Prayagraj, for allegedly raping a 20-year-old woman on the pretext of helping her in a legal case. Teams have been formed to arrest of the accused, police said. According to reports, the husband of the woman, who hails from Kaushambi district, had taken away her six-year-old daughter following their estranged relations. Some months back, the woman reached the CWC where she met its then president. The woman claimed that the man assured her of bringing back her daughter and even offered to bear expenses of the court. The accused then started exploiting the woman sexually and raped her on different occasions at different locations in Civil Lines, George Town, Daraganj and Bahadurganj areas of the district. The woman approached the police some days back when the man allegedly started threatening her on the phone. Station house officer (SHO) of Kotwali police station, Narendra Prasad, carried out investigations and got medical examination of the woman done, and registered an FIR against the former CWC president. Police also carried out raids at the places where the woman claimed she was raped by the accused. Help is also being taken from CWC authorities and district probationary officer. Circle officer Satyendra Tiwari said that further investigation was on in this connection and teams had been constituted for the arrest of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-woman-raped-by-former-cwc-president-fir-registered-101635352718564.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||AY.4.2 not detected in Maharashtra samples: state health officials||The new descendant of the Delta variant of novel coronavirus – AY.4.2 – that is closely being monitored in the United Kingdom has not been found in Maharashtra, state health officials said on Wednesday. This Delta variant sub-lineage was labelled as a Variant Under Investigation (VUI) by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on October 20 and is said to have “modestly increased growth rate compared to Delta”. Principal secretary of the state’s public health department Dr Pradeep Vyas said the AY.4.2 sub-lineage has not been detected in any sample from Maharashtra so far. State’s epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate reiterated it. “AY.4.2 has two additional mutations along with the Delta and the AY.4 mutation. None of the samples from Maharashtra have found these additional mutations,” said Awate. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) continues to be a concern globally as well as in Maharashtra. As of October 25, nearly 73% samples from the state that were sent for genome sequencing under the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) and to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR–IGIB) had the Delta variant. Nearly 5.5% samples had the Delta sub-lineages starting from AY.1, AY.2 and so on. AY.4.2 INFREQUENT IN INDIA Globally, the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) nomenclature is being used by researchers and health agencies to classify the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and variations. Based on the PANGO classifications, 17 AY.4.2 sequences were found in India. These 17 cases also reflected on GISAID, an open-source database tracking the genomic signature of coronavirus variants. However, INSACOG on Wednesday clarified that none of these sequences had both the mutations together. “Manual analysis of these 17 sequences has revealed that 8 sequences have only Spike_Y145H, 2 sequences have only Spike_A222V, whereas the remaining 4 sequences do not have either of the mutations,” the INSACOG release stated. “These 17 samples included 10 from Gujarat, two from Assam, and one from Maharashtra among others. But all these samples were from May, June and July,” said Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The INSACOG also stated that based on the case definition used by UK health authorities, AY.4.2 is very infrequent (below 0.1%) in India. “Most sequences from India that are being classified by PANGO as AY.4.2 have only either Y145H or A222V in Spike, not both mutations appearing together,” it said. AY.4 to AY.33 Among the AY sub-lineages, AY.4 has been dominant in Maharashtra. But INSACOG on Wednesday said that many cases earlier labelled as AY.4 are now reclassified at AY.33 in the new revised system. Maharashtra’s task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said genome scientists are not in agreement with the mutation classification and terminology as far as the AY.4.2 is concerned. “At the moment, we largely have immunity for Delta and Delta derivatives as it has been the dominant strain. Therefore, it’s unlikely that the new sub-lineage will pose a threat, but we have to constantly keep a vigil,” he said. Experts said the AY.4.2 scenario should be looked at from a global perspective. “This particular mutation is creating a problem in UK, north China, Spain, Germany and parts of Europe. But we still know little about its transmission and pathogenicity, so we have to keep a close watch on the global scenario while assessing our own situation,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava who is also a member of the state’s task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ay42-not-detected-in-maharashtra-samples-state-health-officials-101635352178488.html

27-10-2021||Mumbai||Residents protest as Thane civic body begins demolition work of 6 buildings in Diva||The Diva suburb in Thane was tense on Wednesday following a demolition drive undertaken by the Thane Municipal Corporation in mid-morning. Hundreds of people thronged the streets opposing the demolition of six buildings housing 120 flats near Diva station for road widening projects.While the corporation claimed alternate accommodations were provided to each of the residents and enough time was provided to shift, residents refused to move out claiming the new houses were in far off villages, difficult to access from the railway station.Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC, said “We have been taking various measures to inform the residents to vacate the houses. We also provided keys to homes in an alternate premise with all the facilities. It is only after repeated warnings that we have undertaken the demolition work on Wednesday.”Suresh Waghmare, 30, local resident, said, “We have been given an alternate space at Padle Village, which is quite far from our current accommodation. Until now, to go to work or college, everyone could just walk down the road and reach Diva station. Now, we will have to spend around ₹100 a day to reach Diva station. Moreover, there are no other facilities. This is the only building in that village area.”Padle Village is around 8km from Diva station and one way is around half-an-hour ride.Savita Rathod, 45, resident of Diva, said, “We have been staying here for more than two decades. Shifting to a remote area would be inconvenient for us. If they had provided alternate accommodation in the vicinity or within the city precincts, we would have been happier and eager to move.”Residents have protested in the past as well, forming a 500m long human chain in 2019. Anticipating such a reaction, a heavy police bandobast was in place on Wednesday. The residents argued, tried to stop the demolition work and many women wept while a 40-year-old Riza Ahmed fainted on seeing her home being demolished. Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC, said, “This was an illegal structure. Also, we had to widen the road and hence provided them with an alternative. The road block near Diva station caused traffic jams. Widening the road would be beneficial for all. We made repeated announcements in these areas and also put up banners announcing that the structure will be demolished. It was not a sudden decision. We also turned off the water and electricity supply first so that the residents are alerted.” The demolition is undertaken to make way for a road widening project from Diva Circle to the railway station. Diva ROB is a part of this widening. It will be 723m long and 14.80m wide. Central Railway and TMC have contributed 50% each for construction of the ROB.The TMC, with the help of JCB, has only demolished certain parts of the buildings and hence residents on Wednesday evening entered their homes and packed the remaining belongings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/residents-protest-as-thane-civic-body-begins-demolition-work-of-6-buildings-in-diva-101635351164534.html
27-10-2021||Patna||9 convicted for blasts at Modi’s Patna rally in 2013||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court here on Wednesday convicted nine people in connection with the serial blasts at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan in 2013 during an election rally of Narendra Modi, who was then the Bhartiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate, which left six dead and 90 others injured.Special public prosecutor Lalan Kumar Sinha, who represented NIA in the court, said nine of the total 10 accused were convicted under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including under 302 (murder), besides sections of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, Explosives Act and the Railways Act. Sinha said all convicts were members of the banned outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). The explosive devices at Gandhi Maidan had gone off after a blast in the toilet at platform number 10 of Patna Junction, according to police. Two of the accused, Imtiyaz Ansari (Gandhi Maidan) and Mohammad Tariq Ajam (Patna Junction), were also injured in the incident and revealed the name of other associates. Later, Ajam died during the treatment at Patna Medical College and Hospital. A total of 17 IEDs were found in and around Gandhi Maidan, according to police. Additional district and sessions judge of the special NIA court, Gurwinder Singh Malhotra, which has held nine people guilty, let off the 10th accused, Fakruddin, for want of evidence.Those pronounced guilty are: Imtiyaz Ansari, Haider Ali alias Abdullah, Noman Ansari, Umar Siddiqui, Azharuddin Qureshi, Ahmed Hussain, Mohammed Iftekhar Alam, Mohammed Mujibullah Ansari and Feroz Aslam.The court will pronounce the quantum of sentences on November 1.Sinha said five of the convicts have already been held guilty in the 2013 Bodh Gaya blasts case. He said he has demanded death sentences for all accused. In its charge sheet, NIA said that the accused had planned the Patna blasts after they failed to get close to Modi at his previous rallies in New Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, widow of one Ramnarayan Singh from Patna who was among those killed in the blast at Gandhi Maidan, alleged that despite the assurance by the government, she was yet to get either pension or a job as a part of the compensation to kin of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/9-convicted-for-blasts-at-modi-s-patna-rally-in-2013-101635350438560.html
27-10-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: JD(U) says unfazed by Lalu’s campaign||The ruling Janata Dal (United) in Bihar on Wednesday dismissed suggestions that the campaigning by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad could damage its winning prospects in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, where bypolls are to be held on October 30. Both seats were won by JD(U) in 2020 state elections. Prasad, who has been away from the state since December 2017 when he was convicted and jailed in fodder scam cases, held election rallies in both constituencies on Wednesday.“Lalu unleashed his tongue while Nitish Kumar’s work speaks for him. Nobody can forget the journey to Kusheshwar Asthan from Darbhanga 16 years ago and the smooth ride today. It would have been better had Laluji talked about what his government had done. People enjoying round-the-clock electricity supply will never like to even remember the lantern age they were condemned to live in earlier,”said Bihar minister and JD(U) general secretary Sanjay Jha, who has been camping in the area for weeks.“If Bihar today has infant mortality rate (IMR) less than the national average, which is reflected through the Centre’a report released on Tuesday, it shows how the Nitish Kumar government has worked at the basics,” he said.JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said that despite his illness, Lalu Prasad going for campaigning shows he does not have trust in the ability of his son and heir apparent Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “There has been no change in his approach despite consistent drubbing at the hands of the voters since 2005 and the bypoll results will also be no different. Nitish Kumar has given him enough of political treatment in the last 15 years. It is strange that a man who cannot contest even panchayat polls is seeking votes in assembly election,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-jd-u-says-unfazed-by-lalu-s-campaign-101635350138577.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC to study crocodiles at Powai Lake||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), as part of its proposal to build a 10.2km long, circumambulatory cycle track around the periphery of Powai lake, has commissioned a six-month-long study to assess the population of Indian marsh crocodiles, that are known to live in the water body.This will be the first time that such a study will be undertaken. This has been a long-standing demand of environmentalists. While an official census has never been conducted, the Maharashtra State Angling Association (which is situated on the banks of the lake) has previously pegged their number at between 40-50 adult individuals.The study, a proposal for which is currently awaiting approval from BMC, will be led by herpetologist Dr Kedar Bhide, who is one of six experts on the BMC-appointed panel to oversee sustainable implementation of the project, which also involves steps to remediate the water body through aeration, management of weeds and other vegetation, stopping sewage ingress and monitoring of dissolved oxygen levels.“As part of the study, we will do day counts (when natural daylight is available) and eyeshine counts at night. These are accepted methodologies to determine crocodile numbers in a given area and will tell us exactly how many adult crocodiles are inhabiting the lake. While we know they are there, and that there is an indication of breeding, there has been no official study or data collection done so far. We will also study where the crocodiles are basking and nesting, where they take shelter in the water, and what food sources are available to them,” said Bhide to Hindustan Times on Wednesday.Bhide said he expects the population count and basking survey to begin by the end of the year, while nesting surveys are scheduled to be conducted sometime in 2022, between February and June, which is the nesting season for the Indian marsh crocodile. “Now that the monsoon is over, we are just waiting for the water levels in the lake to recede further before we can start our fieldwork. We will compile our findings in a report which will present mitigation measures that the BMC should adopt during the development of the cycle track. Powai Lake is already a sub-optimal habitat for crocodiles and other wildlife, and part of the project involves restoring the area and implementing better biodiversity management,” said Bhide.In addition to mitigation measures, the report will also develop a standard operating procedure for conflict management. “Since the cycle track will be used as a public space where humans and crocodiles will be in close proximity to one another, it is important to plan these SOPs. Hypothetically speaking, if a crocodile wanders onto the cycle track, the BMC will need proper instructions on how to respond. For this, we are considering roping in local wildlife rescue teams who are already experienced in dealing with these animals,” said Bhide.The cycle track component of the Powai lake rejuvenation project, however, has drawn the ire of environmentalists who say they are opposed to the area being developed as a public space for tourists, citing possible harm to the crocodile population. “Why has a project proposal been drawn up without first conducting such a study to understand the impact? Does wildlife become a priority only when it gets in the way of some other development? The forest department and wildlife experts have proposed to conduct such studies in the past but they have not materialised until now. It is needed, but can be done independently without the cycle track,” said Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti.Crocodile populations in Powai Lake are also allegedly in decline. An honorary wildlife warden with the forest department, who has been conducting rescue operations in the city for close to a decade, said, “Sightings of crocodiles in Powai lake were far more frequent around 10-15 years ago. Now a lot of the areas which were available for them, have been encroached, and fish stocks have declined due to pollution and overfishing. Desilting projects have also eroded little islands in the middle of the lake where they would bask.”P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), BMC, confirmed that such a study has been commissioned. “We will approve the budgets and contract soon. As far as completion of the cycle track is concerned, we will wait until the report is done so as to leave the crocodiles’ basking and nesting areas untouched.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-study-crocodiles-at-powai-lake-101635349778543.html
27-10-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: Lalu says Sonia called, Cong junks claim||Confusion prevailed over the RJD-Congress alliance in Bihar on Wednesday after Lalu Prasad hinted at a thaw and said Sonia Gandhi spoke to him on phone about his health and discussed the opposition’s unity, a claim promptly dismissed by Congress leaders.Before leaving Patna to campaign for by-elections in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies, Prasad told reporters, “Sonia Gandhi spoke to me on phone and enquired about my well-being. We also discussed opposition’s unity.”Hours later, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Bihar, Bhaktra Charan Das, who Prasad had called “bhakchonhar (simpleton)”, categorically ruled out any discussion between the Congress president and RJD chief on Wednesday. “This is baseless talk intended to create confusion among the masses at the peak of electioneering. There is no alliance between Congress and RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) in the by-elections and the party would contest all the 40 seats in the next Lok Sabha elections on its own,” said Das.“I am the in-charge for Bihar and a representative of the Congress president. She (Sonia Gandhi) would surely give me the direction about the political line if there was any talk as referred to by Prasad,” said the AICC in-charge, adding that the RJD chief must have lied out of frustration to create confusion among the electors after realising heavy erosion in his party’s vote bank in both the seats.Prasad’s RJD and Congress, which fought the 2020 Bihar polls in alliance, are contesting separately in the bypolls for the two seats, which were earlier won by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United).Das said Congress’s victory would give a new direction to politics in Bihar. “Our victory in two seats is not that crucial as to tilt the balance of power. But it would certainly revitalise Congress,” he said.State Congress leaders, already belligerent after Prasad’s remarks against Das, too dismissed RJD chief’s claim of telephonic call with Sonia Gandhi as a ploy to confuse voters.Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma said, “Prima facie, it appears to be fake. RJD chief is a master dramatist.” Kadwa MLA Shakeel Ahmad Khan said, “RJD has begun taking recourse to lies knowing well Congress was winning both the seats.” Congreas has fielded Rajesh Mishra and Atirek Kumar from Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, respectively. In 2020, the party had lost Kusheshwar Asthan by less than 6,000 votes.When contacted, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said there should be no confusion over talks between top leaders of the two parties. “Lalu Prasad and Sonia Gandhi know each other and RJD has supported Congress and the party chief in critical times. Moreover, there has been no denial (of telephonic all) from Sonia ji,” he said. Meanwhile, Congress legislator Prem Chandra Mishra alleged that leaders and ministers of the ruling alliance are distributing cash to influence voters and using official machinery for election purposes. “The Election Commission has been requested to act against them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-lalu-says-sonia-called-cong-junks-claim-101635349718541.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||Shah Rukh Khan son Aryan’s case ‘different’: Judge explains why 2 arrested got bail||MUMBAI: The case of Odisha residents, Avin Sahu and Manish Rajgaria, arrested during the Cordelia cruise drugs bust, is different from the case of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha, the special Mumbai court said in its detailed orders granting the two bail on Tuesday, explaining that no case of prima facie conspiracy and abetment was made out against them.The court said there was no prima-facie material that they were part of any larger network and their case can be distinguished from that of others against whom there was evidence of conspiracy.“The respondent (Narcotics Control Bureau, or NCB) failed to produce on record any evidence to show that he was either in contact with any of the accused or that in any way that he is connected with co-accused. The prosecution failed to show nexus of the applicant with co-accused to prima-facie make a case of conspiracy. Merely because the applicant was present on the cruise, he cannot be said to be acted in conspiracy with the co-accused,” Vaibhav Patil, the special judge designated to hear cases relating to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), said in a 12-page order on Avin Sahu’s bail request. He cited similar circumstances in his order granting bail to Manish Rajgaria.Also Read: No recovery from Aryan Khan, WhatsApp chats not proof: lawyers to high courtJudge Patil said section 29 of NDPS Act, which relates to punishment for abetment and criminal conspiracy, is not applicable in the case of the two Odisha residents hence rigours of section 37 of NDPS (relating to offences to be cognisable and non-cognisable) would not apply to them. The court said there is no prima-facie material that the present applicant is part of a larger network and his case can be distinguished from the case of others accused against whom there is evidence of conspiracy. As argued and according to the remand report, the accused is arrested only for violation of 8C (prohibition, control and regulations), 27A of NDPS Act (punishment for financing illicit trafficking and harbouring offenders) which attracts punishment for one year. Hence section 29 of NDPS is not applicable to him. “The role attributed to the present accused is different from the role attributed to accused Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha and that no case of prima-facie conspiracy and abetment is made out against the applicant as alleged by the prosecution. Hence section 29 of NDPS Act is not applicable,” the judge said.Judge Patil also observed that the prosecution has failed to point out any circumstances during arguments which “show the nexus of the applicant Rajgaria with any co-accused to prima facie make out the ingredients of the conspiracy”.“Merely because some contraband was allegedly recovered from the applicant, he cannot be said to be acted in conspiracy with co-accused. Moreover, so far as in respect of recovery is concerned, panchnama states that contraband was handed over to the NCB officers by the security officer. Thus, there is prima facie no cogent evidence on record regarding recovery of contraband from the applicant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shah-rukh-khan-son-aryan-s-case-different-judge-explains-why-2-arrested-got-bail-101635349298508.html

27-10-2021||Pune||SPPU issues October-end deadline to 400 students to clear out hostel rooms||PUNE After the state government allowed colleges and universities to reopen campuses for students, from October 22 offline lectures started at several colleges in the city. To prepare for accommodation of students coming in after the Diwali vacations, the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has issued notices to 400 students to immediately take away their belongings from and vacate hostel rooms.A large number of final year students and those that have passed out, have not yet taken away their luggage and other belongings from the rooms. Many rooms are locked and now a notice with a final ultimatum to vacate the rooms by the end of this month has been given to students. Those students who will not take away their belongings or luggage, will find the luggage at the hostel luggage room if the deadline is not met. Currently, a majority of students are still in their villages and hometowns for the Diwali vaccations and will return to Pune only after the festival. Students have demanded an extension for this deadline.Kiran Waghmare, a final year student said, “I am ready to take away my luggage, but I can come only after the Diwali vacation to Pune. Considering this request of most of the students, SPPU should give us an extension.”SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar said, “We have already given enough time and several notices to students to vacant their rooms, but still many students have not taken away their luggage. Post Diwali, new student admissions for the hostel will start and for that our preparations are going on. Now for the remaining students we have issued this circular, and if there is any problem they can contact us and we will surely help and cooperate with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-issues-october-end-deadline-to-400-students-to-clear-out-hostel-rooms-101635348278571.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||No new corona case in 67 UP districts: Yogi Adityanath||Lucknow: No new corona case had been reported in 67 districts, while only 13 new cases had come to notice in remaining eight districts in the past 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh, said chief minister Yogi Adityanath here on Wednesday. In all, 0.17 million Covid-19 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. Seven patients have fully recovered during the period, bringing down the number of active cases to 100 in the state. There was no active corona case in 39 districts of the state while only one active case each was reported in 18 districts. Addressing a high level meeting, the chief minister said in all, 1.68 million patients had recovered from Covid-19. He said corona had been checked with the state government’s tracing, testing, treatment, and vaccination policy but there was a need for precaution and maintaining vigil to keep Covid-19 under control. He said special attention should be paid during the festival season. HIGHEST VACCINE DOSES Yogi said the number of people getting both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine was highest in the state. He said 30.8 million people had been given both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Out of 127.70 vaccine doses given so far, 96.9 million were first doses. This was nearly 60 per cent of the state’s population eligible for vaccination. He said the people eligible for second dose should be fully vaccinated and a regular communication should be maintained with the Centre to ensure availability of vaccines. MAINTAIN CLEANLINESS Yogi said special attention should be paid to cleaning, fogging and sanitization, keeping in view dengue, diarrhoea and viral infections. He said compensation should be paid to farmers whose crops had been damaged in floods and added that 0.5 million farmers had been identified for payment of compensation. Work in this regard should be carried out expeditiously with sensitivity, he said. ACT AGAINST THOSE BLACK MARKETING FERTILISERS Yogi said district magistrates should inspect procurement centres and there should be no delay in payment to farmers. He said there were reports of man-made shortage of DAP fertilizer through black marketing and hoarding. The agriculture production commissioner should take note and work out a system in this regard. He said district magistrates should ensure expeditious disposal of complaints and strict action be taken against those indulging in black marketing and hoarding. The state government was committed to protecting interests of employees and high level committees had been constituted to resolve their issues, Yogi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-new-corona-case-in-67-up-districts-yogi-adityanath-101635346838681.html

The special vaccination drive for students in KDMC started on October 25 after the state government announced a week-long vaccination drive for the students across Maharashtra state. “In two days, we have managed to vaccinate 1,026 students who came to the college. The response is less as many students are not present,” said an officer of the health department of KDMC.On Wednesday, the staff deployed for vaccination at Mohinder Singh Kabul Singh College in Kalyan (W) were sitting idle as no students turned up for vaccination. “As of now, there is no list of students that we are targeting to vaccinate till November 2. However, we are trying to reach out to as many colleges as possible in the coming days,” added the officer.KDMC has managed to start vaccination at eight out of the 30 colleges in the city.

27-10-2021||Pune||Junnar is ground zero for leopard attacks on humans, livestock||PUNE Pune city witnessed its first leopard attack this year on Tuesday, when Sambhaji Athole (45), out on a morning walk in Gosavi Vasti in Hadapsar was attacked.However, there is another part of the district which has been grappling with the issue for multiple years.Junnar has lost 34 people and had 108 injured in leopard attacks since 2001, according to data provided by the office of Jayant Gauda, deputy conservator of forests, Junnar.While the number of deceased in Junnar has been restricted to one per year since 2015, barring 2018, when there were two deaths, and 2020 when there were no deaths, the livestock in the area has seen an increased threat over the years.With 382 animals attacked by leopards in 2001, the number has gone up to 1,178 in 2021, according to the records of the forest department.The highest number of livestock attacks in the past 20 years was in 2019, just before the Covid-19 lockdown, where 1,995 animals were affected in 1,704 incidents.Even though the attacks reduced in 2020, the number of livestock affected remained high with 1,626.In 2021, 1,178 livestock animals have been attacked within seven months.Wild animals and birds have also become targets of the leopards in the area - with three attacks in 2018, two in 2019 and two in 2020. 2021 witnessed six animals injured by leopards within six months. The injured animals and birds include Sambar (deer), peahen, monkey, fox, and peacock.The forest department along with ResQ foundation and local rescue teams have rescued 30 leopard cubs - 10 female and 20 male - since 2018 in Junnar. In the same period, 22 adult leopards have been rescued – six females and 16 males.The forest department has trained local people and associates with ResQ foundation of Neha Panchamiya to deal with the increasing sightings of wild animals and man-animal conflicts. However, the need for a comprehensive policy is felt with every incident - be it leopard attacks or the death of a Gaur that strayed into Pune.Earlier in August this year, the 11-member committee set up by the Maharashtra government to study leopard-human conflict, had re-stated the importance of co-existence with the big cats and focus on engagement with locals. The committee rejected suggestions of capturing or trans-locating leopards from the conflict zone besides suggesting a “Living with Leopards” (LwL) programme. While leopard attacks have grown over the years, deaths of big cats in Maharashtra have also seen rise over the years. During 2020 went up to 174, 60% more than the figure registered in 2019 that saw 110 leopard deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/junnar-is-ground-zero-for-leopard-attacks-on-humans-livestock-101635346418190.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||49 indicators to monitor progress in 100 aspirational blocks of UP||LUCKNOW The Uttar Pradesh government has worked out 49 indicators to effectively monitor development in 100 aspirational blocks identified recently on the pattern of the union government’s aspirational district programme being implemented in eight aspirational districts of UP. A portal/dashboard is being developed to set up data on the progress of implementation of these indicators in 100 aspirational blocks in 34 districts. “Additional chief secretaries/principal secretaries will review the progress of implementation of these indicators linked to their respective departments in the aspirational blocks (along with districts) on a fortnightly basis and take follow-up action to bring about improvement, if their performance was found below expectations,” stated chief secretary RK Tiwari, in an order sent to senior officers on Wednesday. Initially, the state government had shortlisted about 80 indicators on the basis of recommendations made by different departments. The number of indicators was then brought down to 49. The state government had consulted the NITI Ayog as well while identifying the aspirational blocks and the indicators. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the aspirational district programme on January 5, 2018. UP’s eight districts had been included in the programme. These included Balrampur, Shravasti, Bahraich, Siddharthnagar, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Fatehpur and Chitrakoot. The programme proposed to quickly and effectively transform selected districts by convergence (of central and state schemes), collaboration of central, state level officer in-charges and district collectors, competition among districts and focus on the strength of each district. The state government issued directives to ensure that the data with regard to indicators was available on the portal by the 15th of every month. A senior officer said the union government too identified 49 indicators to monitor progress of various programmes/schemes in aspirational districts in five thematic areas that include medical and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion & skill development and basic infrastructure. The 49 indicators identified for the aspirational blocks include percentage of pregnant women receiving antenatal care, institutional deliveries vis-à-vis total deliveries, percentage of low birth weight babies, percentage of underweight children in under six-year age group, sex ratio at birth and percentage of primary health centres compliant with public health standards of India. Other indicators relating to education sector included transition rate from primary to upper primary, transition rate from upper primary to secondary, mathematics performance in Class 3 and language performance in Class 3, mathematics performance in Class 8 and language performance in Class 8, female literacy rate in 15-plus age group, percentage of schools with functional drinking water facility, percentage of schools with functional electricity facility, schools complying with RTE specified pupil-teacher ratio, disbursement of Mudra loan, percentage of gram panchayats with Internet connection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/49-indicators-to-monitor-progress-in-100-aspirational-blocks-of-up-101635346118250.html

27-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath launches ₹1132 crore projects in Gonda||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday launched 144 development and medical projects worth ₹1132 crore in Gonda district in the eastern region of the state. Every district will soon have a medical college to provide accessible healthcare services to citizens in Uttar Pradesh, he said. “The government has worked in a planned and phased manner to improve the existing healthcare system and expand the health infrastructure in the state,” Yogi Adityanath said while laying the foundation stone of the Government Medical College that will come up at an estimated cost of ₹282 crore in Gonda. “Today, the foundation stone of a medical college in Gonda is being laid with the resolution to start admissions in this institute by the year 2022-23,” he added. “Despite facing natural calamities like floods, Gonda has made great progress. This has been possible because of several growth-oriented reforms implemented by the government at the ground level, along with ensuring the safety of every individual,” Yogi Adityanath said. He reiterated that before 2017, curfews were imposed during the festive season and the common man was not even allowed to celebrate festivals in peace. While the previous governments did not respect the religious sentiments of the people, Uttar Pradesh has been transformed in the last four and a half years, he said. Today, people are being given the gift of welfare schemes right before festivals, he asserted. He went on to say that, unlike the previous governments, “our government fulfilled the aim of benefiting every eligible person and worked to push the unserved places on the path of development without discriminating on any basis.” He emphasised that the state government is functioning to achieve the goals set by it. “We fulfilled our promise of building the grand Ram temple and now others are claiming to be honest devotees of Lord Ram,” he added. The chief minister handed over the symbolic keys of the houses to beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural and Urban), and also gave benefits to the eligible beneficiaries under welfare schemes like Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, Kanya Sumangala Yojana, Rashtriya Grameen Aajeevika Mission and Kanya Vivah Sahayata Yojana. Medical education minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, social welfare minister Ramapati Shastri, minister for MSME Sidharth Nath Singh and Gonda MP Brijbhushan Sharan Singh, among others, were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-launches-1132-crore-projects-in-gonda-101635345878768.html
27-10-2021||Mumbai||Officials took my signatures on blank papers, says 2nd NCB witness in drugs case||MUMBAI: An independent witness in a raid conducted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on August 26 came forward on Wednesday to claim that he too was made to sign several blank papers by officers of the federal drug enforcement agency. Shekhar Kamble, a Navi Mumbai resident, is the second witness in a drugs seizure case to level the allegation after Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the drugs case filed by the agency in which the son of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, was arrested earlier this month.Shekhar Kamble said the signed blank documents were used by the NCB to draw up the panchnama, the document in which citizens, who are not part of the investigating agency, sign off as independent witnesses on the details of the search operation, items found at the particular location or from an individual along with statements of the persons concerned.Kamble said he was an independent witness in a case registered by NCB on August 26 when agency officials conducted raids in Kharghar and arrested Nigerian national Kingsley Ukwueza. The agency claimed to have seized 55 grams of Mephedrone (commercial quantity) and a small quantity of ganja in the raid. “I was present at the time of raid with NCB officials and one Nigerian managed to flee away while NCB nabbed another. I am not aware if they (NCB officials) have recovered any drugs from him,” said Kamble, a Navi Mumbai resident. Also Read: NCB decided not to act on cruise info, Sameer Wankhede went ahead“Three days later one NCB official, Anil Mane, called me and asked me to come to NCB office in south Mumbai where I was made to sign at least 10 blank papers which were later used as panchnama,” he added. Kamble said he came stepped forward after he learnt that the anonymous letter sent to the chief minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik also mentioned the Kharghar case. “I got scared and meanwhile I got a call from Anil Mane on Tuesday night, instructing me to not speak about the episode with anyone. NCB officer Ashish Ranjan is investigating the case,” said Kamble.Shekhar Kamble said he approached the Kopar Khairane police station in Navi Mumbai to seek police protection. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede denied Shekhar Kamble’s claim. “I completely deny this and I will appropriately reply in the court”. An internal inquiry was ordered by NCB after Prabhakar Sail’s allegations came to light. Sail, also claimed that his former boss, private detective KP Gosavi whose role has come under scrutiny, and who is currently on the run, and NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, were part of an attempt to secure a ₹25 crore payoff to let Khan go.Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik on Tuesday cited a letter purportedly written by an unnamed NCB employee alleging that Wankhede framed innocent people in 26 fake drug cases. He also claimed Wankhede engaged two private persons to tap phones of the people to frame them. The letter claims NCB allegedly planted drugs shown to have been seized in some of the cases. Malik has also alleged that the day Aryan Khan was arrested, NCB detained many others in connection with the same case but those linked to a Bharatiya Janata Party leader were released. NCB has insisted it detained around 14 people and released six while the remaining eight, including Aryan Khan, were arrested.Malik has also accused Wankhede of framing his son-in-law and two others in a drug peddling case in January and delaying the process for their bail. He said NCB showed 200 kg herbal tobacco as ganja and produced photographs of seizures taken at its office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/officials-took-my-signatures-on-blank-papers-says-2nd-ncb-witness-in-drugs-case-101635345578251.html

27-10-2021||Lucknow||Smriti in Rae Bareli, BJP eyes clean sweep in Cong bastion||LUCKNOW To build on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) growing political heft in regions considered to be Congress bastions, union minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday visited Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. Smriti, who replaced Sonia Gandhi as the chairperson of Rae Bareli’s District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) in July, arrived in Munri village and spent time with girl students of a local school before attending a public function to announce the launch of several government schemes. She had defeated the then Congress chief Rahul Gandhi from Amethi in 2019 Lok Sabha elections – only the third Congress defeat from here. Since then, the BJP has been expanding its hold on the region, winning the recent zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls for the first time. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had fielded former Sonia loyalist Dinesh Singh against her from Rae Bareli. Though Singh lost, he subsequently played a part in the Congress defeat in the election for zila panchayat chairpersons’ post. Munri village is part of the Salon region that traverses between Amethi and Rae Bareli – part of Amethi Lok Sabha (which falls in Rae Bareli district and where she said BJP has kept promises made to the people). “I had made promises to the people here and today I can say that I have fulfilled them,” Smriti Irani said pitching herself and the BJP as ones that honour commitments. Smriti also took a veiled swipe at the Congress chief. “The district is one, but has two MPs. If one asks whether your MP is seen in this region, people go quiet. Which colony has got a proper road built in front of their house and people go quiet. On the other hand, Salon residents can proudly state that their ‘didi’ can give a detailed breakup of development initiatives and is regularly involved in people’s good and bad times,” she said. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi too had visited Rae Bareli recently and Smriti’s visit is being seen as an attempt by the BJP to symbolically indicate the ruling party’s interest in this Congress citadel. “Having firmed up its grip on Amethi, the BJP is now looking to Rae Bareli.But before the 2024 LS polls, the BJP would like to test its growing presence in Rae Bareli from where it won two seats in 2017 UP polls, as many as the Congress. With both Congress lawmakers having turned rebels since, the BJP is looking to scale up its political presence,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political veteran. The BJP leaders admitted that having won 6 of the 10 assembly segments of Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2017 UP polls, the party is looking towards a clean sweep. “Of course, we will sweep the region but we aren’t focusing on any one particular belt. People are connecting with us everywhere due to pro-poor policies launched by the Modi and Yogi governments,” said Vijay Bahadur Pathak, vice president, UP BJP. The 2022 UP polls are expected to be announced by December-end or January and on the ruling party’s nudge, Smriti Irani has stepped up her presence in the region, visiting Rae Bareli on one pretext or the other. In October 2020, she had reviewed development projects in Amethi from Salon and was back here in December, laying foundation stones for various development works, baring political intent to wrest Rae Bareli in 2024, followed by a visit to Hajipur village to hear Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio talk show ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya also said, “Rae Bareli never witnessed the kind of development it is witnessing now. Just as despite losing Amethi in 2014 LS polls, the BJP continued its association with the constituency, we have not forgotten Rae Bareli just because we didn’t win here. Unlike the Congress, which failed to do anything for even those regions from where its leaders had been getting elected for decades, the BJP is developing all constituencies.” The Congress, however, dismissed Smriti’s visit. “She is a political tourist. Our leadership has a familial relationship with the area but there are some outsiders who have been polluting the atmosphere. However, the people won’t let them succeed,” said Congress leader Zeeshan Haidar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/smriti-in-rae-bareli-bjp-eyes-clean-sweep-in-cong-bastion-101635345398301.html

The BJP was supported by the Shiv Sena and the Samajwadi Party on the issue. The matter was discussed after MFB proposed to sell unused vehicles in the scrap.Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and standing committee chairman in the BMC said, “The bids for selling the scrap are by the same contractor, from the same address, but with different company names. The auctioning of scrap from 2017-18 has come up after a span of three years. The cars like the Ambassador and jeep are being sold at ₹25,000. The overall value of scrap is over ₹2 crore, but it is being undervalued. A cartel of contractors has been duping the BMC for over 25 years.”Supporting the BJP, Yashwant Jadhav, a Shiv Sena corporator and standing committee chairman said, “The BJP claims there is a cartel of contractors duping the BMC for 25 years, but this has been happening for over 40 years now. Members of ‘one family’ are bidding with different company names and getting contracts. They are not allowing any outsiders. This same in case of contracts of demolition and parking lots.”Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party corporator and Bhiwandi Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) said, “The BMC administration should investigate the matter, considering the involvement of cartel in the sale of scrap and demolition works.”After the opposition, the standing committee has put the proposal of selling fire vehicles in scrap on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cartel-of-contractors-duping-bmc-says-bjp-alleges-scam-in-selling-of-scrap-101635344618004.html

In the latest incident on Saturday, a former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator dug up a cycle track in Hadapsar saying it was obstructing traffic. What’s more, he bragged about his action in public even as the PMC filed a complaint against an unknown person.V G Kulkarni, chief engineer of the road department said, “The incident took place on Saturday. When we came to know about it, we instructed Hadapsar ward officials to file a complaint against an unidentified person as we did not know who was behind the action. The cycle track is part of the bus rapid transit route (BRTS) and is around 225 metre long and runs adjacent to the footpath.”The 1.5 metre wide cycle track is located on the Pune-Solapur road near Hadapsar Gadital and runs adjacent to the service road before the beginning of the Saswad road flyover. The PMC in 2007-08 developed the footpath and cycle track along the 8 kilometre BRTS from Swargate to Hadapsar Gadital as per union government guidelines. It was part of the pilot BRTS in India developed from Hadapsar to Swargate and Swargate to Katraj. However, locals have been complaining for long that the cycle track obstructs traffic as it has been developed just before the beginning of the Saswad road flyover. They have been demanding that the width of the cycle track be reduced.Sasane said, “We have received complaints from locals who have been demanding removal of the cycle track as it is creating traffic problems on the Pune-Solapur road near the Gadital flyover. We have received an application addressed to the road department regarding inconvenience caused by the cycle track. However, there has been no response from the administration. So, we have removed the cycle track for the convenience of residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/former-ncp-corporator-digs-up-cycle-track-pmc-files-complaint-against-unknown-person-101635344500520.html

They had firmed up the alliance on October 20.Akhilesh Yadav said Rajbhar has closed the door through which the BJP came to power (in UP in 2017) and the SP will lock it. For his part, Rajbhar, who spoke before Yadav, made several poll promises.He said if Akhilesh Yadav forms the government, domestic electricity bills will be waived for five years and a law will be passed for free education up to the post-graduation level, adding that those who do not send their children to school will go to jail.He also said there would be a law for the free treatment of the poor, and old government pensions will be restored. The SBSP chief promised that government schools will provide facilities like private schools and police personnel will be posted in districts neighbouring their home districts.In a show of solidarity and unity, Akhilesh Yadav wrapped a yellow scarf around his neck, commonly used by SBSP workers, while Rajbhar wore a red cap, usually donned by SP workers. “Red and yellow have come together and have gathered in Mau. Seeing us together, some people will be turning laal-pila (red and yellow or angry). Om Prakash Rajbhar knows it well as to who is turning red and yellow in Lucknow and Delhi,” the SP chief said in an apparent reference to the ruling BJP.The slogan “Khadeda Howe” is on the lines of ‘Khela Hobe’ (game on), which was coined by the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress for the West Bengal assembly polls that saw the party defeat the BJP and storm back to power for a third consecutive term.“Slogan ‘Khela Hobe’ was given in West Bengal and ‘didi’ drove out the BJP from the state. Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh it will be ‘Khadeda Hobe’ and the BJP government will be removed by the people of the state,” Rajbhar said.Akhlesh Yadav also said, “Rajbhar ji has said that something has happened in West Bengal. People of eastern UP will do khadeda (driving out). As I said in Lucknow, Om Prakash Rajbhar has closed the door through which the BJP came to power. Together SP and SBSP have latched the door.” “I am confident that the BJP will be wiped out in UP in coming assembly elections,” claimed Akhilesh Yadav.“When the alliance was not finalised, experts used to do analysis of who will win how many assembly seats in UP. But after the alliance (between SP and SBSP), analysts changed their figure. The SP and SBSP have come together to work for the rights and self-respect of the poor, Dalit, OBCs and minorities. Now, may the public make us win 400 seats,” said Akhilesh Yadav, adding that no one will be able to stop the alliance in UP.The Samajwadi Party chief hit out at the Centre for growing inflation and unemployment. He said that bikes of poor people had stopped running due to the rising price of petrol. Alleging that the BJP government didn’t give any help to the poor during the Covid-19 crisis, Akhilesh Yadav claimed people didn’t get oxygen and medicines. The former chief minister also accused the BJP of not listening to farmers who are agitating against the Centre’s three new farm laws.Recently, when the farmers went to ask for their rights in Lakhimpur Kheri, union minister of state of home Ajay Mishra Teni’s son mowed down some (four) farmers under his vehicle, the SP chief alleged, adding that the minister hasn’t been removed yet. As long as he (Mishra) remains minister, the victims will not get justice, Yadav said. The minister’s son Ashish Mishra has been arrested in connection with the case. Both the minister and his son have repeatedly denied Ashish Mishra’s involvement in the incident.Akhilesh Yadav further said if the three new laws were implemented, the famers will become daily wagers in their fields and contractors will decided what to sow. Addressing the gathering before the SP chief, Rajbhar said he has brought the future CM in front of the people, adding that he will contest the assembly elections in association with the Samajwadi Party.Cautioning the people that BJP will spread rumours about him, SBSP chief asked them not to believe them.Reacting to the rally addressed by SP and SBSP leaders, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya of the BJP said, “Rally or mega rally, nothing is going to happen. The BJP is going to win these 2022 UP polls with 320 seats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sbsp-has-closed-bjp-s-door-to-power-samajwadi-party-will-lock-it-akhilesh-yadav-101635344138649.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||Drug addicts should be sent to rehab centres, not jail: Athawale||LUCKNOW Union minister and Republican Party of India (RPI) chief Ramdas Athawale on Tuesday stressed that there was a need to make the film industry “drug-free”, but said people caught consuming drugs should be sent to rehabilitation centres instead of jail and there must be a change in this law.“People who consume liquor are not put behind bars, but are sent to de-addiction centres to get rid of the habit,” he said.Addressing a press conference here, Athawale said: “My ministry has proposed an amendment to the law under which the accused charged with drug consumption will be not sent to jail but to the rehabilitation centre. Those indulging in smuggling, sale and other unlawful activities should be lodged in jail.”Possession of drugs is a criminal offence in India and Section 27 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act prescribes imprisonment of up to a year or a fine of up to ₹20,000, or both, for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. Bollywood Actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was recently arrested under this section.Defending the Narcotics Control Bureau’s action in the drugs-on-cruise case, Athawale said the rejection of the bail petition six times by the court in Aryan Khan case indicates that the arrest made by the agency was appropriate, he said. Refuting the allegation made by Maharashtra minister Nawab, Malik against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, the RPI chief said: “Wankhede is a Dalit belonging to the Mahar community from Maharashtra’s Nagpur region. His father Dayandev Wankhede married a Muslim woman. Sameer’s first marriage was with a Muslim woman. Malik is trying to tarnish Sameer’s image as he had earlier arrested his son-in law in a drug case.”RPI’S UP POLL PLANAthawale said RPI had decided to contest the 2022 assembly election in UP in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and it would field candidates on 8 to 10 assembly seats.The RPI had launched a statewide yatra from Saharanpur on September 26 to mobilise its cadre for the assembly election. The party will also organise Bahujan Kalyan Maharally at Ramabai Ambedkar ground here on December 18 and senior BJP leaders would participate in it, he said.“The RPI is a true representative of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar’s ideals. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has grabbed our ground in UP but we will try to make inroads into the BSP support base by winning the support of the Dalit community,” he said.Athawale said along with Dalits and backwards community, people of the upper castes were also joining the RPI and to win the support of the upper caste, the RPI was organizing Brahmin conference. “The India Jan Shakti Party, Ekikrit Brahmin Mahasangh and Parmarth Trust led by the Brahmin community leaders merged with the RPI,” he added.The RPI leader stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not against farmers, but opposition parties were instigating farmers against the three farm laws to serve their vested interests. The central government had made it clear that it was ready to talk with the farmers to bring necessary amendments to the farm laws, he said. “Union minister of agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar has held several rounds of talks with representatives of farmers, but the dialogue remains inconclusive. The central government has made it clear that it will not withdraw the farm laws,” said Athawale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/drug-addicts-should-be-sent-to-rehab-centres-not-jail-athawale-101635343719457.html

27-10-2021||Mumbai||70% fire incidents due to short circuit; BMC wants housing societies to conduct electrical audit||After the level-4 fire at 60 storeyed Avighna Park, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) wants housing societies in the city to conduct electrical audits. According to the civic body, 70% of fire incidents are due to electrical short circuits.The BMC on Wednesday said they will write to the public work department (PWD)’s electrical division to develop a mechanism to regulate housing societies to conduct electrical audits. However, the civic body officials said that the Maharashtra Fire Act does not have a provision for mandatory electrical audits.According to officials from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB), in case of fire at One Avighna Park, the fire started in a video doorbell due to short-circuit and later spread to other areas. The exact cause will be known after a thorough investigation, said MFB officers. The officer added, “In 70% of the cases, fire is due to short-circuit.”Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC informed the standing committee, “There is no mechanism for having societies conduct electrical audits. We are in communication with the state government to develop a regulatory mechanism for the same. We are also reviewing fire safety in hospitals and in the malls of the city.”Bhide added, “In case of high-rises also we have been conducting fire drills and inspections regularly and taking all appropriate steps to ensure there is zero-tolerance for fire safety,” an officer said.According to BMC officials, the MFB in the past three months have conducted fire drills at 52 high-rises and inspected 1,526 buildings in the past 20 months. Notices have been issued to 327 buildings, while 78 buildings have complied with violations, 109 are in the stage of compliance and prosecution against three housing societies is under process.Further, the BMC’s standing committee on Wednesday also cleared a proposal of ₹3.15 crore for the procurement of 24 fire bikes for the city. According to BMC officials, the fire bikes will help firefighting in congested areas like chawls and slums. These fire bikes will be added to the fire-fighting fleet of the MFB. However, corporators across the party line asked the BMC administration to ensure that firefighting equipment is efficiently used. Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition in the BMC and Congress corporator said, “The standing committee should be informed on how these bikes will be used, where they will be parked followed by how many litres of water will be stored in it?”Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party corporator in the BMC said, “Such flowery words are used and such proposals are brought in the standing committee, but we should also look how useful these modern equipment are? Earlier, we brought robots and drones. but we all know how much use they have been. We are not against modernisation but there should be an efficient use of the resources.”Bhide said, “We do understand that there are challenges in fire-fighting. The response time of our fire brigade is 20 minutes in peak hours, which ideally should be around six-seven minutes, as per the Central government norms. However, despite this, let me assure you that Mumbai Fire Brigade is the most technologically equipped. We have 35 fire stations and 18 mini fire stations, and we are in the process to have more mini fire stations. These fire bikes will in a way help the fire brigade improve a lot of things when it comes to responding to fire incidents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/70-fire-incidents-due-to-short-circuit-bmc-wants-housing-societies-to-conduct-electrical-audit-101635343178092.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||RLD chief promises to waive off pending power bills of farmers||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary on Wednesday promised complete waiver of pending electricity bills and rates slashed to half in future electricity bills for farmers once his party comes to power in UP that goes to polls next year. Addressing a public meeting in Jat dominated Kirawali town of Agra, he also promised ₹12,000 every year in one installment to farmers in Uttar Pradesh and one crore jobs to youths. The RLD chief has been addressing public meetings as part of his ‘Ashirwad Path’ yatra wherein he is seeking blessings of elders in run up to UP assembly polls.“Farmers are much worried about exorbitant electricity bills as the present government is not thinking about farmers. When our government is formed in the state, we will waive total pending electricity bills of farmers and curtail rates of electricity to half for farmers,” he said.Chaudhary further said “We will also give ₹12,000 in one installment to farmer in a year once we form the government. The marginalized farmers having no means for irrigation will be given ₹15,000 per annum.”Chaudhary said the present fund of ₹6000 that too in three installments was insufficient.“We will make this announcement on December 23, the birth anniversary of Chaudhary Charan Singh which will be celebrated as Kisan Diwas,” he said.“People ask me why we are releasing our manifesto so early for assembly elections. My answer is that this is to create pressure on other parties to make promises for masses, especially farmers,” he said.He later left for Bajna town of Mathura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rld-chief-promises-to-waive-off-pending-power-bills-of-farmers-101635342758141.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||In a first, two-day apple festival to be held in Kashmir||In a first, the Jammu and Kashmir government has organised a two-day apple festival on the banks of the Dal Lake to promote Kashmiri produce among buyers from different states. The festival, which starts Thursday at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre, will be inaugurated by lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha and Union minister for agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar. Horticulture director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat said, “During the festival, big buyers and entrepreneurs will come to Srinagar and will directly speak to growers and cold store owners. Growers from all districts have been invited for the festival. Our aim is to act as a bridge between growers, big buyers and companies. Several states are unaware of fruits produced in Kashmir and could be our future market.”There will also be a roundtable session between growers and traders. “Earlier, a carton of apples would fetch ₹200 to ₹300. Now, it fetches over ₹1,000. So, the involvement of big buyers will help fruit growers fetch a better price,” Bhat said. Ghulam Rasool Bhat, former president, fruit growers and dealers association, says interactions always help to build relationships between buyers and the sellers. “Similar festivals should be held at the mandis of apple producing districts.”However, some growers are sceptical. “Whenever new governments come, they organise new festivals, conferences and tours for the traders. On ground, the government must take several initiatives to promote the trade,” said Habibullah Bhat, a fruit dealer in North Kashmir. “Even today, our growers are using old technologies and are behind from their foreign counterparts. We still have a long way to go,” he said. As per official records, seven lakh farming families (approximately 35 lakh people) are directly or indirectly associated with the sector. The apple trade contributes to around 8% of the UT’s GDP and the government is trying to increase production by introducing high-density plantations. Officials attached with the high-density plantations say even if 25-30% of the existing orchards are replaced with high-density plantations, then the production of fruit can double or triple. Currently, Kashmir produces around 23 to 24 lakh metric tons of fruit. “There are many new measures underway that will increase apple production in the coming years, besides new varieties are being introduced that will fetch good money in the fruit markets across the country,” a senior horticulture officer said. During the last year, the Jammu and Kashmir government has added up 40,000 metric tons of storage, taking the cold storage capacity to 1.65 lakh metric tons. Another 35,000 metric tons of storage capacity is being built.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-a-first-two-day-apple-festival-to-be-held-in-kashmir-101635342218098.html

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Utility over, ‘pankhis’ fan memories of time gone by||As soon as the car began its slow ascent, my eyes fell upon a small shop under the flyover. A man sat outside the shop on a wooden bench, fanning himself with a colourful bamboo-leaf hand-fan, popularly known as ‘pankhi’. He was trying to ward off the heat on a humid August morning. Nostalgia hit me like a cannon ball as I recalled the varieties and designs of hand fans I had come across in my lifetime. The first variety that came to mind was the foldable bamboo leaf version, spread out in a full circle with polished bamboo handles that was a permanent feature in my mother’s handbag. I remember it was purchased from a small shop in the then highly recommended and a must-visit Lakkad Bazaar of Shimla. Later, she replaced it with one of those Japanese folding hand fans called Ogi, made of bamboo or wooden strips threaded together and held at the end with a rivet. These fans when spread out, boasted of a beautiful picture of a dainty Japanese girl in the traditional kimono. In Punjab, ‘pankhis’ formed a part and parcel of the cultural heritage. Colourful woollen or phulkari pankhis embellished with ghungroos and frills mounted on a metallic frame with wood carved and polished handles can be seen adorning the walls of a traditional ‘baithak’ in Punjabi households. Many families take pride in the handmade or hand woven ‘pankhis’ by the matriarchs of the family and cherish them as an heirloom. The ‘pankhis’ involve intricate patterns and display unique and delicate techniques adopted to highlight the exquisite workmanship of the village belle. So much so that these beautifully decorated ‘pankhis’ at one point of time used to be an indispensable part of a girl’s wedding trousseau. Over the years, the handmade woollen or embroidered ‘pankhis’ were replaced with the bamboo ‘pankhis’ made with interspersed bamboo leaves. Also, there was ‘foreign invasion’ of the Chinese and Japanese fans that carried the added advantage of being cheap and foldable. The Chinese fans were the stiff circular ones made by sticking paper on the leaf which was later painted in myriad colours. History tells us that in Japan, the warriors also known as Samurais used the foldable hand fan as a weapon and there are to this day schools in Japanese martial arts that give training in using these fans as a weapon against the enemy. Advancement in technology shunted out the handmade ‘pankhis’ with plastic ones that are readily available in countless colours and shapes. The onslaught of inverters in every household today has also played a pivotal role in relegating the ‘pankhis’ into oblivion. It has pushed the modest ‘pankhis’ either into the remotest corners of those trunks that are rarely opened or into a phase of being a vestigial entity that is no longer cared about. However, an impression still haunts many of us who have been witness to long hours of power cuts during sizzling afternoons and sweltering nights when the unpretentious ‘pankhis’ were not only an instrument of solace but also a means of community bonding; when men, women and children would come out of their houses to sit outside in circles, on stools or moorrhas with ‘pankhis’ in hand with many a tales to narrate, tales of wit and wisdom. sonrok15@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based college teacher||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/utility-over-pankhis-fan-memories-of-time-gone-by-101635339038097.html

27-10-2021||Lucknow||TGT Recruitment: Govt-aided schools in UP set to get 12,610 new teachers||Aspiring teachers, who had applied for the recruitment as trained graduate teachers (TGT) in government-aided secondary schools of the state, received good news in the run-up to the festival of Diwali. Their wait for a job is now over with Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Services Selection Board (UPSESSB), Prayagraj, declaring results of the TGT Recruitment-2021 for all 16 subjects late Tuesday night. With this, the teachers-starved 4,500 government-aided secondary schools of Uttar Pradesh will finally get 12,610 new teachers. Deputy secretary of UPSESSB Naval Kishore informed that the results of final selections of TGT Recruitment-2021 have been made available on the official website of UPSESSB— https://upsessb.pariksha.nic.in/. He said that the successful candidates have been given an opportunity till October 29 to fill their options for school allotments online. “The link for this has also been made available on the official website of UPSESSB,” he added. UPSESSB made it clear that in this recruitment differently abled candidates were provided 4% reservation as per norms. The Supreme Court had ordered UPSESSB to complete this recruitment process by October 31. The UPSESSB completed the entire recruitment process in less than a year by declaring the results of all 16 subjects, including Science, Hindi, Sanskrit, Home Science, Social Science, Mathematics, Art, English, Agriculture, Physical Education, Commerce, Sewing, Urdu, Music Instruments, Music Vocals and Biology. UPSESSB had conducted the TGT recruitment exam-2021 on August 7 and August 8. The total 12,610 posts of TGT (seven posts were added later) had attracted around 7.10 lakh applications. The UPSESSB had issued the online advertisement for these recruitment exams on March 15, 2021, and the last date of application was May 20, 2021. The amended advertisement for this recruitment exam was issued after a gap of four months. After cancelling the initial advertisement, owing to legal hurdles, UPSESSB also reduced 310 posts of TGT as compared to the first advertisement. Earlier, online applications for the 15,508 posts of TGT and PGT were invited by UPSESSB through an advertisement. These included 12,913 posts of TGT and 2,595 posts of PGT from October 29, 2020. However, the NIC website crashed for two days on November 13, 2020, due to the high number of candidates trying to apply. Later, on November 18, 2020, the UPSESSB cancelled the advertisement due to legal hurdles on the advice of its legal experts. With the declarations of TGT Recruitment Result-2021, now all eyes will be on UPSESSB to declare the final results of PGT Recruitment-2021, interviews for which are presently being conducted. This is for the first time that TGT and PGT recruitments for government-aided secondary schools are being held sans interviews, and solely based on the written exam. This has happened owing to the Central government doing away with the need for an interview round for recruitment to posts in certain categories, which also includes TGT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tgt-recruitment-govt-aided-schools-in-up-set-to-get-12-610-new-teachers-101635333218771.html
27-10-2021||Patna||‘Fewer infant deaths in Bihar than national average’||In a big leap, Bihar has reduced its infant mortality rate (IMR) to 29, less than the national average of 30, as per Sample Registration System (SRS), 2019, bulletin of the office of the Registrar General of India. In the last SRS report for 2018, Bihar’s IMR was equal to the national average of 32. However, the cause of concern is that the IMR among girls still remains significantly higher than boys in Bihar.This SRS bulletin presents the estimates of birth rate, death rate, IMR (all recorded per 1000 population) and natural growth rate for the year 2019 for India and its States/Union Territories. The SRS is a large-scale demographic survey conducted every year.In urban areas of Bihar, however, the IMR is 27, which is significantly higher than the national urban average of 20.In rural IMR though, Bihar has fared much better with an IMR of 29 against the national average of 34. The IMR in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (41), Madhya Pradesh (46) and Assam (40) is much higher. IMR is widely accepted as a crude indicator of the overall health scenario of a country or a region.Also, IMR data for Bihar shows it is higher in case of female at 33, against 26 for male. The same trend is seen in both rural and urban areas with higher IMR for female at 33 and 30, respectively.For the third most populous state, however, birth rate of 25.8 remains remarkably high, against the national average of 19.7. In rural areas of Bihar, the birth rate is even higher at 26.5, though it drops to 21.2 in urban areas. It is the highest in the country and followed by Uttar Pradesh (25.4).The death rate in Bihar is less than the national average both in rural and urban areas with an overall rate of 5.5 against the national average of six.Dr Vikash R. Keshri, public health expert, The George Institute for Global Health, India, said the latest SRS report indicates an encouraging trend in reduction in IMR in Bihar.“Over four years from 2015 to 2019, IMR for Bihar has declined by 13 points (42 to 29) as compared to 7-point reduction at the national level (from 37 to 30). This indicates the success of targeted public health intervention in the state. However, a wide gap in IMR for male and female, and high birth rate are points of concern which need immediate attention and policy action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/fewer-infant-deaths-in-bihar-than-national-average-101635333217371.html
27-10-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: Sarasbaug and Hirabaug remind us of visages of 18th century Pune||To an average outsider, Pune may seem to be a city of paradoxes and irony! A bridge called “Lakdi Pul” is not made up of wood; a god called “Khunya Murlidhar” or murderous Murlidhar but is an innocent-looking idol. A “Talyatla Ganpati” (Ganesha situated in a lake) but actually sits within a garden, today. And most confusing is the bustling peth area named as gardens such as Tulshibaug, Belbaug but not a plant in sight.All the above names referred to the quintessential Peshwa period Pune which was developed in the 18th century under the able vision of Peshwas such as Nanasaheb Peshwa. Today, the true nature of these places is lost under subsequent changes and alterations but the names have stayed and essence lingers through historical memories.Parvati lake was created near Pune city as an alternative to the Katraj lake which was the primary supply of water through the aqua ducts. Thus, the lake of approximately 25 square kilometres (550 yards into 220 yards) was built in the year 1751-52. An island of 25 square feet was kept at the centre of the lake which was subsequently developed into a striking garden. Tall trees were planted on the banks of the lake to create a natural ambience. With the availability of water, vegetation and food, a variety of birds flocked the lake making for a lively scene. Another garden, Lotanbaug was created to the west of the lake.Construction of the lake was an activity close to Nanasaheb’s heart. Legend informs us that once as Nanasaheb’s palanquin passed by the construction site, he was enraged by the apparent lax attitude of workers who were delaying the work indefinitely. In order to teach them a lesson by example, he got down the palanquin and personally started digging the grounds with a spade. Site workers were ashamed and assured him that work would complete within the promised duration.Ambil stream flew near the lake and arrangement was made such that excess water from Katraj aqua duct would drain in Ambil stream which in turn would drain into river Mutha. A small stone dam wall was built along the Parvati lake which would regulate the flow of water in the Ambil stream throughout the year. Thus, excess water coming to Parvati lake due to flooding of the Ambil stream was regulated, too. British gazetteer mentions that the Parvati lake was used to be full of lotus flowers. Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa later installed a Ganesha idol in an open temple on the island of Sarasbaug, naming it as Siddhi Vinayak in 1774. Saras cranes were brought to the garden to reside in the lake waters, by Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, thus, giving it the name “Sarasbaug”.During the Peshwa period, the lake provided a great spot for boating aka “Nauka vihar”. Many important strategies were discussed between Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, Mahadji Shinde and Nana Phadnavis while they took the boat ride around Parvati lake.Today, this Siddhi Vinayak at Sarasbaug is a popular destination and place of worship flocked by Punekars. It is known by various names such as “Sarasbaug Ganpati”, “Talyatlya Ganpati” and so on. The original temple was built in the Maratha style of architecture, but it has been renovated later in 1969. The idol of Ganesh was replaced three times to date due to damage caused by ageing, in 1882 and 1990.The lake suffered heavy neglect during colonial times and most of the land except the island was handed over by the British to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for repairs. In order to reduce the maintenance cost and prevent epidemics due to mosquitoes, the corporation filled the lake with debris to make way for an extended garden.Today, the temple houses a fascinating exhibition of a number of Ganesh sculptures and is surrounded by lawns and gardens. Shri Devdeveshwar Sansthan Trust, who is in charge of managing various temples of the Peshwa period, oversees the temple maintenance and management.Similar such garden exists near Tilak road today, called Hirabaug, situated next to Sarasbaug Ganesh temple, as we travel from Bajirao road to Parvati hill.Some anecdotes inform us that Mastani might have been put under house arrest at Hirabaug by Chimaji Appa, Bajirao’s younger brother, but in all likelihood, it may not be true.The picturesque garden is called Hirabaug and the bungalow or Peshwai wada within was mostly, commissioned by Nanasaheb Peshwa in 1753. Contemporary British records mention it by the names” Pleasure house” or “Diamond palace’. The palace faced east direction and was equipped with a fountain, paved courtyard and the view of Parvati lake. A “Khajina buruj” (water tower) was erected to source water for the fountain and water was fed to the tower using a Persian wheel.The first mention of the Hirabaug bungalow is seen with reference to a feast arranged for fulfilling the vows to Brahmins by Nanasaheb Peshwa. The venue was utilised yet again for the wedding feast during Madhavrao Peshwa I’s marriage ceremony.The bungalow and the garden suffered substantial damage due to fire during Nizam’s attack on Pune in 1763. Later, the elder Madhavrao Peshwa resurrected the garden by ordering fresh plantations. Nana Phadnavis the able minister under Madhvrao Peshwa, then personally issued orders to remove the debris, repair and rebuild the bungalow at Hirabaug in 1764.Young Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa is known to practise his hobby of rearing the silk moths in the gardens of Hirabaug for a while as per his personal diaries. It was frequently used as a lodging for guests of Peshwas as seen during Sawai Madhavrao’s elaborate wedding festivities. Nizam of Hyderabad was housed in Hirabaug and treated with characteristic Peshwai feasts in gold and silver dining sets. Peshwa records are filled with the description of extravagant affluence that was seen and celebrated in Hirabaug on multiple occasions.The British guests were hosted at Hirabaug after the famous Vasai treaty of 1803 who describe the Hirabaug and Parvati lake surroundings in great detail. It indeed served as a royal pleasure house for important occasions.After the fall of the Maratha empire in 1818, the Hirabaug came under the possession of the British government, but it was then occupied by a Parsi individual named Sorabjishet Rustamji who occupied it till 1865. Later the property exchanged many hands to finally be purchased by Rajaram Bhau Mhaske and Mahadev Kunte in 1866 at the cost of ₹15,050. The property was bought to establish “The Hirabaug town hall committee” in 1877. Mahadeo Govind Ranade was instrumental in raising the contribution to buy the property for the establishment of the “Hirabaug town hall committee”. The committee was to be used as a public platform to host lectures, discussions and debates and the garden was to be used for the purpose of a sports club. Later, in the year 1891, the Deccan club was established at Hirabaug.The purpose of public recreation and leisure continued through various regimes from Peshwas to British to present-day administrators as both the gardens became more public friendly. Though, both Sarasbaug and Hirabaug may not retain their original forms they continue to remind us of the gorgeous visages of what 18th century Pune once was!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-sarasbaug-and-hirabaug-remind-us-of-visages-of-18th-century-pune-101635332137699.html

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress chief Sidhu calls Capt Amarinder ‘spent cartridge’||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu said on Wednesday that former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh will be remembered as Jaichand, an archetypal traitor in mythology, of Punjab’s political history. Also read: Farmers’ protest: Punjab ex-CM Capt Amarinder to meet Amit Shah tomorrowCalling him “truly a spent cartridge”, Sidhu alleged that Capt Amarinder was an arm-twisted, Enforcement Directorate-controlled loyal chief minister of Punjab who sold the interest of the state to save his skin. “You were the negative force stalling, justice and development of Punjab,” he alleged in a series of scathing tweets. Sidhu mounted the scathing attack on the micro-blogging site while the former chief minister was addressing a press conference in Chandigarh. The two have had a long-running tussle that saw Sidhu resign from Amarinder Singh’s ministry in July 2019, but he made a comeback as the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief exactly two years later despite the Capt’s objections. Last month, Capt Amarinder Singh was made to resign from the CM’s post following continued opposition by Sidhu and rebellion of several ministers and MLAs. He has now announced that he will float his own political outfit and is hopeful of a seat arrangement with the BJP. Sidhu accuses Capt of colluding with Badals, BJP Sidhu said that a three-member committee was formed (by the Congress high command) to make Capt Amarinder Singh accountable. “Why were MLAs against you? Because everyone knew you have collided with Badals! All you want is to defeat me, have you ever wanted Punjab to win? Your 75/25 dealings with Badals and BJP are crystal clear (sic),” he claimed. Sidhu asked if he (Capt Amarinder Singh) was unceremoniously dumped for good governance and the 18-point agenda was handed “to the poorest performing CM of Punjab”. Taking a dig at the two-time former CM’s political moves, Sidhu tweeted: “Last time you formed your own party, you lost your ballot, garnering only 856 votes… People of Punjab are again waiting to punish you for compromising on the interests of Punjab!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-chief-sidhu-calls-capt-amarinder-spent-cartridge-101635330277152.html

Four police stations in Mumbai have received complaints against the top NCB official.The pivot of the October 2 cruise drugs case has shifted from Aryan Khan to Sameer Wankhede. Prabhakar Sail, a key witness in the case, has levelled allegations of corruption against Wankhede.Also Read| Key witness in Mumbai cruise ship drugs raid case appears before Crime BranchIn an affidavit filed before a local Mumbai court on Sunday, Sail claimed he heard private KP Gosavi -- who reportedly accompanied the NCB team during the raid on the cruise ship off Mumbai coast on October 2 -- speak about a pay-off of ₹8 crore to Sameer Wankhede in the drugs raid case. The top NCB officer, however, denied the allegations.Sail also claimed to have overheard Gosavi and one Sam D'Souza trying to settle the cruise ship drugs seizure case allegedly for ₹18 crore.Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik has levelled several other charges against Wankhede, including use of a fake caste certificate to get a government job under a reserved quota.The minister also said that he received a letter from an unnamed NCB official which stated that Wankhede framed innocent people in 26 fake drug cases. Malik said he has forwarded the letter to NCB's director-general SN Pradhan. However, the anti-narcotics cell has refused to probe the anonymous letter.In a fresh attack on Wednesday, the Maharashtra minority minister tweeted a copy of Sameer Wankhede's 'Nikah Nama' or marriage certificate and the top NCB official's photograph with his first wife, Shabana Qureshi.“On Thursday 7th December 2006 at 8 pm, a Nikah was performed between Sameer Dawood Wankhede and Sabana Qureshi at LokhandWala complex, Andheri (west) Mumbai,” Malik tweeted.Also Read| Aryan Khan case: Nawab Malik posts photos of Sameer Wankhede’s ‘nikah’"Meher amount was ₹33,000.

Wankhede also said that he is being targeted and is ready for a probe into the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-drugs-case-police-appoint-officer-to-probe-allegations-against-wankhede-101635314094418.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||16 houses gutted in fire in remote Malana village of Himachal||At least 16 houses were destroyed and three partially damaged when a fire broke out in the remote village of Malana in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh late on Tuesday. Village pradhan Raju Ram said one person was injured while putting out the blaze, which started in an old wooden structure and spread fast to adjoining houses due to windy conditions. Soon after the Kullu district administration was informed, a team of firefighters was rushed to the village that lacks road connectivity. “Villagers struggled to control the fire. It took us hours but we managed by early in the morning,” said Roop Lal, a resident of Dharaberh in Malana panchayat. “The fire has been brought under control,” said State Disaster Management Authority director Sudesh Mokta. Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg said firefighters left from Kullu around 1.30am, but since the village was inaccessible by the road, firefighting equipment was sent to the village through ropeway and firefighting teams trekked for an hour to reach the village at midnight. “Water for dousing the fire was brought from local perennial sources, but the fire spread from one wooden structure to another due to the wind,” said sub-divisional magistrate Vikas Shukla and superintendent of police Gurudev Sharma. Teams have been sent to the village with relief material for the affected families. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. At least half of Malana village, including the temple of the presiding deity, Jamdagni Rishi or Jamlu Devta, was reduced to ashes in a fire in January 2008 Union Home Minister Amit Shah, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and BJP national president Jagat Parkash Nadda also expressed grief over the fire tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dozen-houses-gutted-in-fire-in-remote-malana-village-of-himachal-101635317975945.html

The neighbouring Gurugram will also observe a cracker-free festival of light while the Rajasthan government, too, has banned their sale and use from October 1.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court said that under the guise of green crackers, banned articles are being used by firecracker manufacturers and reiterated that its earlier order banning joint crackers must be complied with by every state.“Our order must be complied with. It is not the question whether one content or the other. It is being sold openly in the market and used by people. We would like to know if a ban is there, how come they are available in markets," the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/only-green-crackers-permitted-in-bengal-for-2-hours-during-diwali-101635314113691.html

Earlier this week, the former chief minister told reporters that he will go to Munger and Darbhanga on October 27 to campaign for the RJD in the October 30 by-elections.According to party functionaries familiar with the matter, Lalu Prasad Yadav will be addressing one meeting each in both the assembly constituencies. Earlier this week, Yadav said that he will ensure the “visarjan” of chief minister Nitish Kumar and the ruling NDA in the state.Also Read | He can get me shot, can’t do anything else: Nitish on Lalu’s ‘visarjan’ claimCampaigning for the two seats of Tarapur and Kusheshwarasthan will come to an end on October 28 evening. Congress has also fielded candidates for the two seats after RJD announced its decision to contest the two seats, creating a rift between the two parties which were allies in the state but later separated from the Mahaghatbandhan (Grand Alliance).Meanwhile, the ruling NDA as well as the Congress have claimed that Lalu Prasad's re-entry into the Bihar political scene will make hardly any difference. “When Lalu Prasad will go to these places, people will definitely ask why he ditched Congress. He should mention that whenever he tried to play games with the Congress, he had fallen flat,” said Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore.The NDA camp is also stepping up its campaigning game ahead of the upcoming by-polls. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Union minister Pashupati Paras have already joined the electioneering from Monday. Reacting to Lalu Prasad's “visarjan” remark, Nitish Kumar said that Yadav can get him shot but nothing more than that.BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel, speaking on Lalu Prasad's attempts to gain favour for the RJD, said that the campaign was not going to make an impact this time.“The GA is disintegrated. When they fought the last election together, both the seats were won by the NDA,” said the BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-prasad-in-bihar-after-3-years-to-campaign-for-rjd-in-bypolls-101635297435205.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Five arrested over sextortion racket, targeted 40 men||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they have busted a gang of extortionists led by a 42-year-old woman, who was previously convicted in a criminal conspiracy case, and arrested her and four of her associates for allegedly extorting money from men after threatening to frame them in bogus rape cases.The alleged accused befriended the victims through an online dating application and lured them to a house, where they drugged the man and clicked his objectionable photographs and videos with women in the gang. Police said the gang hatched elaborate plays to hoodwink victims and each gang member had specific roles.“We have recovered some police file covers, extorted money and other articles from the arrested persons. The gang members have confessed to extorting valuables from nearly 40 men in the past couple of years. We have recovered a diary containing details of 34 victims and their self written statement admitting guilt and a signed compromise agreement. All of them will be contacted during the probe,” said an investigator, who asked not to be named.On October 23, a businessman dealing in timbers in Dabri filed a complaint alleging that around a month ago, he received a call from a woman named Pooja, who wanted to purchase a ply board. On October 21, he was in Janakpuri area when the woman called him on WhatsApp and met him after five minutes.“She lured him to a house and gave a glass of water to drink. He fell unconscious after that and when he came to, the businessman found himself on a bed naked. Six women and three men present there assaulted him and robbed him of ₹15,700, his wristwatch and gold ring. They threatened to kill him if he did not pay them ₹7 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary, adding that a case of extortion and threat was registered on the man’s complaint.During investigation, the police collected information about the gang and learnt that the crime was masterminded by Shivani alias Sonu Suri, who was convicted in a criminal conspiracy case in which she had used a woman to file a bogus rape case against a man.The police arrested Suri and her four associates, identified as Revti Devi (33) and her husband Vaibhav (37), both residents of Jeewan Park; Sheetal Arora alias Pooja (40), a resident of Burari; and Harbinder Singh (60), a resident of Tagore Garden.Suri’s interrogation, the DCP said, revealed that she used to get mobile numbers of targets using an online dating application. She used to provide their mobile numbers to Arora, who then invited the targeted person to the residence of Revti. “They extorted money from the victim on the pretext of filing a false rape charge,” said Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-five-arrested-over-sextortion-racket-targeted-40-men-101635298315018.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board to do away with intermediaries||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) approved a slew of measures during its board meeting on Tuesday and said it plans to set up zonal and ward level committees, with the representation of civil society members, to improve its grievance redressal mechanism.DJB chairman Satyendar Jain said the board has also decided that all the household water connections will now be provided by DJB itself and intermediaries will be removed from the process. A proposal to this effect was cleared by the board on Tuesday.Jain said the water utility will provide household connections to consumers and that will include laying of pipelines and installation of meters on the consumer premises. Jain said while the DJB maintains over 13,000km of water pipeline network, the connection from the DJB pipeline to individual households is currently the responsibility of consumers.“This policy approval will help in resolving complaints of water contamination and reduce unauthorised connections. In several cases, it was observed that damaged pipelines and leakage from pipe joints resulted in water contamination, but these faults could not be resolved by the DJB as they were beyond its purview,” he said.For getting new meter connections, the board has approved a charge of ₹4,000 for colonies in categories A, B and C; ₹2,000 for categories D and E; and ₹1,000 for categories F, G and H, and villages.DJB has approved the constitution of the water and sewerage committee at the ward and zonal level and these will comprise both civil society representatives and DJB officials. The ward level committee will have seven members while the zonal committee will have 12.DJB vice-chairmain Raghav Chadha said the civil society representative will be chairperson of the ward level committee while the constituency MLA will chair the zonal committee.The water utility has also simplified the financial assistance scheme provided for installing rainwater harvesting systems in houses. “For residential houses having an area of less than 500 square metres, a financial assistance of ₹25,000 will be provided, and for residential houses having an area of 500 square metres and above, an assistance of ₹50,000 will be provided,” DJB said in a statement.The board also approved a project for installing a 20MGD RO (reverse osmosis) plant at Okhla water treatment plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-to-do-away-with-intermediaries-101635297891979.html

It is also expected to reconsider the ban imposed on Chhath Puja celebrations at public places.The Chhath Puja celebrations were banned by the DDMA in public, including at Yamuna riverbanks, water bodies and temples in Delhi, after a meeting on September 30. But since then, the Covid-19 situation has improved a lot in the national capital and demands have been made by various groups and political parties to allow Chhath Puja to be celebrated.It is a major festival celebrated by those in East Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (Purvanchali community). The community has sizeable number in the national capital and are concentrated mostly in East Delhi.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Delhi, including party MP Manoj Tiwari, had attacked the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government over the ban and asked it to send a proposal to the DDMA for allowing the celebration of the festival at public places in Delhi.Also Read | Drive to vaccinate over 10,000 devotees before Chhath Puja launched in DelhiTiwari, who is the BJP's Purvanchal face in the national capital, has been advocating for allowing public celebrations for Chhath Puja in Delhi ever since DDMA put a ban on it while allowing Dussehra, Ramlila and Durga Puja celebrations in the city.In the backdrop of protests by the BJP and Congress against the Chhath Puja ban, Kejriwal had earlier this month urged Lt Governor Anil Baijal to call a meeting of the DDMA as soon as possible to allow celebrations in public, saying the Covid situation in Delhi was under control.Baijal then directed the chief secretary to convene a meeting of the DDMA to discuss the issue.Chhath is celebrated after Diwali by people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh and the ritual involves the offering of 'Arghya' by fasting women to the Sun god in knee-deep water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-meeting-today-will-reconsider-ban-on-chhath-puja-celebrations-in-delhi-101635293002197.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A young man’s evening||It’s late October. That explains the nip in the air. But is it so chilly that Shambhu Yadav has to wrap himself in a blanket? The young man is perched on the pavement, outside a five-star hotel in Delhi’s diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri. It is late evening, and already dark. He is sitting behind a kerosene stove. Rice is on the boil.“I’m making dinner for us all,” he says. Mr Yadav is among a troupe of labourers charged with laying underground cables in the vicinity for a telecom company.He attributes the blanket to fever: “I’m shivery.” His colleagues have asked him to rest, and to check on the rice rather than exerting himself in strenuous physical activity. They themselves are fiddling around with hefty loops of red and yellow cables, dragging them along the roadside.“I’ve been having light fever for the past few days,” Mr Yadav says gloomily. Some onions and tomatoes are lying on a tiny chopping board beside him. He is supposed to slice them to garnish the dal that’s already been prepared. But right now he is choosing to stay still. “I feel…,” he doesn’t finish his sentence.At 20, Mr Yadav is already talking like a man who has been disillusioned by the world. “Mann bhar gaya hain,” he mutters, explaining his disillusionment with the course of his life. “I came to Delhi eight-nine years ago, and have been a labourer since then.” He says that the extreme poverty of his family back home in the village in Gaya, Bihar, prevented him from attending school. “There was no money for my education.”In the night, it will certainly get cold, but Mr Yadav will not have a restful slumber in a warm cozy bedroom, protected from the elements by tightly locked windows and doors. “I don’t have a kamra (room) in Delhi…. we sleep where we work.” Tonight, he says, he and his team will stay right here on this pavement, across the road from the high-security British embassy. They have a truck into which they might retire to sleep.“But my fever is light… it will be over soon, and then I’ll feel better,” he remarks, resting his chin on his knees, as the steam from the bubbling rice pot partially hides his face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-young-man-s-evening-101635292698642.html

He asked the cadre to further intensify their mass contact, fan out in their areas and generate awareness among the people against divisive agenda of disruptive forces, which are exploiting the sentiments of the people on the basis of religion and region. “There is no threat to any religion and if there is a danger to anything at all, it is the politics of hate, which has been serving as a shield to communal elements,” he said and added that the politics of mistrust and suspicion will take a toll on the nation. He said that attempts of dividing the people of J&K were not new.

A large number of people converged at Maharaja Hari Singh Park to pay their respects to the visionary ruler. J&K BJP led by its president Ravinder Raina and other senior leaders also celebrated the historic day and were joined by Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh. Raina reacted to PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s statement supporting those who celebrated Pakistan’s T20 victory against India in Srinagar. “She has a Talibani ideology. Anyone who celebrated Pakistan’s recent win over India in a T20 World Cup match would be jailed for conspiring against the country,” he said. “Some leaders need security cover and are protected round-the-clock by our forces but their hearts beat for Pakistan. Mehbooba is of Talibani ideology and she is answerable to the people for supporting an enemy nation which is pushing armed terrorists, conspiring against us and bleeding J&K. She has committed a grave sin,” he said. Centre for Ladakh and Jammu Kashmir Studies also celebrated the 75th Accession Day at University of Jammu. The J&K High Court Bar Association under the leadership of its Jammu president MK Bhardwaj also celebrated the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/politics-of-hate-is-shielding-communal-elements-farooq-101635287717728.html

The number of civilian and security personnel killings has come down since 2014 till this year as compared to those between 2004 and 2014.”Shah said that incidents of stone pelting have also decreased drastically and added that the Modi government has zero tolerance towards terrorism. “Our priority should be to save people of Kashmir from terrorism,” he said. During his three-day visit to J&K, the home minister, besides reviewing the security situation, addressed a public rally and members of youth club and panchayat representatives, along with visiting the border in Jammu. He also inaugurated several development projects and a houseboat festival in Srinagar. This was the first visit of the home minister to J&K post-revocation of Article 370 and bifurcation of J&K state into two UTs.

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal: Remote Kangra village to get gift of light this Diwali||Hidden away deep in the majestic Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas, the remote Bara Bhangal village of Kangra district would light up with solar power this Diwali after years of darkness. The Himurja, in collaboration with KL Solar Company, will install 168 solar panels in the secluded twin hamlets of Ghraan and Phaal that constitute the Bara Bhangal. Residents of Bara Banghal, a nearly inaccessible valley, were living in the dark and struggling to get the electricity for long, submitting representations to the successive governments regarding their demand. In absence of electricity, they used ‘jugnus’ (wooden sticks put on fire) or kerosene lamps to work at night. The only 40KW hydropower project commissioned in 2004 was lying defunct for over a decade for want of repair. Even as the state electricity board was exploring the possibilities to restore the power project, the government found solar power system the best option to light up the village. Kangra deputy commissioner Nipun Jindal said the solar panels were airlifted to the village on Monday while investors have already been transported on mules. “This is an off-grid solar system with each panel having a capacity of 250KW with a battery backup,” said Jindal. The battery comes with a five-year warranty. The power produced by one panel would be enough to light up four tubes and a TV, besides phones can also be charged. About three months ago, the DC said, the government had announced to set up solar power system in the village. This Independence Day, Baijanth subdivisional magistrate Saleem Azam had also visited the village and promised to install the system before winters. Since then, the district authorities were making efforts to set up the solar power system. Bara Banghal, located at 2,575 metre above the mean sea level, is so isolated that one has to undertake a 70km arduous trek from Bir village crossing over 4,665m high Thamsar Pass to reach the area. It takes two to three days to reach Bara Banghal on foot. Two more treks, one from Holi-Nayagran in Chamba and other one from Manali, are equally long and gruelling. The Holi-Nayagran trek that runs parallel to the Ravi is the most dangerous. The trek from Manali involves an arduous hike over 4,800m high Kalihani pass. Bara Bhangal has a population of about 700, most of whom are shepherds who migrate to Bir village in winters. However, elderly residents who cannot trek across the mountains stay back in the village during winters. The narrow valley also serves as grazing pastures for sheep of Gaddi tribe of Chamba and Kangra. The district administration stocks food grains for these villages in month of September before snow blocks the passages. The village was in news in 2018 after villagers ran out of food stock after the mule trek, the only supply route, to the village got destroyed by multiple landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-remote-kangra-village-to-get-gift-of-light-this-diwali-101635284957603.html

Kanda has been fielded against Indian National Lok Dal’s Abhay Singh Chautala and Congress’ Pawan Beniwal in the Ellenabad bypoll. At a gathering in Randhawa village, Haryana CM Khattar hit out at INLD nominee Abhay Singh Chautala for resigning from the state assembly.“ The people of Ellenabad have the golden opportunity to elect the BJP nominee as it will usher in all-round development of the area. The people of Ellenabad have been struggling to get basic necessities for the last 17 years. The Congress has been trying to come into the limelight by provoking farmers against the three farm laws. Our government has been procuring crops on minimum support price and there is no question of mandis being shut down,” he said.The deputy chief minister held different programmes and a road show in the constituency where he faced protests from farmers who raised black flags in protest. In a direct attack on his estranged uncle Abhay Chautala, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term from Ellenabad, Dushyant said he (Abhay) had resigned from the state assembly amid farmers’ protest to gain political mileage.“ He (Abhay) claimed that he will not enter the Vidhan Sabha until three farm laws are repealed.

The protesters blocked entry to the secretariat by parking tractor-trolleys and locking the gates. BKU senior vice-president Jhanda Singh Jethuke said the rural economy of the cotton-growing belt was hit after the pest attack this season.The union is demanding financial assistance of ₹60,000 for farmers and ₹30,000 per family of farm labourers engaged in the cotton harvest.Deputy commissioner Arvind Pal Sandhu said the administration was in constant touch with protesting farmer leaders to end the agitation.“The entire matter is in the knowledge of the higher authorities and it will be resolved at the state government level,” said the DC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-press-for-cotton-crop-relief-block-bathinda-district-administrative-complex-101635280458342.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||End of the road for Justice Girish Agnihotri as his name removed from list of Punjab and Haryana HC judges||The Punjab and Haryana high court administration on Tuesday removed the name of justice Girish Agnihotri from the list of judges of the high court. His name also does not figure in the fresh roster released on Tuesday evening for the coming days. Justice Agnihotri’s tenure as an additional judge came to an end on October 25, but the notification on either the extension of his tenure as an additional judge or appointment as a permanent judge has not come, it is learnt. The high court administration has not come out with any official statement so far. “He ought to have been administered oath along with those who were appointed as a permanent judge on Monday. Now even those appointed after him have administered the oath of office,” a senior functionary said, hinting at the end of his tenure as a judge. Many said the move was unprecedented as in recent history no such name could be cited by even veteran lawyers, who was not made permanent after appointment as an additional judge. The son of a former high court judge, MR Agnihotri (retired), justice Girish Agnihotri took oath as an additional judge on October 26, 2019. His name did not find favour with either the apex court or the Central government even on an earlier occasion in 2013. However, he was recommended again in January 2019 and appointed as an additional judge in October 2019. Designated as a senior advocate in 2007, prior to his elevation, he mainly dealt with service and constitutional matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/end-of-the-road-for-justice-girish-agnihotri-as-his-name-removed-from-list-of-punjab-and-haryana-hcjudges-101635280037224.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s sex ratio at birth touches 5-year low, shows data||Haryana has registered an alarming dip in the sex ratio at birth as per the data collated between January and September. The figures recorded are the lowest since 2016. Officials say 906 girls were born per 1,000 boys this year till September. This is the first time that the sex ratio at birth (SRB) has dropped by nine points after the launch of the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme in 2015. The cumulative SRB up to September 2015 was 868 and it rose to 911 in 2016-17 during the first nine months. In 2018, the SRB came down to 909 (Jan-Sept cycle) and rose to 919 in first nine months of 2019. The cumulative SRB of Haryana in September last year was 915. The dip in the SRB, considered to be a critical indicator of gender equality, has set the alarm bells ringing in the state government, which has swung into action to keep the flagship programme firmly on track. Officials monitoring the programme say a series of meetings were held last week, after the SRB data was finalised, and instructions were issued to the concerned authorities to intensify surveillance and catch touts involved in gender determination to arrest this slide. Additional principal secretary to the chief minister Dr Amit Kumar Agrawal says the latest dip “is a matter of grave concern.” He said one of the primary reasons for the dip could be “variation in data.” The first signs of touts outwitting the government machinery and carrying out gender determination had emerged when the cumulative SRB till June 2021 had dipped to 911, from 920 in the corresponding period till June 2020. “The issue is linked to Haryana’s reputation. Necessary directions have been issued to the concerned authorities to take strict action. Those violating the law and opting for illegal gender determination tests will not be spared,” Dr Agrawal said. Rohtak leads, Sonepat lagging Rohtak led the state with an SRB of 955, followed by Charkhi Dadri 937, Panipat 930, Nuh 922, Jind and Sirsa 919 each, Hisar 916, Panchkula 910, Kurukshetra 909, Mahendergarh 905, Yamunanagar 902, and Gurugram 901. While the SRB of seven districts was between 916 and 955, the SRB of five districts ranged between 901 and 910. The SRB of 10 districts of 22 districts slipped below 900 against five districts during the same period last year. There was a difference of 21,355 births (10,267 male and 11,088 female) registered till September this year as compared to the corresponding period last year. The total births registered till September last year were 3,86,748 (2,01,929 male, 1,84,819 female) against 3,65,393 (1,91,662 male, 1,73,731 female) this year during the same period. The worst-performing 10 districts with the SRB hovering between 880 and 899 in the first nine months of 2021 are Palwal (899), Kaithal and Bhiwani (897), Karnal and Faridabad (896), Rewari (892), Ambala (891), Fatehabad (882), Jhajjar and Sonepat (880). Dr Agarwal said that he has already held meetings to sensitise the departments involved in this programme. “I have personally spoken to deputy commissioners of the districts where this dip in the SRB has been registered,” Dr Agarwal said. He urged the doctors of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to not shield those violating the PNDT (Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act and the MTP (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) Act. Dip in annual SRB likely Haryana had registered 922 female births per 1,000 males in 2020 despite the Covid pandemic posing challenges. The annual SRB was 923 in 2019, the highest Haryana had recorded in at least a decade. From 833 in 2011, the annual SRB of the state had improved to 876 in 2015. It rose to 900 in 2016 and after remaining static at 914 in 2017 and 2018, it jumped to 923 in 2019. “The latest SRB figures are disappointing. We may barely hit 915-916 annual SRB this year. This is a wake up call because districts such as Sonepat that were earlier performing well are slipping. We must fix the gaps fast. There are multiple factors behind this slide,” said a key expert involved in the programme, cautioning that it will be wrong to blame Covid pandemic for this dip in the SRB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-sex-ratio-at-birth-touches-5-year-low-shows-data-101635279796867.html
27-10-2021||Dehradun||Harak Singh meets BJP’s Madan Kaushik amid speculation of his next move||Dehradun:  Uttarakhand minister Harak Singh Rawat on Tuesday met BJP state president Madan Kaushik at his Dehradun residence amid speculation that the minister is considering an offer to return to the Congress, the party he quit in 2017 to join the Bharatiya Janata Party.The development comes two days after an “ice breaker” telephonic conversation between Harak Singh Rawat and Congress national general secretary Harish Rawat, the former chief minister who was seen to be against Harak Singh Rawats’ return to the Congress. Harish Rawat’s condition that former Congress leaders who want to return to the party must give a public apology was seen in the context of speculation around Harak Singh Rawat’s return.After their telephonic conversation on Sunday, Harish Rawat toned down the rhetoric, saying “in disasters even animals come together then why not two brothers.” He was reciprocating Harak Singh Rawat’s gesture who had earlier in the day referred to him as his “elder brother” and told reporters his “place is always at his (Harish Rawat) feet.”The conciliatory tone of the rivals - Harak Singh Rawat’s exit from the Congress had hugely contributed to the collapse of Harish Rawat’s government in 2017 - had triggered concerns in the Uttarakhand BJP that there was a distinct possibility that Harak Singh Rawat could head back to the Congress. This, if he happens, would be the second setback to the party in the hill state that is due to go to the polls next year.“The leadership is definitely tensed with the development. It is wary of the fact that if Harak Singh decides to return to the BJP then it would be another big blow to it as he is a seven-time MLA and a very influential figure in state politics,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.Harak Singh is considered to have played a key role in the rebellion of nine Congress MLAs in 2016 who switched to the BJP.The BJP leader cited above said, “Tuesday’s meeting with Kaushik is clearly an effort by the BJP state leadership to try to stop him from leaving the party amid speculation on the same.”Meanwhile, a Congress leader claimed that Harak Singh was likely “to join the Congress after Diwali”.“Now after a truce has been called between him and Harish Rawat, the path to his return to party seems to be clear. He is likely to join the party after Diwali or November 9,” he said.Harish Rawat fuelled speculation about BJP leaders quitting the party on Tuesday.“We welcome BJP leaders who want to come to Congress as there is an instability in the BJP,” he said on Tuesday.“We welcome any BJP leader who wants to come here. But having said that, it won’t be possible to accommodate all as we have to protect the rights of our own workers and leaders who have been fighting the BJP in all these years during its rule,” said Rawat.BJP state president Kaushik countered speculation that Harak Singh could join the Congress. “We had a meeting to discuss the upcoming polls as he is one of our senior leaders,” said Kaushik while refusing to reveal any more details on the meeting. Harak Singh couldn’t be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/harak-singh-meets-bjp-s-madan-kaushik-amid-speculation-of-his-exit-from-party-101635279557079.html

After SCD Government College and Government College for Girls, Ludhiana, this is the third government college in the city. The new government college has a two-storey building. The city’s new college building has been constructed on GLADA’s five-acre land. Around ₹15 crore has been spent on the construction of the building.The admission process for the Government College East was started in August 2018. Initially, the classes for BA were started at a community centre but later shifted to SCD Government College, Ludhiana. The students of the first batch of BA have already completed their degree as the building construction work was delayed.Talwar said that Government College East has come after the country’s independence and it is a co-educational institute. The other two government colleges were inaugurated during the British rule. BA course classes have been started from the college premises. In the next session the courses of B.Com, BBA, BCA and BSc (medical and non-medical) would be introduced.Stone laid for sub-stationMLA Talwar also laid foundation stone of a 66 KV sub-station at Tibba road on Tuesday.

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court dismisses Akali leader’s plea for stay on conviction ahead of polls||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed the plea of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Yadwinder Singh Yadu seeking a stay on conviction in a 2002 criminal case, to contest the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab.The high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia and justice Sant Parkash observed that a representative of the people should be a man of a clear antecedent, but to the contrary, there were 14 criminal cases registered against him, out of which he is undertrial in two cases. “The registration of criminal cases against the applicant shows his character, antecedents and mental propensity. Though he has been acquitted in most of the cases, the registration of so many cases would lead to an irresistible and unerring conclusion that he is certainly not entitled to the relief claimed,” the bench said, adding that it apprehends that if the order of conviction is stayed, there is every possibility and likelihood that he may indulge in similar activities and may cause obstructions in the coming elections.He was convicted in November 2016 in an FIR registered on July 30, 2002, at the Khanna police station in Ludhiana. He was convicted along with some co-accused to undergo three years of imprisonment on November 18, 2016. A convict of three and more years is barred from contesting polls. The FIR primarily was of causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon among other offences.He had moved an application for a stay on the conviction that he wanted to contest assembly polls from the Khanna constituency and due to the conviction of three years awarded to him, he would not be able to contest the same.The court observed that relief against conviction could not be claimed as a right before the court of law and it had to stay the conviction in a judicious manner after considering the facts and circumstances of the cases.As such, discretion had always to be exercised by courts judiciously and not according to whim, caprice and there was no exceptional circumstance to exercise discretionary power in the case in hand, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-dismisses-akali-leader-s-plea-for-stay-on-conviction-ahead-of-polls-101635278656725.html
27-10-2021||Other||Progressive Punjab Investors Summit: Punjab CM assures industry of conducive ecosystem||Chandigarh Assuring Captains of industry of providing conducive ecosystem for investment in Punjab, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday reiterated his government’s firm commitment to act a true facilitator showing zero tolerance for political or bureaucratic corruption, negative attitude, delays and inertia. Delivering his keynote address on the plenary session of 4th Progressive Punjab Investors Summit 2021 at the Indian School of Business, Mohali, Channi said the state would live up to their expectations as Punjab is the best place to do business in India. He expressed his gratitude to all visionaries who joined in, virtually, on the first day of two-day summit for their valuable suggestions. Their inputs would help the state government to further fine tune the existing industrial policy by incorporating some requisite amendments to make it far more investor friendly, he added. “You have the capital, you have the risk-taking capacity and you have business ideas. I have the will, I have the intent and I have the commitment. I give my commitment to you all today that our government will work with you at every step to see that nothing from the government hinders your speed or create hurdles in your business plans,” he told the industrialists, inviting them to team up with the state government to work towards mutual growth and progress. The CM added that he wanted to improve the state’s ranking from top 10 to top 5 states in the country in terms of attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). He said the state has developed a land bank of 6,000 acre with Plug and Play facilities and created an efficient skill development ecosystem with active participation of industry. In his address, state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal lauded the immense contribution of stalwarts of industry in scripting the new chapter of industrialisation in the state, as Punjab has already reached a point of saturation in agriculture and providing a boost to the industry is the need of the hour. In his welcome address, industries and commerce minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli said this summit would go a long way in boosting the confidence of prospective industrialists and investors to further propel Punjab as the most preferred destination. Chief secretary Anirudh Tewari and principal secretary, industries and commerce, Tejveer Singh also spoke on the occasion. HUL chairman and managing director Sanjiv Mehta announced an investment of ₹1,200 crore and Amity University chancellor Dr Atul Chauhan announced an investment of ₹300 crore in next two years in the higher education sector. Apart from this, Mahindra Group chairman Anand G Mahindra also announced to set up its third tractor factory in the state shortly, besides setting up a hotel project near Pathankot. Ludhiana to host state session of summit todayOn Wednesday, the show will move on to Ludhiana, where Channi will introduce the Punjab Industrial Policy to new entrepreneurs.

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly speaker disqualifies Jaitu legislator Baldev Singh||Punjab Vidhan Sabha speaker Rana KP Singh on Tuesday disqualified Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Jaitu, Baldev Singh, from the membership of the state assembly.Baldev Singh has been disqualified with effect from October 26 as per provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, a statement from the Vidhan Sabha said. The first-time MLA had voluntarily left the party on whose ticket he was elected. As per the Tenth Schedule included in the Constitution in 1985 and popularly known as the anti-defection law, a member can be disqualified if he or she voluntarily gives up the membership of a party.The Jaitu MLA had resigned from AAP on January 16, 2019, in protest against Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s unceremonious removal from the post of leader of the opposition, accusing the party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal of “dictatorial, arrogant and autocratic style of functioning”. He later joined Khaira’s Punjab Ekta Party (PEP) and contested the May 2019 Lok Sabha election from Faridkot seat on its ticket and polled just 4.51% votes, forfeiting his security deposit.A few months later, he returned to the AAP fold after a meeting with state unit president Bhagwant Mann on October 16, saying he realised that the party was the only alternative for Punjab and Punjabis. He was among seven AAP legislators who had turned rebel in 2019. Khaira, whose resignation from the assembly after he joined the Congress was accepted by the speaker last week, and two other AAP rebel MLAs are also facing proceedings under the anti-defection law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-vidhan-sabha-speaker-disqualifies-aam-aadmi-party-jaitu-legislator-101635278477077.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Former Punjab CM Badal seeks intervention of Modi in NRI’s deportation case||Reacting strongly to the IGI Airport authorities sending former cabinet minister Surjit Singh Rakhra’s brother Darshan Singh Dhaliwal, an NRI, back to the United States after denying him entry to India, Punjab former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “intervene personally and effectively” to get the injustice vacated immediately.Badal also requested the PM to personally invite Dhaliwal as a “goodwill gesture which will send a positive signal to the NRIs”. The former CM also spelt an agenda for agriculture, which among other things, includes the revocation of three farm laws, taking stakeholders on board before any legislation affecting them, setting up a panel with farmers and farm experts to advise the government on agriculture policies and enlarging the list of crops for ensured marketing with MSP.A statement issued by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) claimed that Dhaliwal was sent back from the IGI Airport on October 23-24 night with the authorities saying that this was being done as a punishment for organising langar for the agitating farmers on the Delhi borders. Calling it an affront to the “sacred practice”, Badal also urged the PM to take stern action against the erring officials who “brought a bad name to the country with their action”.Detailing his agenda for agriculture, the SAD leader said any legislation, policy or administrative decision affecting the destiny of farmers must be undertaken only after taking the stakeholders on board. He said farmers must be effectively involved in decision-making processes on issues affecting their destiny. “For this, I suggest that the government should set up a statutory panel, with equal representation to representatives of farmers, agricultural experts and farm economists for the formulation of government policy on farming and farmers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-punjab-cm-badal-seeks-intervention-of-modi-in-nri-s-deportation-case-101635278416862.html

Referring to the sealed reports in the Punjab and Haryana high court on drug trafficking, Mann said the state government and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) could undertake further investigation against drug smugglers, their bureaucrats and political leaders because the court did not restrain them from taking action. In a statement here, Mann said that like the previous SAD-BJP government, the present Congress government is also deceiving the people. Accusing the state government, Bhagwant Mann said that the present government was also using the sealed reports in the high court as an excuse to shun action. “Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and advocate general APS Deol, along with the ED, should show to the people legal and court orders to the people of the state which restrain them from further investigation or action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-questions-punjab-govt-on-action-in-drug-cases-101635278236807.html

The fireworks timing has been restricted to 35 minutes on the Christmas and New Year Eve.The government has allowed only green crackers (without barium salt), which are in compliance with the directives of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), as well as various judicial orders passed amid reports of firecrackers likely to aggravate the Covid problem, read the orders passed by the department of science and technology.The order says that while on Diwali (November 4), people can burst green crackers between 8pm and 10 pm, on Gurpurab (November 19), from 4 am to 5am and from 11.55pm to 12.30am, on Christmas Eve and New Year Eve from 11.55pm to 12.30am.Only licensed traders will be allowed to sell firecrackers, the order reads.The sale and use of any kind of firecrackers is prohibited in Mandi Gobindgarh and Jalandhar from the midnight of October 28-29 till midnight of December 31, reads the order. The order also directed the state government to promote community cracker busting to check pollution.What are green crackers? Green crackers are low-emission fireworks permitted by the Supreme Court for celebrations to a moderate degree during festivals, relaxing the complete ban on fireworks previously imposed in 2017 Green crackers, researched and developed by experts at the CSIR-NEERI (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute), a government-funded research institute in the field of environmental science, have a small shell size compared to normal crackers Green crackers are produced with less harmful raw materials, in accordance with instructions issued by the top court, and are made in a way that suppresses the dust when they are burnt – thus reducing emissionsThey also do not contain harmful chemicals such as lithium, arsenic, barium, and lead and instead release water vapour that does not allow the dust to riseThough still impactful on the climate to an extent, the green crackers are believed to cause 30% less particulate matter pollution than traditional crackers and are thus considered generally less harmful than their conventional alternatives||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2hr-window-to-burst-green-crackers-in-punjab-on-diwali-gurpurb-101635277816861.html

After Tuesday’s hearing, Punjab advocate general APS Deol said the court has directed the registrar judicial to produce these status reports in sealed cover in chamber and observed that it will examine these reports prior to the next date of hearing.The bench of justice AG Masih and justice AK Verma also observed, orally, that the court was conscious of the fact that the matter had been pending adjudication without any effective order being passed since May 23, 2018 and, therefore, the court does not want to give an impression that it was sitting on the matter, Deol added. Earlier, Deol had requested that the status reports filed in the court in 2018 be taken up on priority basis and after examining the same, an order be passed to enable the prosecuting agency to proceed as per law. The court was dealing with two applications seeking the opening of some sealed cover reports on Punjab’s drugs menace. One set of reports is on the role of influential persons in drugs trafficking submitted in 2017-2018 by the state Special Investigating Team (SIT), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and a government panel. The second set of reports is of a panel headed by IPS officer S Chattopadhyaya on the “role” of police officers. One of the two reports in the latter’s case was singularly signed by Chattopadhyaya, but not by two other officers on the panel. Additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain is also to submit status reports on the progress in the extradition of certain accused wanted in the drugs cases as well as the latest report by the ED and other central agencies by November 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhola-drugs-case-hc-likely-to-pass-order-on-nov-18-on-opening-of-sealed-cover-reports-101635277756731.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Mandi bypoll | Tribals to use NOTA to protest against power projects||As campaigning for the Mandi parliamentary bypoll reaches a crescendo, environmental activists in tribal regions are disappointed that neither of the political parties have incorporated the threat to their fragile ecology in their agenda and are urging people to opt for the NOTA option to voice their discontent. In the wake of rising demand for electricity, numerous hydroelectric power projects have come up in the fragile mountainous terrain in Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur, which fall in the Mandi parliamentary constituency. The Sutlej River, which flows through Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur, a cold desert with a fragile topography, bears the biggest load of the state’s ambitious hydropower projects. Of the state’s total hydel capacity, 56% (5720MW) is installed on the Satluj basin. The ecological imbalance, thus caused, have impacted the livelihood of the residents and increased the probability of disasters. Kinnaur has around 30 hydel projects. Candidates given charter of demands Organisations at the forefront of opposing the power projects have submitted a charter of demands to candidates of both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party and are urging the people to use NOTA to protest against the non-fulfilment of demands. “We want to draw politicians’ attention to the damage caused to the environment due to the power projects,” says RS Negi, a retired IAS officer and social worker, who has convened the Him Lok Jagriti Manch, which is running a campaign against the construction of hydro projects over the last two decades. “Villages such as Nathpa, Kandhar, Urni and Pangi face the threat of landslides due to construction of mega power projects. The National Highway 5 often remains closed for the same reason,”said Negi On August 26, a major demonstration was held at the district headquarters, Reckong Peo, under the joint aegis of local organisations such as the Himlok Jagriti Manch, District Forest Adhikar Sangharsh Samiti, Jangi Thopan Powari Prabhavitt Sangharsh Samiti and Hangrang Sangharsh Samiti. Agitating locals demanded that all proposed hydroelectric projects in the Sutlej River valley be cancelled. ‘Man-made disasters termed natural calamities’Roshan Lal Negi of the Jangi Sangharsh Samiti said, “We have held numerous discussions with the administration, government and scientists on the downsides of the proposed 804 MW Jangi Thopan power project, but to no avail. Scientists have termed the disasters as ‘natural calamities’ as opposed to ‘man-made disasters’ on the behest of the government to give the hydel projects a clean chit.”The tribals have been demanding implementation of the Forest Rights Act for a long time. “No political party is clear on the Forest Rights Act. Most panchayats in Kinnaur are still unaware of their rights. We will use NOTA to lodge our protest,” says Jiya Lal Negi, president, Forest Right Act Committee Kinnaur. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, or Recognition of Forest Rights Act, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act (FRA), was passed by Parliament in 2006 to address historical injustices and exclusion meted out to a large community of forest dwellers in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandi-bypoll-tribals-to-use-nota-to-protest-against-power-projects-101635277636991.html

Unaccounted cash of ₹2.25 crore and gold worth ₹2 crore were also seized during these raids, it said. “The group has been found to be involved in suppression of income by showing bogus intra-group transactions within group concerns,” the CBDT said, adding that “the group was also found to have been involved in receiving a substantial part of sale consideration in cash and thereby, suppressing the turnover”.The “seized documents” reveal suppression of turnover of around ₹90 crore per annum by a group concern of the cycle business, and “incriminating” documents related to undisclosed sale of scrap were also seized. The second group is based in Jalandhar and is engaged in providing immigration and study visa related services to students. Raids on this group were carried out on October 18. “The searches found that the group used to charge a package, ranging between ₹10 lakh to ₹15 lakh per student, depending on the country where the student wished to pursue education,” the CBDT said. “Almost the entire receipts of the group, aggregating to more than ₹200 crore in the last five years are in cash,” it said. It was also found that the bank accounts of the employees were used to receive money, which was subsequently withdrawn in cash, the CBDT added. The statement said “profit earned from such receipts was never disclosed in the income tax returns (ITRs) filed.” “Only the commission received from foreign universities has been shown as receipts in the ITRs by the members of the group,” it said. Unaccounted income of about ₹40 crore has been detected and ₹20 lakh cash and jewellery of ₹33 lakh has been seized, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/it-dept-detects-rs-130-cr-after-raids-on-cycle-immigration-firms-in-punjab-101635277576878.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||UP IAS Association president’s post lying vacant||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh IAS Association is yet to appoint a president, after the death of the incumbent in April this year due to Covid-19. It is also yet to hold its annual event, the IAS Week, in keeping with the resolution adopted on January 19, 2013, declaring that the IAS Week will be held every year. The association, once known for its exercise of introspection and effectively taking up issues with the government, is going headless for the past six months. It has not been able to appoint a new president following death of the incumbent and chairman Uttar Pradesh Revenue Board Deepak Trivedi (1985), who died due to Covid-19 on April 29 a day before his retirement. As per the established norms, the association requests the senior-most IAS officer to take over as the organisation’s president whenever a vacancy arises. So Mohammad Iftikharuddin (1985), being the next senior-most officer posted in the state, would have been the association’s obvious choice. The association, however, has apparently not taken a call on the issue. “Iftikharuddin has not taken over as the association’s president. He has not signed any paper,” said a senior IAS officer. Iftikharuddin was not available for comments. He is facing a SIT probe after a video purportedly showing him preaching Islam and allegedly making a pitch for conversions at his official residence in 2014-2016 surfaced. Iftikharuddin was then posted as the commissioner of Kanpur division. The state government ordered SIT probe against him on September 28 this year. “The association does not have any president as of now. It has not decided anything about making an appointment on the post. We will let everybody know once a decision is taken,” said a senior IAS officer. The association has also not taken a call on holding its annual IAS Week. On January 19, 2013 the Uttar Pradesh IAS Association resolved to hold the IAS Week and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) every year. The association decided to pass the resolution as it was not able to hold the week for five years from 2007 to 2012. After adopting the resolution, the association held the week and the AGM in 2014, 2015 and twice in 2016. After the 2017 assembly elections, though the association organised the IAS Week in December 2017 and AGM on December 16, 2017 and later in 2019 with AGM on February 2, 2019, unfolding developments at the IAS Week (held in February 2019) remained a cause of concern for some officers. A few minutes after chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s interaction with IAS officers at the senior administrative officers’ conference, the state government had asked the divisional commissioners and the district magistrates to rush to their respective divisions and districts to attend a video conference on February 2, 2019. The chief minister had convened the video conference to review the preparations for high school and intermediate examinations scheduled to begin on February 7, 2019. As a result, many divisional commissioners and district magistrates had to cut short their visit to Lucknow and thereby stayed away from the AGM, an integral part of the IAS Week. The association, however, continued to make efforts to hold the IAS Week till early 2020 but spread of Covid-19 led to enforcement of restrictions in March 2020. It stopped making efforts in this direction in view of restrictions. “Our members have been busy taking steps to fight Covid-19 and enforcing restrictions up to now,” said another senior IAS officer. The association has only a few weeks left to hold the week. Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are due early in 2022 and the state is likely to go into poll mode in the next few weeks. Asked whether the association proposed to hold the event in the next few weeks, an office -bearer of the UP IAS Association said “We can’t say anything. We can’t predict anything about holding the IAS Week this time. It’s a matter of three days only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-ias-association-president-s-post-lying-vacant-101635277516611.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Permits issues for sale of crackers at 37 shops||The district administration issued 37 temporary licences for the sale of firecrackers ahead of Diwali, on Tuesday. As many as 582 applications were received for the licences and the allottees were selected through a draw of lots conducted at Bachat Bhawan in mini-secretariat.The 37 shops are to be set up at six locations in the city and the sale will be allowed from October 29 to November 4 (Diwali). Of the total, 13 shops will be set up at the grain market near Jalandhar bypass, five at Model Town Extension, four at Dugri Phase 2 near Dugri police station, nine at GLADA ground on Chandigarh Road, three at Chaara Mandi, Haibowal, on Hambran road and three in a ground near Lodhi Club road.Joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezhian said temporary licences have been issued as per the directions received from the Punjab and Haryana high court in the past. “The applicants were allowed to submit the applications on October 21 and 22 and the draw of lots was conducted peacefully on Tuesday. The licensee can establish the temporary shop at the designated sites and the sale will be allowed from October 29 to November 4,” he said.Traders rue foul playMeanwhile, a few retailers and wholesalers cried foul over the application submission process. Tribhuvan Thapar, one of the traders, said it was mandatory to show experience in the trade to avail the licence. “Flouting norms, many of the residents used the previous licences of other traders to show experience and submitted the applications. Due to this, 582 applications were submitted for 37 licences only. The department also failed to scrutinise the applications, due to which many of the actual traders have not been able to avail the licence during draw of lots,” he said. “Now many of the residents, who are not in the trade of firecrackers, have availed the licence and they will now sub-let the licence to traders who have not been able to avail the licence. The licensee will charge a hefty amount for subletting the licence,” said Thapar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-permits-issues-for-sale-of-crackers-at-37-shops-101635277339390.html

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Consumer court penalises travel firm, hotel for spoiling Chandigarh couple’s honeymoon||The district consumer disputes redressal commission, Chandigarh, has penalised a travel agency based in Shimla and a Manali hotel for spoiling the honeymoon of a couple from Sector 15.Holding the firm Travel Talkies and The Humsour View hotel deficient in services, the commission directed them to refund ₹10,302 booking amount along with 9% interest (from December 15, 2020, till realisation) besides paying ₹10,000 compensation to the complainant for causing mental agony and harassment and ₹7,000 towards the litigation cost. Manjeet Saini, 28, a resident of Sector 15, Chandigarh, in his complaint said that he was lured by the travel agency and hotel into a holiday package for four days and three nights. Its cost was ₹30,500 for two couples. The agency also sent him photographs through WhatsApp, showing the view from the room’s balcony.On the basis of these images and other promises, Saini booked the package and paid ₹10,302 on December 15, 2020. The travel agency and the hotel confirmed the booking with check-in date as December 25. He said that he along with his newlywed wife and another couple reached the hotel according to the booking schedule, but the travel agency and hotel failed to fulfil the assured commitments. Despite requests, the hotel flatly refused to arrange the rooms shown in the images. Left with no alternative, the complainant arranged rooms in another hotel and stayed there for two nights after paying ₹18,000. He claimed that due to the conduct of the hotel and travel agency, his honeymoon trip was spoiled. ‘Turned out to be a farce’Despite registered notices sent to Travel Talkies and The Humsour View, no one appeared on their behalf. Ruling in favour of the complainant, the consumer commission, presided over by Rajan Dewan, said: “Honeymoon holds special place and sentimental value in the lives of newlyweds who plan in advance after exploring and surfing various options and finally make the hotel, travel and other bookings as per their requirements and budget.” The order said that Saini had made the hotel booking and paid the consideration in advance after going through the images sent to him on WhatsApp, whereby he was assured the view visible from his balcony, which “turned out to be a farce and all his plans turned sour immediately upon reaching the hotel”. “Therefore, it was but natural for the newlyweds to be sulking and feeling cheated if the promised services were not provided. Hence, the complainant was well within his right to make alternative arrangements on his own in another hotel,” ruled the commission, adding that the travel agency as well as hotel are bound to refund the amount paid to them as well as compensate them for the inconvenience caused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/consumer-court-penalises-travel-firm-hotel-for-spoiling-chandigarh-couple-s-honeymoon-101635277287072.html

He was produced in a Chandigarh district court on Tuesday and sent to eight-day police custody. Police have also identified his accomplice.“We have arrested one person who had got the forged cheque withdrawn while the other accused involved has been identified. Teams are in Wani to arrest him,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. A case of cheating and forgery was registered at the police station in Sector 17 a week ago on the complaint of Virender Singh Thakur, chief accountant officer, MC, Chandigarh. Alertness of manager saved more loss The fraud came to light after the branch manager, Bank of Baroda, Sector 37, Chandigarh, called Thakur and informed him that two bearer cheques issued on October 13 and 16 in favour of one Husan Mutarik Shaikh have been deposited for the release of ₹98.51 lakh and ₹22.50 lakh, respectively. The payment of the cheques was stopped as these were not issued by authorised signatories of the MC. On checking with the bank, it came to light that an amount of ₹28.51 lakh had been paid to Kartikya Fish Plant in Wani on October 11. The cheque was also found forged. The account in question is used by the MC to deposit money collected from cow cess, which is imposed on the sale of liquor and is used for welfare of animals. The account belongs to the medical officer of health, as this MC department is entrusted with the responsibility of looking after gaushalas. MC to write to RBI for reimbursementThirupathi told police that he in involved in fish trade and has a current account with the Bank of Baroda. He had got the forged cheque enchased that was issued in the name of Kartikya Fish Plant. The bank, too, did not check how the money was diverted. Police said that the cheques were deposited for encashment at Amaravati in Maharastra. After not getting a response from the bank for reimbursement of ₹28.51 lakh withdrawn fraudulently, the MC will now be writing to the Reserve Bank of India. “The money was withdrawn due to the negligence of the bank and we have written to them for reimbursement. We have already clarified that if the bank fails to reimburse the amount, the MC will initiate legal proceedings. I will also be writing to the RBI to get the money reimbursed,” said Anindita Mitra, commissioner, MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/maharashtra-man-held-for-defrauding-chandigarh-mc-of-28-5-lakh-101635277285754.html

Dr Nagra said that during the visit, the team found a lot of plastic waste, such as carry bags, empty bottles and disposable glasses, and stagnant water at various places in the villages. He said empty bottles, glasses and other plastic waste collect rainwater in which mosquitoes breed. The health officials also inspected village ponds. Meanwhile, arrangements were made to carry out anti-larvae spraying. Dr Nagra said that according to the villagers, the spraying was not carried out in the villages. He also appealed to the villagers to dispose of plastic waste as soon as possible, and said people can contact the health department’s helpline number 104 for any information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-death-toll-climbs-to-26-in-mohali-101635277283287.html

With this, the total number of cases this year has gone up to 215, a fivefold rise over 42 cases reported in 2020. Samlehri village in Mullana block is turning out to be a hot spot after 10 cases of the mosquito-borne viral disease were confirmed there recently and more people are coming forward with dengue-like symptoms. Civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said medical officers at the primary health centre concerned have been instructed to increase sampling in the village. Health officials said poor hygiene and recent rain showers are primarily responsible for more cases in the countryside this year. Earlier this month, a similar situation was seen at Dahar village in Naraingarh block.District epidemiologist Dr Sunil Hari said lack of awareness has led to the outbreak at Samlehri. He said a team surveyed the village on Monday to trace mosquito-breeding sites. “There are several cow sheds with stored water that has not been replaced for weeks. Dumping grounds along the Mithapur road and open drains inside houses are also possible breeding sites,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-sees-fivefold-rise-in-dengue-cases-this-year-101635277282088.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC: 70,000 new rural voters to play key role in election||With 13 villages added to the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s jurisdiction three years ago, their 70,000 residents are set to play a key role in the upcoming civic body elections. From having no stake in the previous MC elections held five years ago, these voters now account for more than 10% of around 6.5 lakh electorate. There are 22 villages under the MC’s jurisdiction, of which 13 — Behlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas — were taken over by the civic body in December 2018.MC wards were increased from 26 to 35 by the UT administration last year solely to incorporate these new villages. The fate of seven wards depend on residents of these villages. Ward 1 and 8 comprise exclusively of some of these villages. While the opposition Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are banking on poor development record of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in these wards as well as the farmer agitation, the saffron party has loosened the fiscal strings to spend ₹102 crore dedicated funds on these 13 villages.Development issuesDevelopment issues have been plaguing the villages, particularly since the areas were subsumed into the MC jurisdiction.“Though part of the City Beautiful, these villages are close in infrastructure levels to Zirakpur than to the city. The situation has only deteriorated in the past three years. Take our village, Daria. To get drinking water is a daily problem. Most residents are dependent on water tankers. Similarly, sewage is a big problem,” said Ajay Pandey, former Daria panchayat samiti member and local Congress leader. Opposition party members also complain that since the villages were subsumed within the MC, the residents have no voice in their governance.“The panchayats were disbanded in 2018, and for nearly three years the villagers had no public representatives. Earlier, people used to get their work done through the panchayat members. But MC officials are unresponsive. The ruling BJP leaders have not helped either,” said Jit Singh, Behlana resident and Congress District (Rural) president. New regulationsComing into the MC’s ambit has also brought the corresponding rules and regulations, which have irked many residents.“There are many cases where the MC is not giving water connection to people because they allege that a building doesn’t conform to its bylaws. Most buildings were constructed before 2019, but now people have to comply post facto. There is also a prospect of the MC imposing property tax on residents,” said Nitin Goel, AAP general secretary who lives in Dhanas.Both Congress and AAP are also looking to gain from the anti-farm laws agitation, which is directed against the BJP. There have been some instances wherein protesters have staged dharnas against BJP leaders visiting the villages.Stating that the BJP has infused large funds for development of these villages, party’s state president Arun Sood said: “Development works worth ₹102 crore have been started in villages. We are close to resolving issues like lal dora and provision of basic amenities outside it. A land pooling policy is in the offing for village development.”Sood also contended that the BJP has expended its base in villages in the last five years. “In all the recent elections, village residents have predominantly voted for the BJP and its policies,” he said. On the farmers’ agitation impacting party’s chances, Sood said, “It is a non-issue in Chandigarh’s villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-70-000-new-rural-voters-to-play-key-role-in-election-101635277280920.html
27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Onion gets 30% dearer in a month||Amid rising fuel prices and unexpected rains in the region, vegetables are getting dearer in Chandigarh. Onion prices, which had remained on the lower side earlier this year, have gone up by 30% this month. Priced at ₹35 per kilogram on October 1, the staple veggie was available for ₹45 at an apni mandi on Tuesday. Onions prices vary according to its variety. At the wholesale market in Sector 26, the retail price of Indore’s white onion ranges from ₹40 to ₹50 per kg. In comparison, the red Rajasthani produce is available for ₹30-40 per kg. However, according to the mandi officials, the wholesale rate is starting to go down even as retail rates remain high. While earlier the wholesale rate had reached up to ₹38 per kg, it is now around ₹32 per kg.“Earlier, there was a problem with supply. With the government intervening and adding to the supply from its own reserves, onion prices are expected to drop in the coming days,” said a mandi official.Tomato prices also continue to remain high, though there has been a dip from the peak of ₹80 per kg seen earlier this month. Now, the rate is down to ₹60, but it is still 33% dearer than ₹45 at the beginning of the month. “The main reason for the hike in tomato prices is the rising cost of fuel, which adds to the transportation cost. The recent rains have also damaged some of the local crop,” said Punjab Mandi Board superviser Satbir Singh.Singh said vegetables such as cauliflower and bottle gourd, which are abundant around this time of the year, have also been affected by the rains, leading to a rise in their prices. “However, prices are likely to come down in the next few days as the supply starts to improve,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhonion-gets-30-dearer-in-a-month-101635277279566.html

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder likely to launch Punjab Lok Congress today||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh is on Wednesday likely to launch a new political party, the Punjab Lok Congress, according to people familiar with the developments.A formal announcement is expected at a media conference called by the two-time former CM in Chandigarh.“The event will be telecast live on his Facebook page. Do tune in,” Singh’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted on Tuesday morning, extending an invite to the media. Lt General TS Shergill (retd), who was senior adviser to CM, is set to be made an office-bearer in the new outfit. A week ago, Singh said that he planned to soon announce the launch of his political party and was hopeful of a seat arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if the farmers’ issue was resolved. “The battle for Punjab’s future is on. Will soon announce the launch of my own political party to serve the interests of Punjab and its people, including our farmers who have been fighting for their survival for over a year,” his media adviser quoted by him as saying on Twitter on October 19. The former CM is also tentatively scheduled to meet Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Thursday to discuss the way forward to find an amicable solution to the stir, a person privy to his efforts in this direction. Those expected to accompany include three-four state leaders and farm experts. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has denied being part of any such effort. Singh, who is still to formally quit the Congress, was camping in Delhi last week and held detailed consultations with his supporters in the party. However, some of them are learnt to have advised him to float the separate outfit and reach an agreement with the BJP only after a resolution has been to the ongoing imbroglio over the three farm laws. He was made to resign as the chief minister on September 18 following months turbulence and tussle in the state unit during which Navjot Sidhu, who was appointed the state Congress president despite Singh’s objections, and several ministers and legislators rebelled against him. The Congress later picked Charanjit Singh Channi as the chief minister. Ashutosh Kumar, professor of political science, Panjab University, said: “This (launch of new party) was on the cards from the time he announced he will quit the Congress. The main aim appears to be to dent the Congress. Though his next step will be to have an arrangement with the BJP as he has already indicated, the farmers’ protest will be a tricky issue...”A big mistake, says deputy CM Randhawa Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who had rebelled against Capt Amarinder and has been targeting him over his friendship with Pakistani journalist Aroosa Alam, said that no one can be stopped from charting his own political course, to stay in the party (Congress) or leave it. “Whether he is doing it because the BJP has asked him to or of his own accord, it will be a big mistake,” Randhawa said, questioning his (Singh’s) decision to leave the party that had given him so much. He said the former CM’s exit will not dent the Congress in any way. “If he had so much sway, then he would have continued as CM,” the deputy chief minister added. Capt accuses opponents of threatening supportersAmarinder on Tuesday accused his detractors in the Congress of threatening and harassing his supporters in Patiala and elsewhere. Singh, who was made to resign as the Punjab CM in September following months of tussle and turbulence in the state Congress, told them that they cannot defeat him with such low-level political games. “From personal attacks they’ve now stooped to threats and harassment of my supporters in Patiala and elsewhere. Let me tell my rivals they can’t defeat me with such low-level political games. They will neither win votes nor people’s hearts with such tactics,” the former CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral quoted him as saying on Twitter. Singh further said that those who have stood by him have so because they believe in and want to continue working for peace and development in the state. “They will not be scared away by such petty acts of intimidation or persecution. We will continue to fight for Punjab’s future,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-likely-to-launch-punjab-lok-congress-today-101635276736730.html

The BJP leaders led by state executive member, Bikram Sidhu, stated that the MC had failed to take up proper fogging in many parts of the city, and the water puddles formed due to the recent rainfall had become a breeding ground for the mosquitoes. The BJP leaders stated that unhygienic conditions prevail in areas including, Haibowal, BRS Nagar, Salem Tabri, Ghumar Mandi, Chander Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Rani Jhansi Road, Hargobindpura, Nehru Nagar, etc. They added that the failure of departments including, health and MC, to keep a check on mosquito breeding is taking a toll on the residents’ health.They further stated that they will be forced to move on roads if the civic body fails to improve its work in the coming days. Sidhu said, “A large number of lives have been lost due to the ongoing pandemic, and the rising number of dengue cases has added to the misery. The civic body has failed to take up proper fogging drives even as dengue cases are reported every year during this period. Regular fogging and extensive drives should be conducted in every ward of the city to destroy mosquito larvae.”Meanwhile, MC commissioner Sabharwal said that proper fogging is being done in the city. “The ground staff has been directed to share the pictures of the fogging process with senior officials daily,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dengue-menace-bjp-slams-civic-body-over-inadequate-fogging-in-ludhiana-101635276319713.html

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Staff crunch ails Ludhiana fire brigade, 79% sanctioned posts vacant||Even as authorities are working to upgrade firefighting equipment ahead of Diwali, the Ludhiana fire department is facing an acute shortage of staff. Of the 147 sanctioned posts, 117 are lying vacant. Besides, no new post has been created in the last four decades. As per department officials, the existing posts were sanctioned in the early 80s after which no new post was created even as the city has grown in terms of area and density. Of the total 86 regular posts of firemen, 77 are lying vacant. Similarly, 18 out of the 19 posts of regular drivers are vacant. The department has, however, deployed 50 firemen and 23 drivers on outsource/contractual basis to deal with the staff shortage. But officials maintain that it is difficult for outsourced employees to match up to the trained regular staff.Eleven posts of sub-fire officer (SFO) and six of leading firemen are also vacant. There is no regular assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO) so a fire station officer (FSO) has been given the additional charge of ADFO. Two posts of FSO are also vacant. ‘Forced to work over-time’An official requesting anonymity said the department has 17 big fire tenders, each of which requires a team of six persons, including leading fireman, firemen and driver, during every shift. As per norms, there should be three shifts (of eight hours each) in a day. “As there are 12 leading firemen, 59 firemen and 24 drivers, including those employed on contractual and outsource basis, the employees are forced to work on 12-hour shifts. But they are not paid overtime. Sometimes, the staff members have to give up on their rest days to ensure staff strength,” said the official, adding that the matter regarding overtime is currently sub-judice.The official further remarked that the department’s efforts at upgrading the equipment will be of no use unless the staff crunch is addressed first. Sitting on a tinderbox“As per municipal records, there are around four lakh properties in the city, including one lakh industrial units. The population is around 30 lakh. If we do not count the peon and clerk deputed in the department, there are 101 firefighters, including the SFOs, FSO etc. This means there is one firefighter for 4,000 properties and 29,700 people,” said a firefighter while adding that sometimes they are also summoned to Sahnewal, Samrala, Jagraon and even Jalandhar when a major mishap occurs.The fireman added that the staff shortage issue has been raised several times at the state-level. “We are promised regularisation ahead of elections but it remains on paper. Recently, the state had also demanded a list of vacancies and it was said that more staff will be deputed in the department, but nothing has been done so far,” said the firefighter. FSO Swarn Chand, who holds the additional charge of ADFO, said, “The fire brigade falls under the local bodies department. The state department has been apprised of the issue in the past and demand for deputing more staff members has also been tabled. The state government has to take the final call.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The civic body is working to upgrade the fire brigade under the Smart City Mission and modern equipment, including life-detectors, thermal scanners, safety suits etc, have already been provided. The state government is also working to fill vacancies not only in the fire brigade, but in the MC too. The demand from our side has been forwarded to the state.”Fire brigade seeks 20 addl drivers for DiwaliOfficials said the fire brigade has sought 20 additional drivers from the MC for dealing with fire incidents during Diwali. The drivers are expected to report a day before Diwali. Temporary stations will also be established in different parts of the city, including Samrala Chowk, Aarti Chowk, Jalandhar bypass etc, to reduce reaction time during Diwali.Proposal to establish two fire stations hangs fireThere are five fire stations in the city as of now, including the headquarters situated near railway station, Focal Point, Gill road, Haibowal and Sundar Nagar. As demanded by industrialists at Bahadurke Road, Tajpur Road and surrounding areas, the authorities had proposed establishment of two stations at Tajpur road dairy complex and vegetable market at Bahadurke road in the past. But the projects have been hanging fire. An official said the department will also need more staff to operationalise these stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/staff-crunch-ails-ludhiana-fire-brigade-79-sanctioned-posts-vacant-101635276138793.html

27-10-2021||Lucknow||Before 2017, UPPSC was mired in controversy: Yogi||Lucknow Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday urged the newly recruited social and minority welfare officers to work honestly in the interest of the public. The chief minister was speaking after handing over appointment letters to 40 newly recruited district social welfare officers and minority welfare officers selected through UPPSC, in an event held at his official residence in Lucknow. “As you have been selected through a fair and transparent process, without any ‘recommendation’ or bribe, you are expected to perform accordingly,” the CM told the young recruits. He said the basic premise of the administration should always be to provide the benefit of government schemes to the public without discrimination. “Before 2017, the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission used to be a hotbed of controversy. There were allegations against the commission. Even CBI investigation was done. The court had to stay recruitments,” Yogi recalled, adding, “had the same discrepancies taken place in the process of appointment, you would never have been selected.” He said his government provided 4.5 lakh government jobs, recruitment to which was stalled owing to corrupt practices during the previous government. “The department of social welfare is nodal department for Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana under which more than 1.52 lakh girls have been helped to get married. Even Abhyudaya Coaching is being run by this department,” he said. Hitting out at the opposition, the chief minister said that the intention of the previous governments was not pure. “After coming to power, we removed the discrepancies and today youth are getting jobs,” he said. Highlighting the achievements of his government, the CM said, “Uttar Pradesh is now moving forward as a new economy. The team of Lucknow was announced in IPL. This is the result of teamwork. Today, Uttar Pradesh is the second-largest economy in the country.” Minister for social welfare Ramapati Shastri, minister for minority welfare Nand Gopal ‘Nandi’ and state minister Mohsin Raza were also present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/before-2017-uppsc-was-mired-in-controversy-yogi-101635275056869.html

The civic body had initiated a trial in April this year. MC has not initiated the project at ground level yet even as the city is likely witness foggy days soon which will disrupt the visibility of the commuters.Hundreds of stray cattle roam around in different parts of the city including the residential areas, putting commuters’ lives at risk. The animals can be seen in large numbers at Hambran Road, Tajpur Road, Jalandhar Bypass, Rahon Road, and Jamalpur, among other areas.Sunny, a resident of Haibowal, said, “A large number of cattle roam at Hambran Road as the dairy farmers at Haibowal dairy complex leave the dry cows to stray. The black-coloured animals are not even visible during night hours as most of the street lights also remain defunct. The civic body should find a solution and should at least tie reflective belts around the animals as roads accidents may prove to be fatal for the commuters.”Rahul Verma, a member of the road safety council, who is associated with the civic body and has been participating in the meetings, also slammed the officials for only being restricted to their offices.Verma stated that no department, including MC and PWD, is serious about road safety. The officials show concern over the issue only during the meetings and don’t take any steps at ground level. Repeated reminders/complaints have been sent to the MC, but to no avail.Meanwhile, MC senior veterinary officer (SVO), Dr Harbans Dhalla, stated that MC has already purchased 500 reflective belts, and the project will be initiated in a few days. Apart from deploying its staff, MC will also rope in NGOs and staff of different gaushalas for tying the belts around the animals. ₹7.8 crore spentEven after collecting over ₹29 crore as cow cess since January 2017 and spending over ₹7.8 crore out of the same, the civic body has failed to bring respite from the menace.The officials rue shortage of space to shelter the stray animals due to which arrangements are being made with managements of different gaushalas in exchange for a certain fee.Dr Dhalla said that recently MC established a shed in Burj Powat village for sheltering 150 animals. Around 1,500 animals have already been sheltered in different gaushalas across the district, he added.Past incidentsFebruary 10, 2020: A Haryana-based banker died in a road mishap near Hardy’s World on NH-44 as his car overturned after hitting a road divider in a bid to save stray cattle.September 28, 2019: Two men were severely injured after the car in which they were travelling hit a stray cow at Jeevan Nagar of Focal Point.March 24, 2019: A labourer, Akashdeep Singh, 20, of Umedpur village met with a road mishap after his motorcycle collided with a stray cow in Nandpur village.

Middukhera was shot dead in broad daylight in Sector 71, Mohali, on August 7. Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal said Dagar is the second gangster to have been nominated in the FIR after Kaushal Chaudhary, who is accused of hatching a conspiracy to murder Middukhera while lodged in Karnal jail. Dagar and Kaushal had contacted the main shooters who killed Vicky in Mohali after getting tips from Armenia-based gangster Gaurav Padial. Mahal said, “With Dagar on production warrant, we are hopeful of arresting the shooters soon as we have already identified them. However, Mohali police have so far failed to arrest the two identified shooters as the teams conducted unsuccessful raids at their suspected hideouts in Delhi, Haryana and Western UP. On August 7, four shooters came to murder Middukhera, out of which two executed the killing whereas the other two were waiting in a car nearby. Out of all the four, two shooters were of Bhola-Latth gang and other two were of Bambiha gang run by Gaurav Padial.

The state government should stop playing with the lives of lakhs of students who are appearing for these exams in the hope of finding jobs and helping their families in the time of crisis.” “To ensure that our voice reaches the state government and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, we have started this online campaign on social media platforms demanding cancellation of the upcoming exam and the conduct of a re-exam for both days by another firm. We are going to boycott the October 31 exam in large numbers and protests will be held by students at all the examination centres across the state,” Gharbude said. The state government has outsourced the conduct of its exams to NCPL and as per the existing agreement between the two parties, the department only provides the question papers and all other arrangements including designing the website, handling online applications, providing hall tickets to students, allotting examination centres, seating arrangements and publishing the merit list are carried out by NCPL. Earlier too, NCPL was blamed for the fiasco wherein the government had to cancel the exam at the eleventh hour owing to lack of preparation in filling up over 6,200 vacant posts in the state health department. The same recruitment exam was originally scheduled on September 25 and 26 however as NCPL could not make the necessary arrangements in time and students faced several issues with the hall tickets and examination centres, the exam had to be cancelled. As many as 800,000 job aspirants have applied for various posts under groups C and D in the public health department. Speaking to HT earlier on Oct 17, Puneet Kumar, NCPL MD had “We are doing our preparations well to conduct an error-free examination, learning lessons from previously scheduled exams. The allegations made against us are not true and we are going through the policy set by the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-complaints-of-exam-mismanagement-health-department-serves-notice-to-nyasa-101635274398908.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||UP Police make two arrests in FIR into killings of BJP workers, driver||Uttar Pradesh Police on Tuesday arrested two people in connection with the deaths of two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and their driver in violence at Lakhimpur Kheri three weeks ago. These are the first arrests made by the police in connection with a second FIR lodged in the case.Gurwinder Singh, 32, and Vichitra Singh, 24, were arrested from Gola and Bheera towns, respectively, said Prashant Kumar, additional director general, law and order, in a statement. The two were sent to jail after being produced before a local court, a senior official said on the condition of anonymity.On October 3, eight people -- four of whom were farmers -- died in violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on October 3. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same.The minister and his son, however, deny the charge that the latter was in the vehicle and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led to the driver losing control of the vehicle. They accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist, Raman Kashyap, was also killed.A day after the incident, the first FIR in the case was filed by Jagjit Singh which named Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unknown people. At least 13 people have been arrested in connection with this FIR.On October 4, BJP worker Jaiswal filed a second FIR and alleged that “antisocial elements” among farmers attacked and lynched two BJP workers and the driver. This FIR makes no mention of the death of the farmers and only names unidentified people.“The bad elements in the farmers’ protest had attacked the vehicle with bamboo sticks, bricks and stones due to which driver Hari Om got injured and stopped the car on the road side,” read Jaiswal’s FIR.Jaiswal is one of the 13 people arrested in the first FIR.Tuesday’s arrests were made after ascertaining the involvement of the two people, the second official said.Statements of 30 witnesses have been recorded, and the process to record the statements of 13 other witnesses is underway, the second official said.The state police will analyse the security risk of the witnesses and provide protection, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-two-arrested-in-connection-with-second-fir-101635274396556.html

27-10-2021||Noida||Noida sees drop in mercury after icy cold winds sweep NCR||Icy cold north-westerly winds swept the National Capital Region on Tuesday as daytime temperature dropped in Noida and adjoining areas, according to weather analysts. Temperatures are likely to fall over the next three days, and later stabilise only to drop further when the next western disturbance hits the region later this week.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida on Tuesday were recorded at 27.4 degrees Celsius (°C) and 17.6°C against 28.5°C and 17°C, respectively, a day earlier.Maximum and minimum temperatures will hover around 29°C and 15°C on Wednesday, said an IMD official, requesting anonymity.“The mercury may drop further over the next three days as the icy cold winds will continue to flow from the mountain region which recently received snowfall. After three days, the temperature will be stable for some time until the next western disturbance, when temperatures will start to fall again,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.Meanwhile, pollution monitoring agencies predicted that the air quality may drop as stubble burning incidents are likely to increase ahead of the winter season.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) reading -- on a scale of 0 to 500 -- in Noida on Tuesday was recorded at 154 against 150 a day earlier. Similarly, Ghaziabad’s AQI was 176 against 80 on Monday, and 149 at Greater Noida against 90 a day earlier.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.The air quality is likely to worsen in the region, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Tuesday. “Fire emission is expected to increase due to dry weather over North India (upwind region) in the next three days, due to which the particular matter -- PM2.5 -- is likely to increase. Drier conditions tend to increase PM10. Thus, the overall AQI is likely to degrade to ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category for the next three days. The effective fire count over the northwest region is 348 and its share in PM2.5 is 8% as westerly winds are partly favourable,” according to a statement issued by the SAFAR on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sees-drop-in-mercury-after-icy-cold-winds-sweep-ncr-101635273978590.html
27-10-2021||Pune||Police identify 4 “black spots” along killer stretch leading to Navale bridge||PUNE The Pune police have identified four “black spots” along a 3.5-km stretch from the new Katraj tunnel to the Navale bridge chowk.The black spots are where regular accidents are happening, in this case, since 2014, a total of 56 people have lost their lives on this stretch. As per the information released by the police department, the four black spots identified are – the turn at Dari Pul bridge, the Swami Narayan temple chowk, the Narhe selfie point and the Navale bridge chowk. Last week, three accidents at different points on this stretch left three people dead and several injured. “We have identified four of these black spots where accidents regularly happen. Many drivers of heavy vehicles, to save fuel, switch off the engine and roll down the slope in neutral gear, where the vehicle then becomes difficult to control,” senior inspector Devidas Gheware of the Sinhgad road police station. “The Dari Pul bridge turn is so sharp that it can lead to an accident. At the Swami Narayan temple chowk the service road uneven so two-wheeler riders cannot judge it,” he said. “We are working on turning these black spots into safe spots and accordingly precautionary measures have been taken. We are now going to take a review of these spots along with the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and if needed infrastructural changes or any other preventive measure to curb down the accidents will be considered,” said PI Gheware. Of the 56 fatal accidents on this deadly stretch since 2014, half have been due to the “human error”, as per the police. On October 22, a tanker rammed into an SUV car, another four-wheeler and a container in which two persons died and two were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-identify-4-black-spots-along-killer-stretch-leading-to-navale-bridge-101635273977269.html
27-10-2021||Gurugram||Day after contractor booked for extortion, illegal parking lots under scanner in Gurugram||A day after a private parking contractor was booked for extortion, police on Tuesday formed six teams to check if commuters were being charged illegally at any other parking lot.Police said the parking lot business has expanded in the city in the last 10 years and several people charge fees for parking on private land without informing the landowner.The teams will survey illegal parking spaces in the city, said police, adding that crime investigation units are also likely to conduct surprise raids. Commissioner of police KK Rao said that many private contractors are operating unauthorised parking lots in the city and the police have registered cases against at least 50 people in the last three years. “They charge parking fees without even informing the landowner--such cases have been reported from Galleria, Sushant Lok, Sector 57 and Palam Vihar areas. Strict directions have been given to all police stations and crime units to keep a check on such illegal activities. Anyone found operating unauthorised parking spaces will be booked for extortion,” he said.On Monday, a private contractor of a car park facility in Rajiv Chowk was booked on charges of extortion for allegedly charging a trucker ₹40,000 for parking his impounded vehicle at the lot for 18 days. The contractor was charging ₹100 per tyre per day, against a maximum charge of ₹100 per vehicle per day. Police said the most complaints of overcharging at parking lots have been received from Rajiv Chowk, Sector 57, Sushant Lok, and Sadar market area.Rao said contractors will have to display the charges at the entry of the parking lot. “The charges are fixed. Residents should inform police if they find anyone asking them to pay extra and not giving them a receipt,” he said.Residents have alleged that parking contractors are fleecing them, and despite repeated complaints to the nearest police stations, nothing has been done.Vatsala Sharma, a resident of DLF Phase 4, said people charge a minimum of ₹30 for them to park their vehicle on any vacant land adjacent to commercial complexes or local markets. “Despite paying, the risk is ours if anything is stolen from the car. One cannot question the parking staff as they are not even polite and end up threatening us if we ask for a parking receipt,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/day-after-contractor-booked-for-extortion-illegal-parking-lots-under-scanner-in-gurugram-101635273861762.html

The members said they plan to disrupt prayers on Friday yet again if the issue is not resolved by then.Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, a Samiti member who has been a part of the protests, said, “This time, if we find anyone offering prayers in the open and not in mosques then we will be forced to disrupt the law and order situation and things can take an ugly turn,” he said.Bhardwaj said they had a problem with outsiders gathering in residential areas to offer prayers in the open. Members of the Muslim community, meanwhile, said there weren’t enough mosques in the city, leading to them having to gather in the open at certain sites to pray on Fridays.Garg said he had received the memorandum and the administration was trying to resolve the issue at the earliest. He said the administration was on high alert. “We are coordinating with the police to ensure that Friday is peaceful. We have deployed duty magistrates at all locations where a protest can take place and we shall ensure that communal harmony is maintained,” he said.Senior officials said that protesters were likely to gather at multiple sites and police deployment would be planned after discussions with the commissioner of police on Wednesday.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that heavy police deployment is planned for Friday. “The prayers will be held under police protection and we will ensure law and order situation is under control. Police have been instructed accordingly and an assistant commissioner of police will be deployed to take action at each spot if required. No one will be allowed to raise religious slogans at prayer sites,” he said.Protests against namaz in open areas started in September in Sector 47. On October 8, the sector residents and members of some Hindu groups protested for the fourth consecutive week by raising slogans and singing bhajans even as members of the Muslim community offered prayers amid heavy police presence. Though police shifted the site of the Friday prayers around 100 metres from the originally designated spot to avoid confrontation, local residents demanded they wanted prayers to be stopped completely in their area.After a joint meeting of both communities with the deputy commissioner that week, it was decided that residents of Sector 47 would not protest until Diwali (which will be celebrated this year on November 4); however, protesters gathered at Sector 12A last Friday.Members of the Muslim community said that they were being harassed by the protesters. “Police and the administration should take action against those who are conducting these protests at the sites. Designated land should be given to us so we can set up mosques so that members of our community do not have to offer prayers in open,” said Altaf Ahmad, founder member, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch.Haji Shehzad Khan, the chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, said that they have demanded police protection for people praying at the designated sites. “We have chosen three sites to offer prayers – DLF Phase 3, Sector 12A, and Sector 47. The administration has promised us it will take action against those who protest or disrupt our prayers at any of the sites,” he said.He also said they are offering prayers at sites designated by the administration but people are still are disrupting them.The Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti had earlier carried out protests against the offering of namaz in the open in May 2018. After their protests, the administration had discussed the issue with both communities and designated 37 sites in the city for offering namaz, one of which is Sector 47.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rightwing-groups-submit-memo-to-gurugram-admin-threaten-to-disrupt-friday-prayers-101635273856467.html

The authorities have installed 60 signboards with QR code, which can be scanned using any smartphone to get details on a variety of species in many languages. Also, new interpretative and informative signboards have been put in front of the animal exhibits, with detailed information on the species concerned in English and Punjabi. Hygiene metal barriers made of grade stainless steel have been put up in front of major carnivore exhibits to ensure visitors’ safety. These barriers are seven-feet high and the difference between the grill is up to four inches, so the viewing isn’t affected and clicking pictures is easy with any type of camera. Zoo field director of Chhatbir Zoo, Naresh Mahajan, said they are also strengthening the lion-safari wall along the Ghaggar riverside. This boundary wall was constructed four decades ago and made with bricks and chain-link-wire-mesh. Now, it is being strengthened and the height is being increased with extra layers of bricks up to nine-feet high and 2.000 feet long, which will make it safer for visitors and the animals. He said that other initiatives are also being taken to bring Chhatbir Zoo up to international standards and safety and amenities of the visitors are being taken into consideration while planning and developing the infrastructure, he added. In August this year, Dinosaur Park was inaugurated to bring the facility up to international standards of zoo education. Chhatbir Zoo, in collaboration with the Altrview Group, developed the dinosaur park on PPP mode, where real size, lifelike and interactive robotic models of dinosaurs are being exhibited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chhatbir-zoo-now-scan-qr-code-to-get-info-on-various-animal-species-101635273441841.html

In 2019, the Haryana government had announced that 50 electric buses will be added to the fleet at Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) by the end of that year, but the buses have still not been procured. According to officials in the know, the process initially got delayed because of procedural issues and then the lockdown imposed due to the nationwide Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020. “The government announced two years ago that 50 electric buses will be added to the fleet and arrangements were made accordingly. A parking space was created at the Sector 10 bus depot and charging stations were installed. It was first decided that the authority would purchase the buses, but now, in accordance with the state’s policy on electric vehicles, it has been decided that the state government will purchase and distribute the buses to every district,” said Arun Sharma, GMCBL manager of Sector 53 and Sector 10 depots in the city. The official said that the number of buses to be given to Gurugram and by when they will be given had not been decided yet. In August 2019, the department of heavy industry (under the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises) announced the sanction of 5,595 electric buses to 64 cities, including Gurugram, under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India (Fame) subsidy. It was the only city in Haryana to have been allotted the e-buses under the second phase of Fame. There are currently over 160 GMCBL buses plying on 29 different routes in Gurugram and Faridabad. Earlier this year, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram in August launched the city’s first electric three-wheelers zone (ETWZ), where only electric autos and e-rickshaws can ply, to promote the use of e-vehicles. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had flagged off these vehicles as part of the Parivartan project from Galleria Market in DLF Phase 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-years-on-gurugram-s-wait-for-e-buses-just-got-longer-101635273436317.html

Under this pilot project, SDMC has successfully resolved 95% of the issues pertaining to its own jurisdiction,” CAQM said in a statement.The major pollution sources that have been addressed under this pilot project include garbage dumping sites, overflowing dhalaos, burning of garbage, construction and demolition sites, debris dumped on public land, road dust from unpaved roads, barren lands, industrial emissions and vehicular pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiair-quality-panel-sdmc-join-hands-to-identify-local-pollution-sources-101635273378070.html

Actions have been taken against many during the last few days as part of this drive while SOG teams are continuously at work to identify and trace persons who may try to take advantage and run betting rackets during T20 matches. “All police stations have been asked to carry out regular checking drives at places from where betting rackets may be operated. Different teams of SOG are on alert and are using their informer networks to identify bookies,” superintendent of police (crime) Ashutosh Mishra said. Previously also, many betting rackets were busted by cops during IPL matches. Moreover, gambling dens were also raided by police teams on regular basis in different parts of the city. But despite regular raids, alerts bookies managed to run betting in many parts of the city and even in rural areas during T20 India Pakistan match on Sunday held in Dubai. “As persons involved in betting rackets usually use phones for bookings, it becomes difficult to trace and identify them. They may operate from densely populated localities, posh areas or even remote villages to avoid suspicion of police,” said the official. According to police, bettings are booked not only offline but also online. Bookies remain active on phone and at their hideouts and take money for betting on scores, wickets and speculations on who will play first etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-cops-on-alert-against-betting-gambling-rackets-during-t20-wc-diwali-season-101635273376782.html

27-10-2021||Delhi||Forest dept seeks DUSIB help to clear Ridge slums||To begin the work of demolishing slum colonies and multi-storeyed buildings, built illegally in forest land in the southern Ridge, the Delhi forest and wildlife department has sought the help of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) to find alternative land parcels where the slum dwellers could be rehabilitated.While demolition drives are currently ongoing to remove the smaller structures in villages such as Devli, Asola and Pul Pahladpur, forest officials say denser areas such as Neb Sarai are next up, and to carry out demolition there, a rehabilitation package needs to be chalked out first.A forest official said the demolition drives have been going on for over two years now and encroachment are being removed from 19 villages of Asola, Bhatti, Chhatarpur, Aya Nagar, Maidangarhi, Satbari, Sahoorpur, Saidulajab, Neb Sarai, Jaunapur, Dera Mandi, Devli, Rajpur Khurd, Tughlaqabad, Pul Pehladpur, Rajokri, Rangpuri, Ghitorni and Mahipalpur.However, the department said denser areas with tall structures such as Neb Sarai, Saidulajab, Prem Nagar as well as Aya Nagar will require assistance from the district task force (south), as slum colonies have to be rehabilitated first, as per law.“We are unable to act on these thickly populated pockets and we have now approached the district task force for manpower and DUSIB for rehabilitation purposes. Work cannot commence in certain areas until locals are rehabilitated. A meeting will again be held in the next couple of weeks,” said the official, asking not to be named.Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forest (south), who is overseeing the encroachment removal drive, said over the past few months, the department has adopted a strategy of removing encroachments and building a permanent wall within a matter of days. The area freed form encroachment is then rejuvenated by the planting of native saplings.“Within 15-20 days, the boundary wall is up and saplings are planted so the land cannot be reclaimed or used for other activities. The ecological task force is also deployed there immediately,” Anand said.A senior DUSIB official when contacted said they were awaiting a request from the forest department to begin rehabilitation work. “Rehabilitation can be done by the Delhi development Authority (DDA), or any other land-owning agency. While we identify areas that they can be rehabilitated, the cost has to be borne by the land-owning agency. Once we receive a formal request, we will begin the process,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forest-dept-seeks-dusib-help-to-rehabilitate-slum-dwellers-free-up-ridge-land-101635273076341.html

27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Two held for killing man during robbery||Four days after a 42-year-old electrician was stabbed to death on a busy road in central Delhi’s West Patel Nagar for resisting an armed robbery, the police on Tuesday said they arrested two men and apprehended six minor boys in connection with the crime. The alleged accused stabbed the electrician in his abdomen before robbing him of his mobile phone, ₹3,000 cash, a gold ring and Aadhaar card, police said.The electrician, identified by his first name as Manoj, lived with his family in Baba Faridpuri area near West Patel Nagar and worked at an electronics showroom in Baljeet Nagar, police said. “The knife used in the crime was recovered along with Manoj’s stolen phone and Aadhaar card. The suspects spent the looted money,” said a senior police officer, adding that nearly 60 police personnel scanned footage from over 400 CCTV cameras in a 1km radius of the scene of crime to identify and nab the suspects.The arrested men were identified as Sikahdar alias Sikku, 21, and Vivek Singh, 20. The six apprehended teenagers are between the age of 15 and 17, police said. One of them was previously involved in a case of assault and wrongful restraint. All of them have been booked for murder and dacoity, said deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan.The incident is the latest in a series of snatching and robbery cases in which the victims suffered fatal or serious injuries besides losing their valuables. According to Delhi Police data, Delhi reported 5,108 snatching cases till August 15 this year -- 851 more than what was reported during the same period in 2020. Similarly, robbery cases increased by 178 till August 15 this year to touch 1,264, as compared to 1,086 cases reported during the same period in 2020.On October 22 around 8.30 pm, Manoj was returning home from his workplace when a group of eight persons allegedly cornered him on a busy road in Block 35, West Patel Nagar. They held him at knifepoint and made him hand over the cash and other belongings. But Manoj resisted their bid to rob him and ran towards a lane while screaming for help.But the suspects chased him and one of them stabbed him in the abdomen. “We scanned the footage from over 400 CCTV cameras and identified all suspects. All of them have been caught,” said DCP Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhitwo-men-arrested-six-minors-apprehended-for-killing-man-during-robbery-101635272716786.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC restrains ED from taking further action in Amnesty India funds case||The Delhi high court on Tuesday restrained the Enforcement Directorate (ED) from taking any further action pursuant to the attachment of Amnesty International India’s funds in connection with a money laundering case.The money laundering case of the ED is based on the November 2019 Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR against Amnesty International India Private Limited (AIIPL), Indians for Amnesty International Trust (IAIT), Amnesty International India Foundation Trust (AIIFT), and Amnesty International South Asia Foundation (AISAF) in connection with the alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and the Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (criminal conspiracy).The ED also froze various bank accounts and fixed deposit accounts of Amnesty International India and Indians for Amnesty International Trust on November 26, 2020.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a petition by the human rights agency to prevent the transfer of attached funds, also directed that a status quo be maintained until the organisation’s appeal against the confirmation of the attachment order is taken by the appellate tribunal, which is currently not functional.The judge clarified that her order shall “merge” with any order that may be passed by the appellate tribunal subsequently.“The writ petition is partly allowed by directing that till the appeal and the stay application are taken up by the appellate tribunal, parties will maintain status quo. Consequently, the respondent (Enforcement Directorate) will remain restrained from taking action pursuant to the impugned order. This order will merge with any order passed by the appellate tribunal,” justice Palli said.Similar directions were passed by the judge on a petition against the confirmation of a provisional attachment order against the Indians for Amnesty International Trust.The order was passed after the two petitioners stated that while they have preferred a statutory appeal against the confirmation of the attachment order, passed by the adjudicating authority, the same is unlikely to be taken up on account of the appellate tribunal being non-functional.The judge noted that the petitioners’ claim about the status of the appellate tribunal was not disputed by the lawyer appearing for ED, Amit Mahajan.In its petition filed through lawyer Arshdeep Singh, Amnesty International India stated that on August 6, the adjudicating authority confirmed the attachment of its fixed deposits and certain bank accounts, which were provisionally attached earlier this year pursuant to a money laundering case being probed by the ED.It said since April, all matters before the appellate tribunal are being re-notified en bloc after the expiry of the tenure of its acting chairman and therefore, there was an apprehension that the appeal would be rendered infructuous.In a scenario where the Centre has not issued any notification for the appointment of a chairman and/or members, the functioning of the appellate tribunal is likely to remain suspended for an indefinite period of time, the petition said.Amnesty International India also said that while conforming to the provisional attachment order, the adjudicating authority not only acted in blatant violation of the principles of natural justice but also overlooked the complete “non-application of mind” by ED officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-restrains-ed-from-further-action-against-amnesty-india-101635272657172.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Share of farm fires in bad air on rise, may peak near Diwali||Rain and favourable wind might have delayed the onset of winter pollution in the national capital, but air quality forecasts for the coming days suggest that Delhi is headed towards an air emergency as stubble fires are expected to peak -- coinciding with Diwali (to be celebrated on November 4), when pollution levels usually spike because of large-scale bursting of firecrackers in violation of bans.Air quality forecast by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) decision support system — an air quality monitoring and forecasting system that helps government agencies take prompt decisions to prevent pollution peaks —said the contribution of stubble smoke in Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels is expected to reach around 65% by the first week of November. The current contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s particulate matters is around 40%.Experts said the stubble smoke coupled with firecracker-bursting across states in north India during Diwali (November 4) is likely to push the Capital’s air into hazardous zone.
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt sets up centre to track adverse effects of Covid, other vaccines||The Delhi government has set up a state-level centre — consisting of doctors from several departments including medicine and cardiology — to monitor and investigate cases of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) at the Maulana Azad Medical College associated with Lok Nayak hospital.The team will begin by investigating the adverse events after the Covid-19 vaccination, and then move onto monitoring complications after vaccinations under the government’s universal immunisation programme, officials from the hospital said.“When a vaccine is administered, especially a new one like that for Covid-19, there are always reports of people fainting or getting diarrhoea. And, in some cases, people also link deaths, which could have happened because of any other condition, to the vaccine. It will be the job of this multi-disciplinary team to go over all the medical records of such people to determine whether or not a reaction is linked to the vaccine,” said Dr Pragya Sharma, professor in MAMC’s department of community medicine, which is coordinating the state-level centre.Surveillance data after inoculation – including Covid-19 and other vaccines under the government’s immunisation programme – is collected by the government’s immunisation cell.“The data will continue to be collected as it is currently, but this centre has been started to strengthen the mechanism. Our centre will carry out all the tests and diagnostics as well as provide multi-disciplinary expertise for investigating the cases,” said Dr Sharma.There have been 0.009% AEFI related to Covid-19 vaccinations in the city, according to data from the government’s CoWIN platform. This is more than the national average of 0.004%.“There is a very small percentage of people who report adverse events after Covid-19 vaccination; and among those reported, most are symptoms such as fever, rash, or pain at the site of the injection,” said Dr Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sets-up-centre-to-monitor-adverse-event-cases-after-immunisation-101635272058800.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Four of family die in fire at northeast Delhi home||Four members of a family died after a fire broke out at their third-floor house in northeast Delhi’s Old Seemapuri in the early hours of Tuesday. Police said the fifth and the only surviving member of the family escaped as he was sleeping in a room on the second floor of the four-storey building.Although the exact reason for the fire has not been ascertained, police officers said that an oil lamp that the family kept lit round-the-clock may have caused the blaze. Police are also examining the possibility of a short-circuit in the decorative lights that were placed around a small temple in the room.“The fire was most likely caused by the big oil lamp that was kept lit under a wooden table in the room. The house was inspected by forensic experts who are trying to establish the exact reason for the blaze,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.Delhi fire services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that the fire was small, and limited to just the one room where the four victims were sleeping.The victims were identified as Horilal (59), a peon at Shastri Bhawan; his wife Reena (55), a sanitation worker in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC); and their two children – Ashu Chauhan (24), and Rohini (18). Horilal’s third son, Akshay (22), who worked as a housekeeping staff in a private logistics firm, escaped as he was sleeping on another floor.According to Akshay, his brother Ashu, a housekeeping staff in the North Block, was scheduled to get married in November. Horilal was due to retire from his job in March next year, he added.The DFS chief said that the fire control room received a call around 4am about the fire. Four fire tenders were rushed to douse the flames and the fire was immediately brought under control, he said. The blaze spread due to inflammable items in the room that was bolted from inside. The windows were also closed, said fire officials.“Four bodies were found on the floor. They died because of smoke inhalation,” said Garg. The bodies also had burn injuries, fire and police officials said.DCP Sathiyasundaram said a case of death by negligence under IPC section 304A was registered against unknown persons. Although no foul play is suspected so far, section 436 of the IPC has been added to probe if there was any mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy the house, he said.The four-storey building where the fire broke out is built in a 25 square yard plot. The ground and the first floor belong to Sunil Kumar Dhingan, a relative of the family, and the second and third floors were occupied by Horilal and his family. The only entry-exit point through the stairs has an iron gate that was locked from inside, police said.Futile attempts to escapeAkshay as well as some locals said that after the fire, they noticed marks on the room’s wooden door, suggesting that the victims made unsuccessful attempts to break it open.They suspect that the family members fainted during the efforts due to the toxic fumes. Police also said that this may have been the case.Sunder Pal, who lived on the second floor of a nearby building, first noticed the fire and alerted the neighbourhood. “We all began knocking the building’s iron gate and calling out names of Horilal’s family. Nobody responded initially and after a few minutes, Akshay came out on the second floor,” said Pal.Another neighbour, Radhey Shyam, said Akshay then rushed to the third floor after being told about the fire but he could not open the door. Later, police and firefighters broke open the door and the victims were rushed to GTB hospital, where doctors declared them brought dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-of-family-die-after-fire-breaks-out-northeast-delhi-home-101635272057483.html

He also suffered minor burns on his hand while dousing flames from the headlight of one of the parked cars, said a senior police officer of the police station.Police said the fire was reported at the residential apartment in Raj Nagar Part-2 around 6pm on Monday.Initially, constable Ashish and three more personnel reached the fire spot and found that the blaze was coming out of one of the servant rooms near the parking lot on the ground floor.“They found four cars parked near the servant rooms that were hampering the fire fighting and rescue operation. The SHO and other personnel also arrived there. Constable Ashish broke the windows of two cars while others pushed the cars out of the building, making space to carry out the rescue operation,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma.According to the officer, six people, including three children aged between one and three, were subsequently rescued.Later, two fire tenders arrived at the spot and doused the flames.In another fire reported from the area on October 23, police said they saved seven members of a family who were trapped in the house after a fire broke out due to a leakage in a cooking gas cylinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-rescue-six-from-fire-in-house-in-palam-village-101635271756263.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: AAP MLAs, councillors to take up mega fogging drive to fight dengue||Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of inaction, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said that its MLAs and councillors in Delhi will start a fogging initiative across the city from Wednesday in its fight against dengue. The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.While the AAP is in charge of the city government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD). Delhi goes to municipal polls next year.“After BJP’s reckless governance failure, AAP’s workers will take charge of public health. AAP MLAs and councillors will start a mega fogging campaign from October 27. The BJP’s inaction regarding dengue control is costing lives,” said AAP’s MLA and spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj at a press conference.He further said, “The BJP has not taken a single step to keep dengue in check. They are on a continuous quest to defame Delhi by putting the lives of the people of Delhi at risk. The BJP doesn’t want to protect Delhiites. Fogging this year has been done in only 5-7% of the state and anti-malaria inspectors haven’t even gone to the ground yet. AAP workers will take the onus of protecting the people of Delhi. Every ward, locality and lane will be covered in the drive.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called the allegations baseless.“It is really shocking to see AAP stooping down so low that they have started using sensitive issues such as dengue to politically malign BJP-ruled civic bodies. In the process, they are even denying credit to municipal health, sanitation and domestic breeding checkers who are working over time currently. Due to the hard work of municipal staff, the spread of dengue and malaria is well under control but sadly, just to indulge in dirty politics, AAP leaders, including MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj, are unnecessarily creating fear among people with baseless allegations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiaap-mlas-councillors-to-take-up-mega-fogging-drive-to-fight-dengue-101635271396384.html
27-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Ashram underpass mess to extend beyond November||Relocation of a nearly 7km-long, high-power transmission line is set to hit the administration’s plans to finish the ongoing work on the Ashram Chowk underpass by November-end, officials involved with the project said.The transmission line, which is being handled by the Delhi Transco Limited (DTL), runs between Maharani Bagh and the AIIMS trauma centre. A senior DTL official, who asked not to be named, said it is expected to be completed only by November 15, which will impact the entire project.The 750-metre underpass, which has missed four deadlines since the work began on the project in 2019, connects Nizamuddin railway bridge and CSIR Apartments at the Ashram intersection. However, protracted construction work, poor site management, and haphazard dumping of construction material and debris has ensured years of chaos at one of the busiest traffic intersections in the Capital.Though the fifth deadline for the completion of the underpass is December 31 — it was set on August 17 — Delhi Public Works Department minister Satyendar Jain on September 17 said the work may be completed by November.“There has been a slight delay as high-voltage cables surfaced in the area where the ramp of the underpass is to be constructed. The cables are being shifted and that is likely to take around a month’s time. We have expedited the process and are resolving all the issues. The entire work of the underpass will be completed in two months,” Jain said at the time.When asked about the relocation of the high-power transmission line, Jain’s office, in a statement on Monday, said necessary directions have been issued to maintain the pace of work as scheduled and concerned officials have been asked to ensure smooth flow of traffic across the stretch.The senior DTL official quoted above said that the 220KV line originates from the substation near Maharani Bagh, and goes up to AIIMS trauma centre. “Due to high population density in this area, an overhead power supply line cannot be considered. The deadline of November 15, 2021 has been fixed for completing this task,” the official said.A PWD official overseeing the project confirmed that the digging work around the power line has started. “Most of the civil work for this underpass has been completed from both sides of the approach roads but the pending work of installing the last concrete block now depends on how long does DTL takes to relocate the power line. We will take around one month to complete the remaining work, after the power lines are shifted,” the official said.Meanwhile, traffic snarls at the key intersection that witnesses movement of over 300,000 vehicles every day continued. The Delhi Traffic Police issued an advisory on Saturday, stating that due to underpass construction work only one lane is open for traffic moving from Ashram to Badarpur, and that the commuters should avoid this route.“Vehicles coming on Ring Road from Sarai Kale Khan, and taking left towards Badarpur are advised to take CV Raman Marg-Mathura Road or Ashram flyover-Capt Gaur Marg- Modi Mill Flyover for Badarpur. Likewise, traffic on Mathura road from Nizammudin seeking to cross Ashram for Badarpur are advised to turn right and take Capt Gaur Marg-Modi Mill flyover for the onward journey,” the Delhi Traffic Police stated in the official statement.The initial deadline for the Ashram underpass project was December 2020, then it was shifted to April 2021, since most of the work was yet to be completed. That deadline too was, however, missed and the next deadline provided by the government officials was that of June 2021. After this, PWD missed the August 31 deadline too and later said that the work will be completed before the end of the year.Air pollution ban (starting 2019 September), assembly polls (March 8), pandemic-induced lockdowns (between March 2020 and June 5, 2021), labour shortage and financial crunch have also hit progress of work on the project.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning in the School of Planning and Architecture, said the project completion should be top priority as more than 500,000 passengers use the Ashram intersection every day.“Ideally, such intersections involving arterial roads and national highways should be grade separator interchange points with no restriction in flow of traffic movement. We are already a decade late in the intervention at this intersection. With other projects like Delhi-Meerut highway getting completed, the traffic volume at this intersection was bound to increase. The vehicular flow is coming at higher rate and getting stuck at the Ashram intersection,” he said.Prof Ram said, “We should also create a plan to facilitate pedestrian movement at this intersection as it will have flyover, underpass, Metro lines and at-surface movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiashram-underpass-mess-to-extend-beyond-november-101635271336182.html
27-10-2021||Lucknow||To prepare for UP polls, Amit Shah to meet 2019 Lok Sabha in-charges||Union home minister Amit Shah would sit down to chart BJP’s 2022 UP election roadmap from Friday by consulting Lok Sabha (LS) in-charges in 2019 general election when the party won 64 out of 80 seats from the state. The BJP had won these many seats despite an alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)—the reason why meeting with 2019 Lok Sabha in-charges is listed prominently in Shah’s Friday itinerary. Shah, who will reach Lucknow in the morning, will spend Friday night in the state capital. “Those LS poll in-charges would have an in-depth view of things. They have on-the-ground estimate of how we did well despite a tough caste arithmetic that the coming together of SP-BSP presented before us in 2019 LS polls. That’s why his meeting with them would be important because he would surely base his campaign strategy, either wholly or in part, on the basis of his meetings with them,” a BJP leader said. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev held a meeting on Tuesday evening to finalise the agenda for the series of meetings that Shah is scheduled to hold through the day on Friday. Shah is to also meet poll-in charges for each assembly segment in 2022 UP polls besides a meeting with all important party functionaries including members of the UP election panel headed by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan and comprising among others information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev, state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal and UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh. The Union home minister is also scheduled to launch party’s membership drive from Vrindavan scheme, Sector 17 Colony, after his arrival in Lucknow. Just as he had done in 2014 Lok Sabha polls and the 2017 UP polls when he was the party’s UP in-charge. Shah would also flag off party’s campaign vehicles for various parts of the state.BJP eying Dalit votesThe BJP is eyeing Dalit voters, the reason why after holding a meeting of Jatav Dalits on Tuesday, the BJP is to hold meeting with another influential caste group – Sonkars – on Wednesday. At the Jatav meet, BJP lined up leaders of the influential Dalit sub-caste, prominently showcasing Baby Rani Maurya, a Jatav Dalit woman tasked with holding meetings to connect with this key Dalit subcaste considered to be staunch supporters of Bahujan Samaj Party. Former BJP MP and now an MLC Vidyasagar Sonkar, who visited the Panchayat Bhawan venue for the meeting, said the BJP was connecting with all. “The opposition is busy in slander campaign but in these social representative meetings, we are telling the people how the benefits of the government schemes have reached one and all. The Modi-Yogi governments at the centre and the state have connected with the poorest of the poor and this is the reason why a desperate opposition is busy spreading rumours,” Sonkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/to-prepare-for-up-polls-amit-shah-to-meet-2019-lok-sabha-incharges-101635269596386.html
27-10-2021||Pune||After attacking man in Hadapsar, leopard caught by forest officials||PUNE A man was injured after he was attacked by a leopard on Tuesday morning in Gosavi Vasti, Hadapsar, forest officials confirmed. This is the first incident of a direct conflict between man and a wild animal in Pune city in 2021, according to forest department officials. The man was identified as Sambhaji Athole (45), and he was out for a morning walk when the leopard attacked him. He has sustained wounds on his left side and was rushed to a nearby private hospital, where he was reported stable. “He has injuries on his stomach and back, but he is stable now. We have caught the leopard,” said Rahul Patil, district forest officer, Pune. “The leopard was suspected to be hiding in a nearby abandoned house or in the vegetation nearby, according to residents,” said a spokesperson of fire department. Forest department officials were later informed and a team was moved to the spot for rescue and capture of the animal. There have been over a dozen sightings of big cats and the Pune district forest department has rescued 12 leopards in the past two years. The department has issued guidelines for the residents living in areas where leopards have been spotted. An awareness campaign is also part of the department’s initiative. However, there is no defined policy to channel the police, local administration, and forest department efforts if leopard sightings keep increasing. The attack came days after the citizens residing in Undri and Mohammedwadi area had spotted a leopard. However, despite motinoring the area, the forest officials did not get any clear evidence of a big cat’s presence in the vicinity. On October 10, a calf was reportedly killed in what was believed to be an attack by a wild animal in Mohammadwadi. The forest officials said they could not identify whether it was killed by a leopard or a hyena. After the calf was killed, forest range forest officer MJ Sanas appealed residents not to venture out during night. “Mohammedwadi almost touches the main city area, so wild animals don’t come here on a regular basis,” said Sanas. Apart from the leopard scare in Mohammedwadi, the sighting of leopard has been common in Junnar, Ambegaon belt of Pune district. Earlier in August this year, the 11-member committee set up by the Maharashtra government to study leopard-human conflict, had re-stated the importance of co-existence with the big cats and focus on engagement with locals. The committee rejected suggestions of capturing or trans-locating leopards from the conflict zone besides suggesting a “Living with Leopards” (LwL) programme. The man-animal conflict in Junnar forest division has claimed lives of 33 persons during past 230 years. At the same time, deaths of big cats in Maharashtra during 2020 went up to 174, 60% more than the figure registered in 2019 that saw 110 leopard deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/leopard-attacks-man-on-morning-walk-in-hadapsar-101635267915970.html

27-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP expels 20 more office-bearers in poll-bound Jubbal Kotkhai||Barely four days before the by-elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday expelled 20 more office-bearers of its Jubbal-Kotkhai unit, where rebel candidate Chetan Bragta is posing a challenge to party nominee Neelam Saraik. The office-bearers from the block and district units of the BJP have been expelled for anti-party activities. Those expelled are Mahavir Jhagta, Inder Chauhan, Surinder Dhaulta, Krishan Chand Manta, Virender Chauhan, Narendra Chauhan, Ashok Chauhan, Nikkam Singh Baltu, Balbir Thakur Prince, Shyam Sharma and Mohinder Jhagta. District unit chief Ajay Shyam said the 20 office-bearers have been expelled from the party for six years. BJP’s Kisan Morcha president Rakesh Sharma (Babli ) has expelled five office-bearers of the farmers’ wing from the party for six years in Jubbal Kotkhai. The expelled leaders include Kitab Singh Negi, district president; Rajendra Chauhan, district secretary; Mahavir Jhagta, and Manoj Sunta, block president. The convener of the party’s Scheduled Caste cell has expelled Nitin Kumar, Satish Hemta, Moti Lal Shakti Singh, Ravindra Rawal, and Anant Lal Kesta. So far, the BJP has expelled 50 workers from block units of its youth body, BJYM, and women’s wing Mahila Morcha. No scope for returning: State BJP chief The block unit of the party resigned soon after the BJP denied the ticket to Chetan Bragta and preferred Neelam Saraik over him. The party expelled seven office-bearers of the Mahila Morcha on October 23. “All those who have been expelled will not be taken back in the party fold,” state party chief Suresh Kashyap said in a statement here on Tuesday. “The BJP is a disciplined party and the workers are the backbone of the party. But anti-party activities will not be tolerated at any cost in the party,” he said, adding that the party’s Himachal affairs in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna and co-in charge Sanjay Tandon have time and again warned the dissidents. Virbhadra was the Messiah of development, says Pratibha Congress nominee from Mandi Pratibha Singh on Tuesday hit out at the government over Lok Sabha member Ramswaroop Sharma’s death. She said that government is shying away from probing his death. “Bypolls are taking place because Sharma is no more between us. People of the state have every right to know,” she said. She also flayed HP chief minister and other BJP leaders for their remarks against her. “BJP leaders’ remarks over a woman only reflect their frustration,” she said while addressing a series of poll meetings. Neither am I weak nor helpless,” she added. Pratibha said her husband Virbhadra Singh was the “Messiah of development”. She said with his death, the state lost one of its leaders of masses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bjp-expels-11-more-office-bearers-in-poll-bound-jubbal-kotkhai-101635246134706.html

Abedin recounts that the assault took place after a dinner that she went to with a few senators and their aides. “I ended up walking out with one of the senators, and soon we stopped in front of his building and he invited me in for coffee,” she writes, as reported by The Guardian. “Once inside, he told me to make myself comfortable on the couch.”As the senator made coffee, he took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves. “Then, in an instant, it all changed. He plopped down to my right, put his left arm around my shoulder, and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth, pressing me back on the sofa,” Abedin writes.“I was so utterly shocked, I pushed him away. All I wanted was for the last 10 seconds to be erased.” According to Abedin, the senator seemed surprised by her reaction and apologised, saying he had “misread” her. But then he asked her if she wanted to stay.“Then I said something only the twenty-something version of me would have come up with – ‘I am so sorry’ – and walked out,” Huma Abedin writes.After the incident, she avoided the senator a few days. When they met next, he asked if they were still friends. Thankfully, for her, Hillary Clinton walked in at that precise moment “as if she knew I needed rescuing even though I’d told her nothing about that night,” says Abedin.According to Huma Abedin, she had “buried” the incident, but memories of it came surging back during the confirmation hearings of former president Donald Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused by a Christine Blasey Ford of assaulting her when they were both in their teens.Huma Abedin was born in Michigan. Her father Syed Zainul Abedin was born in New Delhi and her mother Saleha Mahmood Abedin was from Pakistan. She grew up in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.She joined the White House as an intern during the presidency of Bill Clinton (1993 to 2001), where she was assigned to the then first lady Hilary Clinton. Abedin went on to become Hillary’s closest aide as she ran for the senate and then the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, which she lost to Barack Obama.Abedin also served as key aide to Hilary Clinton, when she was the secretary of state between 2009 to 2013, and was also senior figure on Hilary’s second presidential run, which she lost in 2016 to Donald Trump.Abedin was married Anthony Weiner, a Democratic party operative, who went to serve seven terms as member of the House of Representatives and then saw his career implode over a sexting scandal and with whom she is now estranged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-aide-huma-abedin-reveals-she-was-assaulted-by-a-us-senator-101635354761191.html

Here's what happened||Since early last year, when the Covid-19 pandemic first swept across the globe, people have been forced to work from indoors. Though the situation has eased considerably since then, and restrictions have been relaxed across several countries, employees, by and large, continue to work from home. Because of this, office meetings have taken place through video calls, and often, while speaking during such meetings, people discovered that their mic was on mute all along.Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to Twitter on Wednesday to share a similar experience. “Always remember to unmute…thanks @KermitTheFrog for joining us on @YouTube #DearEarth and chatting about some of our shared interests,” Pichai tweeted, along with a short, two-minute video clip of the interaction. Always remember to unmute...thanks @KermitTheFrog for joining us on @YouTube #DearEarth and chatting about some of our shared interests:) 🌎🏏🦗 https://t.co/RCIUnPcltK pic.twitter.com/cEd6BjkA6H“Hi there, Sundar,” Kermit, a Muppet character created in 1955 said to Pichai, welcoming him for the interaction taking place as a part of YouTube's “Dear Earth” series. The India-born executive responds to Kermit, but the former is inaudible as his mic is on mute. “Sundar, I think you are on mute. Wow, can't believe I am talking to the CEO of Google, and he is on mute,” Kermit says.At this point, which comes 11 seconds into the clip shared by Pichai, he realises his mistake and says, “Sorry Kermit. I was on mute, and I've done it a few times this year like everyone else. I'm huge fan of you and the muppets,” the Google CEO says, as Kermit returns the compliment.The conversation continues, and eventually Sundar says that he and his children love watching, among other things, cricket highlights on YouTube. Kermit says that he, too, lives cricket, to which Pichai clarifies that he is talking about the game of cricket, and not the insect.“Dear Earth” is a YouTube Originals programming which aims to address the sustainability challenges that the world is facing and solutions which can be adopted to bring about a change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sundar-pichai-fails-to-unmute-his-video-call-here-s-what-happened-101635348630871.html

Based on this trajectory, expect the Hurun China Rich List to grow to as many as 5,000 within ten years,” according to Hoogewerf.Hoogewerf said that it’s a similar story in China in the context of the rising number of billionaires.“Back in 1999, there were none, with the first wave of 100 coming through in 2007, before breaking through the 500-mark in 2015 and since Covid, almost doubling to 1185 known billionaires today, 50 percent more than the US, which has just under 700 known billionaires. At this rate, expect China to have 2,000 known billionaires by 2030,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-added-307-billionaires-last-year-as-new-energy-sector-propels-wealth-101635329317131.html
27-10-2021||World||Pak army chief won DG ISI battle, PM Imran Khan got the procedural lollypop||Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa revealed both his military clout and political maturity in getting his ISI candidate Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum appointed as head of Pakistan’s spy agency while ostensibly deferring to the process demands made by Prime Minister Imran Khan.With PM Khan having no options but to tow the line of army chief, there is very strong speculation that Gen Bajwa may continue to head the military beyond his current retirement date of November 2022. Gen Bajwa took over as Pak Army Chief on November 29, 2016. On October 6, 2021, he replaced Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as DG, ISI and appointed Karachi V Corps Commander Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the head spook. Gen Hameed, who has been an open supporter of Taliban’s Interior Minister and global terrorist Sirajuddin Haqqani, was appointed as the Commander of XI Corps at Peshawar.The appointment got stuck after PM Khan wanted the due process to be followed as if indicating that he did not want to replace Gen Hameed, who was again seen in Kabul with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi after his replacement has been announced by the Rawalpindi GHQ.While Pak PM showed his ostensible clout with the Army by issuing a press release about Gen Anjum taking over as ISI from Gen Hameed on November 19, fact is that Gen Bajwa had his way with civilian leadership happy with a facile victory. Unlike Gen Bajwa who hardly comments on India unnecessarily, PM Khan showed his political immaturity by gloating on Pak cricket team defeating India in a T20 match in Dubai. His clever offer of a dialogue with India from Saudi Arabia is a non-starter as the Modi government will not open any diplomatic channel till Pakistan stops targeting India through home bred Islamic jihadists. The rabid Islamic comments made by PM Khan’s minister and even former Pakistan cricketers after the T20 victory have been noted by the government. It was seen an attempt by Pakistan civilian leadership to be seen as more aggressive than Pak Army leadership on India for political gains in future.Even though Gen Bajwa allowed Khan to save face by first sending a panel of names of Army commander under consideration of the DG ISI job and then allowing them to be interviewed by Pak PM, the bottom line was that Gen Nadeem Anjum’s name could not be changed by the civilian leadership.The change as directed by Gen Bajwa happened despite Gen Hameed increasing temperatures on both sides of the border with bombings of so-called ISKP in Afghanistan and targeted killings by proxies of Pak terror groups in Kashmir in the run up to his Peshawar posting announcement by Rawalpindi. In the end, Bajwa won the game hands down, Pak PM only managed a lollypop as a consolation prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-chief-won-dg-isi-battle-pm-imran-khan-got-the-procedural-lollypop-101635319452458.html

KSA has always been there for Pak in our difficult times incl now when the world confronts rising commodity prices.”I want to thank HRH Prince Mohammad bin Salman for supporting Pak with $3 bn as deposit in Pak's central bank & financing refined petroleum product with $1.2 bn. KSA has always been there for Pak in our difficult times incl now when world confronts rising commodity prices.Imran Khan had on Monday met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on the sidelines of the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) summit in Riyadh, which he was invited to attend at the royalty's invitation. Later on Tuesday, the Saudi prince announced that it was depositing $3 billion in Pakistan's central bank to help the cash-strapped country with the foreign reserves. According to Geo News, the announcement was made by the Saudi Fund for Development, which said that not only was it depositing $3 billion in the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) but also had issued an official directive to supply $1.2 billion to finance Pakistan's oil products trade during the year. The news was later confirmed by Pakistan's information and energy minister Hammad Azhar.“This will help ease pressures on our trade and forex accounts as a result of global commodities price surge,” Azhar said as he shared the news.It was reported by the Hindustan Times earlier this month that Pakistan is facing a deep economic crisis, its biggest one in history. According to The News International, one of the largest English language newspapers in Pakistan, the Imran Khan-led regime ideally requires gross external financing of $51.6 billion within a two-year period (2021-2023) in order to fulfill its needs.Also Read | Pakistan in deep economic crisis. Here's how much financial help it requiresPakistan, despite its close ties with Iran, shares a friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia in line with the pan-Islamic ideology. Riyadh has helped Islamabad multiple times over the years, including aid in paying for Pakistan's first batch of F-16 fighter aircraft in the 1980s and providing $6 billion in loans that helped Islamabad tide over its balance of payments crisis just two years ago.The Saudis also came to Pakistan's rescue in 2018 when they agreed to provide $3.2 billion worth of oil on deferred payments per annum as part of a $6.2 billion package to help Pakistan get over with its crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/always-been-there-imran-khan-thanks-saudi-arabia-on-receiving-3-billion-aid-101635314701726.html
27-10-2021||World||Explained: Why Turkish President Erdogan is backpedaling in diplomatic row||Over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan instructed his Foreign Ministry to declare the ambassadors of 10 states, including those of Germany and the United States, "persona non grata." Following a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Erdogan struck a more conciliatory tone, explaining that the embassies had "taken a step back from this slander against our country and our nation. I believe these ambassadors […] will be more careful in their statements regarding Turkey's sovereign rights" in the future.The move followed a Twitter statement by the US Embassy underscoring its commitment to Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations prohibiting interference in another state's internal affairs. Aykan Erdemir, a former Turkish opposition parliamentarian, said Washington's "strategic ambiguity" allows "Erdogan's spin doctors to claim the West has surrendered, whereas the English version gives the impression that the West remains steadfast on human rights."The diplomatic spat arose after the envoys in question called for the release of Osman Kavala, a philanthropist who has remained jailed without a conviction in Turkey for nearly four years. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) demanded his release back in December 2019.Erdogan's political gambitCharlotte Joppien, an expert on Turkish politics at Hamburg University, said Erdogan is trying to distract attention from domestic problems, pointing out that his approval ratings have been falling for months. Indeed, independent pollster Avrasya reports approval for Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has now dipped below 30%.The government's weakness even seems to be uniting Turkey's long-fractured opposition. Taken together, the Kemalist Republican People's Party (CHP) and the national-conservative Good Party (IYI Parti) now poll at over 40%.Moreover, the existence of numerous other small anti-Erdogan parties and the fact that the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is polling at roughly 10% means Erdogan and the AKP need to worry about losing upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections.Why is Erdogan's popularity tanking?More than anything, the president's waning popularity is tied to Turkey's economic woes — inflation stands at 20%, corruption is rampant and the value of the Turkish lira has been in free fall for years. On Monday, $1 US was worth a staggering 9.59 lira — though the currency rebounded slightly after Erdogan's conciliatory statement.This protracted devaluation of the lira has had dramatic consequences: Key imports, upon which Turkey depends, are growing progressively more expensive. Many Turks who have taken out dollar-denominated loans are struggling to service their debt. In addition, inflation is driving up costs for everyday products.Have similar rows occurred in the past?This is by no means the first time Erdogan has attempted to use an international diplomatic crisis to shore up domestic support. That was the case when Turkey temporarily jailed German journalist Deniz Yücel, as well as in Turkey's clash with France and the US over whether the mass slaughter of Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks during World War I constituted genocide.Erdogan often uses such disputes to claim other countries are trying to keep Turkey down. He also uses them as an opportunity to lash out against media outlets, whom he has accused of peddling fake news. Despite different situations, his polarizing tactics are always based on the same political calculus. He knows confrontation with foreign powers appeals to many nationalist Turks, but he hopes the strategy will also force the opposition to adopt a more jingoist stance.How has the opposition reacted?This time, however, Erdogan's attempted strong-arming of the opposition does not seem to be working. Instead, his political adversaries have publicly lambasted him, with Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the CHP, saying the president is trying to create excuses to explain away "the collapse of the economy that he himself destroyed."The leader of Turkey's Future Party, Ahmet Davutoglu, made similar comments. Davutoglu, who once served as foreign minister and prime minister under Erdogan, said the president is neither truly concerned about Osman Kavala, nor the independence of Turkey's judiciary. Instead, he said, Erdogan is deliberately stoking polarization and swapping "statesmanlike logic for the language of the gutter," bringing "shame upon our country."What are Erdogan's options?Despite fierce criticism at home and considerable pressure from abroad, Erdogan still holds powerful cards in his hands — he could edge Turkey, a NATO member state, even closer toward Russia, for instance. Ankara has already angered NATO allies by ignoring their concerns and outright rejecting objections from the US by purchasing the S-400 air defense system from Russia. As a result, Washington subsequently refused to deliver F-35 fighter jets to Turkey.Now, Turkish decision-makers are mulling whether to purchase Russian combat aircraft alongside further Russian-made air defense systems— no small gesture considering the fact that Turkey maintains the second-largest standing military force in the NATO alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-turkish-president-erdogan-is-backpedaling-in-diplomatic-row-101635308734065.html
27-10-2021||World||Under Biden, US criticises Israel on settlements for first time in years||The United States on Tuesday forcefully criticised Israel for the first time in years on its settlements, with president Joe Biden's administration saying it “strongly” opposed new construction on the West Bank. The reaction comes after four years under Donald Trump in which the United States offered a green light to Israel's activity on occupied Palestinian land, with his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, touring a settlement at the end of his tenure.The State Department under Biden had repeatedly warned against settlement construction and on Tuesday sharply criticized Israel after it moved ahead.“We are deeply concerned about the Israeli government's plan to advance thousands of settlement units” on Wednesday as well as tenders published Sunday for more than 1,300 homes, State Department spokesman Ned Price said."We strongly oppose the expansion of settlements, which is completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm, and it damages the prospects for a two-state solution," he told reporters."We also view plans for the retroactive legalization of illegal outposts as unacceptable."Price stopped short of saying the decision would jeopardize relations with Israel. But he said that the administration would "raise this issue directly with senior Israeli officials in our private sessions."Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is a right-winger close to the settlement movement, although he leads a coalition with centrists who seek to preserve stable relations with the United States.Housing Minister Zeev Elkin is part of the right-wing New Hope party and said the settlements were "essential to the Zionist vision" of strengthening Jewish presence in the West Bank.Gap in USPalestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh had urged Washington to "confront" Israel on the settlements, which he described as "aggression."About 475,000 Israeli Jews live in settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law, on land Palestinians claim as part of their future state.The Trump administration, which was backed by evangelical Christians who see biblical reasons for supporting a Jewish homeland, revised longstanding State Department guidance and said it did not consider settlements illegal.It was a sharp shift from the previous Democratic administration of Barack Obama who faced open criticism from Israel's veteran right-wing prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, particularly over US diplomacy with Iran.In one of its last acts, the Obama administration declined to exercise the routine US veto at the UN Security Council and allowed a resolution against Israeli settlements to pass through.While Biden has long ties with the Jewish state, many in his Democratic Party have increasingly opposed Israeli policies, especially under Netanyahu.In June, dozens of Democratic lawmakers wrote an open letter to Biden urging him to "consistently and proactively" issue "firm public condemnations" of actions that could jeopardize the peace process.Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, a centrist who engineered the coalition to oust Netanyahu, accused the previous government of putting Israel at risk through a partisan alliance with Trump and has pledged to work through disagreements quietly.Lapid last month proposed a development plan for the impoverished Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Islamist militants Hamas who fought a war with Israel in May, but conceded that the idea was not supported across the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-biden-us-criticises-israel-on-settlements-for-first-time-in-years-101635305713967.html

The US secretary underscored the need for a return to the transition civilian government, Price added.Earlier on Tuesday, the Al Hadath broadcaster reported that Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who was ousted in the military takeover, was returning home. Hamdok was reportedly being held at the home of the Sovereignty Council of Sudan Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces.The takeover came as the term of the 11-member transitional Sovereign Council of Sudan was approaching completion. Thereafter, the council was set to transfer power to a civilian government.

It added that an official directive was issued to supply $1.2 billion to finance Pakistan's oil products trade during the year.This comes as a respite for Pakistan, which is battling a deep economic crisis.The news was confirmed by information minister and energy minister Hammad Azhar."This will help ease pressures on our trade and forex accounts as a result of global commodities price surge," Azhar said as he shared the news.Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan had on Monday met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on the sidelines of the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) summit in Riyadh, which he was invited to attend at the crown prince's invitation.Back in May, the federal minister for information Fawad Chaudhry had said Saudi Arabia had agreed, in principle, to revive the facility of oil supply to Pakistan on deferred payments.Finance minister Shaukat Tarin had repeated earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had agreed to provide oil on deferred payment to Pakistan.Earlier, Saudi Arabia had provided a USD 6 billion financial package, including $3 billion deposits into the State Bank of Pakistan and the remaining $3 billion for oil facility on deferred payment on an annual basis.Last year, the decade-long friendship between both countries took a sharp turn when Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's issued a blunt warning to Saudi Arabia after the latter refused to act against India over the Kashmir issue.On the first anniversary of the revocation of Article 370 by India, Qureshi took Saudi Arabia to task in a TV interview for not obliging Pakistan over the issue of 'organising' a meeting of the Council of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Foreign Ministers (CFM) on Kashmir in early February 2020.Qureshi's remarks revived Riyadh's anger, who had forced Pakistan to pay back USD 1 billion prematurely.Riyadh has helped Islamabad many times including helping in paying for Pakistan's first batch of F-16 fighter aircraft in the 1980s and providing USD 6 billion loans that helped Pakistan tide over its balance of payments crisis just two years ago.Saudi Arabia had come to Pakistan's rescue in 2018 when it had agreed to provide USD 3.2 billion worth of oil on deferred payments per annum as part of its USD 6.2 billion packages to help Pakistan tide over its balance of payment crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-sends-3-billion-package-to-help-out-cash-strapped-pakistan-101635301290991.html

27-10-2021||World||Google growth marred by disappointing result in YouTube, cloud computing sectors||Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported quarterly sales that topped Wall Street estimates, reflecting robust advertiser spending, but disappointing results from its YouTube and cloud-computing divisions weighed on the stock.Third-quarter revenue, excluding payments to distribution partners, was about $53.6 billion, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts projected $52.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. YouTube ad revenue and Google Cloud sales both fell short of analysts’ estimates, driving the shares down about 1% in extended trading. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has tried to keep Alphabet’s revenue engine chugging along by prioritising three areas: e-commerce, YouTube, and cloud computing. That helped the internet giant rebound from a dour 2020 when some marketers pared their budgets as they coped with the initial shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the most recent quarter, the retail, travel, and media and entertainment industries heavily advertised on Google’s platforms, the company said. Still, the company’s fortunes remain highly dependent on macroeconomic factors, including supply-chain doldrums that have plagued nearly every industry and could bite retailers and ad companies during the holiday shopping season. The Mountain View, California-based company also has been let down by its video platform YouTube and its cloud arm, both of which are meant to help it diversify away from the core search engine that brings in most of its revenue.The shares fell as low as $2,700 in extended trading after closing at $2,786.17. The stock has jumped 59% this year.Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call that Apple Inc.’s anti-tracking app privacy features had a “modest impact on YouTube’s revenues” in the quarter.Alphabet’s profit was $27.99 a share in the third quarter, beating the average estimate of $23.50. But YouTube ad revenue came in at just $7.2 billion. Analysts were looking for the world’s most popular video-sharing site to generate about $7.5 billion.Sales from the company’s cloud division rose to $4.99 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion. While the unit has gained some market share under Thomas Kurian, it still lags far behind leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp. Pichai said he believes the unit has “continued momentum” on the call. “It was modestly off of the street’s estimate, but we feel very good with the momentum,” Porat said on a call with reporters. “We are very pleased with the ongoing progress across the board, the product innovation, the buildout of our teams, and the strength across verticals.”Alphabet also repurchased $12.6 billion in shares last quarter and said its employee base grew to 150,028, up 18,000 from a year earlier. Porat pledged on the earnings call to continue investing in servers, real estate, and headcount for Google Services and the cloud division. The executive also warned that sales from Google’s app store would suffer from the company reducing its commission this summer after pressure from regulators and software developers. “Google Play’s contribution to revenue growth will remain more muted given the ongoing impact of both lapping the increased level of user engagement that started in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic, as well as the fee change that took effect on July 1,” Porat said on the call. Search and other related businesses generated third-quarter sales of $37.9 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $36.7 billion.“They are benefiting still from some of the commerce moving online because of the pandemic,” Mark Ballard, a researcher at marketing performance firm Tinuiti, said in an interview ahead of the results.Google recently launched its line of Pixel 6 smartphones, the company’s latest effort to break into the competitive consumer-electronics market. But like other manufacturers, Google’s hardware unit is dealing with difficulties getting enough supplies, Porat said.“We’ve been risk-managing the supply-chain challenges well,” Porat said. “We are working closely with suppliers and logistics partners to plan and pivot when and where we need. With the strong reviews and demand on the Pixel 6, we do expect some supply constraints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-growth-marred-by-disappointing-result-in-youtube-cloud-computing-sectors-101635298729129.html
27-10-2021||World||Brazil senators back criminal charges against Bolsonaro over Covid-19 response||A Brazilian Senate committee recommended on Tuesday that president Jair Bolsonaro face a series of criminal indictments for actions and omissions related to the world’s second-highest Covid-19 death toll.The 7-to-4 vote by the 11-member committee ended its six-month investigation of the government’s handling of the pandemic and calls for prosecutors to put Bolsonaro on trial for charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting crime to misuse of public funds and crimes against humanity.Sen. Omar Aziz, the chairman of the inquiry, said he will deliver it to the prosecutor-general Wednesday morning.More than 600,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Brazil. Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing.The Brazilian Senate committee voted on a report, the culmination of the 11-member committee’s six-month investigation of the government's handling of the pandemic. It called for Bolsonaro to face charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting crime to misuse of public funds and crimes against humanity, and so hold him responsible for many of Brazil’s more than 600,000 Covid-19 deaths.Once approved, the decision on whether to file charges is now up to Brazil’s prosecutor-general, a Bolsonaro appointee who is widely viewed as protecting the president. The allegation of crimes against humanity would need to be pursued by the International Criminal Court.Regardless of whether the report leads to charges, it is expected to fuel criticism of the divisive president, whose approval ratings have slumped ahead of his 2022 reelection campaign — in large part because of Brazil’s outsize Covid-19 death toll. The investigation itself has for months provided a drumbeat of damaging allegations.Since the start of the pandemic, Bolsonaro has sabotaged local leaders' restrictions on activity aimed at stopping the virus' spread, saying the economy needed to keep humming so the poor did not suffer worse hardship. He also has insistently touted an anti-malaria drug long after broad testing showed it isn't effective against Covid-19, assembled crowds without wearing masks, and sowed doubt about vaccines.Bolsonaro has defended himself by saying he was among the world's only leaders courageous enough to defy political correctness and global health recommendations, and that he hasn't erred in the slightest.Report author Sen. Renan Calheiros first presented the nearly 1,200-page report last week. It says that by insisting on treatment with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as “practically the only government policy to fight the pandemic, Jair Bolsonaro strongly collaborated for Covid-19's spread in Brazilian territory" and as a result is "the main person responsible for the errors committed by the federal government during the pandemic.”Committee members in the so-called “G7” group of senators who aren’t from Bolsonaro’s base agreed on most of the points in Calheiros' report. They met Monday to hammer out final adjustments to the text.Changes include recommending charges for 13 additional people, many of them former or current Health Ministry employees, as well as the governor of hard-hit Amazonas state, according to Calheiros. The final report recommends charges against two companies and 79 people, including Bolsonaro, current and former members of his administration, dozens of allies, and the president’s three sons, who are politicians.It also adds an additional violation for allegedly spreading false news following Bolsonaro's live broadcast on social media last week claiming incorrectly that people in the U.K. who received two vaccine doses are developing AIDS faster than expected, the senator told the AP.Committee approval is needed before the report goes to the office of Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras, who could ask the Supreme Court for authorization to carry the investigation forward and eventually pursue charges. His office said the report will be carefully reviewed as soon as it is received.The report also contains recommendations for two counts of "crime of responsibility”, which are grounds for impeachment. Lower House Speaker Arthur Lira, a staunch Bolsonaro ally, would need to bring a vote on whether to open impeachment proceedings. That's highly unlikely, considering Lira is currently sitting on more than 120 other impeachment requests, according to information from the Lower House.Bolsonaro’s son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, told journalists Tuesday the report is legally weak and politically motivated.“The intent of some senators on the investigative committee is to cause the maximum amount of wear and tear on the president,” he said.An earlier draft of Calheiros' report had recommended the president also be indicted for homicide and genocide, but that was scrapped even before its presentation last week. Some committee members opposed their inclusion while others expressed concern that bombastic claims could undermine the report’s credibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-senators-back-criminal-charges-against-bolsonaro-over-covid-19-response-101635294414012.html
27-10-2021||World||World on track for 2.7°C temp rise this century, warns UN||The world is on track for an average temperature rise of 2.7°C this century if the only steps on climate action it takes are the commitments announced till now, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Tuesday, a fresh warning ahead of the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) later this month.The 2.7°C breaches the Paris Agreement’s target of 2°C and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been warning of catastrophic consequences if the planet is allowed to warm beyond an average temperature of 2°C compared to pre-industrial age levels.According to the UNEP’s ‘Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On’, the updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by various countries and other commitments made for action till 2030 will only reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 7.5% compared to the previous round of commitments in 2015. Reductions of 30% are needed to meet Paris Agreement’s 2°C goal and 55% to keep global warming under 1.5° C, it added.As of September 30, 120 countries, representing just over half of global greenhouse gas emissions, had communicated new or updated NDCs. UNEP has also considered announcements of new mitigation pledges for 2030 by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea which have not yet been submitted as NDCs for analysis in the report.India is also among countries that hasn’t announced an updated NDC or announced an enhanced target as yet.There is a 66% chance of hitting global warming of 2.7°C by end of the century with the present formally submitted and announced NDCs. “To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we have eight years to take an additional 28 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions, over and above what is promised in the updated NDCs and other commitments - equivalent to almost halving current greenhouse gas emissions,” the report warned.“Today I have bad news. Less than one week before COP26 in Glasgow, we are still on track for climate catastrophe. The 2021 Emissions Gap Report shows that even with present Nationally Determined Contributions and other commitments of countries around the world, we are indeed on track for a catastrophic global temperature rise of around 2.7°C,” UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres said during the launch of the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-on-track-for-2-7-c-temp-rise-this-century-warns-un-101635289977647.html
27-10-2021||World||FDA advisers back Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11||The US moved a step closer to expanding Covid-19 vaccinations for millions more children as a panel of government advisers on Tuesday endorsed kid-size doses of Pfizer's shots for 5- to 11-year-olds.A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted unanimously, with one abstention, that the vaccine’s benefits in preventing Covid-19 in that age group outweigh any potential risks — including a heart-related side effect that's been very rare in teens and young adults despite their use of a much higher shot dose.While children are at lower risk of severe Covid-19 than older people, ultimately many panelists decided it's important to give parents the choice to protect their youngsters — especially those at high risk of illness or who live in places where other precautions, like masks in schools, aren't being used.The virus is “not going away. We have to find a way to live with it and I think the vaccines give us a way to do that,” said FDA adviser Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas.“I do think it’s a relatively close call,” said adviser Dr. Eric Rubin of Harvard University. “It’s really going to be a question of what the prevailing conditions are but we’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it.”The FDA isn’t bound by the panel’s recommendation and is expected to make its own decision within days.If the FDA authorizes the kid-size doses, there’s still another step: Next week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have to decide whether to recommend the shots and which youngsters should get them.Full-strength shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech already are recommended for everyone 12 and older but pediatricians and many parents are clamoring for protection for younger children. The extra-contagious delta variant has caused an alarming rise in pediatric infections -- and families are frustrated with school quarantines and having to say no to sleepovers and other rites of childhood to keep the virus at bay.States are getting ready to roll out shots for little arms -- in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine -- as soon as the government gives the OK. More than 25,000 pediatricians and other primary care providers have signed up so far to offer vaccination.While there is less Covid-19 among 5- to 11-year-olds, they still have faced substantial illness -- including over 8,300 hospitalizations reported, about a third requiring intensive care, and nearly 100 deaths.A study of elementary schoolchildren found the Pfizer shots are nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection -- even though the youngsters received just a third of the dose given to teens and adults.Pfizer’s study tracked 2,268 children ages 5 to 11 who got two shots three weeks apart of either a placebo or the kid dose. Vaccinated youngsters developed levels of virus-fighting antibodies just as strong as teens and young adults who got the full-strength shots.The kid dosage also proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary side effects — such as sore arms, fever or achiness — that teens experience. At FDA’s request, Pfizer more recently enrolled another 2,300 youngsters into the study, and preliminary safety data has shown no red flags.The study isn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose, mostly in young men and teen boys.Statistical models developed by FDA scientists showed that in most scenarios of the continuing pandemic, the vaccine would prevent far more Covid-19 hospitalizations in this age group than would potentially be caused by that very rare side effect, heart inflammation, that's the big unknown.But with cases falling across the US, the FDA panel had to consider whether the pandemic might recede so much that more children could face side effects from the vaccine than would be protected from Covid-19.“If the trends continue the way they are going then the emergency for children is not what we might think it might be,” said Dr. James Hildreth of Meharry Medical College.Moderna also is studying its vaccine in young children, and Pfizer has additional studies underway in those younger than 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-advisers-back-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-ages-5-to-11-101635280110234.html

India has paid for five and they are expected to be delivered this year.Under CAATSA, a defence deal becomes sanctionable as soon as the purchased equipment is delivered - as it happened when Turkey, a NATO ally, received its S-400s in December 2020.India expects it will be exempted from sanctions for several reasons. It began negotiating the purchase before CAATSA became law in 2017 and there was not a counter-offer from the United States at the time. The US subsequently offered Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Patriot Advance Capability (PAC-3) in 2019, by which time the S-400 deal had been finalised.There is also a hope in New Delhi that the United States will not jeopardise the relationship, which is booming, by imposing sanctions on India.While the Trump administration gave no assurances, former secretary of defence Jim Mattis had argued for India and Vietnam to be exempted from CAATSA sanctions saying they have been cutting their dependence on Russia military hardware and sanctions could prove counter-productive.The Biden administration has not made any public remarks on the issue, but secretary of defence Lloyd Austin did raise the issue of S-400 during his visit to New Delhi in March 2021.Robert Menendez, the Democrat who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had urged Austin to raise the issue during his India visit. The senator is a Russia hawk and has pushed for CAATSA sanctions to be used to discourage countries from buying Russian defence equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-admin-to-exempt-india-from-caatsa-curbs-101635273916480.html

Sajjan’s departure from defence, which he held since 2015, was widely expected as he was criticised for the institutional sexual misconduct crisis that erupted in the Canadian Armed Forces under his watch.Meanwhile, outgoing foreign minister Marc Garneau has not returned to the cabinet and has been replaced by Melanie Joly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-anita-anand-appointed-canada-s-defence-minister-101635270616152.html
27-10-2021||World||Imran Khan names new ISI chief ending standoff with Pakistan Army||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday approved the appointment of Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the next chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, ending an unprecedented standoff on the issue with the powerful army.The differences between Khan and the army over the appointment had resulted in speculation about the future of the government headed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. There were even fears in political circles about a change at the highest levels of the government if the army decided not to continue propping up Khan.A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office in Islamabad said Khan had “seen and approved the appointment” of Anjum as the director-general of the ISI from November 20. It added that the current ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, would continue to hold the post till November 19.The face-off between Khan and the army began when the military issued a statement to the media on October 6 naming Anjum as the next ISI chief, replacing Hameed.According to convention, the army forwards the names of three lieutenant generals to the prime minister, who picks one as the ISI director-general. Though the formal announcement about the choice is made by the PM, it is widely understood that the army chief conveys which of the three officers should be picked for the post.Under a reshuffle announced by the army on October 6, Hameed was to be moved out of the ISI to head Peshawar-based XI Corps. A stint in an operational command is needed to put Hameed in contention for becoming army chief after the current chief, Gen Qamar Bajwa, completes his extended term in November 2022.Khan, however, continued to hold up a formal announcement about the next ISI chief as different theories did the rounds in Pakistan. Some said Khan believes Hameed should be retained as the ISI chief for an extended period because of the role he played in shaping developments in Afghanistan and in liaising with the Taliban.After differences emerged among the Haqqani Network and other Taliban factions over forming a setup in Kabul, Hameed rushed to Kabul to cobble together an interim cabinet that put hardliners in control.There was speculation that Khan’s wife, a pirni or spiritual guide, had suggested the time was not auspicious to make a change in the ISI. Similar speculation swirled again on Tuesday over the move to retain Hameed as the ISI chief till November 19.Though Hameed accompanied foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on his recent first visit to Kabul since the Taliban assumed power in mid-August, the ISI chief did not join Khan for a visit to Saudi Arabia last week as had been anticipated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-names-new-isi-chief-ending-standoff-with-pakistan-army-101635254895221.html

27-10-2021||India||Schools, colleges reopen in New Delhi for all from Nov 1, online option to stay||Schools in the Capital can resume physical classes for all standards from November 1, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday, after a decision by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) that was based on the marked improvement in the Covid-19 situation in the city. Delhi added 38 new Covid-19 cases and there were no additional deaths on Wednesday, according to data from the state government’s daily health bulletin. The positivity rate of samples tested was 0.06 %, a level where it has remained for months now.Sisodia, who is also the Delhi education minister, said that suspension of in-person classes is “affecting the overall growth of the children”.“The government, the officials in the DDMA and experts are of the opinion that suspension or in-person classes in schools are tremendously affecting overall growth in children. The Authority feels it is now safe to restart schools fully. From November 1, all public and private schools will be allowed to open all classes for in-person attendance,” Sisodia said at a news briefing after the DDMA meeting.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the vice chairperson of DDMA, and experts including Niti Ayog member (health), VK Paul, and National Centre for Disease Control director, Dr SK Singh, were also present at the DDMA meeting chaired by Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. Sisodia said parents will not be forced to send their children to school and classes will continue in a hybrid mode. “No parent will be forced to send their children to schools. Online classes will continue,” Sisodia said, adding that all other educational institutions can also reopen from Monday. Schools in Delhi have been shut since March last year when Covid-19 cases first started rising in the country. Classes resumed for a brief period in January and February this year, but were suspended as the brutal second wave (fourth for the Capital) of Covid-19 took hold in March-April. The government allowed the resumption of physical classes for students of standards 9 to 12 and colleges from September 1, with strict Covid-19 protocols. Sisodia noted that while the Covid-19 situation in the Capital is under control, people should not become complacent during the upcoming festive season. “COVID situation is under control but considering the situation in few countries at present and the upcoming festivals, there is need to be cautious and not let our guard down,” he said. The government has directed schools to ensure there is not more than 50% attendance once physical classes resume. “Schools will have to ensure that not more than 50 percent of the students in a class should be called to schools and all the staff is required to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible,” Sisodia said. Citing figures shared in the DDMA meeting, Sisodia said that around 98% of the teaching and non-teaching staff has received at least of one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.“Almost all schools staff in the city have taken at least one dose of the vaccine by now. We are trying to achieve 100% vaccination in this regard at the earliest,” he said.At present, India’s vaccination drive only covers adults, with just one vaccine – Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D -- getting an approval for use in children above 12 years of age. Once the vaccination drive opens for children, those with comorbidities will be given priority, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) had said earlier.On the concerns about a possible third wave, Sisodia said, “If the situation turns bad, schools can always be asked to go back to online mode. It will depend on the situation.”At a DDMA meeting on September 29, a panel tasked with chalking out a detailed plan and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for reopening schools had noted that there has been no reported instance of any increased local transmission of Covid-19 in Delhi due to the reopening of schools for Classes 9 to 12.The panel had also suggested reopening schools from October 1 noting that the attendance of students from senior classes has increased up to 80 percent.However, in line with the suggestions of experts, DDMA decided not to reopen schools at that time in view of the upcoming festivals. Allowing only 50 percent students per classroom, mandatory thermal screening, staggered lunch breaks, an alternate seating arrangement and avoiding routine guest visits were among the guidelines announced by the DDMA for the reopening of schools and colleges from September 1.The decision to reopen schools drew mixed reactions from parents and teachers. Administrations of many schools said that it was unlikely schools will reopen next week. Madhulika Sen, senior adviser at Tagore International School, said arranging transport facilities will be a major problem. “If we are to call back students of all grades, arranging transport will be a major factor. We have to maintain physical distancing in buses as well and with 50% seating capacity in buses as well as classrooms, the expenses will go up. We have to see if parents can manage those expenses or not. If we have staggered timings for other classes, it will be challenging to run bus services. Logistically it will be quite difficult. Planning this will take time and reopening on November 1 is out of the question,” she said.“Primary classes could be started from December based on our experience of calling students of classes 6 to 8 from November. Many schools are also functioning as vaccination centres and that too should be phased out of school premises so that schools can function completely just as educational institutes. Due to reduced seating capacity, we cannot call all students together so we will have to call classes on alternate days. This way, students can attend classes at least thrice a week,” said Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of the government school principals’ association.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-colleges-reopen-in-new-delhi-for-all-from-nov-1-online-option-to-stay-101635359019293.html
27-10-2021||India||Teacher held for pro-Pakistan post in Rajasthan||A private school teacher in Rajasthan’s Udaipur district was arrested on Wednesday, a day after she was terminated by the school management for allegedly posting a WhatsApp status celebrating Pakistan’s victory in a T20 World Cup match against India on October 24, police said, adding that she was released on bail by a local court. Narpat Singh, circle inspector, AmbaMata police station, said the teacher was arrested under Section 153 (B) (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on Wednesday. She was later produced before a court and was released on bail. Her alleged WhatsApp status generated huge backlash on social media, after a school student’s parent questioned her patriotism. She was subsequently terminated by the school management. She released an apology, claiming her WhatsApp status was misunderstood and taken out of context. “As the message [from the parent] had emojis and it was in light moments, I replied in Yes. But it doesn’t mean anywhere that I support Pakistan. I am an Indian and I love India. I love India as much as everyone else,” the teacher said in her apology. She further said, “As soon as I realised that I had made a mistake, I deleted the status message... realising it was giving a wrong message. I am sorry if I have hurt anybody’s sentiments.” Senior Congress leader Archana Sharma said it was a legal issue and law will take its own course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teacher-held-for-pro-pakistan-post-in-rajasthan-101635358358899.html

Stalin was responding to Vijayan’s letter received on October 24 raising the issue of floods and landslides and fearing that the water would accumulate in the dam as rainfall intensified. He had said that there was an urgent need for the gradual release of water from the dam through the tunnel to Tamil Nadu.Stalin in his response said that the water level as of 9.00 am on October 27 is 137.60 feet, with an inflow of 2300 cusecs. “We are already drawing the maximum quantity of water through the tunnel in Vaigai Dam, as requested in your letter. Currently, 2300 cusecs of water is being drawn through the tunnel to Vaigai basin since 8.00 am today,” Stalin said. “The current water level is well within the storage level compliant with the upper rule levels approved by the CWC (Cauvery Water Commission).”The Tamil Nadu CM said that the state is monitoring the water level closely and the officials are in constant touch with the team from Kerala. “I have discussed the position with the concerned officials and have directed them to continue to closely monitor the water levels and regulate the outflow accordingly,” he said. “In addition, I have specifically asked them to share in advance, all the necessary information on water position and release, if any, so that your government can initiate such precautionary measures needed before the release of water.” The construction of the Mullaiperiyar Dam started in the 1880s following a famine, and is considered an engineering marvel. The dam was opened in 1895 but the water and issues over the dam continue to be a dispute between Tamil Nadu and Kerala to this day.Stalin assured Vijayan that the TN government will ensure that the interests of both states and people are well safeguarded in an effort to strengthen the ties between the neighbouring states. “The Government of Tamil Nadu and our people are very concerned about the floods and the resultant damage suffered by Kerala and its people in the last 10 days. I wish to assure you that we will stand with you during these difficult times and will extend any help that is needed for alleviating the sufferings of the people,” he said. “In this regard, I have already instructed the Collectors of the border districts of our state to extend all help and ensure the supply of all items needed for flood relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-responds-to-kerala-cm-s-request-assures-him-of-help-to-tackle-floods-landslides-101635357880199.html

The BJP leader also hailed Singh’s efforts to resolve the farmers’ issues, who have been protesting at Delhi’s borders against the Union government’s three farm laws.“The Centre has been always open to talks with farmers and has welcomed any intervention to resolve the deadlock,” news agency PTI quoted Chugh as saying in a statement.Expressing his appreciation for Singh’s support to the extension of the Border Security Force’s jurisdiction in the state, Chugh said, “Amarinder Singh is [a] soldier and taking an appropriate stand on the issue of national security. We understand Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu's sympathy for Pakistan but it is tragic that he is not sensitive to the national security concerns of a border state.” Earlier, Singh had expressed his backing for the BJP government’s move to extend the jurisdiction of the forces, PTI reported.Also read | Punjab Congress chief Sidhu calls Capt Amarinder ‘spent cartridge’The remarks from the BJP general secretary came as Singh had earlier in the day confirmed that he is in the process of forming his own political party. “Yes, I will be forming a new party. The name will be announced once the Election Commission clears it, along with the symbol. My lawyers are working on it,” news agency ANI quoted the former CM as saying.Singh had already expressed his willingness to have an alliance with the BJP in the assembly polls slated for next year in the state, conditional that the farmers' issue was resolved. The BJP too had reciprocated that the party would wait for him to announce his party, however, said it was open to alliance with anyone who puts the nation’s interest first.Notably, he also said that he would meet with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday to discuss the three contentious laws. “Tomorrow we are taking some people with us, around 25-30 people, and we will be meeting the Home Minister on this issue,” he said. The meeting would be the second between the two, with the first meeting that happened last month regarding the same issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-welcomes-amarinder-singh-s-intervention-in-resolving-deadlock-with-protesting-farmers-101635356223730.html
27-10-2021||India||HT This Day: 28 Oct 1947 – Kashmir accedes to India||- PLEBISCITE SOON ON RULER'S DECISION- SHEIKH ABDULLA TO FORM INTERIM GOVT.- UNION TROOPS RUSHED FOR PROTECTION OF STATE  New Delhi- In view of grave emergency the Maharaja of Kashmir has acceded to the Indian Dominion. In a letter to Lord Mountbatten he declares that "the other alternative is to leave my State and my people to freebooters." He adds: "This alternative I will never allow to happen so long as I am the Ruler of the State and I have life to defend my country."The Maharaja has also stated that he has decided to invite Sheikh Abdulla to form an Interim Government to work with-the Prime Minister.Lord Mountbatten, accepting the accession, has stated: "It is my Government's wish that as soon as law and order have been restored in Kashmir and her soil cleared of the invader, the question of the State's accession should be settled by a reference to the people." Lord Mountbatten added that Indian troops had been sent to defend the State and "to protect the lives, property and honour of your people."That Kashmir has been thus saved is the result of quick moves on the political chessboard. Indian troops left by air in batches for Srinagar this morning. They immediately took position at the aerodrome and in the capital of Kashmir and thereafter proceeded to Baramula where they engaged the raiders. It is generally agreed that the troops have shown great enterprise and done, a fine piece of Job.Mr. Mehrchand Mahajan, Mr. V, P. Menon and Sheikh Abdulla left early this morning for Jammu to see the Maharaja. Mr. Menon returned this evening with the Instrument of Accession duly executed by the Maharaja, and immediately thereafter met the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and the Minister for States. The first news of the accession was announced over the radio and it caused widespread relief since there has been a great deal of anxiety about the safety of the people in Srinagar.Pakistan Leaders OutwittedApparently, the Pakistan leaders have been outwitted. Mr Jinnah's arrival in Lahore and the Pakistan Defence Secretary visit to Peshawar were timed to coincide with the startling developments in Kashmir.It is said that the attitude of Sheikh Abdulla and his colleagues and followers of the National Conference has been the most heartening aspect of the situation. The great leader of Kashmiris set his face sternly against the invaders and pledged his party's full support to the Maharaja to throw out foreigners. He did not bargain in the crisis but placed his services unreservedly at the disposal of the Maharaja.The Government of India, too, has set a fine example by declaring that even though Kashmir had acceded to the Indian Dominion it would still stand by the wishes of the people. This stand further strengthens its case in regard to Junagadh and Hyderabad and considerably enhances its moral stature.Coloured Version By B.B.C.Considerable surprise is expressed in New Delhi at the one-sided version that is being daily put out by B.B.C. of developments in Kashmir. Even today it stated that the revolt is of the local Muslim population of Kashmir, whereas the emergency has been caused by the attack from outside and as stated by the Maharaja, "the people of my State, both Muslims and non-Muslims, generally have taken no part at all."Pt. Dwarkanath Kachru, Private Secretary to Pandit Nehru, is flying tomorrow morning for Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-28-oct-1947-kashmir-accedes-to-india-101635356076783.html
27-10-2021||India||Talks with China to resolve border crisis to continue, says Rajnath Singh||Dialogue with China for a peaceful resolution of the border crisis in Ladakh will continue with Indian troops standing firm in the sensitive sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday even as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has stepped up its activities not only in the Ladakh area but also in the eastern sector including Arunachal Pradesh. He made the comments on the situation along the northern borders while addressing the army brass during the ongoing commanders’ conference, which is focused on a raft of issues with border developments being right at the top.“It is our national responsibility to ensure availability of best weapons, equipment and clothing to our troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend our territorial integrity,” he said. India and China have been locked in a border standoff for over 17 months in the Ladakh sector, and in the midst of that row PLA has scaled up its military activities in the east. PLA has intensified patrolling in sensitive areas across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh after the lingering standoff with India began last year in the Ladakh sector, and has ramped up area domination patrols for surveillance and orientation of newly inducted troops with a noticeable increase in visits by senior PLA officers to forward areas to supervise the military activities, as previously reported. The sectors across which the Indian Army has detected PLA’s increased operational tempo include Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La -- areas of high historical significance in the context of Chinese aggression in the eastern sector -- and counter measures have been taken to boost India’s readiness to handle any contingency. The 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with PLA not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army. The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, in early August. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each deployed in Ladakh. The bi-annual army commanders’ conference is focusing on several issues including the situation along the country’s borders, security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir, organisational restructuring, logistics, administration and human resource management, the defence ministry said in a statement. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane is chairing the four-day conference that ends on Thursday. If the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre so is the Indian Army, Naravane said on October 9, referring to the military build-up and infrastructure development across LAC. The conference also comes days after Naravane visited the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir for a security review after several soldiers were killed in a counter-terror operation, and renewed infiltration attempts by Pakistani terrorists are being witnessed along the Line of Control after a temporary lull following the renewal of a ceasefire pact with Pakistan in February 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-with-china-to-resolve-border-crisis-to-continue-says-rajnath-singh-101635355058675.html
27-10-2021||India||‘No in-camera hearing for appeal against Tarun Tejpal for now but…’: Bombay HC||PANAJI: The Bombay High Court on Wednesday will on November 16 hear arguments on the maintainability of the appeal filed by the Goa government against the acquittal of former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal in a case of rape and sexual harassment of a junior colleague. On Wednesday, Tejpal told the court of justices Revati Dere and MS Jawalkar that he was challenging the maintainability of the plea and also pressing his application that the appeal hearings be heard in-camera and not in open court as has been the case so far. However, the court was not inclined to consider the application for the in-camera hearing “at this stage” and decided to hear arguments on the appeal’s maintainability on November 16. In his written response, Tejpal’s lawyer Amit Desai said, “We have raised that squarely the maintainability of the appeal is defective, not in consonance with the requirement of 378 CrPC,” Desai said, referring to the criminal procedure code that relates to the filing of appeals in case of acquittal.Desai said the appeal was filed prematurely even before a copy of the written order of the trial court judgement was made available and the prosecution bypassed due procedures in filing its appeal in the rush.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who is arguing the case on behalf of the prosecution, told the court that there were no irregularities in the filing of the appeal and that he will provide a detailed response on Mehta, the central government’s second most-senior law officer, also reiterated his opposition to an in-camera hearing and went on to criticise the May 21 verdict by additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi, arguing that it was archaic, belonged to the 5th century and was deeply unfair to the survivor who he said, was subjected to naming and shaming in the judgment.The high court, which made it reluctance clear to go for in-camera proceedings, however, ordered the lawyers not to read out the sensitive portions of the trial court judgement or statements by witnesses and the rape survivor in open court but told them to restrict themselves to written arguments when it comes to sensitive portions.Tejpal was accused of raping a junior colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal raped her in a lift of the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court which delivered its verdict this year.In her ruling, the judge gave Tejpal, who faced charges of sections 376 (rape), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (criminal assault with intent to disrobe a woman), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code, the benefit of the doubt and acquitted him on the ground that the prosecution did not produce sufficient evidence to back up its charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-in-camera-hearing-for-appeal-against-tarun-tejpal-for-now-but-bombay-hc-101635353380312.html
27-10-2021||India||The curious mix of power subsidies and politics||As the next election cycle nears, politicians are once again promising cheap, even free electricity, to voters. After he assumed charge as the chief minister of Punjab, Charanjit Singh Channi burnt copies of electricity bills and announced restoration of power connections which were disconnected for non-payment of bills. And the Aam Admi Party (AAP), which used the free-power promise effectively in Delhi, is making similar promises in states such as Punjab and Uttarakhand. While there are some benefits to these policies, they can be detrimental in the long term. Here’s why.Who pays for power subsidies in the end? There really is no such thing as a free lunch. Power distribution companies (Discoms) which buy electricity from electricity producers (Gencos) are obliged to pay for it at commercial rates. When governments offer cheap or free power to households or farmers, they have to compensate Discoms for the residual amount. This is done in two ways. State governments subsidise or end up taking over the debt of Discoms. This is what happened in the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojna (UDAY) when state governments floated bonds worth ₹2.32 lakh crores to retire the accumulated debt of Discoms. Another way in which governments recover the costs of cheap tariffs is by cross-subsidising, which means they raise the price of power for other consumers. In the end, it is the consumer who ends up paying, as commercial users pass on these costs. An October 13 research note by Pranjul Bhandari and others from HSBC Capital Markets and Research has given estimates of this cross-subsidisation of electricity prices in India. The note shows that cross-subsidisation is not enough to recover the costs, creating the burden of large unpaid dues.See Chart 1: cross-subsidy in electricity Outstanding dues to Discoms are worth more than the yearly cost of MGNREGS Latest data from ministry of power portal (PRAAPTI) shows that total non-disputed payment owed by Discoms in various states to Gencos stood at ₹1.01 lakh crore on October 22. This was ₹79,112 crore at the beginning of the fiscal year. This is more than what is spent on the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Programme in a year. The total overdue payments are divided into two categories: those due for a maximum of 60 days; and those pending for over 60 days. This classification matters because the Discoms are given 60 days credit by Gencos . After that the latter charge penal interest on the outstanding dues in most cases. The electricity portal data shows share of overdue payments which are delayed by more than 60 days has increased by 8 percentage points since the beginning of this year and now account for 80% of the total dues. See Chart 2A and 2B: Dues owed to Gencos and their break-up by 60-day threshold What is causing this delay in payments by Discoms? According to Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA , the delays in payments to Gencos can be attributed to weak operating efficiencies and financials of the Discoms. Various factors contribute to this. Power tariffs are inadequate in relation to their cost of supply because they are set lower . Sometimes, this is because of inadequacy of tariffs in relation to their cost of supply because of delays in the approval of tariff orders by regulators. There is also the inadequacy of and delays in subsidy payments by state governments, he added. According to a March report from ICRA, subsidy payments by governments were estimated to comprise 16% of discom revenues at an all -India level in 2021-22. A recent Economic and Political Weekly paper by Amandeep Kaur and others on state level performance of Discoms shows a worsening of financial parameters of over the years. The paper points out that the gap between the average cost of supply (ACS) per unit of power and the per unit average revenue realised (ARR) by utilities increased from ₹0.27 in October 2018 to ₹0.58 per unit Kwh in January. Also, the average aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) by Discoms increased from 19.93% of total energy input received in May 2017 to 26.15% in January(compared to the intended target of 15% under UDAY scheme). The HSBC note referred to earlier notes that a turnaround in financial health of Discoms is a must for India’s transition to a low carbon-emission economy. “Transmission networks need to be upgraded with ancillary services and storage to successfully raise the share of renewable energy over time (this is needed to manage the sudden change in frequencies and supply associated with renewable power). The weak financials of the Discoms also impact other players in the energy arena. Because the Discoms don’t want to let go of paying customers such as corporates, they impose restrictions via policy flip-flops and ad-hoc charges to discourage the private sector from directly sourcing renewable power.” See Chart 3: AT&C and ARR-ACS gap for Discoms Which states are the worst offenders? Data for October shows that Discoms in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have the highest share of overdue payments to Gencos. While these three states comprise 50% of overdue payments, they are not the ones that have the highest share in overdue payments that are delayed for more than 60 days. Discoms owe over 50% of their overdue amount to independent power producers (IPP) followed by central public sector undertakings (CPSEs). The highest overdue amount is owed to Adani Power (25,611 crore) which comprise around 25% of overall dues to Gencos. See Chart 4: Share of states in pending payments to Discoms How do such moves affect state finances? According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA ratings, “Waiver of electricity bills or other forms of subsidy provided by a state government add to its revenue expenditure, thereby widening the fiscal deficit”. The amount owed by Discoms in 27 states (for whom 2019-20 domestic product and fiscal data is available on CMIE) accounted for 18.4% of the total fiscal deficit of these states. This is a burden which will ultimately show up in state government’s ability to spend money on other heads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-curious-mix-of-power-subsidies-and-politics-101635353079921.html

Also, the police urged the people to maintain peace, ANI reported.Meanwhile, security has been ramped up in the district following the violence and all mosques have been provided with police protection, news agency PTI reported citing the police. “All the mosques across the state are under security cover now. We are keeping a vigil on the situation,” PTI quoted Director General of Police VS Yadav as saying. The official also said that the situation was “peaceful” in North Tripura except for some stray incidents.He also said that miscreants had tried to disrupt the state’s communal harmony by attacking places of religious worship but could not succeed due to deployment of security forces. “Some miscreants were active to disrupt the communal harmony and malign the image of the government. But the police always remained active,” he said.North Tripura superintendent of police Bhanupada Chakraborty said that three houses and a few shops, reportedly owned by members of the minority community, were also vandalised during the violence in Rowa Bazar, near Chamtilla. “Now the situation in North Tripura district is peaceful. We have beefed up security and police protection for all mosques in the district.

27-10-2021||India||Latest Agni-V launch successful, boosts deterrence against China||India on Wednesday announced that it carried out the latest test of the 5,000 km range Agni-V missile from the APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast, a significant step towards boosting the nuclear deterrence against China. The successful test of the Agni-V missile is in line with India’s stated policy to have credible minimum deterrence that underpins the commitment to no first use, the defence ministry said in a statement. The missile, which is being inducted into the Strategic Forces Command (SFC), will put India’s credible minimum deterrence on a firm footing as no missile in the Indian arsenal has the range to strike targets deep inside China. “The missile, which uses a three-stage solid fuelled engine, is capable of striking targets at ranges up to 5,000 km with a very high degree of accuracy,” the statement added. The missile has been tested several times after its maiden launch almost a decade ago. The latest test comes at a time when India and China are locked in a border row in the Ladakh sector, and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has also scaled up its military activities in the eastern sector, including Arunachal Pradesh. India completed its nuclear trial in 2018 when the indigenous nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arihant, successfully completed its first deterrence patrol. India has the capability to carry out nuclear strikes with fighter planes, land-launched missiles and from the sea. The Agni series of ballistic missiles and warplanes such as Rafales, Sukhoi-30s and Mirage-2000s can deliver nuclear warheads. The 6,000-tonne Arihant, which means destroyer of enemies, is armed with 12 B-05 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) capable of delivering nuclear warheads up to 750 km away. India is also developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence. In September 2021, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) carried out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time from the Odisha coast. Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-manoeuvring hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/latest-agni-v-launch-successful-boosts-deterrence-against-china-101635350318419.html

NCB says ‘unreachable’||Narcotics Control Bureau deputy director-general Gyaneshwar Singh, who is heading the vigilance probe into the extortion allegations against Sameer Wankhede on Wednesday said the investigators could not reach KP Gosavi and Prabhakar Sail, the two key persons linked with the case. Many other people have been served notice to appear before the investigating team, but Gosavi and Sail were not available on the contacts on NCB's record, Singh said."We have tried our best to contact them but could not. Through the media I would like to tell them they are free to join in two days and give evidence to special inquiry team which has been staying at CRPF mess at Bandra (West)," Singh said.Sameer Wankhede quizzed for 4 hours; drugs case probe to continue under himKP Gosavi was a witness of the NCB in the Aryan Khan case. After Aryan was arrested from the cruise rave party, Gosavi clicked a photo with him and shared it on social media, which went viral. Since then, Gosavi who claims to be an independent investigator and NCB's independent witness in the Aryan Khan case is in the news. His former aide Prabhakar Sail claimed that he was made a witness in the Aryan Khan case where he was made to sign on blank papers by Sameer Wankhede. Citing some telephonic conversation between Gosavi and another person that he overheard, Sail said there was an arrangement of getting ₹25 crore in exchange for Aryan's release. Of the amount, Sameer Wankhede was supposed to get some, Sail had alleged.After making the allegations, Sail met a senior Mumbai Police official on Monday and sought police protection. Minister Dilip Walse-Patil said Sail was accorded police security.Meanwhile, KP Gosavi created a stir on Monday as he announced that he would surrender at Mandiaon police station in Lucknow 'any moment'. He also said that he was feeling threatened in Mumbai. However, he did not surrender and, according to the NCB, both are now untraceable."We tried to contact both Sail and Gosavi, one house was closed while the other address could not be verified. We also tried to contact one witness through his advocate but could not trace him," Singh said.While the NCB team said Sail was not reachable, the Mumbai police's team which has started an inquiry against Sameer Wankhede claimed it has recorded Sail's statement on Wednesday. Sail claimed he was not approached by the NCB and that he was ready to share all information with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-kp-gosavi-and-his-ex-aide-sail-ncb-says-unreachable-101635348673085.html

27-10-2021||India||Party drugs worth ₹2 crore seized in south Bengal||Yaba tablets worth around ₹2 crore were seized from Madhyamgram in North 24 Parganas district near Kolkata on Wednesday. Three people were arrested. Acting on a tip-off customs department officers apprehended two people from Madhyamgram and recovered around 28,000 Yaba tablets. Both of them were arrested. Later, 8000 more tablets were seized from another place and one more person was arrested. “The total value of the seized Yaba tablets is around ₹2 crore. Also known as madness drug, crazy medicine and Nazi speed, these are psychotropic substances prohibited under the NDPS Act 1985,” said an official. A mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine and sold as red or pink pills, Yaba originated in Myanmar and entered the Bangladesh black market in early 2000 and gained instant popularity due to the paucity of such stimulants locally. The fact that it was cheap also helped. This is, however, not the first time that such drugs were seized from the city and its outskirts. In August this year, Heroin and Amphetamine tablets worth ₹55 crore in the international market were seized by the special task force of the Kolkata Police in West Bengal’s Malda district. Four drug peddlers, two of whom are from Manipur and Bihar, were arrested. A consignment was also seized in Kolkata in July 2020. Smuggling of Yaba tablets has shot up since 2019 across the porous Indo-Bangladesh border in south Bengal, after the Border Security Force (BSF) cracked down on cattle smuggling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-drugs-worth-rs-2-crore-seized-in-south-bengal-101635348280171.html

We're decided that for the next one month, healthcare workers will go door-to-door to vaccinate people eligible for second dose & also those who have not taken the first dose: Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya pic.twitter.com/2jwgib3uTXMandaviya made the announcement after holding a meeting with his counterparts and representatives from states and Union Territories to discuss scaling up of the vaccination drive in the country.He further said 77 per cent of the eligible population in India has been vaccinated against Covid-19 with the first dose, while another 32 per cent have been fully inoculated.However, more than 10 crore people have not yet taken the second dose of the vaccine, the health minister said, while urging them to go ahead with completing their course.The minister also asked officials at the meeting to focus on such beneficiaries who are overdue for their second dose.According to government data, over 3.92 crore beneficiaries are more than six weeks overdue for their second dose, around 1.57 crore are up to four to six weeks late, and more than 1.50 crore are up to two to four weeks overdue for their second shot of either Covishield or Covaxin.Also, over 3.38 crore people are up to two weeks overdue to becoming fully vaccinated.The gap between the first and second dose is 12 weeks for Covishield and four weeks for Covaxin. Both doses are needed for adequate protection against severe Covid-19 infection and hospitalisation.The 11 states and UTs that have completed administering both doses to more than half of their eligible beneficiaries are Lakshadweep, Sikkim, Goa, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Daman and Diu, Arunachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/har-ghar-dastak-govt-to-launch-door-to-door-covid-vaccination-drive-next-month-101635347599435.html
27-10-2021||India||‘India will have whole of Kashmir someday,’ says top IAF official||A high-ranking Indian Air Force official on Wednesday expressed hope that India will be able to govern the entire Kashmir, including the Pakistan-occupied territory. Air Officer Commanding in Chief (AOC-in-C) of Western Air Command, Air Marshal Amit Dev said there was no plan to capture Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Dev was speaking to the media at the 75th anniversary of Indian troops' Budgam landing.He also pointed out that people in PoK were not treated fairly by Pakistan.“All the activities which were carried out by the Indian Air Force and the Army (on October 27, 1947) resulted in ensuring the freedom of this part of Kashmir. I am sure that someday, the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir will also join this part of Kashmir and we will have the whole of Kashmir in years to come,” Dev said.“Entire Kashmir is one, the nation is one. People on both sides have common attachments. Today or tomorrow, history will witness that nations come together. We do not have a plan at the moment, but, God willing, it will always be there because people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir are not being treated very fairly by the Pakistanis,” Dev further added.Following the signing of the instrument of accession with India by then ruler of Jammu and Kashmir Maharaja Hari Singh, Indian troops landed in the Valley on October 27, 1947 the very next day after Pakistani tribals carried out raids.The AOC-in-C of the Western Air Command also highlighted that the IAF faces many challenges, but the basic challenge it faces is technology.“The rate of change of technology is so fast in the world today that we have to keep pace with that. If any nation which is to grow economically has to have a strong military, we must fulfil our obligation to the nation in the years to come and we are always ready for the challenge,” he said.He, however, said that the IAF has become a very capable force.“After the instrument of accession was signed, we moved in our troops quickly and Srinagar airfield was saved and thereafter we launched further offensive and pushed the Pakistani military, which came as Kabalis (tribals), further back,” Dev said.Dev claimed that if the United Nations did not intervene the entire Kashmir would have been India’s.He said the IAF and the Army carried out many small missions including the operations in Poonch after an airstrip was laid there in a short span of a week, attacks on the Srinagar airfield, in Skardu on ammunition dump and in Leh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-have-whole-of-kashmir-someday-says-top-iaf-official-101635343247515.html

The agency has recorded Wankhede's statement in connection with the departmental vigilance probe into the extortion allegations brought against Wankhede.A five-member vigilance probe team reached Mumbai on Wednesday and began its probe. It has collected some documents and recordings from the Mumbai office of the NCB. "The statement of Wankhede is being recorded...it is a sensitive inquiry and it is not possible to share real-time information related to the probe, and we will not be able to share all the details," Singh said. Sameer Wankhede was questioned today.

He'll remain the investigating officer in the drugs-on-cruise ship case until substantial information is found against him: DDG NCB Gyaneshwar Singh pic.twitter.com/lleD8UvJN5The central agency has initiated a vigilance inquiry into the claims made by Prabhakar Sail, who claimed that Wankhede made him sign blank papers in connection with the Aryan Khan case. He also claimed alleged that an extortion bid of ₹25 crore was made by some agency officials, which he claimed based on overhearing some conversation. It has been claimed that Wankhede was supposed to get some money from that ₹25 crore.Singh said Prabhakar Sail and KP Gosavi will also be interrogated but they could not be contacted through the contact numbers or addresses. "We have tried our best to contact them but could not. Through the media I would like to tell them they are free to join in two days and give evidence to the special inquiry team which has been staying at CRPF mess at Bandra (West)" said Singh.The questioning comes as another witness of the central agency claimed that he was made to sign blank papers by the agency and by Wankhede in connection with a different case. The witness, Shekhar Kamble, a resident of Navi Mumbai, said he was made to sign on 10-12 blank papers by Wankhede and others, which were later used as panchnama in connection with a Nigerian national’s arrest from Mumbai's Kharghar in August this year. This witness claimed that no drugs were recovered from the Nigerian national, but the NCB falsely showed that some amount of MD drug was found on him.The DG did not comment on the fresh case of the allegation and said the NCB team is aiming at a fair investigation. That is the reason the investigators are not operating from the NCB office in Mumbai but from CRPG Mess in Bandra. "We tried to contact both Sail and Gosavi.

27-10-2021||India||CPM drops Jayachandran from party panels in Kerala; daughter calls it ‘eyewash’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala’s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Wednesday removed PS Jayachandran from all party posts and committees after he was accused of kidnapping his daughter’s newborn child and later handing it over to the state council for child welfare-run orphanage for adoption. The party has also decided to conduct an inquiry into the case.Jayachandran was a Peroorkada local committee member and a senior leader of the party trade union wing Centre for Indian Trade Unions.A party leader said the decision to strip Jayachandran was taken by the local committee in Peroorkada on the direction of the district committee.Former student activist Anupama S Chandran, who struggled to get the party to act against her father for months, said the belated move is an eyewash and demanded a state committee-level probe the missing child’s case.“Nothing will emerge if the case is investigated by the local committee. I want a high-level inquiry, and women leaders should be part of it,” she said in state capital Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. Jayachandran was not available for comment. Earlier, he said the party was aware of everything, but it disowned him when issue took the national stage.A senior CPM leader, who did not want to be quoted, said further action will be taken against Jayachandran and officials of the child welfare committee, who allegedly colluded with him in the adoption.A Thiruvananthapuram court will hear the anticipatory bail petitions filed by Jayachandran and five others on Thursday.In a police complaint filed last week, Anupama S Chandran alleged that her father took away her child born in October last year and handed over the newborn to a state child welfare council-run orphanage. She alleged the child was reportedly given to a family from Andhra Pradesh in violation of adoption rules. But Jayachandran said he sent the baby to the government-run children’s home in Thiruvananthapuram with his daughter’s consent and contended that his daughter also signed a legal document to this effect. His daughter rebutted him, insisting that she was forced to sign the document.Chandran’s one-day fast before the state secretariat on Saturday for her child attracted national attention. Many senior leaders of the CPM including politburo members Brinda Karat and MA Baby decried inaction in her case. Despite the senior leaders’ intervention, the party failed to take action against him. The issue also figured prominently in the state assembly. Opposition leader V D Satheesan termed it an “honour kidnapping” while state health minister Veena George insisted that all procedures were followed when the baby was given for adoption. A family court has stayed the baby’s adoption till Nov 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpm-drops-jayachandran-from-party-panels-in-kerala-daughter-calls-it-eyewash-101635340724677.html

He did that and we have legal documents to prove that. You can see that both of them are aware that they belong to different religions and both of them have signed these documents,” Kranti said.“Sameer Wankhede was not involved in any wrongdoing. He is an honest person and has always spoken the truth. The more people try to smear him with false accusations it will only help emerge stronger. His father and his wife are with him,” she further added.The tussle between Malik and Wankhede intensified after the former shared a picture of Wankhede with his first wife Dr Quraishi. Malik also claimed that Wankhede got an IRS job by allegedly showing false documents citing that he was from the SC community.“"I want to make it clear that the issue I am exposing of Sameer Dawood Wankhede is not about his religion. I want to bring to light the fraudulent means by which he has obtained a caste certificate to get an IRS job and has deprived a deserving Scheduled Caste person of his future,” the NCP leader said via a tweet. Malik accused the NCB zonal head several times of extortion and arresting people on false cases following the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan. Aryan Khan was arrested earlier this month in a drugs bust case from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kranti-extends-support-to-sameer-wankhede-terms-malik-s-allegations-baseless-101635339305314.html

Chaudhary also said that he has expressed it to the party’s high command and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot. He met with Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in Delhi and discussed various organisational issues.“I have informed the party high command including party president Sonia Gandhi, former president Rahul Gandhi, our state in-charge and the chief minister,” news agency PTI quoted the minister as saying earlier in the day.Chaudhary also said that he believed in the ideology of ‘one person one post’ and wanted to fulfil the new responsibility of Punjab Congress in-charge with dedication, PTI reported. However, he said that he did not want to fuel any speculations or controversies about his resignation as a minister and said, “This is my opinion, which I have conveyed to the party high command.”Also read | Punjab Congress chief Sidhu calls Capt Amarinder ‘spent cartridge’When asked about the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab, Chaudhary expressed confidence that the Congress will win the polls with a majority and retain power in the state. He also said that he has been observing the party’s organisation in Punjab for the past few months.With Punjab assembly elections scheduled next year, Chaudhary, reckoned to be close to Rahul Gandhi, replaced Harish Rawat as the Punjab Congress in-charge following a phase of turmoil for the party in the state. Rawat had requested the party high that he wished to concentrate on Uttarakhand assembly polls which is also slated for next year.Meanwhile, former chief minister Amarinder Singh, earlier in the day, said that he would create his own political party before the state assembly elections. “Yes, I will be forming a new party. The name will be announced once the Election Commission clears it, along with the symbol. My lawyers are working on it,” news agency ANI quoted Singh as saying in a press meet.Notably, he has earlier expressed his willingness for a seat-sharing agreement with the BJP, if the farmers issue was resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-harish-chaudhary-says-want-to-quit-as-rajasthan-minister-for-new-role-as-party-s-punjab-chief-101635337942471.html
27-10-2021||India||West Bengal allows green crackers on Kali Puja and Chhath; PIL seeks blanket ban||The West Bengal government on Wednesday allowed bursting of green crackers for around two hours during Kali Puja and Chhath Puja and for about 35 minutes on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. This comes at a time when the Centre has warned the state of rising Covid-19 cases in Kolkata after Durga Puja festivities. Recently a section of Kolkata’s leading doctors, environmental experts and medical associations jointly submitted a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee requesting a blanket ban on firecrackers. A PIL has also been filed in the Calcutta High Court seeking a complete ban on firecrackers. The matter will be heard on Friday. The order issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board says that there has been a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers, except green crackers in the state. During Kali Puja bursting of green crackers has been allowed from 8 pm to 10 pm, and on Chhath Puja it has been allowed from 6 am to 8 am. During Christmas and New Year green crackers have been allowed from 11:55 pm to 12:30 am. Diwali will be celebrated across the country on November 4 this year. In 2020, the Calcutta High Court had banned the use and sale of firecrackers on Kali Puja to curb pollution amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government too had appealed to the people to avoid bursting firecrackers during Kali Puja and Diwali in order to check air pollution. “Much damage has been caused by the rampant violations of Covid-19 safety protocols during Durga Puja. Cases have started rising once again in the city and across the state. We should at least show some restraint during Kali Puja by not bursting crackers and fireworks this time. The smoke and pollution would cause more harm to patients who are suffering from Covid-19 or are recovering from the disease,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. The Durga Puja, the biggest festival in the state, ended on October 15 and the daily count of Covid-19 cases is once again hovering around the 1000-mark after a gap of more than three months. Nearly 974 new Covid-19 cases were detected in the state on Saturday, and on Sunday the number shot up further to 989. On Monday and Tuesday, it remained a little above the 800-mark. The Kolkata Police have started intensifying action against citizens for violating Covid-19 safety protocols as the daily count of cases has shot up in the city after the festivities.With the daily count of Covid-19 cases shooting up in West Bengal after the festive season, the state administration has started re-introducing containment zones to check the spread of the virus. Containment zones have already come up in Howrah, North 24 Parganas - the district with the highest number of daily cases after Kolkata, Jalpaiguri and Hooghly. In Kolkata, however, no such zones have been declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-allows-green-crackers-on-kali-puja-and-chhath-pil-seeks-blanket-ban-101635337237597.html
27-10-2021||India||‘Political expediency’: BJD legislator critiques his boss Naveen Patnaik actions||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s Biju Janata Dal (BJD) lawmaker Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, who has occasionally taken a stand independent of the party line, on Wednesday said chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s first decade in the state’s top seat was marked by zero tolerance to crime and corruption but his latest actions are dictated by political expediency.The scathing observation in a front-page editorial in Odia daily Sambad edited by the legislator comes against the backdrop of the chief minister’s hands-off approach to the raging controversy around the minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra for his proximity to the prime accused in the murder of a school teacher in the state’s Kalahandi district. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJD) and the Congress have stepped up attacks on the Naveen Patnaik government, saying they want the chief minister to sack his minister who was alleged to have been close to the murder accused, Gobind Sahu, president of the managing committee that runs the school where the teacher was employed.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik hasn’t spoken on the controversy yet.In the editorial, the BJD lawmaker said Naveen Patnaik’s USP during the first decade of his rule was zero tolerance to crime and corruption. “Probity in public life was the hallmark. And this is what endeared him to masses in Odisha. People saw him in a different league. But now, political expediency dominates. As the BJD has been in power for over a decade due to lack of a viable political alternative, ego is ruling the power corridor,” wrote Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, a reference seen to hint at inaction over the alleged proximity of the minister with murder accused Gobind Sahu.Also Read: Odisha school official accused of murder also got govt funds for his institutionsSahu strangled 26-year-old school teacher Mamita Meher in his car in Kalahandi district on October 8 after she allegedly threatened to expose him. According to the police, he cut her body into pieces, burnt it and then buried the remains in an under-construction stadium near his school, the Sunshine English Medium school. He was arrested on October 19 and is now in jail.“In his first 10 years of rule, Naveen received the admiration of people of Odisha through his work which is rare for most politicians. By 2024, Naveen may break the record of Pawan Chamling and Jyoti Basu as the chief minister with the longest tenure. But he has not done anything that would ensure that his name is written in history in golden letters. Now no one remembers the tenure of Jyoti Basu or Pawan Chamling. It is quite possible that Naveen Patnaik may meet the same fate,” he wrote.“The influence of big money in elections, winning at all costs, no ethical conformity et al have become the new normal. The outcome is then a spike in corruption cases and throttling of transparency. How many MLAs from the party can dare to come clean about not having any disproportionate assets,” he asked.This isn’t the first time that Soumya Ranjan Patnaik had questioned the party’s stand.In July this year, his signed editorial in his paper sought a white paper on deaths due to Covid-19 in the state, observing that there was a desperate race among states to keep the figures on the lower side. His advice to the chief minister was to display the courage to release the white paper, telling him that “people will love him more” even if the numbers are on the higher side.Odisha BJP leader Prithviraj Harichandan said Soumya’s comments described the BJD’s ‘home affairs’.BJD legislator Prasant Muduli challenged the picture painted by Soumya Patnaik, insisting that the state has seen a remarkable transformation in the last 20 years. Naveen Patnaik first became chief minister in March 2000 and led the party to victory in 2019 when he started his fifth term.The BJP, meanwhile, continued to amp up the pitch against the ruling BJD and constituted a three-member committee comprising MP Sunita Duggal, BJP Mahila Morcha’s national president Vanathi Sriniwasan and MLA Rupa Mitra to look into the murder of Mamita Meher. On Wednesday, BJP workers also gheraoed the Balasore SP office demanding the dismissal of Dibya Shankar Mishra. In Sundargarh, party activists led by Sundargarh MP Jual Oram submitted a memorandum to Sundargarh SP to seek a CBI probe into the case.The Odisha State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has issued a notice to Kalahandi SP to seek a report within seven days. The commission said it is under the impression that the guidelines issued by the Odisha Women and Child Development Department to ensure a safe environment in institutions where children study or live were not adhered to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-expediency-bjd-legislator-critiques-his-boss-naveen-patnaik-actions-101635336757846.html

27-10-2021||India||Snap is about more immersive, personalised experiences: Murphy||Snap, an app you may remember as Snapchat, is a bit of everything including an instant messaging app, a social network and a strong creator community. Yet, Snap Inc. calls itself a camera company, because they say all the engagement emerges from the phone’s camera. The company has announced crossing the milestone of 100 million active Snapchat users in India at the second edition of Snap In India forum. This comes as the tech company has made significant push over the past few months towards localisation in India. Snap is embarking on a strategic partnership with online shopping platform Flipkart, to enable augmented reality (AR) via Snap’s camera kit on Flipkart’s store front on the smartphone apps. This will allow shoppers to experience a more immersive and personalised experience. The India localisation focus for Snap continues with the extension of the partnership with Samsung that adds AR powered lenses to native camera apps on Samsung Galaxy phones, which now extends to the M series phones too. Snap Map, a personalised virtual map of user surroundings, will now work with the Zomato app to include restaurant information and the ability to place orders from within the map. Snap has also confirmed that they will be launching a free, early-stage founder focused program in India called Yellow Tree Bootcamp. This is expected to help the Indian start-ups connect with experts to discuss fund raising, operations, growth, including how to leverage tools like Snap Kit and Snapchat Ads Manager for their businesses. Bobby Murphy, co-founder and chief technology officer at Snap, and in many ways the company’s secret weapon when it comes to developing new features and the experience on the Snapchat app, spoke with Hindustan Times to discuss why Snap calls it a camera company, the push for AR and the opportunities it provides apart from the usage trends from India and the engagement around unique applications such as Photomath. Here are the edited excerpts. Q. From the launch in 2012 to the introduction of Lenses in 2015 and the extensive AR focus from 2016, how has the journey been? We’ve seen incredible growth in India. I think our vision around augmented reality, which began many, many years ago, as we started recognising the special engagement around visual communication or this kind of frequency of interaction with our camera. It led us to invest early in creative effects through augmented reality which extends to efforts for building this platform around augmented reality. We have potential for augmented reality to really significantly change the way we engage with each other and with the world around us, because I think it represents a capacity to render or visualise software experiences in the way humans normally see the world and kind of imagine things in the world. And so, for us especially in India, it’s been incredibly exciting to see the growth of engagement. Our big milestone for 100 million Snapchatters in India is a real testament to the tremendous work our team in India has put in, as well as the support from team members outside of India. They have been working with local organisations, local creators, developers and companies to empower not just consumers to engage with reality in a strong way, which we have seen, but also the creators and developers on the other side of the platform. I think it is being recognized that AR has the potential to create new professional and career opportunities and for brands and companies to reach customers in highly differentiated, novel and new interactive ways. We’re very optimistic about the future of augmented reality in particular, and the growth momentum we are seeing in India. Q. How has the user engagement evolved with the AR features, which in a way bring overlays from post to pre-capture? Have the numbers been surprising? I think it reflects our own excitement of innovating around augmented reality because Snapchat is so rooted in visual communication. While capturing and sharing photos with close friends and family frequently, what I think originally began in some cases like simple post (photo) capture effects, things like geo-filters, drawing tools and captions really allowed us to think more actively about the potential use of advanced computer vision and graphics to bring more immersive effects into the pre (photo) capture experience. It is recognising that the live camera represents an even more interesting opportunity for us to not just help people express themselves creatively but also support their ability to learn about the world, and to try on products to shop in new ways. In India, it is just a tremendous amount of sustained and growing engagement around augmented reality. We have seen some really amazing engagement around the many holidays in India, and we have partnered with local creators who have reached huge numbers of engagement and created some really spectacular lenses. I think what’s exciting is that we are seeing success and momentum on both sides of our platform-- with Snapchatters engaging very heavily with augmented reality along with creators, brands and businesses recognising the opportunity to reach customers and audiences with brand new experiences. Also Read: ‘E-bikes are not just clean and green, they help people save more money’Q. You mentioned about shopping, particularly the partnership with Flipkart. Can you tell us a bit about what sort of features users can expect? So this is this is done through our product called camera kit, which we integrate into other companies applications to power AR with Snap’s AR technology. As with Flipkart, we have actually seen on our own service on Snapchat, some really positive engagement around commerce related lenses. We are excited about working with Flipkart to bring AR try-on to their service. Q. We’ve often wondered about Snap calling itself a camera company. With that as the background, where do Games and Maps fit in? Our idea of Snap as a camera company is a little bit abstract as Snap represent a service that reflects your personal view of the world including your close friends and family in your specific context, while this positioning is more literal in our investment in augmented reality and users looking at the world through our camera. In cases such as Games, our investment is really inspired by recognition that people socialise very strongly around games as many of us have experienced playing console games sitting on a couch with friends in the same room. The shared physical context and playing a game together was really the basis for our investment in the Games platform, but without having to be in the same room. Similarly Maps is an effort to reflect your personal view but through this new Canvas in a map. We have seen that most of the maps we engage with are fairly static and I will see the same map that you see, for example, but our perspective of our local environment should be tailored to our own unique personal tastes. And so, the Snapchat map being able to see who your friends are on the map, the places you kind of most visit and find to be most interesting, was where we saw an opportunity. Q. The partnership with Photomath to solve math equations is quite unique. How does that work, and what’s been the user engagement around that? Photomath is a fantastic partner for us, and they are a real great company. They built a really innovative product, using computer vision to understand and read a math equation and then help students and others solve those equations step by step. We as a company were extremely enthusiastic about this potential of the camera starting with creative expression but expanding into many more uses and Photomath is exactly one of these companies. Q. How has the user engagement in India been on the community side? I would say India represents a really great example of how powerful it is to partner locally, and very deeply. Our team and our community in India has done a great job. Empowering lens creators, educating new creators in ways that allow people in India to participate and lots of other people in their local communities through AR and through content and other features. We have seen that we are partnering deeply with local organisations and local creators, those are the kind of experiences that resonate most with our community in India. And that’s why we are so interested in continuing to invest in our lens studio workshops and the lens hackathon that we have done across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/snap-is-about-more-immersive-personalised-experiences-murphy-101635336397614.html
27-10-2021||India||Another night in jail for Aryan Khan as court adjourns hearing till tomorrow||The Bombay high court on Wednesday adjourned the hearing of the drugs-on-cruise case till Thursday afternoon after hearing the arguments of Amit Desai and Mukul Rohatgi. This was the second day of the hearing of the case in the high court. On Thursday, additional solicitor general Anil Kumar Singh will  present the NCB arguments. Former attorney general of India, Mukul Rohtagi, who appeared for Aryan Khan on Wednesday said the arrest memo did not give true and correct grounds for arrest. Referring to Section 50 of the CrPC Act, Rohatgi said, "Article 22 of the Constitution is more important than Section 50 of CrPC. It states that no person should be held without being informed about the grounds of arrest and the person shall have the right to consult a lawyer of his choice."‘Arrested for an offence not committed’: Senior lawyers contend in drugs caseRohatgi said the remand application was misleading as it projected that a large quantity of drugs was recovered from Aryan Khan. "Remand application must mention true and correct facts," Rohatgi said."Please look at the arrest memo of Aryan Khan. It is identical. What it refers to are items not recovered from me. There is a legal connotation for this. The law says you must give true and correct grounds for this. This takes us back to the CrPC section 50. Persons arrested have the right to be informed of arrest and grounds of bail," Rohatgi added.What Amit Desai said arguing from Arbaaz MerchantSenior advocate Amit Desai appeared for Arbaaz Merchant on Wednesday presented his argument at length and said there was no 'conspiracy' over the rave party. Aryan, Arbaaz and Munmun were arrested individually and at that time the charge of conspiracy was not imposed."Especially when the offences alleged are punishable with less than one year. A notice under section 41a of the CrPC should have been issued, asking them to join the investigation," Desai said terming the arrest illegal. "Bail is the rule and jail is the exception. Now it has become arrest is the rule and bail is the exception," Desai said.As Aryan, Arbaaz and Moonmoon were arrested for not consuming the drugs, Desai saod that they have been arrested for an offence which is not committed. The intention to consume should not apply as no medical test was done.Desai also cited the cases of two guests who were on the ship and were given bail."I am seeking bail in a case where the punishment is only one year. And where there is no evidence of conspiracy," Desai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-night-in-jail-for-aryan-khan-as-court-adjourns-hearing-till-tomorrow-101635335972673.html
27-10-2021||India||Fifth BJP legislator joins Trinamool Congress in less than six months||In another blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Krishna Kalyani --- the party’s MLA from Raiganj in north Bengal --- joined the ruling Trinamool Congress on Wednesday. Since the Mamata Banerjee-led party returned to power for the third consecutive time with a thumping victory in the West Bengal assembly polls in May this year, at least five legislators, including Kalyani, have joined the TMC. Last month, former Union minister and party MP Babul Supriyo also switched over to the TMC. “In BJP there is no audit of good performance. There is only conspiracy. You cannot win an election with just conspiracy. To win an election you need development,” Kalyani said after joining the TMC at a hotel in Kolkata. He had quit the BJP on October 1 after being slapped with a show cause notice by the party for publicly speaking against senor party leaders including BJP’s state president Sukanta Majumdar and former Union minister and Raiganj MP Debasree Chaudhuri. “This is his personal view. I don’t want to comment. He has been detached with the party for long. He is a businessman. Everyone knows what a businessman needs to do to prosper in the state. People of Raiganj will give him a befitting reply in future,” said Majumdar. Another BJP leader Firoze Kamal Gazi alias Babu Master also quit the party. Earlier an influential TMC leader and a strongman from Basirhat in North 24 Parganas, he had recently joined the BJP. He even apologized to TMC chief Mamata Banerjee. TMC’s national general secretary and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee had recently said that several BJP leaders are willing to join the TMC but the ruling party hasn’t opened its doors for all. “The day we open our doors, the next day BJP would be wiped out in West Bengal,” Abhishek Banerjee had said while addressing a public rally last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fifth-bjp-legislator-joins-trinamool-congress-in-less-than-six-months-101635335437528.html

Otherwise, the 'nikah' would not have been solemnised as per Islam, news agency PTI reported.“I had performed the 'nikah' of Sameer Wankhede and Shabana Quraishi. Her father had approached me to perform the marriage in the Lokhandwala complex area of Mumbai. The groom's name was Sameer Dawood Wankhede who married Shabana Quraishi," the Qazi told a news channel, according to PTI. He also claimed that the "Mehar" amount mentioned in the nikah-nama was ₹33,000. "Mehar" in Islam is a security deposit which signifies a contract made by the groom and his family to his bride at the time of their nikkah.What is the controversy over Sameer Wankhende's 1st marriage? 5 pointsThe NCB officer's first marriage is in the news after Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday claimed that Sameer Wankhede's first marriage was performed according to Islamic rituals. Earlier, Nawab Malik claimed Sameer Wankhede is Muslim, which Wankhede refuted claiming that he is from a multi-religious family, where his father is Hindu and his mother was a Muslim.After the minister posted the purported photos of the 'nikah', Wankhede said his first marriage was under the Islamic ritual as that was his mother's wish. He never converted to Islam and that's why after the 'nikah', they got their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act."Fulfilling the wish of one's mother in a secular country is not a crime. I am proud of secularism in our country. My mother was a Muslim and my father is a Hindu. I love both of them very much," Wankhede said.In the same year of his first marriage, he got divorced and the divorce too was completed under the Special Marriage Act.“I do not understand Urdu, hence I am not aware what my name was written in their documents (nikah nama). She (my late wife) might have mentioned my name as Dawood affectionately. People do call each other with different names out of love,” Wankhede's father Dnyandev Wankhede said.The Special Marriage Act has the provision for interfaith marriages. Had Sameer Wankhede already converted to Islam, then there was no need for the Special Marriage Act, Sameer's wife Kranti Redkar said on Wednesday.Apart from the allegation of extortion, Sameer Wankhede is now accused of forging documents to get the SC quota in UPSC.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nikah-wouldn-t-have-been-performed-if-what-qazi-says-on-wankhede-s-marriage-101635334741988.html

27-10-2021||India||‘Infringement of constitutional guarantees’: Top advocates contend in drugs case||The Bombay high court on Wednesday resumed the hearing on the bail application of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's son, Aryan Khan, in connection to his alleged involvement in a cruise ship drugs case.Arguing before the high court, senior advocates called the custodial detention of Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Seth Merchant and Munmum Dhamecha a “direct infringement of constitutional guarantees” while assuring that the trio would cooperate with the investigating agencies if they were granted bail in the case.A single bench of Justice Nitin Sambre was hearing the applications for bail plea of Aryan Khan and his friend Arbaaz Seth Merchant, after the court adjourned the hearing on Tuesday evening.Aryan Khan was being represented by India's former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi and celebrated lawyer Satish Maneshinde among a battery of advocates, including partners of law firms Karanjawala & Co and Desai Desai Carrimjee & Mulla, while senior advocate Amit Desai represented Arbaaz Merchant.Meanwhile, additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Advait Sethna argued on behalf of the prosecution.Aryan Khan is in jail along with Arbaaz Seth Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha since October 7, following the Narcotics Control Bureau's (NCB) raid on a Goa-bound cruise off Mumbai’s coast on October 2.Beginning the argument on Wednesday afternoon, advocate Amit Desai said Arbaaz Merchant and the other youths were charged only with possession and consumption of small quantities of charas. “The trio — Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha — had come only for the purpose of consumption. There was no conspiracy,” Desai said, adding, “Even those who apprehended them, treated them as coming there individually. Punishment for which is one year.”The advocate argued before the court that instead of arresting the trio for what the NCB officials claimed was an “individual act” they should have instead given notice under 41A of the CrPC (notice of appearance before police office) and asked them to join the investigation.Invoking the 2014 judgement in Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar case, Desai submitted before the court that “arrest itself was illegal", stressing that “in minor offences arrest is an exception.”“The judgement of Arnesh Kumar is a dictum in these kinds of matters. There is a change in rule for minor offences, rules are no arrest and arrest only under the exception,” Desai told the court.“Bail is the rule and jail is the exception. Now it has become ‘arrest is the rule and bail is the exception’”, Desai said. Stressing that the NCB didn't serve the trio any notice under Section 41A of the CrPC, the advocate argued that they should be released on bail. “First remand application does not talk about conspiracy. So the court, at the time of the first remand, was misled into believing that they were also charged under sections 28 and 29 of NDPS Act,” Desai said.“The magistrate's court was told later eight people were arrested for conspiracy though it was not what had happened. Because of these issues, we are in custody for the past 22 days. Till today there is no arrest for conspiracy and conspiracy is a separate offence,” he added.Desai further told the court that the trio is not accused of 'use' as defined under the NDPS Act as per the arrest memo. “No allegation in the arrest memo of 'use'. So there was a clear understanding that this was a case of nothing more than personal consumption,” he said.“If there was an intention to consume then Section 27 of the NDPS Act does not apply. We have been arrested for an offence that was not committed. Consumption is a verb that has not happened and, hence, even Section 27 of the NDPS Act should have not been applied.”“The special NDPS court rejected our application because of conspiracy. The WhatsApp chats don't support the conspiracy theory whatsoever," the lawyer said.A special NDPS court rejected the bail plea of Aryan Khan on October 20 and extended his judicial custody till October 30. The special court ruled that certain WhatsApp chats showed Aryan Khan's “involvement in illegal drugs activities" and his “nexus with peddlers and suppliers of banned drugs”.Reading a 2001 judgement of the Bombay high court, which observed that “meeting of minds is necessary to prove conspiracy,” Desai said, “Three people individually going on a vessel and deciding to consume is not a conspiracy.”Pointing out that a special NDPS court on Tuesday granted bail to two people in the same case, the advocate said “2.4gm of ganja was found from one of them.”He also said that the Whastapp chats don't support the “conspiracy theory” as claimed by the NCB. “What is abundantly clear is that there are no WhatsApp chats that connect conspiracy to the rave party…past events are connected asking for custody. Nobody stops investigation after bail. There are circumstances that show there is no conspiracy at all. But what is the need of custody when punishment is just one year."Desai assured the court that the investigation won't be stopped if bail is granted.Arguing before the court in Aryan Khan's plea next, Mukul Rohatgi said the arrest memo “did not give true and correct grounds for arrest”, as referred to Section 50 of the CrPC. “Article 22 of the Constitution is more important than Section 50 of the CrPC. It states that no person should be held without being informed about the grounds of arrest and the person shall have the right to consult a lawyer of his choice,” the former attorney general contended.Article 22 of the Constitution states that no person should be held without being informed about the grounds of arrest and the person shall have the right to consult a lawyer of their choice.Rohatgi further argued that the remand application was misleading and indicates that “large quantities mentioned in that were recovered from Aryan Khan.”Advocate Ali Kashif Khan, who appeared on behalf of Munmun Dhamecha, told the court that the 28-year-old model was invited on the cruise ship in lieu of payment. The advocate said Dhamecha was in the room along with one Somiya Singh and Baldev when the NCB came for the alleged search. No drugs were found on Dhamecha during the search.“The case is against Somiya Singh, not me. The rolling paper used to smoke was recovered from Somiya. It's in their own document,” the advocate informed the court, adding that the other two were allowed to go.“I am made a scapegoat as I was on the cruise… If I am arrested as suspect then all 1,300 people on a cruise should have been arrested,” the advocate argued on behalf of Dhamecha.The NCB argued before the special NDPS court last week that Aryan Khan was in “conscious possession” of illegal drugs as the agency found at least 6 grams of charas from Arbaaz Merchant, who allegedly admitted to the investigators that they intended to use it for “consumption and enjoyment.”During the hearing on Aryan Khan's bail plea on Tuesday, the 23-year-old star-kid's lawyers told the high court that he should be given bail because no drugs were recovered from him. They also said that WhatsApp conversations used by the NCB were not related to the cruise from where Aryan Khan was arrested three weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-bail-hearing-arbaaz-merchant-ncb-cruise-ship-drugs-raid-mukul-rohatgi-101635330550343.html
27-10-2021||India||Pegasus attempt to crush vibrancy of Indian democracy; welcome SC's step: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday welcomed that the Supreme Court formed a panel to look into the allegations of Pegasus spyware. He said that buying the Pegasus software was an attack on the ‘vibrancy of Indian democracy’. He also said that the product was either bought by the Prime Minister or the Union home minister.“This is illegal. No one is above the nation and its institutions,” Rahul said in a press conference.Rahul Gandhi also claimed that the government in Karnataka was toppled using Pegasus. “This is a deeper problem. It is one thing if you are using Pegasus for tackling terrorism or national security. That is completely a different issue but if the Prime Minister is using it as a personal tool and the data is arriving on the PM's desk, then that is totally criminal,” he said. “We will follow up on that. We will make sure of that… Government's have been dropped, right? In Karnataka, government was dropped using Pegasus,” Rahul Gandhi further added. He said if data regarding opposition leaders or even the ‘Election Commission’ is reaching the ‘Prime Minister’ with the help of Pegasus, then it is a criminal act. Rahul Gandhi said that the decision to buy the spyware from the Israeli firm NSO was an attempt to ‘crush the vibrancy of the democracy’ and the ‘discussions that happen in a democracy’. “It is a big step that the Supreme Court has taken and we hope that the truth will come out of this,” Rahul Gandhi said. He also expressed concern that if any other country accessed information of the people who were allegedly snooped upon using the spyware. “The list includes members of the judiciary, opposition leaders as well as BJP leaders. Did any other country have access to information of our people?" Rahul asked. Cyber experts comprising Naveen Kumar Chaudhary, Prabaharan P and Ashwin Anil Gumaste were appointed by the apex court on Wednesday to probe the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance of politicians, journalists, and activists. Former Supreme Court judge RV Raveendran will oversee the functioning of the panel, according to a report by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-attempt-to-crush-vibrancy-of-indian-democracy-welcome-sc-s-step-rahul-101635333617625.html

Nagaland, one of the four states in the northeast that share borders with Myanmar, has become a refuge for Myanmar’s Nagas, said state minister Neiba Kronu. Naga people in Myanmar are mostly from the Sagaing region and Kachin state. Kronu said an assessment on how many refugees have crossed over to Nagaland from Myanmar is underway. Most of them entered Mon district, he said. Three more Nagaland districts share borders with Myanmar. Kronu said these are “our own (Naga) people” and added that civil society and church organisations were extending aid to them on humanitarian grounds.“We are yet to ascertain the exact number of people who have come into the state. We shall soon take a decision on this,” Kronu said.Since March, around 13,000 refugees, mostly from Chin state, have entered Mizoram for refuge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-minister-says-state-has-become-a-refuge-for-nagas-fleeing-myanmar-101635332617644.html

27-10-2021||India||Had I been out of jail, Tejashwi would have formed govt in Bihar: Lalu Prasad||Making his first appearance after six years following incarceration at Tarapur, RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Wednesday took pot-shots at the Nitish Kumar-led government calling it a dispensation facing internal friction among allies. He also accused the JD (U) strongman of resorting to cheating before forming the government after the Bihar assembly polls held last year. “People of Bihar had made Tejashwi the chief minister. But Nitish Kumar formed the government through cheating and manipulation. Had I been outside, it would not have happened,” he said, amid thunderous applause from the crowd in a seven minute speech at Idgah Maidan in Tarapur where by-polls are scheduled along with the Kushweshwar Asthan assembly seat on October 30. The RJD chief has been making accusations that the RJD lost several seats owing to electoral manipulations carried out during the counting of the 2020 assembly polls in which RJD had got 75 seats and was close to the magic figure of 122 with the opposition led Grand Alliance scoring 110.Prasad, displaying his well-known wit made sharp comments laced with metaphor, and said the so-called ‘double engine’ government in Bihar- an euphemism for NDA ruling both the state and Centre-- had failed on all fronts as the engines were pulling each other in different directions. “Is sarkar ko koi idhar toh koi udhar se khich raha hai ( this government is being pulled in different directions),” the RJD chief said, an oblique reference to how there was growing friction between BJP and JD(U) in the state government apparently obstructing development initiatives. The RJD and JD(U) will face off in an intense battle in the upcoming by-polls which has become multi-cornered as the Congress too has fielded its candidates from both the seats. Prasad, who has started displaying his trademark sarcasm against his opponents, also mocked Kumar for saying that the RJD chief could get him shot. “I had told we will give visharjan (immersion) of the NDA government. Now, Nitish is saying I can get him shot. Why will I do that? He will himself die,” he said. Prasad took pot-shots at the state government over prohibition and the Chief Minister’s alleged failure to get the special status category demand fulfilled. “In Bihar, it’s rats that drink liquor,” he said, wearing a smile to make the point as how prohibition had opened channels of illegal liquor smuggling in the state. There have been media reports of how seized illegal liquor bottles have vanished from police stations with cops claiming that rodents drank up the liquor. The RJD chief, who visited Tarapur in a helicopter and is scheduled to address another meeting at Kushweshwar Asthan in the afternoon on the last day of campaigning in both the seats, also poked fun at the Chief Minister for not getting the special category status demand fulfilled despite re-aligning with the BJP. “Nitish had vowed he would prefer to bite the dust than join hands with the BJP. But he went back on his word and joined the saffron party. Did he get the special status for Bihar?” the 74-year-old former railway minister said, exhorting the crowd to vote for the RJD and oust the NDA from power. He also referred to how he had given unconditional support to Kumar to make him the CM after JD (U) had joined hands with RJD and Congress in the 2015 assembly polls. “But he chose to join the BJP. In Bihar, there is no development and unemployment is rampant,” Prasad said, trashing the NDA’s claim of making big strides on the development front. Besides, he also underlined his campaign for caste census would continue as it would give benefits to the poor and weaker sections in welfare schemes based on the numerical strength of the OBCs and backward classes. “I am now back in Bihar and will continue to be among you people. We have to fight,” he said. The RJD has fielded Arun Kumar from the Tarapur seat and Ganesh Bharti from the Kushweshwar Asthan seat. State president of the RJD Jagdanand Singh, former MP Jai Prakash Yadav and other senior leaders were present at RJD chief’s meeting. Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav also addressed rallies at Tarapur and announced that there would be a big rally on the issue of unemployment early next year either in January or February at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. Tejashwi, during his rallies in election meetings last year, had promised to give 10 lakh jobs to youth if his party came to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-i-been-out-of-jail-tejashwi-would-have-formed-govt-in-bihar-says-lalu-prasad-101635331597439.html

27-10-2021||India||NIA court convicts 9 of 10 accused in 2013 serial blasts in Modi's Patna rally||A special NIA court on Wednesday convicted nine out of 10 accused in the 2013 serial blasts in Patna's Gandhi Maidan. At least six people were killed and over 90 sustained injuries during the blasts that occured during a rally by the then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on October 27, 2013. The court of additional district and sessions judge Gurwinder Singh Malhotra, which held the nine guilty of planting and detonating the explosions, is likely to pronounce the quantum of the sentence on November 1.According to multiple media reports, six of the explosions took place around the venue of the rally while two bombs went off within 150 metres of the dais from where Modi addressed the gathering. Another bomb went off some 20 minutes before Modi and top BJP leaders took the stage. Four live bombs were found near the spot of the rally later. A crude bomb reportedly exploded at a toilet near Patna railway station.However, Modi went ahead with the rally to “calm nerves” and prevent a stampede at the packed Gandhi Maidan.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case on November 6, 2013, and filed a chargesheet against 11 accused, including a minor, in August 2014. One of the accused, Tariq Ansari, succumbed to his injuries from the bomb that went off inside a toilet near the Patna railway station. Meanwhile, the minor accused was sentenced on October 12, 2017 for three years by the Juvenile Justice Board after being found guilty.The NIA nabbed alleged mastermind Haider Ali alias ‘Black Beauty’, Taufeeq Ansari, Mohammed Mojibullah Ansari and Numan Ansari in connection with the case in 2014.The NIA said the accused had planned the blasts at the Gandhi Maidan rally after they failed to get close to Modi at previous rallies in New Delhi, Chhatisgarh and Uttar Pradesh that year.The final hearing of the case started in June 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-court-convicts-9-of-10-accused-in-2013-serial-blasts-in-modi-s-patna-rally-101635322578825.html

Also, the boundary question is of concern to India as the same remained unresolved between the two nations, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a statement.“Such unilateral move will have no bearing on the arrangements that both sides have already reached earlier, whether it is on the boundary question or for maintaining peace and tranquillity along LAC in India-China border areas,” the statement read, adding that India expected China to avoid undertaking any action under the pretext of the new law that could unilaterally alter the situation in the border areas.China’s unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implication on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us: MEA on China's new 'Land Boundary Law' pic.twitter.com/LpBE78l3gKRegarding the boundary question that the MEA said remained unresolved, the MEA said, “Both sides have agreed to seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution to the boundary question through consultations on an equal footing. We have also concluded several bilateral agreements, protocols and arrangements to maintain peace and tranquility along the LAC… in the interim”   “The passage of this new law does not in our view confer any legitimacy to the so-called China-Pakistan "Boundary Agreement” of 1963 which the Government of India has consistently maintained is an illegal and invalid agreement," Bagchi further said in the statement.According to the statement, the new law stated among other things that China abided by treaties concluded with or jointly acceded to by countries on land boundary affairs.

At least six crude bombs left six people dead and around 90 wounded before Modi, who was then the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate, addressed the rally. The explosive devices went off after a blast at a nearby railway station. Four unexploded devices were also found.

Opposition leaders welcomed the top court’s move.Congress leader Randeep Surjewala tweeted shortly after the Supreme Court announced the move, slamming what he called “pseudo nationalism”. “[I] welcome the Supreme Court order setting up a special committee to examine the misuse of spyware #Pegasus despite the Modi government’s embarrassing attempts to evade, avoid and divert attention in the name of national security,” he tweeted.Surjewala sought to draw parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration and British writer George Orwell’s novel 1984. Also Read: Tablets and smartphones to be distributed among youngsters by Nov: UP CM YogiSurjewala tweeted, “The mirror today for the Modi government is the quote from George Orwell’s ‘1984’- A dystopian state, where the government oppresses free speech, manufactures false propaganda on a daily basis, and violates the personal lives of its citizens through constant surveillance. #PegasusSnoopgate.”Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien retweeted journalist Arvind Gunasekar’s tweet on the development and wrote, “BOOM. There you go. So the BJP (and not the Opposition) were solely responsible for DISRUPTING THE ENTIRE MONSOON SESSION of #Parliament.” Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas of the CPI(M) welcomed the Supreme Court order directing an investigation by a team of experts. “The [Supreme Court’s] directions to an expert committee to make recommendations to ensure the prevention of invasion of citizens’ right to privacy… is a leap forward in the area of privacy protection,” he said.Brittas, in a writ petition filed before the top court, had sought a court-monitored probe handled by experts.The Pegasus spyware row erupted on July 18 after an international consortium of media outlets and investigative journalists reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among 50,000 persons who were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to the consortium, Pegasus can switch on its target’s smartphone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device.Responding to a petitions filed by lawyers, politicians, journalists and civil rights activists, the union ministry of electronics and IT filed a three-page affidavit on August 16 that refused to confirm or deny whether it had used Pegasus spyware to carry out a surveillance programme. The Centre instead offered to set up an expert committee to look into the controversy and “dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-crisis-supreme-court-forms-probe-committee-opposition-welcomes-move-101635327036944.html

When people of the SBSP and SP have united, may be the public would help us win 400 seats in UP.”“This election is to make the future. This election is to restore the last honour.”“Our alliance is for restoring the rights and respect of the poor, OBCs and the downtrodden. There may be conspiracies, but don't forget inflation -- the rising petrol and diesel prices,” Yadav said.The SP chief said the BJP government did not provide any help to labourers during the Covid-19 pandemic. “This government left the poor to fend for themselves. It failed to provide treatment and oxygen during the crisis. The BJP government did nothing,” he said.“The governments in Lucknow and Delhi are lying. The youth is trying hard to find employment. There is starvation in the state. UP is lagging behind on the development front. Poor are committing suicide. The government sold out several factories.”“The BJP promised to double the income of farmers. I want to ask which crop price has been doubled. Will the farmers get double the price of their paddy? Prices of fertilisers have increased. Agricultural costs have only gone up. When the farmers asked for their rights, they were mowed down under the jeep by the son of a minister of this government.“So far that Union minister has not been removed. How can victims get justice?” the former chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khadeda-hobe-akhilesh-gives-a-up-twist-to-tmc-s-winning-slogan-in-bengal-101635325852872.html

"My father is a Hindu, My mother a Muslim. My mother had asked me perform the wedding as per Islamic rituals and I fulfilled my mother's wish, which is not a crime. The very same month in which Nikah was performed, we got our marriage registered under provisions of the Special Marriages Act. What I did is not a crime," Wankhede said after Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik tweeted a copy of his 'nikah nama' or marriage certificate t alleging that despite being a ‘Muslim’ Wankhede got IRS job in SC quota. Aryan Khan case: Nawab Malik posts photos of Sameer Wankhede’s ‘nikah’Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik has brought several allegations against Sameer Wankhede, including of false cases and extortions. What started as slamming each other in the aftermath of the arrest of Aryan Khan has now turned into a political storm with Nawab Malik bringing out personal details of Sameer Wankhede. "I want to make it clear that the issue I am exposing of Sameer Dawood Wankhede is not about his religion. I want to bring to light the fraudulent means by which he has obtained a caste certificate to get an IRS job and has deprived a deserving Scheduled Caste person of his future," the minister tweeted on Wednesday.

It has urged eyewitnesses to contact the team for recording statements, and provide digital evidence.Officials said the SIT will ensure the identities of eyewitnesses are kept confidential. If they want, they will be given security as well.The contact numbers, including that of SIT head Upendra Agarwal (9454400454). were shared through an advertisement. The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the protection of the eyewitness and directed Uttar Pradesh police to expedite the recording of their statements before a judicial magistrate.The other members of the SIT include Sunil Kumar Singh (9454400394), Arun Kumar Singh (9454401072), Vidyaram Diwaker (7017496741) and Sudhir Chandra Pandey (9450782977).Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son, Ashish Mishra, the main accused in the violence, was separately moved back to the prison from a district jail hospital in Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday. He was hospitalised on Saturday after medical tests showed that his blood sugar had reached a “critical level” and he was diagnosed with dengue.Farming groups say Teni’s Mahindra Thar mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same. The minister and his son have denied the charge that the latter was in the vehicle, and say farmers stoned the car and the driver lost control of the vehicle.The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that the accused have been identified by eyewitnesses. The court has taken up the matter on its own as a public interest litigation. It directed Uttar Pradesh police on October 20 to pull up its socks and record witnesses’ statements before the magistrate under Section 164 as quickly as possible to dispel the impression that the state is “dragging its feet”. The court said that the witnesses’ statements before a magistrate will have more evidentiary value.Ashish Mishra was arrested on October 9, a day after the Supreme Court came down heavily on the state government for its lenient handling of the main accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-case-sit-shares-phone-numbers-urges-witnesses-to-come-forward-101635324036819.html
27-10-2021||India||Delhi govt to start its anti-firecracker campaign from today||The Delhi government will start its anti-firecracker campaign “Patake Nahi, Diye Jalao” from Wednesday. As many as 15 teams are being deployed across each of the 15 Delhi Police districts to check the use and sale of firecrackers in the run-up to Diwali. Officials said each team will have five to seven members. Violators will be prosecuted under the Indian Penal Code’s Sections including 286 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) as well as under the Explosives Act, which entails a jail term of up to three years. The second component of the campaign involves reaching out to Resident Welfare Associations and market associations to discourage firecracker bursting and instead to associate diyas (lamps) with Diwali.The Delhi government has asked people to report the use and sale of firecrackers by calling on the number 112. Each of the 157 police stations across Delhi will have a dedicated team of two to deal with firecracker related issues.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said eight people were prosecuted for bursting firecrackers across the capital on Karva Chauth (Sunday).The government last year initially allowed green firecrackers to be burst or sold. It later also cancelled licences issued for their sale as Covid-19 cases began to rise across the capital. The government said a notification was issued to the police and district magistrates on September 28, prohibiting the issuance of licences for any kind of firecracker sales.Also Read: Only ‘green crackers’ permitted in Bengal for 2 hours during DiwaliThe bursting of firecrackers, coupled with low temperatures and stubble burning, lead to a sharp spike in pollution levels in the region. Last year, despite the ban on crackers, Delhi recorded numerous violations as the overall PM 2.5 levels spiked up to 33 times the safe standard at locations such as Vivek Vihar. A peak of 1,970 micrograms per cubic metre, as opposed to a safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre, was recorded there.An environment department official said while the powers to penalise people lay with the police, they will receive daily action taken reports from them daily. In addition, teams from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee would also be visiting markets to penalise illegal firecracker sellers. “Leading up to Diwali, efforts have been intensified to ensure no firecrackers are burst sold anywhere. Data will be compiled each day over the number of people prosecuted and this will also give us an idea of which areas are possibly seeing more instances of firecrackers being burst or sold,” the official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-to-start-its-anti-firecracker-campaign-today-101635323496539.html
27-10-2021||India||Expect India to pitch 450GW renewable energy target in Glasgow: Alok Sharma||Just days before a major UN-led summit on climate change opens in Glasgow, Alok Sharma, the president of the event popularly known as COP26, said he expects India to present its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) at the talks with a 450GW renewable energy target by 2030 incorporated in it. Saying that every country starts with a different energy mix, Sharma added that India’s informal goal of 450GW should be formalised in its NDC before the COP26 gets underway on October 31. “That is what I told Indian officials and ministers when I was there,” said Sharma at a virtual press conference organised on Tuesday by Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of journalists and newsrooms to produce more informed and urgent climate change stories. HT is a part of the initiative.The COP26 annual summit on climate change action is also called the United Nations Climate Change Conference.There is no confirmation on what India’s submission at COP26 is likely to be. At an informal briefing on COP26 to select journalists last week, officials said details related to the submission and stance are yet to be approved by the union Cabinet. Also Read: India lost $87 billion to climate disasters in 2020: Report“These decisions are taken at the highest level and have to be passed by the Cabinet before they are announced,” said an official. Officials have not commented on whether India will present an updated NDC.In response to a question about the depleting carbon budget and if he sees developed countries taking up advanced net zero targets, Sharma said it’s an issue that was raised when he was in New Delhi. “The CBDR (Common But Differentiated Responsibilities) is part of the Paris Agreement. My consistent message to every country is that we all need to play our part. I am impressed with the target of 450GW. What I want is that should reflect in the NDC.”Over 120 world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are expected to attend the summit on November 1 and 2. Sharma said Chinese President Xi Jinping has not confirmed his presence, but a Chinese negotiating team will be present in Glasgow.Sharma said Glasgow will be more challenging than Paris. “Our overarching ambition is to say at the end of Glasgow that we have kept [the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming preferably to] 1.5 degrees Celsius alive,” Sharma said. He said an agreement is likely at the end of Glasgow on how the world will keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius. “Glasgow will be the biggest event for the UK since the 2012 Olympics, but there is the added complexity of looking to reach an agreement with 200 parties,” he said.Also Read: Ahead of CoP 26 meet: A Negotiation StrategySharma underlined the need to bend the curve towards 2 degrees Celsius. “But it is still not what the Paris Agreement said. If all the commitments made are not well below 2 degrees Celsius, then we have to reflect on how in this decade we need to come back and reappraise the commitments that have been made. Again, we have to build consensus around this. We have to look to reach some agreement.”A 14-15 member delegation with officials from the ministries of power, finance, earth sciences, agriculture, new and renewable energy, environment, and water will represent India at COP26. Environment minister Bhupender Yadav will head the Indian delegation.PM Narendra Modi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are expected to make a joint statement on a mission dubbed “Green Grids Initiative - One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG)” at COP26.The GGI-OSOWOG project will bring technical, financial, and research cooperation to help facilitate cross-border renewable energy transfer projects as part of the International Solar Alliance.Yadav is expected to lead India during the negotiations in the second week of COP26 when issues related to the Paris rulebook are likely to be deliberated. The rulebook is a set of guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement.Officials have maintained it is not mandatory for India to update its NDC. “It can update it during the global stocktake in 2023. Whatever India announces will be on a voluntary basis,” said an official, requesting anonymity. “Developed countries have been pushing India to announce a net zero emissions target. But for us, our position is clear. Action has to be taken based on historical responsibility, which means they (developed countries) transition to net zero emissions first, leaving the carbon space for us to grow.”India is expected to push for climate change justice, and equity and contribution based on historical responsibility during negotiations with a similar stand as that of 24 other like-minded developing countries, including China.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, has announced plans to reach net zero emissions by 2060. The UAE became the first Gulf nation to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. Russia and China have also announced plans to transition to net zero by 2060. According to the UN, 130 countries have set or are considering a net zero emissions target by mid-century.Centre for Science and Environment director general Sunita Narain said India should announce an enhanced NDC, not because of its responsibility or contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions, but because it is in the country’s best interest. “For us, climate action is for co-benefit,” Narain said. World Resources Institute director Ulka Kelkar said India is entitled to carbon space, but can consider a suitable target year for net zero CO2 emissions. “India is already putting in place the building blocks of a net zero future, such as scaling up renewable energy and investing in green hydrogen. Over time, it can also consider adding a carbon tax and retiring old inefficient thermal power plants, which will yield economic gains and health benefits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26-alok-sharma-wants-india-to-pitch-450gw-renewable-energy-target-in-glasgow-101635322896499.html

Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was arrested in the case on October 3. Malik said he had proof that an international drug lord was present at the Cordelia rave party along with his girl friend but the NCB team led by Wankhede chose not to act against him since the drug lord was his “friend”. Malik claimed he has the pictures and video footage to corroborate this and could share them with the NCB, if the agency approached him.Aryan Khan was arrested by an NCB team that claimed to have busted an alleged drugs party on the Cordelia Cruise ship which was on its way to Goa on October 3 off the Mumbai coast. A total of 20 people, including two Nigerian nationals, have been arrested so far in the case. Aryan Khan has been denied bail in the case with the courts upholding NCB’s contention that there was enough material on record to suggest that Khan could have been involved in an international drugs racket. The defence has however argued that there was no proof of Khan’s involvement in any drugs racket and no basis for his arrest since drugs were not found in his possession. The high profile matter took a further twist when Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the case, alleged on Monday that Wankhede and some other NCB officials had sought ₹25 crore from Shah Rukh Khan as extortion money to release Aryan. Following Sail’s allegation, a vigilance probe was ordered into Wankhede’s conduct and Mumbai Police too announced a probe against the officer. Without naming Aryan Khan, Malik has now said that the party was organised with the mala fide intention of framing “certain” individuals.“A rave party was organised, drugs were sold, people enjoyed themselves there, but no action on the drug lord present at the party. Cruise was not stopped, over 1300 people were not scanned. Instead, NCB deployed people with pictures of certain individuals with the intention of wrongly framing them,” Malik said.“No seizure was made either from the cruise or the terminal. The pictures of seizure distributed by NCB are from Wankhede’s cabin based on which publicity was taken,” he continued.Also Read | Cruise drugs case: Police appoint officer to probe allegations against NCB investigator WankhedeMalik said that the rave party was organised without any permissions including from the Mumbai police or the state home department despite the Covid restrictions being in place. Only permission they had was from the director general (DG), Shipping.Posing further questions on Wankhede’s integrity, Malik also shared pictures of NCB officer’s Nikah with his first wife Dr Shabana Qureshi and the nikahnama (marriage contract) on his Twitter handle to claim that the NCB zonal director had “forged documents” to make a Scheduled Caste (SC) certificate in order to get into public service commission. “My point is to prove that Wankhede got a caste certificate with bogus documents and got a job as an IRS (Indian Revenue Service) officer. He has snatched away the right of a deserving Scheduled Caste (SC) candidate. I am trying to prove his fraud and not his religion,” he clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wankhede-let-off-an-international-drug-lord-in-cruise-ship-raid-nawab-malik-101635321636507.html

He added that the pilgrimage scheme, which was stopped for more than a year owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, is likely to resume within a month as the situation gradually normalises.Kejriwal had promised a day ago that the temple town of Ayodhya will be included in the Delhi government's free pilgrimage scheme for aged people. On Tuesday, Kejriwal visited the Ram Janmabhoomi and the Hanumangarhi temples in Ayodhya and said, “I was fortunate that I got the chance to bow before Ram Lalla, and I wish everyone must get this chance.”Also Read | In Ayodhya, Arvind Kejriwal prays to Ram Lalla, Lord HanumanThe Delhi chief minister vowed that he will do everything in his capability to “make more and more people have darshan here.”Under the Chief Minister’s Teerth Yatra Yojana (chief minister’s pilgrimage scheme), the residents of Delhi can travel to pilgrimage sites such as Vaishno Devi, Rameshwaram, Dwarka Puri, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Mathura, and Vrindavan free-of-cost.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reacted to the Delhi chief minister's trip to Ayodhya and indicated that it was just a "political gimmick" ahead of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Ved Prakash Gupta, the BJP MLA from Ayodhya Sadar, said, “AAP was earlier opposing the Ram Mandir. The Delhi chief minister had even suggested that a university be made instead of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Now they are talking about Lord Ram and seeking his blessings.”Continuing his critique, the BJP leader said, “People are not fools. They are well aware of the divisive politics of the AAP."Notably, Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP has announced that it would contest the state assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, slated to be held early next year. The party has said that it would contest all the 403 assembly seats in the 2022 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-free-pilgrimage-scheme-now-includes-ayodhya-set-to-resume-in-a-month-101635317881616.html

27-10-2021||India||SC forms independent expert committee to probe Pegasus revelations||The Supreme Court on Wednesday set up a three-member expert committee, to be supervised by a former judge of the top court, to inquire into the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance of Indian citizens, as it noted that the issues raised directly concern “the potential chilling effect” on right to privacy and freedom of speech.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, said that retired SC judge RV Raveendran will supervise the functioning of the technical committee, which will look into the “truth or falsity of the allegations” and will submit a report “expeditiously”. “We make it clear that our effort is to uphold the constitutional aspirations and rule of law, without allowing ourselves to be consumed in the political rhetoric. This Court has always been conscious of not entering the political thicket. However, at the same time, it has never cowered from protecting all from the abuses of fundamental rights,” stated the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The members of the technical committee named by the court are: Dr Naveen Kumar Chaudhary, professor (Cyber Security and Digital Forensics) and dean, National Forensic Sciences University, Gandhinagar, Gujarat; Dr Prabaharan P, professor (School of Engineering), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kerala and Dr Ashwin Anil Gumaste, institute chair associate professor (Computer Science and Engineering), Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Maharashtra.Former judge Raveendran, in supervising the work of the technical committee, will be assisted by former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Alok Joshi and Dr Sundeep Oberoi, chairman, sub committee in (International Organisation of Standardisation/ International Electro-Technical Commission/Joint Technical Committee). Posting the clutch of cases for after eight weeks, the bench said that the technical committee will go into the issues relating to the right to privacy, procedure followed for interception and involvement of foreign agencies in surveilling Indian citizens.The CJI, while reading out the operative part of the order, asserted that the members of a civilised democratic society have a reasonable expectation of privacy. “Privacy is not the singular concern of journalists or social activists. Every citizen of India ought to be protected against violations of privacy. It is this expectation which enables us to exercise our choices, liberties, and freedom,” read the orderAlso Read: UP bar council to cancel licences of lawyers filing fake insurance claimsIt also highlighted that “in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution.”The court added that unlawful surveillance is of particular concern when it relates to the freedom of the press, which is an important pillar of democracy. “Such chilling effect on the freedom of speech is an assault on the vital public-watchdog role of the press, which may undermine the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information,” maintained the bench.The bench further rejected the Central government’s plea to let it set up a committee to look into the controversy, noting that it will violate the settled judicial principle against bias -- ‘justice must not only be done, but also be seen to be done’. In its order, the apex court has also pulled up the Union government for raising the issue of national security instead of filing a detailed affidavit to clarify various pertinent points raised by the petitioners, some of whom had complained that their phones were hacked using Israeli spyware Pegasus.The court said that national security cannot be used as a “bugbear” by the Centre and that the court will not give the Union government “a free pass every time the spectre of national security is raised.”“Union of India must necessarily plead and prove the facts which indicate that the information sought must be kept secret as their divulgence would affect national security concerns. They must justify the stand that they take before a court. The mere invocation of national security by the State does not render the Court a mute spectator,” said the court.It underlined that it would have been a different situation had the Centre opted to make its stand clear instead of filing a limited affidavit on August 16 that did not shed any light on their stand or provide any clarity as to the facts of the matter at hand.The bench held that the petitioners have placed on record certain material that prima facie merits consideration by the Supreme Court and the “omnibus and vague denial” by the Centre is not sufficient when there is no specific denial of any of the facts placed in the pleas. “In such circumstances, we have no option but to accept the prima facie case made out by the petitioners to examine the allegations made,” it concluded.The court, on September 13, reserved its order in the case after the Union government said that it could not make public whether its agencies used the Israeli spyware as such disclosure would be against national interest. With this statement, the government returned to a position it articulated on August 17, before suggesting on September 7 that it could reconsider its stand.The reiteration of its stand by the government also prompted the court to remark that the Centre was “beating around the bush”. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, however said at the time that the government was open to having a committee of independent domain experts to go into all aspects of the controversy and submit its report before the bench while adding that the use of a particular software “cannot be made a part of the public discourse in the larger national interest and in the interest of the security of the nation”.The SG requested the bench to allow the government to set up an expert committee. But most of the lawyers for the petitioners, including senior counsel Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Dinesh Dwivedi, Colin Gonsalves and Meenakshi Arora, urged the court to reject the government’s proposal, contending that the “wrongdoer” could not be allowed to have the liberty of choosing the forum of inquiry. The lawyers submitted that the court should set up a panel consisting of members of its choice to go into the issue and report back.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international consortium of media outlets and investigative journalists reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning the phone into a pocket spy.Responding to a bunch of petitions filed by lawyers, politicians, journalists and civil rights activists, the Union ministry of electronics and information technology filed a three-page affidavit on August 16 that refused to confirm or deny whether it had used Pegasus spyware for surveillance of Indians. The Centre instead offered to set up an expert committee to look into the controversy and “dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-up-committee-to-probe-pegasus-snooping-row-101635316896065.html
27-10-2021||India||Amarinder Singh says will form new party ahead of Punjab polls, targets Sidhu||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced that he will form a political party of his own before the assembly elections in the state, but refused to divulge any more details about it. Singh was interacting with the media in Chandigarh."Yes, I am forming a party. My lawyers are working on it. But I can't tell you the name, I will tell you when the Election Commission approves it. We have made a request for a symbol also," said Singh.Also Read | Opinion:  In fratricidal mode, Congress is its own worst enemy in PunjabThe move is on the expected lines, as Singh had said last week that he would soon launch his own party, and was hopeful of a seat arrangement with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) provided the ongoing farmers' stir against farm laws was resolved in their interest."We are going to meet home minister Amit Shah on the issue of farmers' stir. I have met him thrice earlier," the Congress leader said today.Singh said he will meet the Union home minister in Delhi on Thursday "along with 25-30 people” to discuss the Centre's three farm laws. Those expected to accompany him include three-four state leaders and farm experts.Also Read | ‘No MLA would join him’: Navjot Kaur Sidhu on Captain Amarinder SinghThe two-time former chief minister also lashed out at current incumbent Charanjit Singh Channi, who said that the state government will move Supreme Court against the Centre's decision to increase the jurisdiction of Border Security Force (BSF)."Taking over Punjab is a total misconception. No one is taking over the states. This is to tackle drones. The technology is getting advanced and payloads of drones are increasing. To undermine these concerns is irresponsible," said Singh."I am not an alarmist but I know what is happening. Don't deny this, but tackle it," he added.Taking a jibe at deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa for the recent allegations against him on the security situation, the Congress leader said that he has been home minister for 9.5 years and knows the situation. "Someone who has been home minister for one month seems to talk as if he knows more than me.”Singh is still to formally quit the Congress. When asked about it at the press conference today, he said, "I have been in the Congress for 52 years, if I stay in it for 10 more days what will happen."He once again targeted Navjot Singh Sidhu, with whom he fought a long political battle.“Congress' popularity in Punjab has seen a drop of 25 per cent ever since Sidhu has taken over,” Singh said at the press conference today, quoting data from surveys got done by him.He also said that he will fight Sidhu in the Assembly elections “wherever he fights from”.Singh was made to resign as the chief minister on September 18 following months turbulence and tussle in the state unit during which Sidhu, who was appointed the state Congress president despite Singh's objections, and several ministers and legislators rebelled against him.Assembly elections are due in Punjab next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-says-will-form-new-party-ahead-of-punjab-polls-targets-sidhu-101635315452682.html

The team is expected to record the statement of key witness Prabhakar Sail in connection with a corruption allegation he made against his employer, Kiran Gosavi, also a witness in the Aryan Khan drugs case, and NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who is probing the case.“Sail was summoned by the vigilance team and there are chances that his statement will be recorded today. Apart from Sail, the vigilance team could also record the statement of Wankhede today” an NCB source said. Sameer Wankhede returned to Mumbai from New Delhi late on Tuesday after meeting a senior official at the NCB’s headquarters in the Capital, the source said.

Sail was present near Mumbai’s Green Gate during the drug raid on a cruise ship that eventually led to the arrest of Aryan Khan, actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son.He also claimed that the NCB made him sign on blank papers. Sameer Wankhede has already denied the charges. He called them baseless, saying they were aimed at defaming him.Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, meanwhile, has accused Sameer Wankhede of using a fake caste certificate to get a government job under a reserved quota. The minister tweeted a copy of a birth certificate, which he claimed is of Sameer Wankhede. The document showed his father’s name is “Dawood K Wankhede”, while it is “Dnyandev Wankhede” as per the NCB website.Responding to the allegation, Wankhede told HT, “The allegations levelled by Nawab Malik are baseless and are made solely to humiliate me and my family, and to divert my attention from the investigation [into the drugs case involving Aryan Khan].” Wankhede also released a caste certificate of several of his family members, including his father, uncles and first cousins, showing that all of them belong to Mahar people, a scheduled caste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drugs-case-ncb-vigilance-team-may-record-wankhede-sail-statements-101635316056237.html

He highlighted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis and said that while India began at a point where it did not even have enough medicines of its own, the country became self-reliant on its needs and eventually supplied medicines and other related drugs to more than 150 nations across the world.“Today, India is the largest manufacturer and supplier of generic medicines,” Mandaviya said at the Invest India's Investors Summit on Wednesday. “We believe in ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. We are seeing to it that the world gets affordable medicines.”The health minister, who also holds the chemical and fertilisers charge at the Narendra Modi cabinet, added, “When the first wave of Covid-19 hit, the world did not have enough medicines [for the coronavirus disease]. We not only brought our own situation under control and met our own medicine requirements but also supplied medicines to over 150 nations. This is our commitment.”The summit was a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to further strengthen India's position globally in terms of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Its theme was “Opportunities and Partnerships in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices.”Later in the day, Mansukh Mandaviya is scheduled to chair a meeting with state health ministers to focus on ramping up the Covid-19 vaccination drive in the country.Meanwhile, India's inoculation coverage exceeded 103.53 crore as per a provisional report issued by the Union health ministry on Wednesday. “With the administration of 55,89,124 vaccine doses in the last 24 hours, India's Covid-19 vaccination coverage has exceeded 103.53 Cr (1,03,53,25,577) as per provisional reports till 7 am today,” the health ministry said.India has reported 13,451 new Covid-19 cases, 14,021 recoveries, and 585 deaths in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry further informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-committed-to-supplying-affordable-medicines-to-the-world-health-minister-101635311963605.html

People concerned are being thorough about it as it concerns children,” said a government official aware of the matter, requesting not to be named. “The guidelines on a list of specified comorbidities, and other procedural clarifications should be out soon.”The Covid-19 vaccination drive for children is likely to be introduced next month in a phased manner. It could start with giving anti-Covid shots to those aged 12 and above, much like there was a phased approach with the country’s adult population, with children considered vulnerable to Covid-19 getting the first jabs.Also Read: Mandaviya to meet health ministers of states over Covid vaccine administrationZydus Healthcare’s Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, which received emergency-use authorisation last month, has been tested in those aged 12 and above.“The list of comorbidities will be specified as it was done in [the case of] adults. While age was a major criterion for adults, in the case of children, comorbid conditions are likely to be the deciding factor for eligibility. The specified condition may need confirmation from a certified doctor, and whether it’s okay to take the shot. The guidelines will clarify these things,” said the government official.Health-related conditions that are likely to be included on the list are all types of cancers, congenital heart disease, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and lung-related ailments. Children who have undergone an organ transplant will also be prioritised.Meanwhile, the national drugs regulator continues to analyse Covaxin data before granting approval for emergency use in children, said union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday, even though an expert committee of the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) already recommended its use in children two weeks ago.“This is a sensitive matter as it deals with children. Therefore, the government has been clear and taken a stand, from the start, to not interfere in the decision-making on this technical topic. Let technical experts handle it,” said Mandaviya. “However, according to the information that I have, the technical committee has granted its approval on the matter, and the data is being further analysed. Decision on the [Covid-19] vaccine’s use in children will be based on the outcome of that analysis. The analysis is not only based on local data, but also on what’s the global trend, as it deals with children,” the health minister said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-soon-roll-out-guidelines-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-for-children-101635313475445.html

The committee, comprising Sunita Duggal, Vanathi Sriniwasan and Rupa Mitra, is expected to visit the place of the incident and also hold an interaction with the people of the area.In an official statement, the BJP said that its national president JP Nadda condemned the ghastly incident in Kalahandi district.Also Read| BJP, Cong keeps up pressure on Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik govt over Kalahandi caseOn October 19, a partially-charred body of a 26-year-old teacher Mamita Meher was found in an under-construction stadium of a private school in Kalahandi.Meher had gone missing on October 8. Officials told the Hindustan Times earlier that the teacher accused Gobind Sahu, the president of Sunshine School's managing committee, of running a sex racket in the premises and had reportedly threatened to expose his wrongdoings.Gobind Sahu was arrested last week on charges of allegedly killing Mamita Meher, and was sent to judicial custody at the end of his five-day police remand on Monday.The BJP and the Congress, which are the main opposition parties in Odisha, have demanded the resignation of state home minister Dibya Shankar Mishra by alleging that he was close to Gobind Sahu.A 3-member committee has been constituted "to look into the kidnapping, burning & dumping of the body of a woman in Mahaling segment of Junagarh Assembly under Kalahandi Parliamentary constituency; committee to visit the incident place & interact with the people of the area": BJP pic.twitter.com/mDkSoVft2bThe BJP, meanwhile, alleged that the teacher was raped by Sahu during Mishra’s reported frequent school visits.

His fresh tweets about Wankhede came two days after he said the officer is a Muslim but obtained a Hindu caste certificate by forgery to get into IRS under the scheduled caste category.He tweeted a copy of a birth certificate, which he claimed is of Sameer Wankhede.

The letter claims the NCB allegedly planted drugs shown to have been seized in some of the cases.The NCB on Monday started probing allegations that Sameer Wankhede was part of an alleged ₹25 crore extortion racket after the arrest of Aryan Khan in the drug bust case. A vigilance inquiry was ordered after one of the NCB’s witnesses in the case, Prabhakar Sail, made the claim.Nawab Malik has also accused Sameer Wankhede of framing his son-in-law and two others in a drug peddling case in January and delaying the process for their bail. He said the NCB showed 200kg herbal tobacco as “ganja” and produced photographs of seizures taken at its office.The officer’s second wife, Kranti Redkar, and sister Jasmeen Wankhede on Tuesday denied all the allegations at a press conference, saying if Malik has proof, he should go to court instead of holding the media trial and targeting their family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drug-bust-case-nawab-malik-posts-photos-of-sameer-wankhede-s-nikah-101635310955515.html

Earlier this month on October 5, a double judge bench of justice MR Shah and justice AS Bopanna of the Supreme Court had shamed the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for not acting against advocates found to be submitting fake claim petitions and said that the “unfortunate” situation reflected “callousness and insensitivity” on the part of the bar. Following SC’s castigation, the UP bar council said it will cancel all such lawyers’ licence for legal practice. “All directives of the Supreme Court will be followed in this regard,” said Prashant Singh, member–secretary of the UP bar council. “This act falls in the category of misconduct of lawyers,” he added. While fixing November 16 as the next date of hearing in the case, the apex court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to submit list of all such lawyers in a sealed envelope by November 15. A special investigation team of the Uttar Pradesh government has been investigating cases of lawyers causing loss of several crore to insurance companies by submitting fake claims under the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act as per an October 7, 2015 order given by Allahabad high court. The cases of such fraudulent conduct were forwarded by private insurer ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company .

It has asked the ministry of external affairs to have a gender-inclusive staffing pattern and, if required, through gender quotas. “For this, monitoring of foreign policies needs to be done for gender balancing of skewed ratios, wherever found,” the NHRC said.The recommendations were made by the NHRC’s Core Group on Women, which met on September 14 to discuss the dismal representation of women at international forums.Representatives from the ministries of external affairs, personnel, women and child welfare, and the NHRC attended the meet.The attendees noted that there has been no policy in the country on the participation of women at international forums. Even the Draft National Policy on Women 2016, does not have any component that encourages women’s participation and their representation at international forums, according to the minutes of meetings reviewed by HT.Also Read: At NHRC event, PM Modi warns against ‘selective interpretation’ of human rightsThe group asked the ministry of personnel to incorporate a specific policy component on women’s participation at the international level in the Draft National Policy and form a working group to identify structural issues.Some members pointed out that there’s a lack of opportunities for women from fields other than foreign service officers in representing India at the international level, such as at UN bodies. They said that women have not been nominated to date to the post of Sherpa at G20.Also, there is limited access for women entrepreneurs engaged in the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector to contribute to India’s foreign trade policy. The NHRC asked the MSME ministry to promote women entrepreneurs at the international level. It said the Prime Minister’s Office and the ministry of home affairs should realise their commitment and work towards obligations under Article 8 of CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). The UN General Assembly adopted the convention in 1979. Article 8 of CEDAW says the “state parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure to women, on equal terms with men and without any discrimination, the opportunity to represent their governments at the international level and to participate in the work of international organisations”.The NHRC said thrust should be put on a stronger commitment to mainstream gender at the policy level, especially in matters of security, since India is a Non-Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. It asked the ministry of education to introduce an updated curriculum to teach in schools and colleges about the contribution of 15 women, who were in the constituent assembly, to sensitise students about gender parity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrcasks-government-to-increase-participation-of-women-at-international-forums-101635306754756.html

Here are the allegations that Sameer Wankhede faces:• Nawab Malik on Tuesday cited a letter purportedly written by an anonymous employee of the agency alleging Sameer Wankhede framed innocent people in 26 fake drug cases. He also claimed Wankhede engaged two private persons to tap phones of the people to frame them. The letter claims the NCB allegedly planted drugs shown to have been seized in some of the cases.• On Monday, Nawab Malik claimed Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim but made a Hindu caste certificate by forgery to get into the Indian Revenue Service under the scheduled caste category. He tweeted a copy of a birth certificate, which he claimed is of Wankhede. The document shows his father’s name is Dawood K Wankhede while it is Dnyandev Wankhede as per the NCB website. Wankhede has rejected the allegation.Also Read: Not just Aryan Khan, these Bollywood celebrities have faced Sameer Wankhede• The NCB on Monday started probing allegations that Wankhede was part of a ₹25 crore extortion racket after the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan. A vigilance inquiry was ordered after one of the NCB’s witnesses in the case, Prabhakar Sail, made the claim.• Malik has also alleged that the day Aryan Khan was arrested, the NCB detained many others in connection with the same case but those linked to a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader were released. The NCB has insisted it detained around 14 persons on that day and six were released while the remaining eight, including Aryan Khan, were arrested.• Malik has also accused Sameer Wankhede of framing his son-in-law and two others in a drug peddling case in January and delaying the process for their bail. He said the NCB showed 200kg herbal tobacco as “ganja” and produced photographs of seizures taken at its office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drug-case-how-focus-shifted-from-aryan-khan-to-ncb-investigator-sameer-wankhede-101635305675055.html
27-10-2021||India||AY.4.2: At least 17 cases of new coronavirus lineage found in India. Details here||The AY.4.2 lineage of Covid-19, a subvariant of the Delta coronavirus strain, has appeared in at least six states of India, manifesting in as many as 17 cases reported so far, according to data uploaded on GISAID, an open-source database tracking the genomic signature of coronavirus variants. While the central government has said that a panel of experts was looking into this new coronavirus strain which is believed to be behind the recent infection explosion in the United Kingdom, British authorities have posited that AY.4.2 could possibly be even more transmissible than Delta, although there currently is no evidence suggesting that it caused more severe diseases or rendered vaccines ineffective.The most recent cases of AY.4.2 coronavirus variant reported in India was when two suspected cases were identified earlier this week and the samples were sent to a laboratory in Bengaluru for genome sequencing. As per data available on GISAID, the 17 samples of AY.4.2 found so far in India include – seven in Andhra Pradesh, four in Kerala, two each in Telangana and Karnataka, and one each in Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir.What is AY.4.2 sub-lineage?Matthew Bashton and Darren Smith, from Northumbria University in Newcastle, said that 75 AY lineages of the coronavirus have been identified till now, each with different additional defining mutations in their genome.Talking about these in The Conversation, the duo said one of these variants - the AY.4 - has been steadily growing in proportion in the UK over the last few months, accounting for 63 per cent of new cases in the last 28 days.“The defining change in AY.4.2 is the mutation A1711V, which affects the virus's Nsp3 protein, which plays a number of roles in viral replication. However, the impact of this mutation is unknown,” Bashton and Smith said in their article.Is there a need to be worried?Although the AY.4.2 coronavirus variant has entered several European countries at this point, experts believe that it has yet to take hold somewhere else other than the United Kingdom. It has dropped off the radar in Germany and Ireland, though it is lingering in Denmark.It is still too early to tell if this is the beginning of the next dominant lineage, and any ability this variant might have of escaping immunity needs to be confirmed by experimental work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ay42-at-least-17-cases-of-new-coronavirus-lineage-found-in-india-details-here-101635302760771.html

Modi, however, went ahead with the rally to calm nerves and prevent a stampede at the packed Gandhi Maidan. Nine Indian Mujahideen (IM) suspects and a Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) suspect were made accused in the case.The accused were identified as Numan Ansari, Haider Ali alias “Black Beauty”, Mohammed Mujibullah Ansari, Umar Siddiqui, Azharuddin Qureshi, Ahmed Hussain, Faqruddin, Mohammed Iftekhar Alam, and a minor, whose identity has been protected. The minor accused was sentenced on October 12, 2017 for three years by the Juvenile Justice Board after being found guilty of involvement in multiple blasts.

The NIA took up the case on November 6, 2013, and after probing the incident, it filed a charge sheet against the 11 accused on August 21, 2014. In the charge sheet, the NIA said the accused had planned the Patna blasts after they failed to get close to Modi at previous rallies in New Delhi, Chhatisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. Manoj Kumar Singh, public prosecutor of the NIA court, said the final hearing of the case started in June 2018. The arguments of prosecution witnesses and the accused have been concluded in the special NIA court.

It was not necessary to have different income scales for different cities, states and regions as economic conditions keep changing with time, it told the SC. A broad criterion applicable to the entire country should be taken as the basis for providing reservation for economically weaker sections, the Centre said in an affidavit.The affidavit was filed in response to a bunch of petitions filed by some doctors who have opposed quotas of 27% for other backward classes (OBCs) and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS) in the all-India quota seats for postgraduate medical and dental courses from this academic session. The response came ahead of the hearing on Thursday.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna had last week sought to know what study was done to arrive at an income threshold of ₹8 lakh to identify the poor uniformly across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-precision-to-determine-income-cutoff-for-quota-101635301629002.html

27-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan's bail plea hearing to continue in Bombay high court today||The Bombay high court will on Wednesday resume hearing of the bail plea of Aryan Khan in connection with seizure of drugs on a cruise ship. The hearing will resume at 2.30pm today.During the hearing on Khan's bail plea on Tuesday - his third after being arrested on October 3 - the 23-year-old's lawyers told the high court that Aryan should be given bail because no drugs were recovered from him. They also said that WhatsApp conversations used by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) were not related to the cruise where Aryan Khan was arrested from three weeks ago.Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi was part of the high-powered legal team which sought bail for actor Shah Rukh Khan's son.Aryan Khan is currently lodged in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail for alleged consumption and conspiracy under the stringent Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Rohatgi, representing Aryan, argued that his client was invited to the cruise as a special guest and there was no recovery of drugs from him, and no medical examination was conducted to show he consumed drugs. "No recovery, no consumption, I submit I am wrongly arrested," he stressed.Rohatgi also said in his arguments that Aryan Khan was a "young man" who should be sent to rehab rather than jail."Law provides that for small quantities, the maximum punishment is one year of imprisonment. For consumption, there is rehabilitation as per law," Rohatgi argued on behalf of Aryan Khan.He further said that six grams of charas was recovered from accused number 2 (Arbaz Merchant) and Aryan had no relation with him except for arriving with him there.Aryan Khan's bail plea was rejected by the special court on October 20 in the case following which his judicial custody in the case got extended till October 30. Khan approached the Bombay high court for an urgent bail hearing.He was arrested by the NCB on October 3, a day after the agency raided the cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai. A total of 20 people, including two Nigerian nationals, have been arrested so far in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-hearing-to-continue-in-bombay-high-court-today-101635296911519.html
27-10-2021||India||Drugs case: NCB to probe Prabhakar Sail today on allegations of corruption||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) will on Wednesday probe Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the drugs-on-cruise case, on allegations of corruption levelled by him against NCB witness Kiran Gosavi and Sameer Wankhede, the zonal officer in charge of the case. "Mumbai NCB has summoned Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the drugs on cruise case, for questioning tomorrow. He will be questioned by NCB team reaching Mumbai from Delhi tomorrow, in connection with his allegations of corruption," the NCB said on Tuesday.Sail is the bodyguard of Gosavi. He has alleged that Gosavi took ₹50 lakh from an individual after the raid at the cruise ship. He said, "I worked as a bodyguard of Kiran Gosavi. I assisted him during the Mumbai cruise drugs case." However, the NCB named Sail as a "hostile witness" in its affidavit in the court.Sail on Tuesday said that he stood by his allegation of extortion demand against Wankhede and others, and nobody had tutored him. Wankhede has already denied the allegation. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sail showed some chats on mobile phone where Gosavi purportedly asked him to collect the extortion money from Haji Ali. "I have narrated everything chronologically and nothing is made-up. Nobody is asking me to speak about this issue," Sail said.On October 18, a case was registered against Gosavi, the man who was seen accosting Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan at the NCB office in connection with the drugs-on-cruise case.A team of the NCB busted an alleged drugs party on the Cordelia Cruise ship which was on its way to Goa at mid-sea on October 2. A total of 20 people, including Aryan Khan, have been arrested so far in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-ncb-to-probe-prabhakar-sail-today-on-allegations-of-corruption-101635294309691.html

He will also discuss with the health ministers about PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission and the delay in administering second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines.The Centre on Tuesday urged the states and union territories to focus on beneficiaries who are waiting for their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine after their interval period gets over.

27-10-2021||India||Bombay HC to hear plea challenging Tarun Tejpal's acquittal in rape case||The Goa bench of the Bombay high court will on Wednesday virtually hear the state government's appeal against the acquittal of journalist Tarun Tejpal in a 2013 sexual assault case. The matter was earlier adjourned by the high court on September 20, when it said that a facility for virtual hearing will be set up by October 27, when the matter is to be heard. The development comes as Tejpal opposed the Goa government's plea challenging his acquittal in the case, and also requested an ‘in-camera’ hearing to keep the court proceedings private.Also Read | ‘No template of apt behaviour after assault’: Experts on Tarun Tejpal verdictTejpal, the former editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine, was in 2013 accused of sexually assaulting a female colleague at an event. On May 21 earlier this year, a sessions court presided over by Justice Kshama Joshi acquitted him of all charges. The Goa government, however, filed an appeal against the acquittal in the high court.Last month, Tejpal made a submission before the Bombay high court, seeking ‘in-camera’ proceedings of the Goa government's petition challenging his acquittal in the case, and sought its dismissal while raising preliminary objections on its maintainability. However, Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, representing the Goa government, opposed Tejpal's requests to keep the proceedings private, saying the “country has the right to know how the institution dealt with the girl (victim).”Mehta will be participating in the court proceedings from Delhi today, owing to the virtual nature of the hearing. The matter was taken up physically at the court for the first time on August 31, in the wake of the Goa government relaxing several coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related curbs. Thereafter, a request was pending before the chief justice for a hybrid (physical plus virtual) hearing into the matter, which was eventually granted.Also Read | Tejpal’s acquittal left ‘impression on victims of sexual violence’: Goa govtA former colleague of Tejpal had accused him of sexually assaulting her inside the lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in November 2013, where the both of them were attending an event. The matter received intense public attention and media scrutiny, especially owing to the fact that Tejpal and his magazine had previously been active in highlighting the issue of sexual violence in India through investigative journalism and sting operations. Tejpal later admitted “misconduct” and stepped down as the editor of the Tehelka magazine for six months. However, a Goa trial court acquitted him of all charges earlier this year, noting substantial investigative bias and lacunae by the investigating officer in the case, including the destruction of key evidence that would “conclusively corroborate the defense of the accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-plea-challenging-tarun-tejpal-s-acquittal-in-rape-case-101635291447069.html

Article 289 in the draft constitution pertained to the formation of a commission that would be in charge of conducting free and fair elections in the country. To achieve this, the chief of the commission or the Election Commissioner would not report to the executive, and would also hold overview of the elections in the various provinces, a provision that Bhimrao Ambedkar, the chairman of the drafting committee, had argued for the day before.

27-10-2021||India||Analysis on for use of Covaxin in kids: Govt||The national drugs regulator continues to analyse Covaxin data before granting approval for emergency use in children, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Tuesday, as questions remain over why the clearance hasn’t come even though the subject expert committee of the central drugs standards control organisation recommended its use in children two weeks ago.“This is a sensitive matter as it deals with children; therefore, the government has been clear, and taken a stand, from the start to not interfere in the decision-making on this technical topic. Let technical experts handle it. However, according to the information that I have, the technical committee has granted its approval on the matter, and the data is being further analysed. Decision on the vaccine’s use in children will be based on the outcome of that analysis. The analysis is not only based on local data but also on what’s the global trend as it deals with children,” said Mandaviya.This is the first time the drugs controller general of India (DCGI), VG Somani, has taken this long to grant an approval following the SEC’s decision. The emergency use authorisation in all other six Covid vaccines that are approved for use in India, was granted in a day or two.A senior official familiar with the development earlier said about the delay, “We will have to be extremely careful when talking about Covid-19 vaccination in children as even the developed countries that have begun vaccinating their children, are treading cautiously. The whole world is watching and we cannot afford to slip.”On October 12, the expert group looking into vaccine approvals gave its clearance for the use of Covaxin in the 2-18 age group, raising the possibility that children could soon begin to receive doses since Bharat Biotech’s shot is already being administered in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/analysis-on-for-use-of-covaxin-in-kids-govt-101635284841730.html
27-10-2021||India||NCB decided not to act, Sameer Wankhede went ahead||Narcotics Control Bureau’s Operations Unit, based mostly in the anti-drugs enforcement agency’s HQ in Delhi was aware of the party planned on the Cordelia cruise ship on the night of October 2, but decided not to act on it because there was no big players involved and the quantity of drugs on board was likely to be insignificant, people familiar with the matter said.Sameer Wankhede , who is Zonal Director of NCB’s Mumbai unit and also had information about the party, went ahead with the raid with his team and independent witnesses, said an official at NCB, who didn’t want to be named. A second official, who too asked not to be named, said there was nothing untoward in Wankhede’s action because a zonal director in NCB has complete freedom to conduct operations independently on the basis of verifiable information.HT could not verify whether file was moved in the headquarters in connection with the tip-off on the rave.Director General of NCB S N Pradhan didn’t respond to text messages and repeated calls by HT.Wankhede said he was “not aware of such thing” in response to a specific query on the Operations Unit having information about the rave but deciding it wasn’t worth their time.The Operations Unit has pan-India jurisdiction, while a zonal office can only carry out operations in areas under its control – Maharashtra and Goa in Mumbai Zone’s case.With NCB now initiating a vigilance inquiry into the matter, chances are that the agency will look into Wankhede’s informer network and the kind of people whose assistance the zonal director seems to have taken, including a private detective KP Gosavi whose role has come under scrutiny, and who is currently on the run.The Mumbai team has alleged the drug bust involving 23-year old Aryan Khan, actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son has “international links”.Thus far, 20 have been arrested in this case, including Delhi based event management professionals, Nigerian nationals and Mumbai based drug peddlers, but only 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 21 grams of Charas, 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy) and ₹1.33 lakh of cash has been recovered by NCB Mumbai from the cruise ship and subsequent raids. On this aspect, the Operations Unit’s information does seem to have been accurate.On Tuesday, Wankhede met senior officials of NCB at the agency’s headquarters at R K Puram, Delhi. He reached Delhi late on Monday and his visit here comes in the backdrop of the NCB ordering a vigilance inquiry into the allegations made by a witness, Prabhakar Sail , who claimed Gosavi and Wankhede were part of an attempt to secure a ₹25 crore payoff to let Khan go.The federal agency’s deputy director general (DDG) of northern region , Gyaneshwar Singh, who is now heading the vigilance inquiry in the matter, told mediapersons outside NCB office he is yet to call anyone for the probe.“When it is required, I will call him (Wankhede),” Singh, an IPS officer, said. Singh is supposed to travel to Mumbai with a team for the inquiry.Wankhede claimed on his arrival in Delhi on Monday that he was not summoned by HQ because of the case but was here for some work, adding that he has been fair in the case. Interestingly, his wife and sister held a press conference in Mumbai to clear his name, even as Mumbai police said they were looking into all the allegations against Wankhede.The NCB is yet to clarify if Wankhede will continue to supervise the investigation in the Aryan Khan Case while the vigilance inquiry is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-decided-not-to-act-sameer-wankhede-went-ahead-101635280407731.html
27-10-2021||India||Goa Oppn demands CM Sawant’s resignation, inquiry into Satya Pal Malik’s charges||PANAJI: Opposition parties in Goa on Tuesday escalated the attacks on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over former Goa governor Satya Pal Malik’s comments about corruption in the Pramod Sawant government.On Tuesday, a delegation of the Trinamool Congress and the Goa Forward Party led separate delegations to Goa governor PS Pillai urging him to dismiss Sawant in the wake of his predecessor’s allegations against him.The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held separate protests at the Azad maidan to demand the removal of the chief minister, who they said, has no right to continue in office. “The continuation of Pramod Sawant as the chief minister of Goa has become absolutely untenable, and the continued existence of his government, an impropriety and a mockery of all democratic, ethical and moral principles,” Goa Forward chief Vijai Sardesai said. “We see this as a befitting case to approach the high court for registering an FIR against the government, with a charge sheet to be filed within 90 days of FIR. Moving expeditiously in such matters of corruption will ensure that the people retain their faith in the Constitution of India,” he said.Sardesai has also demanded that the central government order an inquiry under a retired Supreme Court judge.Similarly, the Trinamool Congress delegation including Lok Sabha MP Saugata Roy, former union minister Babul Supriyo, TMC vice-president Luizinho Faleiro too called on the Governor to demand Sawant’s removal from office.“The BJP government must release a white paper on the purchases and expenditure made by the government during the Covid-19 pandemic. These are serious allegations and cannot be taken lightly,” Faleiro said. The party also submitted a memorandum to the Governor. The Congress’ Gaurav Vallabh, who is in the state, demanded that a high-level inquiry be conducted to probe the allegations.“We demand that the Prime Minister immediately dismiss the CM and entire council of ministers of Goa government who are directly/indirectly involved in such massive corruption and that too in the middle of Pandemic?” Vallabh said. The Congress also demanded the setting up of a “time-bound investigation under the supervision of a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court to find out what all other areas of Governance Goa Government are involved in corrupt practices.”“The PM should come out and answer why no action was initiated against the Goa CM when the governor informed him about the rampant corruption by the Goa government?” he said. Members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were arrested after they attempted to march towards the chief minister’s official residence to register their protest. In an interview with India Today TV broadcast on Monday, Satya PalMalik who spent a little under a year as Goa governor between October 2019 and August 2020 before being shunted out to Meghalaya, pulled up Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant for his handling of the lockdown, that happened when Malik was the Governor as well as Sawant’s “unnecessary” plans to build a new Raj Bhavan in Goa. “I am a Lohia-ite. I get very angry when it comes to corruption. I do not take it kindly. On the day when the lockdown was announced, the government said that even the stores selling basic essentials would not be allowed to open but said they would sell door to door. Which was impossible, but they allowed one company to sell basic essentials door to door which had given money to the Goa Government, when people from Congress told me about it, I informed PM Modi ji ,” Malik said.“There was corruption in the Goa government in handling everything… because of that I was sent away from there,” he also said.Malik who was the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir prior to the revocation of Article 370 and bifurcating the state into two union territories was posted to Goa in November 2019. His run-ins with chief minister Pramod Sawant, however, were followed by his transfer to Meghalaya.The ruling BJP accused the Meghalaya governor of crossing the line in violation of “ethics and propriety”. Goa BJP spokesperson Damodar “Damu” Naik said Malik should step down from his constitutional post if he wants to criticise “his own government”.“It is completely wrong for the governor to speak this way. There is ethics and propriety. He should behave within the limits of ethics and propriety. Did he act on it (corruption charge) when he was the governor? To speak about it now and to speak to the media while still being a governor is completely wrong and unconstitutional. He should have sent a report to the Union home ministry back then and then the senior leaders would have taken it forward,” Naik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-oppn-demands-cm-sawant-s-resignation-inquiry-into-satya-pal-malik-s-charges-101635277456629.html
27-10-2021||India||Supreme Court to peruse 2002 Gujarat riots’ SIT closure report||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would like to peruse the closure report of the special investigation team (SIT) giving clean chit to 64 people in the 2002 Gujarat riots case, including then chief minister Narendra Modi, and the justification given by the magisterial court while accepting it.Zakia Ehsan Jafri, wife of late Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, on Tuesday told the SC that her plea to probe the larger conspiracy behind the riots was not a political issue as she did not intend to name any individual but to address the administrative lapses. “This is not a political issue. I do not want any person to be named, any person to be invited. I am only on the administrative failure of the state government...,” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Zakia, told the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar. Zakia moved the apex court after the Gujarat high court on October 5, 2017, dismissed her petition challenging the findings by the special investigation team (SIT), alleging a larger conspiracy behind the entire riots that led to her husband’s death.As notice is yet to be issued in the matter, which is pending before the Supreme Court since 2018, Sibal said he wanted the SIT to probe on Zakia’s complaint submitted to the additional director general of police in June 2006 and explore whether there was a larger conspiracy behind the riots.The SIT had found no prosecutable evidence against Modi, other members in the state government, bureaucracy and police. For this purpose, the court will examine the closure report of SIT on Wednesday as the arguments remained inconclusive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-peruse-2002-gujarat-riots-sit-closure-report-101635275800627.html
27-10-2021||India||Tamil Nadu governor seeks details about welfare scheme, stirs row||A month after taking over as the Tamil Nadu governor, R N Ravi has sought details on the functioning of various departments and the ongoing welfare schemes, a move that erupted into a political row with questions being raised if this is an overreach by the office of the governor. The matter came to light after chief secretary V Irai Anbu’s letter to heads of government departments asking them to prepare presentations for the governor. “The Honorable Governor of Tamil Nadu wishes to know about the functioning of certain departments in the State and its ongoing welfare schemes of both the State as well as the Union Government,” the chief secretary said in his letter dated October 18, which began circulating this week. The chief secretary requested them to apprise the governor about their departments. “Power-point presentation may also be prepared for the above said purpose. The power point prepared is to be discussed before the presentation,” he said in the letter, adding that a date will be informed to them soon. The ruling DMK’s principal ally, the Congress, criticised the governor’s move. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief K S Alagiri in a statement said the governor is overstepping his powers. “The Governor can only act on the advice of the Cabinet. He has no right to oversee or interfere with the plans and departments of the Government of Tamil Nadu,” Alagiri said, adding that the move raises doubts if the new governor is acting on behalf of the BJP in the state. “I warn that the BJP which has already been rejected by the people of Tamil Nadu will be further affected by the actions of the Governor. He will face consequences if he goes beyond his limits without complying with the Constitution.” Reacting to Alagiri’s statements, BJP spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy asking why the Congress was shocked over the governor’s move. “Are they acting out of fear that they neither have plans nor activities going on?” Thirupathy asked. As the issue turned into a controversy, chief secretary Anbu released a statement on Tuesday evening, urging that the issue be not politicised. “It is customary for a newly-appointed Governor to learn about the schemes and development projects that are implemented in the state,” Anbu’s statement read. “It is unnecessary to politicise this issue. Those who are aware of the administrative process should be aware of this procedure.” Chairman of the State Minorities Commission and Congress leader Peter Alphonse also objected to the governor’s seeking a status report, but said chief minister M K Stalin will be unfazed by the move. “This chief minister will respect the powers of a Governor but at the same time if the Central government and the Governor go beyond their vested powers, he will not cow down like (the former chief minister Edappadi) Palaniswami,” Alphonse said. During the previous AIADMK government, Stalin who was then in the opposition had criticised then governor Banwarilal Purohit over his review meetings with government officials in various districts in 2017. He had called it an intrusion in the state government’s domain and the DMK had also alleged that the BJP-led union government was trying to rule by proxy in Tamil Nadu. Purohit had toured various districts to meet officials and conducted review meetings. In October 2017, Purohit was appointed as the Governor of Tamil Nadu when the state was reeling under a political crisis following J Jayalalithaa’s death in office as chief minister in December 2016. In September, Ravi was shifted from his post as the governor of Nagaland and replaced Purohit in Tamil Nadu who was appointed as the Punjab governor. After being sworn in last month, Ravi had said that he would function within the parameters of the Constitution when asked by reporters if he too would tour the state like his predecessor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-governor-seeks-details-about-welfare-scheme-stirs-row-101635275777920.html
27-10-2021||India||Tamil Nadu CM Stalin urges experts to help state overcome Covid pandemic impact||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has sought suggestions from his Economic Advisory Council, which includes global experts Esther Duflo, Raghuram Rajan, Aravind Subramanian and Jean Dreaze on the issues of debt, education, social justice and economic recovery, following the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are implementing your recommendations effectively, and we want to know more from you. My foremost worry is about how we can strategise to bounce back from the impact of Covid-19,” Stalin is heard saying during the meeting from a video clip released by the government on Tuesday. “I’m also expecting to know about the specific departments that Tamil Nadu should focus on.” He added that he wants to utilise the state’s resources to help more youngsters with job opportunities. He reiterated that he wants to reduce the debt burden of the state and sought advice on the health of the state’s economy. Stalin held the second meeting with the council on Monday virtually after they met for the first time in July. Following the first meeting, Stalin said that the government followed their recommendations, and the state launched a healthcare scheme called ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ (healthcare in search of people), which will provide testing, diagnosis and medication for Covid-19 to people in their homes. Stalin had also announced a scheme recently named ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ (education at your home) to help students of class 1 to 8 whose education was impacted by Covid-19. “In the state budget of 2021-22, we also increased pension for senior citizens based on your recommendations in the previous meeting,” Stalin told the council. He added that Tamil Nadu has made progress from three months ago in the status of its vaccination, having inoculated 72% of the adult population with at least one dose. The chief minister also spoke about the need to reduce debt and accelerate growth in the state. The virtual meeting was attended by all five members – Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian, economist Jean Dreze, and former Union finance secretary S Narayan – of the committee constituted in June by finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan to advise Stalin on economic and social issues after the DMK formed the government in May. According to a statement from the government, Dreze had suggested for the state to come out with a Social Protection Scheme by integrating a few schemes. “Rajan suggested that the state needs to enhance the quality of higher education. He also stressed that the government should also be careful about debts,” a press release from the government read. Subramanian spoke on the need to implement Quasi Universal Basic Income, and Stalin said that he was keen to know how it can be specifically implemented for Tamil Nadu. Narayan spoke about the reforms needed in the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Besides policy on economic and social aspects, the committee is providing the chief minister on human development-related issues that ensure social justice, equal opportunities for women and the well-being of underprivileged sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-urges-experts-to-help-state-overcome-covid-pandemic-impact-101635275776633.html
27-10-2021||India||Minor held for attempt to rape in Kerala: Police||A 15-year-old boy was arrested on Tuesday, a day after he attempted to rape a 21-year-old college student at Kondotty in Kerala’s Malappuram district, police said. Malappuram superintendent of police Sujith Das said the stalker was arrested after checking CCTV visuals of some houses in the area and recording the statement of the victim. “The boy has no criminal record and the victim also said he had not troubled her earlier. But his parents said he was addicted to watching horror films and adult videos,” Das told reporters. The SP said the girl escaped from the boy’s attempts after fiercely resisting his advances. The boy also received minor injuries and when his parents asked him about this, he said he was chased by a stray dog and fell in a ditch. “However when the police reached his home and questioned him, the boy confessed that he received injuries while assaulting the 21-year-old woman. In a hurry to escape from the spot, he left his slippers at the crime site and later his parents identified them,” Das said. According to the SP, the boy had followed the woman for some distance before attacking her close to a secluded banana plantation area. The accused had hit her on the head with a stone, tied her arms and pressed down on her neck to subdue her but the victim fought back and saved her life, Das said, adding the boy was a district-level judo champion. After escaping from the boy, the woman managed to reach a nearby house. The woman, in whose house the woman took refuge, told reporters that her hands were tied and she had injuries on her face and head, and bled profusely. The woman was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. “She fought back valiantly and escaped. We have already seized the boy’s mobile phone and other gadgets,” the SP said, adding that the boy will be sent to a juvenile home after investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minor-held-for-attempt-to-rape-in-keralapolice-101635275716539.html
27-10-2021||India||Latvian woman moves Kerala HC to speed up trial in rape, murder of sister||Three years after the rape and murder of a Latvian woman in Kovalam, the victim’s sister returned to Kerala on Tuesday and has approached the high court to seek an order to speed up trial at the chief judicial magistrate court here. The sister, who also travelled with the 33-year-old victim in 2018, filed a petition with the high court on October 18 through her lawyer. The high court is likely to take up the matter on November 5, according to an official. The sister said she had sent many emails to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office and state police chief Loknath Behra requesting intervention but to no avail. “I want justice for my sister. But things are moving at a snail’s pace. Many assurances were given to me earlier, but all fell flat,” she said, adding that she is expecting a favourable decision from the high court. The two sisters came to Kerala for an Ayurveda treatment in 2018, during which the elder sister went missing on March 14. The victim’s decomposed body was found from an isolated spot near Kovalam beach on April 21 and was later identified by the sister by her dress. Two weeks later, the police arrested two persons, an unauthorised tourist guide identified as P Udayan and one Umesh, a drug peddler, in connection with the rape and murder case. The police registered a case against the accused persons under 302 (murder) and 375 (rape) sections of the Indian Penal Code. They were later granted bail.According to the police, Udayan, fluent in many foreign languages, first spotted the victim sitting alone at the beach. He befriended her and promised to get her some drugs, after which he took her to a deserted spot in a fibre boat. There, Umesh joined him, the police said. The accused then raped her, and after she threatened to report the incident, strangled her to death. They later tied the body to a tree to make it look like a suicide, the police added. “It is a fact that the trial is yet to start in the case. After pandemic, physical trials are not happening, and it delayed many cases,” said an official of the district court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/latvian-woman-moves-kerala-hc-to-speed-up-trial-in-rape-murder-of-sister-101635275659142.html
27-10-2021||India||DVAC questions ex-AIADMK minister for 2nd day in graft case||Former AIADMK transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar on Tuesday appeared for the second round of questioning before the officials of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) in a disproportionate assets case. He was raided by officials in July after they had filed a case against him during his tenure between 2015 and 2021.A case was registered against Vijayabhaskar, his wife Vijayalakshmi and his brother Sekar under Section 13(2) r/w 13(1)(b) and 12 r/w 13(2) r/w 13(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 in July. On July 22, more than 20 places linked to Vijayabhaskar in his native Karur district and his Chennai residence were searched by the officials. The officials had seized ₹2,556,000 of unaccounted cash, sale deed documents, documents of investments made in insurance policies and documents related to transactions in the business firms, in which Vijayabhaskar is a partner and other incriminating documents. “Today, the former minister was enquired till 1.30 pm. After that, he requested that he be allowed to attend to a matter related to the writ petition filed by him in the honourable High Court of Madras related to the panchayat vice president elections in Karur and further requested to continue the inquiry after Deepavali,” said a senior DVAC officer not wishing to be named. The investigating officer questioned him for six hours on Monday. “Since this is the first time he is coming in, there aren’t too many details we gathered, but we will continue further questioning,” the official said. “He had also submitted a letter that he may be let go after six hours of questioning.” When DVAC had issued summons earlier, the former minister had sought time until local body elections were complete to appear before officials. Since the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) formed the government in Tamil Nadu in May, the crackdown on Vijayabhaskar was seen as the ruling party’s first strike against the opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Since then, three other powerful AIADMK leaders were searched on charges of corruption – former municipal administration minister S P Velumani, former health minister C Vijayabhaskar and former commercial taxes minister KC Veeramani – all of them are known to be close to former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami. On Friday, the second round of raid was conducted in four places linked to former health minister Vijayabhaskar and at 26 locations linked to R Elangovan, the chairman of the Tamil Nadu State Apex Cooperative Bank, who is also said to be an aide of Palaniswami as they both hail from Salem. One of the DMK’s election promises is to establish a special court to try graft charges against AIADMK ministers from the previous regime. When the DMK was in the opposition, they had levelled corruption charges against top cabinet ministers, including Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam to the then governor Banwarilal Purohit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dvacquestions-ex-aiadmk-minister-for-2nd-day-in-graft-case-101635275657869.html
27-10-2021||India||Amid Mullaperiyar row, Kerala governor calls for building new dam||A day after the Supreme Court directed Kerala and Tamil Nadu to discuss the water level in Mullaperiyar dam cordially and take a decision to cap it, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Tuesday said it’s time to decommission the 125-year-old structure and build a new one.Talking to reporters, Khan said Mullaperiyar is an old dam and shared the concern of the people living downstream. “It is a fact, it is an old dam and efforts should be made to build a new one. Let the court deal with issues between two states over this and arrive at an amicable solution,” he said here, adding that upcoming talks between two states will break the ice.One of the oldest contentions between the two neighbouring states, the dam issue turned up again after a resident of Idukki, Joes Joseph approached the apex court with a plea that water level should not go above 139 feet because of heavy rains in the area, quoting the 2018 Supreme Court order when the state faced a similar situation. Tamil Nadu opposed it vehemently, saying the court had fixed the maximum water level at 142 feet in 2014, and there is no emergency to lower it. The Kerala government has been pressing for a new dam for many years, citing frequent tremors and changing rain patterns in the Idukki district where the old dam is situated, but Tamil Nadu opposes it fearing the loss of control over it. After the 2014 verdict, Tamil Nadu carried out repairs and retrofitted, but Kerala maintained that these measures were not enough to check the dam’s age and durability.During the recent floods and landslides in Kerala, many took to social media demanding a new dam because of recurring floods in the catchment and downstream areas of the dam. Some even termed it a “water bomb.” Actor Prithviraj Sukumaran also joined the bandwagon. His effigies were burnt at several places in Tamil Nadu. Mullaperiyar is an emotional issue for Tamil Nadu as many agrarian districts are heavily dependent on the dam.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday dispelled any immediate threat to the dam but reiterated the state’s long-pending demand for a new dam. “On social media, some people are carrying out outright alarmist propaganda, but it is not good. This will create panic among people,” he said. Mullaperiyar dam was built under an agreement between the erstwhile royal family of Travancore and the British administration in 1886 to take water to Tamil Nadu for irrigation. Post Indian independence, the dam became part of Kerala, and since then, its main share of water flows to Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-mullaperiyar-row-kerala-governor-calls-for-building-new-dam-101635275656586.html

27-10-2021||India||Cong MP booked over remarks on Kerala mayor||Senior Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP K Muraleedharan was on Tuesday booked by police for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Thiruvananthapuram city corporation Mayor Arya Rajendran, police said.Police said a case has been registered against the Congress leader under IPC sections 354A (Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) and 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) on the basis of the complainant filed by Rajendran, a CPI(M) member, alleging that he had insulted her womanhood by making derogatory remarks against her during a protest in front of the corporation office on Monday.Addressing Congress workers during a protest seeking action against corporation officials allegedly involved in a revenue scam, Muraleedharan had said that the Mayor is looking beautiful but what comes out of her mouth was more terrible than the ‘Kodungallur Bharani songs’.The Kodungallur Bharani songs are folk songs mixed with abusive words sung at the famous Devi temple in Kodungallur in Thrissur district during the famous Meena Bharani festival there. Such songs are sung by thousands of oracles assemble at the temple as part of a ritual on the occasion. Meanwhile, Muraleedharan today expressed regret over his remarks, saying it was not meant to hurt anyone but slammed the Mayor for the alleged corruption in the Thiruvananthapuram corporation.“I regret if my remarks have caused mental distress to anyone personally. I do not hesitate to say it. I do not want any of my statements to hurt anyone personally”, the Vatakara MP said in a Facebook post.He, however, said he doesn’t see anything vulgar in saying that someone is beautiful. Muraleedharan alleged that the corporation was witnessing unprecedented corruption in the LDF rule and the Mayor could not shirk from her responsibilities. Both the CPI(M) and its youth outfit DYFI have flayed Muraleedharan for his remarks against 22-year-old Rajendran, one of the youngest Mayors in the country. She became the Mayor of Thiruvananthapuram at the age of 21 after the CPI(M)-led LDF swept the local body polls held last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-mp-booked-over-remarks-on-kerala-mayor-101635275537804.html
27-10-2021||India||No WHO approval for Covaxin yet as panel wants more details||An expected approval for Covaxin by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been delayed further after experts asked the vaccine’s maker Bharat Biotech for some clarifications, the United Nations health body said following a meeting on Tuesday.Millions of Indians and the Centre have been watching the process, which was expected to reach some sort of conclusion by the end of October. An approval will allow for a larger recognition of Covaxin by other countries to allow Indian travellers who have taken the dose to qualify for vaccine mandates. Conversely, a rejection could hurt confidence in the dose.WHO said it expects the clarifications to come in by the end of this week and it will meet again on November 3 to discuss the approval, technically known as an emergency use listing (EUL).“The Technical Advisory Group for Emergency Use Listing (TAG-EUL) is an independent advisory group that provides recommendations to WHO on whether a Covid-19 vaccine can be listed for emergency use under the EUL procedure. The TAG met today (26 October 2021) and decided that additional clarifications from the manufacturer are needed to conduct a final EUL risk-benefit assessment for global use of the vaccine,” said WHO in a written response to HT.“The TAG expects to receive these clarifications from the manufacturer by the end of this week, and aims to reconvene for the final risk-benefit assessment on Wednesday, 3 November.”The grant of EUL will also make the vaccine eligible for distribution to low and middle income countries under the COVAX facility.Earlier, during Tuesday’s media briefing, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “WHO has a system in place under which one technical committee observes the data, followed by another technical committee further analysing the data. The first committee has approved the data and the approval for Covaxin will be granted on the basis of what the second committee recommends.”On October 5, WHO announced through a series of tweets that emergency use approval for Covaxin was a week away. “We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners - before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly...,” tweeted WHO.The last set of documents WHO sought from the company was submitted on September 27. “All documents required for emergency use listing (EUL) of Covaxin have been submitted to WHO as of 9th July. The review process has now commenced with the expectation that we will receive EUL from WHO at the earliest,” Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-who-approval-for-covaxin-yet-as-panel-wants-more-details-101635275324804.html

He further said that there will have to be stern measures taken regarding this but added that there was no need to panic or raise alarm over the situation.The statements come at a time when Karnataka’s Covid-19 infections appear to have stabilised, if government data is anything to go by. But fears remain of an impending third wave of infections that looms large over the state and its population.Countries like Russia and others are currently facing a third wave of infections and Sudkahar said that there are measures being taken to tackle this effectively, if and when it does arrive in the state.The minister said that those who have taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine are less likely to feel any effect of this variant or any other variant.He added that Karnataka has set up 6-7 genome sequencing labs and this is used to detect, diagnose and tackle any variant of the virus.Karnataka accounts for over 6% of India’s total Covid-19 vaccination coverage at over 63 million doses administered till about 9 pm on Tuesday of the total 1.03 billion administered across the country.The state government claimed that it has so far covered 84% of Karnataka’s eligible population with the first dose and 42% of the second dose, Hindustan Times reported on October 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-suspected-cases-of-ay-4-2-covid-variant-karnataka-health-minister-101635275184312.html

27-10-2021||India||‘A tsunami in favour of BJP’: Bommai confident of win in Oct 30 Bypolls||Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday tried to play the emotional card as he projected himself as the chief minister from Haveri district as he continued his campaign in Hanagal constituency with just one day. Campaigning ends 48 hours prior to the polls on October 30. “I am the chief minister from your district, I am the chief minister from Haveri. I am the son of the soil always,” said Bommai during his campaign in Hangal. Bommai further said there is a tsunami in favour of the BJP which will have its effect on the party’s performance in the Hanagal Assembly bypoll on October 30.“There is a tsunami in favour of the BJP in the state and it will have an effect on Hanagal. There is massive support to the BJP in every village of Hanagal,” the chief minister said addressing the members of Bhajandri community in Hanagal town.With no evident wave or any defining indicators on which way the October 30 bypolls may go, all three major political parties --BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) --are making last ditch efforts to mobilize as much support for their respective outfits as possible during the campaigns. The BJP has sent most of its ministers and senior leaders to mobilize support while the other two parties are also campaigning vigorously in the two constituencies. The campaigns for the bypolls have intensified in Karnataka with senior party leaders making allegations and counters which at times have even gone personal. Hanagal and Sindgi bypoll constituencies fell vacant after their respective representatives died earlier this year. The bypolls act as the first test to the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state since he took over from BS Yediyurappa in July. Hanagal constituency is also in Haveri, which is the home district of the chief minister that has turned it into a prestige battle between all three major political parties. The three parties have spared no opportunity to attack each other on various platforms and issues in an election which Bommai said would become an indicator of what the state can expect in the 2023 assembly elections. All three political parties are also using the opportunity to mobilise support from the grassroots to get a better result in the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluk panchayat elections, expected to be held early next year. While the Congress and JD(S) are trying to corner the BJP government in the state by projecting the saffron outfits failure in Karnataka and in the Centre, the latter has fallen back on pointing out the development or the lack of it when the other two parties were in power. The leaders of all three parties have also been making a beeline to visit influential seers from various communities in the hope to secure their support. BJP and Congress have reached out to their respective support groups and beyond while the latter has accused the JD(S) of trying to help the saffron outfit by attempting to split the minority vote. The Congress has continued with its allegations that JD(S) fielded Muslim candidates in both constituencies to split the support base of the former. Bommai held meetings with leaders of Bhovi and Lambani community while the Congress too, with caste-specific leaders, have targeted various groups. Congress leader and legislator from Chamarajpet Zameer Ahmed Khan on Tuesday said that JD(S) continues to cozy up to the BJP. “One vote to the JD(S) is like two for the BJP,” he said. He added that Kumaraswamy has used Muslims as the sacrificial persons to grow. The legislator even alleged that Kumaraswamy had taken “suitcases”, an inferences to bribes, from the BJP to speak against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the right wing organisation, to win over the Muslim community and split Congress votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-tsunami-in-favour-of-bjp-bommai-confident-of-win-in-oct-30-bypolls-101635275179366.html
27-10-2021||India||Protest, outrage after KFC staff in Karnataka refuses to play Kannada music||Angry netizens took on to social media with hashtag #RejectKFC, after a video of an employee of the fast-food chain refusing to play Kannada music and claiming that Hindi was the national language of India went viral. In the 2 minutes and 20-second long video, a woman can be heard requesting to play Kannada music at the KFC outlet, instead of Hindi songs. The video was filmed by the woman and was posted on Twitter with a caption: “KFC has made a rule that no Kannada songs will be played in KFCs in Karnataka” In the video, a restaurant employee stated that Hindi was India’s native language and as a result, there will be no Kannada music played there. Following this, many Twitter users complained that the restaurant was disrespectful to Karnataka’s land and culture, while others said it was anti-Kannada. “Who taught you Hindi as national language can anyone say stop Kannada song in Karnataka. South Indians love their respective mother tongue, Hindi is a national language for only north Indians,” read one of the tweets which were trending. Another tweet said if a population of 55 million Koreans can be served in their language then why not 60 million population of Kannadigas in their language. In its response, a KFC spokesperson said, that the video is dated and is now being re-circulated. “KFC India has the highest respect for cultural values of all communities. As a brand with a presence across the country, it is our endeavor to ensure our consumers have the same KFC experience whenever and wherever they visit us, and hence at present, we have a common playlist that is licensed and purchased centrally, and played across restaurants nationwide,” read the statement. It further added that the food chain extends services in both English and Kannada. “…may it be at our restaurants or advertising through social, digital & print mediums. Additionally, with our programs as KFC’s India Sahyog and Kshamata we are looking at ways to give back to the community we operate in; extending support to local restaurants,” it added. Last week, in a similar instance a customer from Tamil Nadu had said that he was denied a refund by a food delivery app because he didn’t speak Hindi. Soon after, there was a major outcry on Twitter. The customer care executive was dismissed from service and was reinstated later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-outrage-after-kfc-staff-in-karnataka-refuses-to-play-kannada-music-101635275178021.html
27-10-2021||India||Karnataka struggles to bridge the digital divide among students||Even as physical classes for students above class 1 have resumed in Karnataka, however, the state government, parents, teachers and students are struggling to make up for the lost academic time for children who have been unable to attend schools for various reasons. Despite the additional hours being put in by teachers to impart daily classes to students who are not present in school, teething issues like basic access to technology have come back to haunt education that had been stalled for nearly 18 months on account of the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown.Government school teachers said that they are going above and beyond the call of duty to impart some classes or supervision to online students but with little success.HK Manjunath, a government school teacher and president of the Karnataka Rajya Prouda Shaale Saha Shikshakara Sangha said that this is depriving at least 20-30% of students.“It has been over a year since students really got some classes. So it is difficult to make up for loss in the academic year for those who attend. And even more difficult for those who cannot attend classes for various reasons,” he said.There are over 10 million students in these classes, according to the primary and secondary education department, out of which a survey carried out in July among 9.3 million children to establish their access to technology.According to the survey, just over half of this number or 585,000 lakh students have access to a smartphone or tablet that leaves nearly 3.12 million students without any access to such devices. Similarly, while around 5.1 million have access to the internet, nearly 3.8 million students don’t have any access to technology to help them cope with the academic year, rendering the exercise of online classes as a redundant practice for these children, mostly from rural and backward regions of the state.Teachers said that they are trying to use their own resources and time to reach out to these children; but kids of daily wage labourers or others from poor backgrounds may not have such facilities.People aware of the developments said that there have been attempts to bridge this gap by distributing tablets and coordinating efforts between several groups in rural areas to reach and teach students.“If you look at the numbers, on average there are around 80-90% that we are covering. And we are exploring other ways to reach out to students who still do not have access to schools,” said one person from the primary and secondary minister’s office, requesting not to be named.In Bengaluru (rural, south and north), there are 178,612 students who have been accounted for out of the total 1,992,100. Of this, only 1,387,299 have a mobile number in which they can be contacted and just 1,452,207 have access to smartphones or tablets. Only 1,305,527 students have access to the internet and at least 401,269 have no access, data from the education department shows.The government appointed technical advisory committee (TAC), in its recommendations, argued that education is the fundamental right of the child and stated that reopening physical schools would optimise learning, physical and mental health as well as for nutritional aspects of children.“Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, childlabour, child marriage, child trafficking, begging etc., making their condition worse,” according to the report, submitted to the BS Yediyurappa-led government on June 22.The mid-day meal programme has resumed, providing a life-line to many of these students but several who may have left for their villages or other parts of the state have no access to food or education.Even though the state government has begun teaching classes on television and has created over 300,000 videos, classes and other content, however, data shows that there are 865,259 students who do not have access to radio or television in their homes.Parents associations, at least in Bengaluru, have opposed the resuming of schools for children who are not yet eligible for vaccination, leaving them vulnerable to any infections especially with the third wave of Covid-19 infections looming large over the state. They have also alleged a collusion between private schools and the government to resume physical classes in order to ‘extort’ fees from parents and the pandemic-hit population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-struggles-to-bridge-the-digital-divide-among-students-101635275176699.html
27-10-2021||India||Experts to examine samples afresh as AY.4.2 worry grows||Experts spearheading the genome surveillance of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in India are analysing a set of 15-17 sequences for a second time to see if they fall under the classification of the AY.4.2 variant, days after authorities in the UK said they suspect it could be somewhat fitter (stronger) than its parent Delta variant, which in itself is one of the most dangerous versions of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya confirmed on Tuesday that experts are investigating the new variant, although he did not give more details.Variants of the coronavirus typically have several mutations. When scientists analyse their genome sequence, they add a classification based on whether the mutations are common with other samples. If too many samples begin returning the same mutations, it becomes a distinct variant.The AY.4.2 is an evolution of the Delta variant and largely has the same mutations as Delta, but with three additional ones that scientists say should be treated as a characteristic: A222V and Y145H in the Spike protein of the virus, and A2529V in a portion known as the ORF1ab.Researchers from the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) told HT that 15-17 sequences contain one of these three mutations, and they will now be further analysed to check if they contain the others as well – this could determine if they are AY.4.2 or something like it.“AY4.2 is a new classification and the PANGO software used to assign lineages to sequenced samples is still being updated. There are two mutations on the spike protein of AY.4.2 and one on ORF region; a sequence is designated as AY4.2 if it has two of the three mutations. We have detected fifteen to seventeen samples across India that have at least one of the mutations. Now, we will go back and check whether they have one of the other two,” said Dr Saumitra Das, director of National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG-Kalyani), which is one of the 28 central laboratories under INSACOG.INSACOG reports genomic surveillance of SARS CoV-2 across the country through sequencing of samples from sentinel sites and also detailed state-wise district analysis for some states under State memoranda of understanding (MoUs) including Maharashtra and Kerala.Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB)-Delhi, which is also one of the INSACOG laboratories, said, “We have seen very few AY.4.2, but again there are classification problems.”The parent sub-lineage AY.4 has become one of the main variants being isolated by the INSACOG network after the Delta variant (which is also known as B.1.617.2.According to outbreak.info’s analysis of sequences submitted from India to a global repository known as GISAID in the last 60 days, AY.4 lineage made up for 29% of the samples. The largest proportion, 52%, were of the Delta variant.According to INSACOG’s dashboard that has data up to September, AY.33 is the most sequenced variant constituting 71%. Explaining the discrepancy, Dr Agarwal said, “AY.33 is a PANGO misclassification and will break up.”Dr Das, explained, “AY.33 is the new name that PANGO has assigned to what was previously reported as AY.4; the classifications and re-classifications keep on happening. In India, Delta still continues to be the dominant variant, followed by AY 4.”The scrutiny around AY.4.2 arose after the latest technical briefing by Public Health England (PHE) upgraded the variant as being under investigation. The PHE document, dated October 22, said the key decision is based on AY.4.2 having a modestly increased growth rate and a higher secondary rate of attack – the ability to pass the infection on to someone – was higher than Delta’s (12.4% versus 11.1%).If a variant spreads faster, leads to more severe disease or causes a repeat infection after a past episode of Covid-19 or vaccination, it is classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Delta was the latest VOC of the Sars-Cov-2 – the label is added only after detailed analysis involving lab findings, clinical evaluation and epidemiological studies.In India, of the 104,441 samples sequenced so far, 40,682 are either VOCs or VUIs. Of these, 26,043 are of the Delta variant, which was first found in India and is believed to have led to the devastating wave of infections in April-May..Dr Ekta Gupta, who heads the regional INSACOG laboratory at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Delhi said, “We have not seen any AY.4.2 cases in Delhi as of now, but AY.4 has been reported for months now. These keep changing as per the re-classification, the important thing is that so far we have not seen any clinical significance of any of these variants. And, being close to Delta, they are unlikely to affect a high number of people who might already have been exposed to the Delta variant during the second wave.”Experts agreed that this might be the most crucial aspect to remember – and that none of the Delta sub-lineages have so far raised any concern.“There are no clinical implications that we have seen from any of the sub-lineages at present. The viruses will continue mutating slowly, but some increases in cases that have been reported are largely due to the human behaviour,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, former director of Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB-Hyderabad).Dr Das said, “So far no clinicians have reported any change in symptoms or such. We have to keep an eye out for change in symptoms, more hospitalisations, infections in the vaccinated, and cluster formation and link it to the variant. Right now there is no such concern, but we have to keep an eye on things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-to-examine-samples-afresh-as-ay-4-2-worry-grows-101635274881841.html
27-10-2021||India||Alarm over rising water level of Karnataka’s KRS dam||Heavy rains in the catchment area of Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS)dam near Mysuru, about 140 kms from Bengaluru, has added to apprehensions in people living around the reservoir. “As there is heavy rain in the catchment area of KRS reservoir, where level in (the) reservoir is rising to its full storage level, there is likelihood of releasing surplus water varying from 10,000 to 20,000 cusecs and this may be increasing at any moment. Hence, all the people living on both banks of the river and on the low lying area of river Cauvery are hereby cautioned to move to a safer place and take all precautionary measures for safety and security to their lives and properties,” the KRS dam authorities said in a statement on Tuesday. Vijay Kumar, the superintendent of KRS dam told Hindustan Times on Tuesday that the water level was just one foot below the maximum capacity of 124.80 feet and stands currently at around 123.8 feet. The inflows were around 16,000-17,000 cusecs. “We are watching the situation. Now we are releasing around 3,411 cusecs (per second) which may go up to 5,000-10,000 cusecs which is minor,” he said, adding that the dam could release several times more and that the rains were subsiding which was a good sign. The statements come even as several parts of Karnataka remain inundated after heavy rains since October in which at least 21 persons are said to have died. The rain-related damages include the collapsing of homes, deaths of livestock and cattle, public infrastructure and other loss of personal and government property. Between October 1-18, 14 out of the 31 districts received surplus rains while just six received deficit rains, according to the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority. At least 202 taluks or 89% of the state have received normal to excess rainfalls in this monsoon season while 25 or 11% have received a deficit, government data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarm-over-rising-water-level-of-karnataka-s-krs-dam-101635275117846.html
27-10-2021||India||Year on, little impact of anti-superstition law in Karnataka||After doctors said that her brother will not recover from a paralytic stroke, 36-year-old Rashidunisa approached a black magic practitioner in Bengaluru. The practitioner Naseema convinced her that if they don’t sacrifice a 10-year-old girl in 45 days, the man will not survive. In the days that followed Rashidunisa and her brother Mohammad Wasil, along with a minor began searching for a girl. On March 1, 2017, they zeroed in on their neighbour and cousin Mohammad Noorulla’s daughter. The three of them went to their house around 8.30 pm and kidnapped her. She was taken to a building in an isolated location in Hosahalli on the outskirts of Magadi. After performing rituals for two days they strangled the minor with a ribbon she had used to tie her hair. On March 3, on Naseema’s instructions, they packed the girl’s body in a gunny bag and threw it by the road. The trio was arrested three days later. The incident led to outrage in the Silicon Valley, with rationalists pushing for an Anti-Superstition Bill. Years later, even after the Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and Black Magic Act, the Bill was formally notified in 2020. However, despite the law coming into force, a suspected case of black magic came into fore after a two-year-old girl was found abandoned at a sugarcane field at Halyala village in Belagavi district on September 3, 2021. “During the investigation, we realized the burns were made using camphor and almond oil. Since they were commonly used in black magic and the patterns on the body suggested the same, we are investigating the same,” said one of the investigating officers in the case. Just weeks after, Karnataka police arrested a doctor on October 18 for murdering his wife by injecting a high dose of drugs in a suspected case of a ‘black magic’ ritual in Davanagere district. Despite the outrage and law, finding a black magic practitioner in Karnataka takes only a Google search. In the rural parts of the state, especially in north Karnataka contacts of these practitioners are household names. Narendra Nayak, president of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA) said that the practice of black magic in northern parts of Karnataka is decades old. “In the old regions of the Nizam’s Hyderabad (today’s Hyderabad Karnataka), the practice is called Banamathi, which is a form of black magic. Even now, there are those who follow this, and instances of human sacrifice too are reported in this practice. It was because of one such case of human sacrifice, where a child was killed, I left my job and began campaigning against such practices,” he said. Banamathi is among the practices that have been banned under the Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and Black Magic Act, but the practice continues in the state. “If you look at the numbers you find online or you get otherwise, the practitioners will claim that they are not into a black magic and they practice only non-harmful old rituals, but if you are really keen you will find people,” Nayak added. Another rationalist, who didn’t want to be named said that since former MLAs and a former chief minister were alleged to have participated in black magic rituals, some practitioners have got legitimacy and there is a confidence that there won’t be a crackdown from the police. “Political class is worried about playing with people’s believes, however heinous they could be. When the Anti-Superstition Act was introduced for the first time, it was watered down severely. Since lines between black magic and other practices are blurred due to the watering down of the act, there has been no active enforcement from the police, even as these practices are advertised in some parts of the state,” added the activist. A senior police officer admitted that a crackdown on black magic is high on the police’s priority list, however, all cases are investigated rigorously and police are acting on the information provided to them. Nayak however believes that police enforcement is not the solution to the problem. “When this new Act came into force, I said something is better than nothing. That is because, unless there is a change in people’s mindset, these practices would continue. Fear of punishment doesn’t stop crime,” he said. Meanwhile, police were unable to identify the 2-year-old who was subjected to black magic in Belagavi district on September 3. Police had circulated photographs of the child and requested people for any information about her or her family. She wasn’t able to give a statement to the police either since she was unconscious. Since no missing reports were found, police now suspect that the girl’s parents had sold her for black magic for price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-on-little-impact-of-anti-superstition-law-in-karnataka-101635275116474.html
27-10-2021||India||EWS quota: No mathematical precision to determine income ceiling, Centre tells Supreme Court||New Delhi: In matters of reservation, there cannot be mathematical precision to determine an income ceiling to identify the poor, the central government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday, justifying its decision to introduce 10% quota for people coming from families with annual income of less than ₹8 lakh.These are matters of policy in which courts need not interfere, the government said. It was not necessary to have different income scales for different cities, states and regions as economic conditions keep changing with time, it told the apex court. A broad criterion applicable to the entire country should be taken as the basis for providing reservation for economically weaker sections, the central government said in an affidavit.The affidavit was filed in response to a bunch of petitions filed by some doctors who have opposed quotas of 27% for other backward classes (OBCs) and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS) in the all-India quota seats for postgraduate medical and dental courses from this academic session. The response came ahead of the hearing on the petitions on Thursday.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna had raised queries last week on the implementation of the 10% EWS quota introduced in January 2019 by the 103rd Constitution Amendment Act. The Court sought to know what study was done to arrive at an income threshold of ₹8 lakh to identify the poor uniformly across the country. The bench asked whether per capita GDP, purchasing power, and cost of living index that varied across states was taken into account before arriving at this figure. The Centre was also asked to justify the introduction of OBC and EWS quotas that breached the 50% ceiling in reservation fixed by the Supreme Court’s 1992 decision in the Indira Sahwney case, as the all-India quota seats already provide for 22.5% reservation for Scheduled casts and Scheduled Tribes. The income ceiling was based on “the fact that this is the criteria for determining the creamy layer for OBCs,” the social justice and empowerment ministry said in its response. It relied on a 2010 report prepared by Sinho Commission that examined the determination of economic backwardness and concluded that the existing criteria for identification of the creamy layer could be extended to identify economically backward classes (EBC). The Sinho Commission report was not the sole basis to arrive at the ₹8 lakh figure, it said. The criteria for EWS reservation announced by an order on January 17, 2019, included many other exclusions, such as limitations on farm landholdings, and size of residential flats and plots.On the Court’s query whether variable income in rural and urban areas was taken into account, the Centre said: “The determination has to be made on broad probabilities and it is impossible to achieve perfection or mathematical precision.” The central government agreed that purchasing power differed from urban to rural areas, and even within cities and regions, but said that the sectors meant for EWS reservation – students in higher education institutions and those for employment – constantly migrate from rural to urban areas.“This factor of migration, especially for studies, would obviate the need for separate income criteria for rural and urban areas,” it said. “With efflux of time, economic situation of a district, region, state may keep changing…The cost of living within the state varies in different parts.” In this scenario, “the broad criteria as applicable to the country alone have to be taken into consideration.”Even the distinction between poor in metropolitan and other cities had been accounted for by identifying EWS as besides the income limit, a family should not possess over five acres of agricultural land, own a residential flat of 1000 sq. ft or more, or own a residential plot of 100 sq. yards and above for notified municipalities and 200 sq. yards for non-notified municipalities.“What cutoff criteria is to be provided is largely within the realm of government policy,” it said. “As long as the classification is based on some material, the same falls within the realm of policy and ought not to be interfered with.”The affidavit also questioned the right of the petitioners to question the EWS reservation, and said an attempt is being made by them to deprive eligible EWS candidates and to corner the seats contrary to the constitutional mandate and obligation under the 103rd Constitution Amendment.To ensure that EWS and OBC reservation does not deprive other general category candidates, the Centre said that in the last six years, the total MBBS seats have been increased by 56%, while post graduate seats were hiked by 80% to make up for the seats lost to reserved candidates. On the breach of the 50% ceiling, the Centre submitted that the Indira Sahwney judgment came in the context of reservation for socially and educationally backward classes, and not EWS.The decision of the government to introduce OBC and EWS reservation in medical and dental courses was made applicable to 50% postgraduate and 15% undergraduate all-India quota seats. The government’s announcement of July 29 had said, “This decision would benefit every year nearly 1500 OBC students in MBBS and 2500 OBC students in PG and also around 550 EWS students in MBBS and around 1000 EWS students in PG.” This decision was challenged in court by over 40 doctors aspiring to postgraduate admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ews-quota-no-mathematical-precision-to-determine-income-ceiling-centre-tells-supreme-court-101635274696605.html
27-10-2021||India||Centre planning separate cybersecurity policy||The National Security Council Secretariat, which works with the National Security Advisor in an advisory role to the Prime Minister on national security matters, is considering a stand-alone law for cybersecurity in India, and is working on a strategy document that will consider both the domestic and international implications of such a policy, people familiar with the matter said.The policy will be the first of its kind, even as provisions for cybersecurity exist under the information technology law and certain financial regulations mandated by the Reserve Bank of India. But India does not have a stand-alone law in the domain.The policy is being worked out by National Cyber Security Coordinator Lt Gen (retd) Rajesh Pant in the secretariat. “It is one of the deliverables of proposed National Cyber Security Strategy, and is required to cater for new age cyber crimes,” Pant said.The policy may have three broad pillars, the people added: national security, enabling businesses and individual security.“There is a need for cybersecurity to be a stand-alone law,” one of people cited above said on condition of anonymity. “It will be a policy document that will elevate the current position of the country to a whole new level, with a special focus on emerging technologies.”The secretariat has notified a list of trusted telecom vendors. The new policy is also likely to focus on critical infrastructure. “It will evaluate domestic as well as international needs,” the first person said. “It is likely to address India’s position on artificial intelligence, data sharing and data localisation.”India’s position on data sharing is currently covered by the personal data protection bill, which is awaiting a report by the joint parliamentary committee. It states that personal data, or critical data, has to be stored within the country, and cannot be shared with others without the explicit approval of the data fiduciary, which can be overridden by the government.“The policy is being worked on after a careful look at how other countries are approaching cybersecurity, including the US and the UK,” the first person said. “While in the US, the approach is more about economic empowerment, India needs to find a neutral ground between financial and national security considerations.”The law may also have enabling conditions for blockchain and cryptocurrency.Internet Freedom Foundation trustee Apar Gupta said: “The legislations under the IT Act are more principally inclined towards the creation of Cert-In. There is no legislative concept of technical control and oversight yet, but there are specific laws with respect to payments and settlements.” Cert-In is short for Indian Computer Emergency Response Team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-looks-at-making-cybersecurity-an-independent-law-may-include-focus-on-emerging-tech-101635274397673.html
27-10-2021||India||Govt proposes helmet, harness for kids riding pillion||Children riding pillion on two-wheelers may soon have to wear a helmet and a safety harness attached to the rider, the Union transport ministry has proposed, a significant development in a country where three-quarters of all vehicles on roads run on two wheels.The speed limit for two-wheelers with children on them will be 40km per hour, the ministry said in a draft notification made public on Tuesday for comments and suggestions.At least 75% of the 277.1 million vehicles in India are two-wheelers, according to government data (Vaahan dashboard). In Delhi alone, of the over 10 million registered vehicles, at least 7.3 million are two-wheelers.Any violation of the proposed rules will invite a fine of ₹1,000 and the driver’s license will be suspended for three months.“For children below four years, safety harness shall be used for attaching the child to the driver of the motorcycle… Safety harness is a vest to be worn by the child, which shall be adjustable, with a pair of straps attached to the vest and forming shoulder loops to be worn by the driver. This way, the upper torso of the child is securely attached to the driver,” read the draft notification.The government should also fix accountability of adults carrying children precariously on two-wheelers, said Piyush Tewari, founder and chief executive of SaveLIFE Foundation, a non-profit working to improve road safety. “Each day, more than 30 children are killed on India’s roads, many of them as riders on two-wheelers. It had become imperative to enact appropriate provisions in the law for their protection,” Tewari said. “We, therefore, welcome this move by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, and suggest that adult accountability be fixed as well so that poor behaviour by those accompanying children can be discouraged.”The proposed rules make it mandatory for the driver to ensure that a child pillion rider aged between nine months and four years wears a crash helmet, failing which right-sized bicycle helmets complying with European standards will also be acceptable.The Bureau of Indian Standards has been asked to study and specify standards for the safety harnesses and crash helmets for children, a transport official said. “Till the time BIS comes out with the Indian specifications for these items for children, the European standards are to be followed,” he said, requesting anonymity. “BIS will come out with the prescribed specifications soon.”Till the time the BIS prescribes standards, the safety harness for children should be lightweight, adjustable, waterproof and durable, the ministry proposed. It should be made of heavy nylon or multifilament nylon with high density foam, and should be able to hold a weight up to 30 kg, it said.Countries such as Portugal, Luxembourg, Austria and Czech Republic do not allow children below seven years to ride pillion. While laws in many states of the United States forbid children under one year to be transported on a bicycle, a few states allow it by using an infant sling or trailer as an optional equipment to carry infants. In the European Union, children of nine months to five years of age are allowed to ride pillion only if the child is able to sit unaided, according to a report by the World Health Organization on child development and motorcycle safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-proposes-helmet-harness-for-kids-riding-pillion-101635274278563.html
27-10-2021||India||Supreme Court verdict today on setting up panel to probe Pegasus row||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday deliver its detailed order on setting up an expert committee to inquire into the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance of Indian citizens.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, is expected to name the members of the expert committee and also lay down terms of reference regarding aspects to be gone into by the panel. The other members of the bench are justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.On September 23, the CJI announced that the SC would set up a committee on the Pegasus row while pointing out that its constitution was taking time because some experts the bench had contacted expressed personal difficulties in being part of the panel. The CJI’s statement suggested that the court had virtually rejected the Centre’s plea to let it set up an “independent committee” to look into the controversy.The court, on September 13, reserved its order in the case after the Union government said that it could not make public whether its agencies used the Israeli spyware as such disclosure would be against national interest.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said at the time that the Centre was open to having a committee of independent domain experts who could go into all aspects of the controversy and submit its report while adding that the use of a particular software “cannot be made a part of the public discourse in the larger national interest and in the interest of the security of the nation”.The SG requested the bench to allow the government to set up an expert committee. But most of the lawyers for the petitioners, including senior counsel Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Dinesh Dwivedi, Colin Gonsalves and Meenakshi Arora, urged the court to reject the government’s proposal, contending that the “wrongdoer” could not be allowed to have the liberty of choosing the forum of inquiry. The lawyers submitted that the court should set up a panel consisting of members of its choice.While reserving its order on September 13, the bench said the court would pass an interim order shortly on the constitution of an expert committee and on other ancillary issues related to an independent inquiry after considering the materials placed by the petitioners. The reiteration of its stand by the government also prompted the court to remark that the Centre was “beating around the bush”.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international consortium of media outlets and investigative journalists reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning the phone into a pocket spy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-deliver-verdict-on-setting-up-panel-to-probe-pegasus-row-101635273797787.html
27-10-2021||India||Navy commander, 2 retired officials among 5 arrested||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a commander-rank serving officer and two retired officials of the Indian Navy and two others for allegedly leaking confidential information related to an ongoing submarines project, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The federal anti-corruption agency refused to divulge any other details of the case, including the name of the serving officer arrested for the leak. However, officials who didn’t want to be named said the investigation started last month and the matter relates to the upgrade of Russian-origin Kilo class submarines in the Indian fleet.At least 19 locations in Delhi, Mumbai, Noida and Hyderabad have been raided so far in the case and several people and recovered digital evidence are being examined, they added.It is alleged that the Commander shared crucial details about the ongoing modernisation project of Kilo class submarines with the two retired officers in return for money, said an official who asked not to be named.The Anti Corruption Unit of the agency, which handles sensitive and high profile corruption cases, was tasked with unearthing details of the leak, the people added.It wasn’t immediately clear how the navy got to know about the leak.Investigation is being carried out to unearth if the information had fallen into the wrong hands, the people said.The Indian Navy said on Tuesday an investigation related to alleged information leak of administrative and commercial nature has come to light and is being investigated by the appropriate government agency.The investigation by the agency is with complete support of the Indian Navy is in progress, it added.An internal inquiry by the navy is also underway and is being carried out by a vice admiral to find out how information leaked despite security protocols and advisories, and how lacunae, if any can be fixed, the people cited in the first instance said.India operates eight Kilo class submarines, four HDW German origin submarines and three Scorpene submarines built in India under technology transfer from France (three more Scorpenes will join the fleet in the future). The navy also operates an indigenous nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arihant.India is also pursuing a project worth ₹43,000 crore for building six advanced submarines under the government’s “strategic partnership” (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet. The new submarines are part of the 30-year submarine-building programme approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security in 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-serving-navy-commander-2-retired-personnel-and-2-others-in-alleged-submarine-project-data-leak-101635273319059.html

27-10-2021||India||Crumbling hills ground report: A week later, families count the cost||A week has passed, but Surinder Singh Chauhan, 47, can still hear the screams of his children. At 3:30am, the earth began to tremble, the low thuds of boulders and dirt grew louder, then a landslide crushed one of the two rooms in his modest house near Nainital town. It was the room where his 17-year-old son, and 23-year-old daughter slept. He heard his son first, crying out in pain. By then, people had collected around his home, and when they dug through the rubble, they found him half buried in the earth, his arms extended towards them. The rain and the gushing water were incessant, and pulling him out impossible. Two hours later, Abhishek Chauhan went quiet. Until then, the desperate father had already given up on his daughter, in the belief that she had been washed away. But at 6:30 in the morning, he heard his daughter’s feeble voice. She kept asking to be pulled out, asking her parents to find a way to remove the concrete slab that was crushing her neck. They told her to be brave, that help was on its way. Four hours later, Ritika Chauhan went quiet too. In five hours, both his children were dead.A week after record rains took the lives of 77 people in two days, October 18 and 19, HT travelled to the inner reaches of Nainital district that bore the brunt of the devastation, and found families unable to come to terms with their grief, rescue teams still struggling with the magnitude of the challenge in front of them, and those that lived to tell the tale in government shelters, worried that their damaged homes will collapse any moment.Chauhan’s children are among 35 killed in rain-related incidents in Nainital in the two days when parts of the district received the most rain in the past 124 years. Nainital’s Mukteshwar weather station reported 340.8mm rainfall in 24 hours between 8.30am on October 18 and 8.30am on October 19, the highest since the weather station was set up in 1897. Between October 1 and 20, Nainital district reported 406.2mm rainfall against an average of 41.4mm, recording 881% excess rainfall in this period.Chauhan sells flowers near the Kainchi Dham shrine in Nainital district, 18km away from the district headquarters, 4,500 feet above sea level. His home is a thin long rectangle, two rooms and a kitchen, and the Kshipra river flows nearby. When the flood hit, the geography made it a prison. “There was no electricity and no signal. We couldn’t call anyone. Approach roads on both sides, from Nainital and from Almora, were blocked with landslides. All we could do was call some young people from nearby for help,” he said. His son was in school, and just a few days before her death, Ritika had found work in a private company. “She was so happy. My whole life, I have sold flowers. And now I have had to put flowers on the bodies of my children. It should have been the other way round,” said Chauhan, unable to hold back his tears.Apart from the 77 killed, five people are missing and 24 injured; and 224 houses were damaged, state government officials said on Tuesday evening. Of the dead, 35 are from Nainital district, 11 from Champawat, 10 from Uttarkashi, six from Almora, six from Bageshwar, three each from Pauri and Pithoragarh, two from Udham Singh Nagar, and one from Chamoli district.What led to the calamityNainital is already one of the most landslide-prone areas in the state. In 1880, 151 people were killed in a major landslide in Nainital’s Sher Ka Danda area and such disasters have occurred in 1867, 1880, 1893, 1898, 1924, 1989, 1998, 2018, and 2021. Experts have long maintained that a seismic fault-line runs beneath the lake, which results in stress, shearing and pulverising of the rock formations in lake area, making the whole area vulnerable to major geological disturbances such as landslides.But two other factors have contributed to the damage: the climate crisis, and unchecked development and despoliation of the hillsides. The first has increased the possibility and frequency of extreme weather events (such as the rains many districts in Uttarakhand received on October 18 and 19). The second, evident in the mushrooming of holiday homes for the wealthy from the cities, the cutting of hillsides for resorts, and the development of resorts right next to rivers and streams has increased the chances of landslides and floods.Around 35km away from the Chauhan home, in the Chopra village of Jeolikote, as night fell on October 18, Jeevan Chandra, 45, knew something was wrong. His brother, Manoj Kumar, worked at a hotel less than 4km away in Jeolikote, among the many hotels that have begun to dot the mountainside in the village. He called him repeatedly, but there was no response. He called his hotel manager, who said Manoj had left at 5:30pm. The village was worried, and at night, 30 people set off with torches. “I had a bad feeling in my gut. With our torches, we started looking for him on the approach road. There was a landslide and we kept sifting through the rubble, but to no avail. The next day, we found his bike near a stream which had torn through the road with big boulders nearly 800m from our house. My neighbours went down and found his body in the stream at 11 am on October 19,” Chandra said.Heavy damageAcross Nainital district, the sight of streams in spate, bearing heavy rocks tearing through roads or homes became common across those two days. In Ramgarh, 34km away from Nainital town, entire roads caved in under the weight of boulders. A walk-through a week later showed that entire stretches of road have vanished. At other points, water pipes jut out, and naked electricity poles and wires are bent or mangled. The new challenges make even a journey by foot arduous.Nowhere is this more evident in the 7km road to the hamlet of Sakuna, from the Ramgarh main road. No motor vehicles can now access the area, and HT reached the village, where nine people died in one home, on foot, trekking through parts of the mountainside. At the village on Saturday, there were 20 NDRF personnel, as well as others from the SDRF, conducting a search for two missing bodies.Janardhan Joshi, who lives nearby, said that at 5:30am on October 19, the only surviving labourer arrived at his home, injured and needing attention. “He said they were ten people, nine labourers and one contractor, sleeping in the room when a flood with big boulders came crashing into the house they lived in together. He was sleeping on the extreme left and somehow managed to escape.”Rajesh Kumar Singh, heading the NDRF team at the site, said that with the damaged approach roads to Sakuna, his team was only able to reach the village at 11am on September 20, using ropes and trekking equipment over multiple stretches. “When we reached, we found boulders as large as 14ft by 5ft inside the mangled house. An arm was protruding from beneath the big boulder. There were already two JCBs (earthmovers) working near the home but no other vehicles could come there. We had no cutters. So we used these JCB machines, lifted the boulders with great difficulty, and retrieved bodies from under them.”Then some locals found some welding machines and a generator provided by locals. “On October 21, we retrieved two more bodies. Big boulders, mangled concrete and fast-flowing water made search operations difficult and challenging. On October 21, we retrieved three more bodies, one downstream nearly 1.5km away from the site. Then we sent a team of seven people downstream but couldn’t find the remaining two missing people.”Rescue continuesWith the area cut off, the search and rescue operations, on their fourth day when HT visited the spot on October 23 have been aided by enterprising locals, helping with food and water. Bittu Rawat, a resident of Sakuna, has been among those helping NDRF and SDRF personnel with rice and curry from his home every day. “They are working so hard in the most difficult conditions to hunt for these bodies . I think it is my moral duty to help with what I can.”The village has had no electricity since the 18th, and the one generator provided by locals to NDRF and SDRF for rescue is also the only way for everyone to charge their phones. Lal Singh Bisht, head constable and leader of the SDRF rescue team working in the area said it has been one of the most challenging search missions the team has carried out. “With road links broken and poor mobile connectivity, locating and reaching the hamlets on steep hillsides in the first place was the biggest challenge. We are now searching in the 15km stretch of the river downstream to find the remaining two bodies. ” The NDRF team left the Sakuna area on Monday, while SDRF personnel are continuing with the search.In the aftermath of the disaster, across villages in the area, the future of residents and their homes hang in balance, quite literally. Homes are cracked or are located perilously close to sites that flooded over or where entire slopes have vanished. HT found many villagers trying to build reinforcing walls or removing the big boulders themselves, despite the danger to their own lives. With help still unable to reach them, there are few options. “All the houses that have developed cracks on steep slopes have become houses of death and are unliveable. We don’t what to do with them,” Deepak Bisht from Kainchi Dham said.In Hari Nagar, just on the outskirts of Nainital town, at least 65 families now call the local government school compound, and a neighbouring dharamshala, home. They once lived above the Baliyanala mountainside, which has since witnessed multiple landslides. Looking out towards his home in the distance, Harish Chand sits in the compound of the government school on Saturday. One classroom holds three families. There is no electricity inside, and there is just one functional toilet in the entire school. “We don’t know when our houses will disappear with the landslides. We keep checking on them from here. But we also fear going back,” he said.Dhan Singh Rawat, minister for disaster management, acknowledged that heavy rains have caused wide scale damage to roads, houses, bridges and public infrastructure in general, apart from the loss of lives. “Kumaon, especially Nanital, has witnessed the highest rainfall in last 124 years. This has wreaked havoc. Our priority right now is to provide compensation to people affected and resume road connectivity, water supply and electricity in the affected areas as soon as possible.”Compensation enhancedRawat said that the compensation amount to the affected has been increased. “A high power committee has been formed for monitoring of relief and reconstruction work by the chief minister. The compensation to families whose houses have been fully damaged has been increased from ₹95,000 in plains and ₹1,01,900 in hilly areas to ₹1.5 lakh per house. Those whose pucca houses have been damaged partially will be now provided ₹7,500 instead of ₹5,200. In the case of partially damaged Kachha houses, the compensation has been increased from ₹3,200 to ₹5,000. Patwaris have been directed to ensure survey and distribution of compensation as soon as possible.”From the home on the unstable hill, Harish Chand’s wife Shanti Devi has only brought a few utensils from the kitchen. “We can’t live like this here for too long,” she said. “Government should do something for us, before it is too late.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-week-later-families-count-the-cost-101635272715656.html
27-10-2021||India||Accused in Lakhimpur case identified, Supreme Court told||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that the accused have been identified by eyewitnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, which left eight people, including four farmers, dead on October 3.“All 16 accused have been identified,” senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana that is hearing the case registered by the top court on its own motion (suo motu) as a public interest litigation.The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, on October 20, told the UP Police to pull up its socks and record witnesses’ statements before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 as quickly as possible to dispel the impression that the state is “dragging its feet”. The court underscored that the witnesses’ statements before a magistrate will have greater evidentiary value, and thus, more sanctity during the trial.Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, who is named as an accused in the murder first information report (FIR) lodged by the farmers, was arrested on October 9, a day after the Supreme Court came down heavily on the state government for the police’s lenient handling of Mishra.The FIR named Ashish Mishra and “15-20” unknown people — at least 12 of whom were arrested over the past few weeks. They have been identified by police as Ashish Mishra, Luvkush Rana, Ashish Pandey, Ankit Das. Latif alias Kaale,Shekhar Bharti, Sumit Jaiswal,Shishu Pal, Nandan Singh Bisht,Satya Prakash Tripathi alias Satyam, Mohit Trivedi, Rinku Rana and Dharmendra. Three of the accused were killed in the violence that followed the incident.Salve, however, did not directly say if Mishra was among the accused identified by eyewitnesses. During the court proceedings, he did not take any names. The status report on the investigation is also not in the public domain and has been submitted to the court by the state government in a sealed cover envelope.Salve began his arguments on Tuesday by pointing out that statements of 30 out of 68 witnesses have been recorded before a magistrate under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and that a large volume of video evidence has been sent to the forensic science laboratories. Salve was reading out from the status report on investigation submitted confidentially to the bench.At this, the bench pointed out that there should be more eyewitnesses in the case given the fact that the incident took place when a farmers’ rally, comprising around 4,000-5000 people, was going on.“You ask your agency how many more can be added as eyewitnesses. Eyewitnesses’ evidence is more credible. It is always better to have first-hand evidence in these types of cases. We have some apprehensions...we are a little concerned about these issues,” the bench told Salve.The court added that accessibility or identification of the people in the vehicle that fatally mowed down four farmers should not be a problem when there was a gathering of at least 4,000 people. “There has to be some witness who would stand and tell what the truth is. Identification is important,” said the bench.To this, Salve replied that “all 16 accused have been identified”, and added that steps will be taken to record statements of more eyewitnesses before a magistrate.The court then asked the state government about providing security to the witnesses in the case and later directed in its order to accord proper security to them. Seeking another status report by November 8, the bench further recorded in its order that the statements of all relevant witnesses will be recorded before a magistrate “expeditiously”.At this point, senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj registered a complaint on behalf of the widow of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Shyam Sunder Nishad, who was among the three lynched allegedly by the furious crowd after the offending vehicle ran over four among the protesting farmers.Bhardwaj said that although Sundar’s widow has identified three assailants in the case, the UP Police has not bothered to register any first information report (FIR) against them while the deceased’s family is being threatened.Also, senior advocate Harshvir Pratap Sharma contended that there has been no investigation into the killing of journalist Raman Kashyap in the same incident.Responding, the bench said that it is “trying to balance everything” and asked the UP government to also file a status report on investigation regarding the FIR registered into the death of four persons, besides the farmers.Salve assured the court that the state would look into the second FIR as well and file an appropriate report.Hours later, the Uttar Pradesh Police arrested two people in connection with the deaths of two BJP workers and their driver in the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri three weeks ago. These are the first arrests made by the police in connection with a second FIR lodged in the case.The incident on October 3, which has led to a political uproar in the state that goes to the polls early next year, claimed eight lives. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same.The minister and his son, however, deny the charge that the latter was in the vehicle and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led to the driver losing control of the vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-lakhimpur-case-identified-sc-told-101635272655772.html
27-10-2021||India||75% districts in India vulnerable to climate crisis, face risk of floods: Report||A new study has found that 25 of 35 Indian states and Union territories are highly vulnerable to climate crisis-induced “hydro-met” disasters (floods and drought), with Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bihar being the most at risk.The study based on climate vulnerability mapping of 640 districts in India (according to 2011 census; as of 2021, there were 748) based on rainfall and drought data said that 80% of Indians live in these climate disaster prone districts. The study estimates that over 75% of the Indian districts, including 95% of coastal ones, are extreme event hotspots. Around 45% of these districts have undergone unsustainable landscape and infrastructure changes, a reason for increase in climate vulnerability of these districts.The study was released on Tuesday, a week before the start of a United Nations climate conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow, where developing countries such as India are expected to demand ramping up of climate finance to help them adapt to climate change.Rich countries have failed to deliver on their promise of $100 billion every year by 2020, according to a UN report released on Monday.The developed world has now shifted the deadline to meet the promise to 2023, blaming Covid-19 induced economic slowdown, according to a Reuters report quoting a meeting of finance ministers of G20 countries.“Combating the rising frequency and scale of extreme climate events is fiscally draining for developing countries such as India. At COP26, developed countries must regain trust by delivering the $100 billion promised in 2009 and commit to stepping up climate finance over the coming decade,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer of Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a New Delhi-based think tank that conducted the study.Enhanced climate finance can also support India-led global agencies such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to further mainstream climate actions and adaption, Ghosh said.The study found that Dhemaji and Nagaon in Assam, Khammam in Telangana, Gajapati in Odisha, Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, Sangli in Maharashtra, and Chennai in Tamil Nadu were among India’s most climate crisis vulnerable districts. The study also found that districts in the hill states of Uttarakhand, where 72 people had died in extreme rainfall events in mid October, and Himachal Pradesh, which has seen a 30% increase in extreme rainfall events this year till August, were more vulnerable than ever to climate crisis induced extreme rainfall events.Further, 59% and 41% of the total districts in the eastern and western states, respectively, are highly vulnerable to severe cyclones, the study said.Only 63% of districts have a District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP) and only 32% of them had updated the plans till 2019, the study found.“Our analysis suggests that India’s western and central zones are more vulnerable to drought-like conditions and their compounding impacts. The northern and north-eastern zones are more vulnerable to extreme flood events and their compounding impacts. India’s eastern and southern zones are highly vulnerable to extreme cyclonic events and their impacts and are also becoming extremely prone to cyclones, floods, and droughts combined,” said the study, titled Mapping India’s Climate Vulnerability: A District wise Assessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-districts-in-india-vulnerable-to-climate-crisis-face-risk-of-floodsreport-101635272597188.html

Two celebratory videos, allegedly of MBBS students in two medical institutions in Srinagar, also went viral across social media platforms.HT could not confirm the authenticity of the videos.The officials cited above said the FIRs under UAPA and Indian Penal Code were filed at Soura and Karan Nagar police stations in Srinagar on Monday. “Yes, an FIR under UAPA has been registered after there were purported celebrations and slogans following a cricket match. But the case is not specific to videos on social media,” said an official.“HMs (home minister’s) Mann ki Baat with Kashmiri youth started with slapping UAPA against medical students for celebrating Pakistan’s win. Instead of trying to ascertain why educated youth choose to identify with Pakistan, GOI resorting to vindictive actions. Such steps will alienate them further,” PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti tweeted. Mufti’s tweet was in reference to home minister Amit Shah’s remarks that the Centre would rather talk to Kashmir’s youth than Pakistan, as suggested by National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jkuapacases-filed-for-celebrating-pakistan-s-victory-over-india-in-icc-t20-world-cup-101635272417546.html

Their actual motto is to divide the people of the hills. You give me a plan on how to come to a permanent solution. I would help you even while Darjeeling remains a part of West Bengal.”Banerjee, who is on a four-day tour of north Bengal since October 24, held an administrative meeting in Kurseong.She asked Anit Thapa, former Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader who recently floated a new outfit; Roshan Giri, secretary of the GJM; and Gautam Deb, senior TMC leader and former minister, to come up with a plan by the first week of December. Officials and representatives from the Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA) — an autonomous body that manages Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills in north Bengal — have also been asked to join the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-promises-permanent-political-solution-for-darjeeling-without-nod-for-statehood-101635268576041.html
27-10-2021||India||Lack of clarity, cohesion in party: Sonia Gandhi||Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said there is “a lack of clarity and cohesion” among the party’s state-level leaders on policy issues , underlining the need for redoubling efforts to fight for the deprived sections of population.“To make this promise (of fighting for deprived sections) truly meaningful, we must also make our organisation more representative of this cross-section of society,” Sonia Gandhi said during an address to Congress general secretaries, secretaries, in-charges and state chiefs.She emphasised the need for discipline and unity within the party, adding that “the strengthening of the organisation must override personal ambitions”.Her comments come in the wake of a spate of defections from the party to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and also to the Trinamool Congress, and amidst internal criticism, especially by a group of senior Congress leaders, the so-called G23, that seeks changes in how the party functions, and a more democratic process of picking leaders for organisational posts.Gandhi referred to elections in five states next year and added that Congress workers and leaders were gearing up to take up these battles. “Our campaign must be founded upon concrete policies and programmes emanating from widespread discussions with all sections of society.”She said the party has to fight the “diabolical” campaign of the ruling BJP and its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) “ideologically” with “conviction and expose their lies” if it wants to win these battles. “We must do so with the people,” she addedGandhi also spoke of the need for an outreach within the party ahead of organisational elections. “The AICC (All-India Congress Committee) releases important and detailed statements almost every day on issues facing the nation... They do not percolate down to our grassroots cadres at the block and district levels. There are policy issues on which I find a lack of clarity and cohesion even among our state-level leaders.”Internal polls to elect the party’s next president are scheduled to be held between August 21 and September 30 next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-warns-of-lack-of-cohesion-on-policy-issues-at-key-congress-summit-101635235514141.html

The United Nations (UN) body has sought more clarifications and said its experts will meet again on November 3. This comes at a time when India’s independent drug regulator too has taken unusually long over a separate approval concerning the same vaccine. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) is yet to accept the Subject Expert Committee’s (SEC) recommendations that the vaccine be given to children aged 2 and above. Both decisions are significant for India: The WHO approval could determine if people who have taken the shot are covered under vaccine mandates in other countries; and the DCGI decision will determine if the country could begin vaccinating children soon.
27-10-2021||Editorials||Delhi air pollution: Heed the warnings||Rain and favourable wind might have delayed the onset of winter pollution in Delhi, but air quality forecasts for the coming days suggest that the Capital is headed towards an air emergency, this newspaper reported on Wednesday. This expected change in the air quality has been attributed to two reasons: A spike in stubble fires and Diwali (November 4). The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s forecast said the contribution of stubble smoke in Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels is expected to reach around 65% by the first week of November. The current contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM is about 40%. The delayed withdrawal of monsoon from north India and the heavy post-monsoon showers in October resulted in the slow start to the stubble burning season this year. However, this does not indicate that there will be a drop in the cumulative numbers of fires in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers carry out the practice to clear their fields quickly for the next cropping season.
