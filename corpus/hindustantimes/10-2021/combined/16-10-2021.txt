Previously, the air quality in the city was recorded in the ‘poor category’ with the AQI at 201 on October 9 following a drop in the temperatures, officials had said.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted rainfall in the city on Sunday, leading to a dip in the pollution levels. The IMD on Saturday predicted that the city is likely to witness one or two spells of rain over the next two days.The meteorological centre in Chandigarh on Saturday issued a ‘yellow’ alert for heavy rain in South and southeast Haryana” in its weather bulletin. “Heavy rain is likely to occur in Gurugram on Sunday. Some parts of the city may also witness thunderstorms, lightning and squall. A yellow alert, asking authorities to be prepared, has also been issued for the next two days,” said an official of IMD Chandigarh.Earlier this week, the IMD had said that fresh spell of light to moderate rainfall, accompanied with thunderstorm and lightning, under the influence of lower-level easterlies, is very likely at many places over the northwest India, including Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and at a few places in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi between Saturday and Monday (October 16 and 18).According to the weather bulletin by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi on Saturday, the air quality is likely to improve and remain in the ‘moderate’ category from Sunday to Monday (October 17 to 18) following the predicted rainfall, but the air quality is likely to hit the ‘poor’ category over the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-records-very-poor-air-quality-for-first-time-this-season-rain-likely-101634406066742.html

There are 40 leaders from different farmer organisations who are spearheading these farm protests and they must take responsibility for the things that happened at the dharna sthal as the people are sitting there on their call, Chautala said.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who spoke at the Apparel House later in the day, also said that the “farm leaders at the Singhu border should completely distance themselves from such elements, if they want to clear their role in such incidents”.Meanwhile, both Khattar and Chautala have expressed confidence that they will win the bypoll being held in Ellenabad being held on October 31.The Congress on Saturday, however, said that it is heading for a victory in the Ellenabad bypoll election. Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was also in the city, said that the “Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janata Party (BJP-JJP) government has done nothing except scams, and harassed farmers and general public in its two-year tenure”.“The coalition government has proved to be a failure on every front as every section of the state is troubled by this government... Today, the farmers are neither getting a proper rate for paddy nor the MSP is being given for millet. Millet with an MSP of ₹2,250 quintal is given at a rate between ₹800 and ₹1,000. Even after adding ₹600 to the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, the farmers are facing a loss of ₹600 per quintal,” Hooda said.Refuting the allegations, CM Khattar said, “The Opposition can say whatever it wants, but we are the ones who discuss real issues. In Haryana, we have done a lot of work in the past seven years. New schemes have been made for the needy, and efforts are being made to increase the income of the farmers. Plans have been made for smooth procurement of crops in the mandis. Farmers are being paid in time, and compensation is being given in case of crop damage.”Chautala on Saturday was speaking on the sidelines of an event to inaugurate the new office -- with a capacity to seat 650 officials -- of the excise and taxation department in Gurugram. He said that the new office was designed on corporate lines and it will allow the entire excise department to work under a single roof. “This facility will enable the department to serve the people and businessmen in an efficient manner,” he said, adding that the office was constructed at a cost of ₹45 crore, and has been developed as an energy efficient structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-deputy-cm-chautala-condemns-singhu-murder-101634406007238.html
16-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Fresh policy to give power connections in private colonies, says Khattar||The Haryana government will come up with a fresh policy to provide electricity connections to homebuyers in 16 private colonies in Gurugram, where the power distribution company -- Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) -- had stopped issuing power connections on July 2 this year after the developers did not build the requisite power infrastructure after repeated notices since 2013.The development came as Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday chaired the monthly grievance committee meeting at Apparel House in Gurugram Sector 44. CM Khattar also said the Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) and the department of town and country planning (DTCP) have been directed to fix a timeline for transferring 14 private colonies under the corporation for maintenance and upkeep.The state government will come up with a new policy soon to ensure that fresh power connections are being issued to consumers in 16 colonies where the DHBVN has put a ban, said CM Khattar. “On the issuance of new electricity connections, it has been decided during the meeting that a fresh policy to issue the connections will be formed soon. New connections will be issued to consumers who have already paid the development charge, and those who are yet to pay it. The issue will be resolved once the new policy is in place,” said the CM.The DHBVN had stopped issuing new and temporary electricity connections in these 16 colonies because, despite repeated notices, the developers had neither paid the dues nor set up the requisite infrastructure, said DHBVN officials.According to the information shared by the authorities, colonies where new power connections are not being issued are Sushant Lok phases 1, 2 and 3; South City 1 and 2; Palam Vihar, Malibu Towne, Ardee City, Mayfield Garden, Uppal Southend, Sun City, Vipul World, Saraswati Kunj.CM Khattar also said that consumers in these colonies will be grouped in three separate categories and the new policy, specifically designed for these issues, is on the anvil. “In case, the consumers have deposited external development charges (EDCs) to the developers, this money will be taken from the builders and electricity connections will be issued to the consumers. In case, the EDCs are yet to be paid, they can directly pay it to the government for the issuance of new electricity connections. The consumers will be given relief soon,” the CM added.For accelerating the transfer of private colonies to the MCG, the CM said, the MCG and the DTCP have been directed to conduct surveys to assess deficit infrastructure and prepare estimates and issue the same to 14 developers, whose colonies are to be transferred. “Timelines will be prepared to ensure that colony transfer takes place according to the plan. The district town planner will take all the responsibilities to complete the infrastructure,” said CM Khattar, adding that authorities have issued directions to the officials concerned to ensure that the DLF Phase 3 colony is transferred to the MCG by December 31, 2021.New cremation ground, burial facilitiesTo provide cremation and burial facilities to the residents of the new sectors in Gurugram, CM Khattar on Saturday also announced the setting up of a cremation ground for Hindus, and burial grounds for Muslims, Christians and children over 15 acres in Sector 72 A.A memorial park will also be set up in this facility to provide greenery and memorial space to the residents, CM Khattar said, adding that these facilities are missing in the new sectors, despite the rising population in the city.District sports officer absent in meet, suspendedThe CM on Saturday also issued directions to suspend the District Sports Officer of Gurugram, JG Banerjee, for being absent in the grievance committee meeting the very day, without taking any prior permission. He issued the directions after a matter related to sports came up for redressal, but Banerjee was not present in the meeting.Ease in registry of agricultural landCM Khattar also said that new modalities are being formulated to ensure that registry of sale, purchase and transfer of agricultural land is made easier by the revenue department.

At present, nearly 200 families live in the village.Yashpal Yadav, commissioner of MCF, said, “After the demolition drive was completed at Khori village earlier this year, some people were allowed to stay there as they had said they would remove the construction and demolition waste on their own. But the residents continued to live there in temporary households. We will start a demolition drive from Monday to remove their temporary houses.”On Wednesday, MCF teams had visited the area for inspection and informed the residents to vacate the area within this week.Nearly 6,600 dwelling units in Khori village have been razed by the MCF over the last few months as the illegal colony was encroaching 150 acres of the Aravalli forest land.On June 7, the Supreme Court fixed a six-week deadline to remove the 6,600 structures in the Khori Gaon colony, and directed the MCF to act, without exception, against all the unauthorised structures on the forest land.Members of Mazdoor Awaas Sangharsh Samiti (MASS), an organisation working for rehabilitation of the residents of Khori village, said that the people were staying there as proper rehabilitation had not been provided to them. Nirmal Gorana, convener of MASS, said, “We condemn the decision of the authorities. This is for the second time in months that these families will be displaced. The authorities have not started allocating flats to the displaced residents, who have applied for flats as part of the rehabilitation policy, yet. First, an alternative arrangement should be made and then only any action should be taken.”The rehabilitation policy issued by the government proposes to house the residents of Khori Gaon at the economically weaker section (EWS) flats at Bapu Nagar and Dabua Colony in Faridabad. To be eligible for this, residents need to show either a Pariwar Pehchan Patra (PPP) of an adult member of the house, an election ID card of the Badkhal constituency, or an electricity bill of their premises at Khori Gaon.

16-10-2021||Lucknow||‘No dowry’ affidavit sought from UP govt servants married after March 31, 2004||Lucknow: All government servants In Uttar Pradesh who were married after March 31, 2004, have been asked to submit an affidavit declaring that they did not receive any dowry in their marriage, according to a recent circular issued by the department of women’s welfare. The circular, issued on October 12 to all the heads of departments, commissioners and DMs among others, has asked them to mail affidavits on a given mail id by October 18. The authorities have been requested to take action against the personnel who do not file the desired affidavit. “This is probably for the first time when our department has sought no-dowry affidavit from government servants in a serious bid to get the provisions of the anti-dowry law enforced in the state,” said director, women’s welfare, Manoj Rai. Under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, all public servants across the country are mandated to furnish an affidavit at the time of joining, stating that they will not receive dowry when they get married. “Now, we have asked employees who got married after March 31, 2004 to furnish an affidavit stating that they did not receive any dowry when they were married,” he said. The UP framed Dowry Prohibition Rules ( as a follow-up to the Centre’s Act) in 1999 after which it amended rules on March 31, 2004 ,specifically providing in Rule 5 that every government servant will, during his appoint, furnish a self-attested affidavit to the appointing authority, stating that he received no dowry in his marriage. “You are, therefore, requested to necessarily obtain an affidavit from all the government servants posted in offices under you by October 18. with the affidavit stating that they received no dowry in their marriage,” the circular tells the HoDs and others, adding “Please ensure action against employees who do not give an affidavit to this effect.” People who were in the know of things also said that the department of women’s welfare was also scheduled to submit a report on compliance of ‘no-dowry’ affidavit submission and action taken for non-compliance to a Parliament legislative committee that was likely to visit the state soon. Dowry that is termed as a social evil is illegal in the country under the anti-dowry law, according to which any act of taking or giving dowry is punishable with in imprisonment up to five years and fine of ₹15,000 or the value of the dowry given, whichever is higher. The circular seeking no-dowry affidavit is said to have put many government personnel into a quandary. ,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-dowry-affidavit-sought-from-up-govt-servants-married-after-march-31-2004-101634405286634.html

16-10-2021||Lucknow||Hi-tech mechanized system helping to keep Prayagraj clean||The Prayagraj Nagar Nigam (PNN) in collaboration with a private firm has deployed state-of-the-art hi-tech machines to help clean the city better. “The hi-tech machines are being used in cleaning parks, community toilets and other open areas around the city. The cleaning is done using high pressure washing, foam cleaning, splash-free cleaning, high pressure cleaning of choked pipes and drains along with cleaning of drains using an Italian machine Dulevo, which is a patented technology,” said chief executive officer (CEO) of Lions Services Ltd Sunil Singh that has been roped in by the PNN to carry out the work. He added that the machine cleaning will not only save time, but also manpower. “Through the powerful rotary jet machine, stains in toilets and other places will be removed with ease. In addition to this, the garbage from houses will be collected separately as dry and wet waste. To implement this properly, citizens are also being made aware of the way and the importance of segregating the waste,” he added. Singh further said, “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, many projects are being run under the Smart City initiative in the state. The cleanliness drive is being run with full force by the PNN and now with the use of hi-tech machines by Lions Services Ltd, the cleanliness campaign will get a boost.”An official of PNN said already many public toilets are been cleaned using these machines and soon all the toilets of the city would be brought under the purview of mechanized cleaning. “Through this project, toilets are being extensively cleaned through well-equipped technology-based vehicles on a daily basis, due to which a radical change is being reflected in the sanitary condition of these toilets in a very short span of time. Subsequently, there is a continuous and significant increase in the number of citizens using these toilets, which is a progressive change in the direction of ending open defecation,” the official claimed. He said the competent executing agencies have been selected through a transparent tender process. “These agencies use mobile vehicles equipped with modern equipment on the basis of 15 toilets per vehicle. In addition to this, skilled and professional sanitation workers have been deputed, who carry out detailed cleaning of all the community toilets with the help of modern equipment available with the vehicles,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hitech-mechanized-system-helping-to-keep-prayagraj-clean-101634404686899.html
16-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Puja leftovers clutter Hindon banks||The banks of Hindon near GT Road in Ghaziabad on Saturday were strewn with rotten flowers and polythene bags, among other items, after the festivities of Dussehra and Durga Puja, as a number of devotees dumped the puja leftovers in the river. An HT team, which visited the site on Saturday, found that the banks of the river from GT Road to the Vasundhara underpass were stuffed with garbage. HT tried reaching out to the municipal commissioner, additional municipal commissioner and the city health officer, but none responded till late Saturday evening. However, Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board, said, “We have noted the issue and will ask the Ghaziabad municipal corporation officials to rope in cleaning staff and get the garbage cleared from the banks of the river.” When asked, police officials said that the immersion of the Durga idols was done in temporary ponds created away from the banks of the river.“However, some devotees might have dumped the puja leftovers along the banks at different times. We will keep a close watch over such persons and legal action will be taken,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).Environmentalists said that the issue has been witnessed year after year and the enforcement agencies have failed to rein in erring persons. “My colleague Krishan Pal from Baghpat filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal in 2015 and the tribunal directed that there should be no dumping along the banks of river. It also directed for a penalty of ₹20,000. Despite directions, there has been no let off in such instances and almost every year after festivals, there are dumps of garbage which can be seen along the banks,” said Vikrant Sharma, a city-based environmentalist. “The enforcement agencies have basically failed despite several orders passed by the tribunal in this context. They simply dug up artificial ponds for immersion purposes, but they fail to catch erring persons,” said Akash Vashishtha, another city-based environmentalist. The Hindon originates from Saharanpur and culminates at Momnathal in GB Nagar. According to official statistics of the UPPCB, the upstream areas of Hindon at Maheshpur in Saharanpur, Budhana and Baghpat Road in Meerut, had no presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) from January to August this year. Further downstream, the DO is found only at three sampling locations of Karhera, Mohan Nagar and Chijarsi bridge but the levels range between 0.8 to 2.78 mg/litres which is low for survival of aquatic life and standard of 5 mg/litre which is considered favourable for propagation of aquatic life. “Garbage material has organic and inorganic compounds which deteriorates the DO levels and further increases the Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These two parameters when increased, leads to impurities in water and increase pollution levels,” said Dr Chandra Vir Singh, a retired scientist from Haryana pollution board. Singh, the convener of Doaba Paryvaran Samiti, in 2014 and 2015 filed two petitions with the National Green Tribunal and raised the issue of contamination of water of river Hindon due to effluent discharge by industrial units and also about the contamination of groundwater in catchment areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-puja-leftovers-clutter-hindon-banks-101634404448448.html

While 101 rakes of coal have been dispatched from the state government company PKCL coal mines. He said that this has been possible due to the high level initiative and holistic efforts of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Agarwal said that production at thermal units is being resumed on priority and in the last eight days, about 1,700 MW power generation has been started in four units. He said that production has started in Suratgarh with a capacity of 250 MW, whereas 600 MW in Kalisindh Thermal, 195MW in Kota Thermal Power Station and 660 MW in Unit 6 at Suratgarh Power Station had started earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/amid-coal-shortage-in-india-rajasthan-ensures-zero-power-cuts-101634402247779.html
16-10-2021||Noida||A day after Dussehra, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida most polluted across country||A day after the Dussehra celebrations, pollution levels of Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida spiked to “very poor” category on Saturday, with Ghaziabad emerging as the most polluted city across the country, according to the air quality index (AQI) figures of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The AQI data also revealed that Greater Noida was the second most polluted city in the country.On Saturday, the AQI for Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida stood at 349, 312 and 330, respectively. A day earlier, the AQI of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida was under “poor” category at 235 and 241, respectively, while that of Noida was recorded at 192 (“moderate”). According to CPCB, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the sharp rise in pollution levels was a result of burning of effigies in NCR, high volumes of traffic and other external factors. They also said that it is for the first time this season that the AQI of the three cities spiked to “very poor” category. “The reason for spike can be attributed to the Dussehra celebrations on Friday and high volume of traffic on the roads. In Ghaziabad, except for the Indirapuram air monitoring station, the primary pollutant at the three other stations was PM2.5 which affected the overall AQI,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. During the morning hours, several stretches of National Highway 9 remained under hazy conditions which only improved in the afternoon. “In Noida, the three monitoring stations at sectors 1, 125 and 116 witnessed a spike in air pollution levels around 4am on Saturday, but the situation improved a bit in the afternoon. The Noida Sector 62 and Indirapuram stations are close to each other, and their primary pollutant was PM10. Some external factors like stubble burning also added to the pollution levels,” said Sharma, who is also officiating for Noida city. Bhuvan Yadav, UPPCB regional officer for Greater Noida, said that unfavourable meteorological conditions made the situation worse. “Due to low wind speed, there was less dispersal of pollutants, and the accumulation led to the spike in pollution levels. This pattern is mostly observed during winter season,” he added.Meanwhile, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) stated on Saturday that the fire counts in neighbouring states stood at 1,572. “With 1572 effective fire counts, the stubble burning contribution in Delhi’s air has suddenly increased to 14%. Fire counts are gradually increasing, and wind direction is favourable and coming from north-west direction at transport level for intrusion,” the forecast said. It further added that the AQI will remain under the “moderate” category starting Monday. The Safar also said that there is a likelihood of rainfall in the region under the influence of western disturbance. Environmentalists said that the vehicular movement during the festivities is largely responsible for spike in pollution levels. “Apart from the external factors, traffic on roads increased due to festivities and it led to spike in PM2.5 levels. Burning of effigies alone cannot be held responsible for the spike. Due to the pandemic, there were restrictions and many Ramlila committees in the city did not burn effigies. Those who did prepared small effigies and burnt them symbolically without firecrackers,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/a-day-after-dussehra-ghaziabad-and-greater-noida-most-polluted-across-country-101634402946744.html

16-10-2021||Patna||Principals’ retirement age flip-flop: Patna HC sets it right, orders all consequential benefits||In a moral victory and big relief to the college principals who were made to retire suddenly and even from retrospective effect following the 2012 amendment to the PU Act and the Bihar state universities Act, which had deleted the term ‘principal’ in the definition of ‘teacher’ and later restored it in 2017, Patna High Court has ruled that they shall be deemed to have continued on their posts till they attained the age of 65 years and shall be entitled to all consequential benefits, including pay and emoluments as well as continuity in service.“It had been submitted at the Bar that recoveries have been made from certain persons. It is directed that the same be returned forthwith. The compliance of the order should be done within 16 weeks from the date of production of a copy of this judgement before the Vice-Chancellors and Registrars concerned,” ordered the bench of Justice A Amanullah while hearing the case earlier this month.The move will immediately benefit 20 principals spread across several state universities who fought the legal battle through 15 separate petitions and have an impact on over 300 principals who were made to retire during the five years.The removal of college principals from the teaching cadre had created a furore, as the retirement age of teachers was increased to 65 years in 2010, while that of non-teaching staff was left at 62 and all the principals having attained the age of 62 between 2012 and 2017 amendments were compulsorily retired, including some from retrospective effect as they had by then either crossed the age of 62 contrary to the provisions laid down in the 2012 Act and even touched the 65-year mark.The principals were brought under the teachers’ fold, as was the situation before 2012, again through 2017 amendments, which was to be effective from prospective effect from May 15, 2017. However, several principals completed their age of retirement between 2012 and 2017 and they were not only immediately retired from service, but the government also decided to recover the additional salary paid to them. Raj Bhawan had also sought clarification from all the concerned vice-chancellors about the continuance of principals beyond the age stipulated in the Act.The HC order now means that the principals who retired between 2012 and 2017 would be deemed to have been in service till they attained the age of 65 years. “The Principal always was a ‘teacher’ l, for if the Principal would not have been a teacher from 2012 to 2017, then without there being any justification or basis either in law or by the pronouncements of the court or under the UGC regulations, the same could not have been re-introduced by the State,” the court observed.The court observed that “the 2017 Amendment Act included the term ‘principal’ expressly in the definition of ‘teacher’ also shows that without any requirement, the same was done only by way clarification or to remove any confusion/ambiguity”.The court cited the government’s flip-flop while deciding in favour of aggrieved principals. “The budget, which has been brought on record by the Magadh University for the year 2016-2017, the post of principal has been shown in the sanctioned post of teacher and the budgetary allocation for principal has been made under the head of teachers and in terms thereof, the budget was approved and released in February 2017 by the director, higher education, government of Bihar. Thus, even the State accepted that the principals would also come under the category of ‘teacher’ even after the 2012 Amendment Act. The principals also engaged classes in their colleges according to the 2010 resolution and continued even after the 2012 Amendment Act. So, their position is not disputed,” it added.A senior official of the education department, who did not want to be quoted, said that it was precisely the reason why education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary had categorically said at the Patna University foundation day function that the teachers must get their due on time, including promotions, without having to run around. “He told the VCs not to keep a backlog of promotion of teachers and issues concerning them so that they could fully devote themselves to teaching. This will also avoid litigations as ultimately it serves no purpose. Invariably, the state notifications of even UGC regulations are delayed and later department officials try to implement things from retrospective effect, causing unending litigations and loss of precious time and energy. This must stop,” he added.Bihar state constituent college principal forum Baban Singh said the court verdict had come as a big mental relief to the principals. “I was myself a university professor since 1996 and I was also treated as non-teaching staff. Many others senior to me also had to face the trauma of recovery of salary paid to them. I thank all those who stood by us,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/principals-retirement-age-flip-flop-patna-hc-sets-it-right-orders-all-consequential-benefits-101634402106466.html

According to City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar, a case has been lodged against unidentified miscreants.In another incident, a violent clash occurred at Chandhaus More under the jurisdiction of the Paliganj police station area of rural Patna late on Friday night, leaving more than ten persons injured. The incident occurred after some miscreants allegedly started misbehaving with girls and women during the Vijay Dashmi celebrations. When the families objected, the miscreants opened fire. The families of girls also opened fire on the miscreants, leading to chaos in the area, police said. Two persons identified as Pinku Kumar and Chiku Kumar received gunshot injuries in this incident. They were admitted to PMCH and are said to be out of danger. Paliganj ASP Awadhesh Dixit said police recovered two empty cartridges from the spot.

He was also known as Prabodhankar Thackeray because of his Marathi publication, Prabodhan.Thackeray took potshots at the BJP comparing it with the seven blind men who touched different parts of the elephant and claimed that the elephant resembled the part they touched. “We practise our Hinduism at home and once we leave our house, our nationalism becomes our religion,” said Thackeray. “However, if some person from other religions tries to provoke us, then we retaliate,” he added.Thackeray said that, unlike others, the Shiv Sena’s brand of Hinduism is well known. “My grandfather opposed the dogmatic practice and we have been following that till date,” he added.He said he was proud to inherit the legacy of his grandfather and his father Sena founder Bal Thackeray.Thackeray also unveiled the website of the Bal Thackeray Memorial on this occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/we-practise-our-hinduism-at-home-practise-nationalism-once-we-step-out-maharashtra-cm-101634400666608.html
16-10-2021||Other||{Drug seizures} Forensic reports integral part of challan: HC||Chandigarh Forensic reports in drugs seizure cases form the foundation of the prosecution’s arguments and if these are not there, its (the prosecution’s) case falls to ground, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said. The bench of justice Gurvinder Singh observed that no doubt the Supreme Court has held that a challan, even if not accompanied by a report of the chemical examiner or of the expert, cannot be said to be incomplete. “However, it needs to be highlighted that the said cases did not pertain to an offence under the NDPS Act. A case under the NDPS Act can only survive in case the prosecution is able to establish that the article recovered is indeed a contraband, and which can only be established on the basis of its chemical examination,” the bench said. The court was hearing a bail plea from one Vinay Kumar from Sirsa arrested in December 2020. Police claimed that Kumar, driving a tractor abruptly tried to deviate upon seeing police party. When stopped, 7,000 Tramadol Hydrochloride tablets were recovered. The challan was presented before the trial court on March 4, 2021 but without the report of chemical examiner. The period of 180 days, which is mandated for filing of challan as per provisions of NDPS Act expired on June 20, but the prosecution did not file the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report. He filed for bail on June 22 on the ground that in the absence of the report of FSL, the challan could not be said to be complete. The trial court, however, dismissed this report. The court said that in other cases say any injury or hurt or murder case under the IPC, even the ocular version coupled with some medical evidence or some other circumstantial evidence may suffice to bring home the guilt of the accused. But cannot be said to be indispensable in each and every case and even in the absence of such reports, the prosecution may well be able to establish its case. “ ..the contention of the petitioner that the report of FSL form very foundation of the case of prosecution and is an integral part of the challan cannot be brushed aside (in NDPS cases),” the bench said quashing the trial court order and allowing bail to the accused after almost nine months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drug-seizures-forensic-reports-integral-part-of-challan-hc-101634400606453.html

While Bengali Club immersed the idol in a pit on its campus adjacent to Durga mandap amid beating of “dhaak” (drum) and dance by devotees, Ramakrishna Math did so at its orchard in the Gosaiganj area.“In the wake of the pandemic and to maintain social distancing during the immersion, we decided to immerse Durga idol on our campus,” said Arun Banerjee, president, Bengali Club.In all, over 90 Durga idols were immersed in the artificial ponds dug by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) and the district administration on Friday. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation staff were present at Lakshman Mela Park, Jhule Lal Vatika and Kudia Ghat where the idols were immersed, said municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi. He thanked the Durga puja committees and individuals who turned up for immersion of the idols in an eco-friendly way. The immersion was allowed in the presence of the police.Earlier in the day, married women applied vermillion to the goddess before bidding her adieu, in a ritual called Sindoor Khela at different Durga puja mandaps.They later applied the same vermillion, praying for healthy and prolonged life of their spouses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/durga-idols-immersed-in-artificial-ponds-after-sindoor-khela-in-lucknow-101634400366428.html
16-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP only knows two things - 'jeebh chalana' and 'jeep chadhana': Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav Saturday took potshots at the BJP over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, saying the ruling party only knows 'jeebh chalana' (lip service) and 'jeep chadhana' (mowing down people).His criticism of the BJP came days after eight people were killed in violence during a farmers' protest in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri which left eight, including four farmers, dead.BJP leader and Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish has been arrested in connection with the case after he was accused of mowing down farmers with his vehicle. The minister has defended his son, claiming he is "innocent"."The truth is the BJP knows only two things -- 'jeebh chalana' (lip service) and 'jeep chadhana' (mowing down people). Crushing people and suppressing their voice is their (BJP) agenda," Yadav said while addressing party workers at the Samajwadi Party headquarters here.Ashish and others have been named in the FIR filed in this connection and the latter was arrested last week.Claiming the BJP government's tenure was "full of failures", Yadav alleged that because of "wrong policies" of the ruling party, the state lagged behind with runaway inflation and high unemployment."The entire tenure of the BJP government was full of failures. Due to the wrong policies of the BJP government, Uttar Pradesh lagged behind and there was no control on inflation, unemployment. The law and order also got worse," said a party statement, quoting Yadav."The BJP government has not done any work in public interest. The BJP is a strange party which is making tall claims without doing anything. The double engine government of the BJP has harassed every section of society and has not done anything itself but has been appearing in advertisements claiming the works of the Samajwadi Party government as its own," he said.Speaking about the 2022 assembly elections, he said it would decide the direction of national politics and would also be a testing time for democracy.Cautioning the workers, the SP chief said, "We have to be careful of the possible conspiracies of the BJP. Since the BJP is very clever, this time there should be no mistake and SP workers and leaders need to mobilise themselves up to the booth level."He said people's problems will end and the interest of farmers and youths protected only when the SP forms a government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-only-knows-two-things-jeebh-chalana-and-jeep-chadhana-akhilesh-yadav-101634398509811.html

16-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s 3rd hand transplant patient stable, family seeks financial help||Twenty-two-year-old Jagdev Singh who underwent a bilateral hand transplant procedure at the Global Hospital in Mumbai is in stable condition. The 12-hour long surgery concluded early on Saturday. Doctors said that Singh was still unconscious and that the procedure went well without any complications. In January 2020, Singh, a native of Hanumangarh, Rajasthan was working with a borewell in their farm when he came in contact with a high-tension wire. He suffered severe burn injuries and had to be shifted to a hospital in Jaipur where his upper limbs and lower limbs both had to be amputated. Singh was a second-year Bachelor of Arts student then. “He was an excellent kabaddi player,” said Singh’s brother-in-law Nirmal. “He hoped to get a government job to support his family after his education was completed,” he said. It took nearly two months for Singh to be discharged from the Jaipur hospital. Soon after, his family came across the possibility of a hand transplant through an article on the internet. Early this year, Nirmal came to the Global Hospital to inquire about the possibility. Two months ago, he brought Singh along with him and registered him on the waiting list for the transplant. “We received a call at around 5pm on Thursday about the possibility of hand donation. We did not waste any time to think and quickly started our journey,” said Nirmal. He travelled eight hours by road to reach Delhi and then took a flight for Mumbai. By Friday 8pm, Singh was in the operation theatre undergoing the procedure. “The procedure went on smoothly,” said plastic surgeon Dr Nilesh Satbhai who led the team of doctors who conducted the procedure. This was the second such procedure to be carried out at the Global Hospital after train accident victim Monika More’s bilateral hand transplant in August 2020. “This surgery was slightly different because we conducted one hand was transplanted above the elbow level and second was below the elbow. But overall, we were more prepared as we carried the experience of Monika More’s transplant with us,” said Satbhai, adding that Singh is likely to remain in the hospital for another four weeks.After that, the doctors are likely to start a gradual rehabilitation programme. According to Satbhai, the cost of the procedure is estimated to be around ₹25 lakh. In addition to this, the patient will require immunosuppressants that cost anywhere between ₹2 lakh to ₹3 lakh a year. “We are planning to sell off some property back home to manage some amount,” said Nirmal. “We are into farming. It will be difficult for us to arrange such a big amount. But we are also planning to start an online campaign to raise some funds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-3rd-hand-transplant-patient-stable-family-seeks-financial-help-101634398686721.html
16-10-2021||Mumbai||2 arrested for raping 4 women on pretext of performing rituals||Arnala Coastal police have arrested two persons claiming to be sorcerers for allegedly raping four women. According to police, a 26-year-old survivor, who is a complainant in the case, was promised ₹260 crore by the accused duo — Mathew Pandiyan and Dinesh Devrukhkar — in return for performing a “ritual”. She contacted three other women for the same and each paid ₹10,000 to the duo for the rituals in July and August 2021. “The accused then repeatedly raped four women in turns in the guise of ‘rituals’, however, none received the said amount,” said senior inspector Raju Mane. “One of the survivors then approached us and we registered a complaint under section 376(2)(n)(rape) of the Indian Penal Code and section 3(2) of the Maharashtra Aghori Act, 2013. The two accused have been arrested and are remanded in police custody till October 22,” said Mane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-arrested-for-raping-4-women-on-pretext-of-performing-rituals-101634396346571.html
16-10-2021||Mumbai||Dombivli GRP to file chargesheet in honour killing case on Monday||The Dombivli Government Railway Police will file a chargesheet on Monday in a case of honour killing that was detected in July this year. While the accused had tried to pass off the murder as a suicide, the position of the body provided the police with a crucial clue as to the truth.According to the Dombivli GRP, the chargesheet, which runs into over 1,000 pages, indicts 11 accused, out of which nine are currently in judicial custody and two are in a juvenile detention centre, as they are minors.The accused are alleged to have murdered Sahil Hashmi (19), a resident of Chhanora in Uttar Pradesh. According to the chargesheet, Sahil was in a relationship with the cousin sister of the accused, which did not go down well with her family, as Sahil came from a lower socio-economic background than hers.“The chargesheet contains a lot of technical evidence against the accused, which was crucial in nailing their involvement in the offence. Apart from this, there is also medical and forensic evidence as well as witness statements,” senior police inspector Mukesh Dhage, Dombivli GRP, said.Sahil was found on the railway tracks in an unconscious state on June 19. He was rushed to a local hospital and later shifted to Sion Hospital because of his critical condition. Sahil spent four days in a coma before breathing his last on June 23. Meanwhile, the police identified him and traced his 18-year-old girlfriend, whose identity has been withheld, and recorded her statement.The girl told the police that they were coming to Mumbai by the Varanasi Junction-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Ratnagiri Superfast Express when Sahil jumped off the train and committed suicide.“Based on the girl’s statement, we had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR). However, the position of the body gave us a reason to suspect that something was wrong. In our experience, a person who has jumped from a running train lands on his face or his side, while Sahil was found on his back,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Manoj Patil, Central Railway, said.Based on this point, the police started a deeper investigation into the history of Sahil and his girlfriend, and found out about her family’s opposition to their relationship. CCTV footage and cellular location mapping further established that the accused were on the same train as the couple on the day of Sahil’s death.“Sahil and his girlfriend had eloped from Chhanora on June 15 and boarded the train on June 18 to come to Mumbai. When her family learned about it, they registered a complaint of kidnapping with the UP Police and also informed the accused, who stay in Mumbai, about which train they were on. One of them is the girl’s blood sibling while the rest are cousins. They boarded different bogies of the train when it reached Kalyan, found the couple and threw him off the train before it reached Dombivli,” Dhage said.The accused have been charged with murder and destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dombivli-grp-to-file-chargesheet-in-honour-killing-case-on-monday-101634396286154.html
16-10-2021||Mumbai||Hopes hinged on pretomanid, new anti-TB drug in over four decades||Two patients from Mumbai have been started on pretomanid, the newest and the third anti-tuberculosis drug developed over four decades after bedaquiline and delamanid. The clinical trial at the civic-run Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi will enrol a total of 75 patients. Altogether, 400 patients will be enrolled in nine clinical trial sites across India. Pretomanid is prescribed as a part of the BPaL regimen, which includes two other drugs- bedaquiline and linezolid. Doctors and patients both have their hopes hinged on this new drug and the BPaL regimen. Pretomanid is a member of a class of compounds known as nitroimidazooxazines. Unlike other TB drugs developed by pharmaceutical companies, pretomanid was developed and registered by TB Alliance, a non-profit organisation. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pretamonid in August 2019 as a part of the three-drug treatment for people with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) who are treatment-intolerant or non-responsive. The three-drug BPaL regimen was prescribed for a duration of six months. In July this year, results of phase 3 clinical trial called the ZeNix trial carried out in 11 sites across Georgia, Moldova, Russia and South Africa showed the efficacy of BPaL regimen between 84% to 93% in highly drug-resistant patients with a variation in dosage of lineozolid. “The results were very encouraging because the current treatment regimen, commonly known as the ‘all oral longer regimen’ has an efficacy of around 43%,” said Dr Vikas Oswal, the principal investigator of Mumbai’s BPaL trial that has commenced in Shatabdi Hospital. From 14 pills to just 3The ‘all oral drug regimen’ include nearly 14 different anti-TB drugs that a patient consumes every day. Some patients with a stubborn disease are also put on injections and the overall duration of treatment is anywhere between 18 to 24 months. If replaced by the BPaL regimen, patients will effectively take only three tablets for a period of six months. “The longer duration of TB treatment is one of the main reasons for non-compliance,” said chest physician Dr Ashok Mahashur from Hinduja Hospital. “Most TB drugs have side effects due to which all patients have to be closely monitored. When the treatment goes on for a longer duration, the side effects are prolonged, which bothers the patients. Shorter treatment regimens with fewer tablets will be encouraging for the patients,” he said. Similar to the ZeNix trial, the trial at Shatabdi Hospital will also involve variations in the dosage of linezolid. The first arm of patients will get 600 mg of linezolid for six months, the second arm will get 600 mg for two months and 300 mg for four months and the third arm will get 600 mg for three months and 300 mg for three months. The dosage of bedaquiline- 400mg for the first two weeks followed by 100 mg alternatively for 22 weeks- and pretomanid- 200mg for six months- will remain constant. Side effectsThe ZeNix trial has observed that adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of trial participants included peripheral neuropathy. Some patients also had decreased haemoglobin levels. According to TB Alliance, common adverse reactions of pretomanid include peripheral neuropathy, acne, anaemia, nausea, vomiting, headache, increased transaminases, dyspepsia (upper abdominal discomfort), decreased appetite, rash, pruritus (skin irritability), abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (a condition affecting the liver), lower respiratory tract infection, hyperamylasemia (a condition likely affecting pancreas), hemoptysis (coughing up blood), back pain, cough, visual impairment, hypoglycemia, abnormal loss of weight, and diarrhoea. “Historically, side effects have been a major concern with all TB drugs,” said Ganesh Acharya, TB survivor and activist. “But we need newer compounds, newer drugs as the challenge of antimicrobial resistance is only getting serious every passing day. Close patient monitoring is therefore crucial. The entry of pretomanid is a glimmer of hope for TB patients. Once the trials conclude and if they have a positive result, our government should ensure speedy access to the drug for patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hopes-hinged-on-pretomanid-new-anti-tb-drug-in-over-four-decades-101634396226182.html

16-10-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar: I forced Uddhav Thackeray to become Maharashtra CM||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday that Uddhav Thackeray was “reluctant” to take up the post of Chief Minister after the 2019 assembly elections, following which Pawar had “forced” the Shiv Sena chief to do so. Pawar spoke to reporters in Pune hours after former CM and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had claimed that Thackeray had “ambitions to be CM”. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader addressed reporters in Nagpur engaging in a war of words after Thackeray’s Dussehra rally on Friday night. “This is a government formed through dishonesty and I feel that respected Uddhavji should now accept that he had ambitions of becoming a chief minister which he fulfilled. In politics, having ambitions is not wrong. But if you wanted to keep the word, you could have made senior Sena leaders Diwakar Raote, Subhash Desai or Eknath Shinde a CM,” Fadnavis had said. Refuting this, Pawar said: “[Thackeray] was reluctant for the post and had conveyed it to me. A few other names were discussed for the post as well, but I asked him to take up the responsibility. It is not proper to say that Thackeray was eyeing the post.” When asked if deputy CM and Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar was being targeted by the BJP — the Income Tax department recently conducted raids on firms and premises linked to him and his sisters — to scuttle his chances of becoming the next CM, Pawar said, “Thackeray’s name for the post of the CM was unanimously finalized by three ruling parties during the formation of the government. There is no question of any other leader becoming the CM....This government will serve its term and will come to the power again after that.” The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is a coalition of NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress party. Sena broke away from long-time ally BJP after the polls over the issue of the CM post, which the Sena wanted for its party. However, the BJP which had won 105 seats did not agree to this. Sena, which won 56 seats, joined hands with the other two parties to form the government. Fadnavis also said that “some ministers have even got extortion software created to know how much money is to be extorted from whom” which Pawar called “baseless allegations”. “Fadnavis should not level any baseless allegations against the state government, especially after having served as the CM. If he has any proof related to the software being used for extortion, he should make it public. Such statements are not expected from him. He has also said that BJP would not allow Maharashtra to become Bengal. What does he mean by that? Maharashtra and Bengal share many common bonds in terms of language, culture, patriotism. Does he want to say that the Bengal of Subhash Chandra Bose and Ravindranath Tagore is inferior to any other state? Is this comparison between two states of India fair?” he said. Pawar was on a tour of Pimpri-Chinchwad on Saturday. During the press conference, he spoke on various subjects from the I-T department raids on his nieces, to the farmers protests and Fadnavis’s statements from earlier in the morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-i-forced-uddhav-thackeray-to-become-maharashtra-cm-101634394747413.html
16-10-2021||Mumbai||Covid centres in Thane district closed temporarily as less patients visit them||Covid care centres in Ambernath, Badlapur and Murbad are temporarily shut due to less patients.The head of the department said that hardly anyone turned out at these centres for treatment even after getting a positive report. They are less symptomatic and are able to be treated at home itself, the official said.In August, rural areas of Thane district witnessed a decline in daily positive cases. It dropped from 64 daily positive cases in the first week to 27 by the last week of August. Although there was a slight increase in daily positive cases in September, they have not gone beyond 50 daily cases.In October, again a decline has been noted with the daily positive cases ranging between 25 and 35 over the last few days. Till now Thane rural areas have recorded around 1,00,056 positive cases.Municipal councils of Badlapur and Ambernath have to spend around ₹50 lakh per month for the maintenance of one centre and that includes payment of the employees of agencies and other expenses.Ambernath Municipal Council chief, Prashant Rasal, said, “In the last 15 days, Ambernath has reported 71 positive cases. Amongst these, only 19 patients visited the hospital for treatment. Our centre has a capacity of 700 beds. As there are no patients, it is of no use. Every month, the council spent around ₹45 lakh to ₹50 lakh on the centre’s maintenance and payment to private agencies for providing employees. We have our hospital with a capacity of 40 to 50 beds at the centre of Ayudh Nirman, where we can provide treatment for Covid. To stop unnecessary expenses and save money for the future or other calamities, we have taken the decision to close this centre on a temporary basis.”After Ambernath Municipal Council took this decision, Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council and Murbad also planned to shut their centres.Tehsildar of Murbad, Amol Kadam, said, “During the second wave we started Covid centre with 50 beds with oxygen facilities. But, it is of no use now as hardly five to 10 patients visited in the past few months.

16-10-2021||Pune||Maharashtra public health department exam candidates worried over centre allocation||PUNE Candidates appearing for the Maharashtra public health department exam scheduled on October 24 are now facing issues with respect to the allocation of exam centres. Many candidates have received exam centres in two different districts for two separate papers which are scheduled on the same day.Speaking about his grievances, Harshal Thakare, an interested candidate, said that he had applied for the Akola division but instead got a centre at Nashik division.“My centre should have been in the Akola division, but instead I’ll have to go to Nashik as my centre is there. Many students are reporting this issue. There were clear instructions that the centre will be allocated where the candidate has applied for the exam. Then why this inconvenience for candidates. Many candidates have got the morning centre at Sholapur and the evening paper at Pune. How can one candidate travel to two different districts in one single day for attempting paper,” said Thakare.Another candidate, Nikhil Shinde, who applied for the Akola division said we were allowed to fill different divisions for different positions.“However, now we cannot reach another centre or appear for the examination. We were initially allowed to fill the form but now as the admit cards have come it is not possible for us to give the exam,” said Shinde.Anant Datar, an aspirant who applied for the Pune division, has received Ahmednagar as his exam centre.“The department had clearly instructed that allocation of centres will be reserved by them. Under this, I have received the centre as Ahmednagar which I think is fine. I am from Aurangabad and either way, Ahmednagar is closer than Pune,” said Datar.Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) Students Rights’ activist Mahesh Bade said that candidates have opted for two centres that are nearby.“Candidates have opted for two centres which would be nearby. However, the two centres allocated on the admit card are far away which is causing distress to candidates. The choice of centres lies with the candidates and should be allowed to get the centre they choose,” said Bade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-public-health-department-exam-candidates-worried-over-centre-allocation-101634392205819.html

It also gets water from western Yamuna canal.A senior DJB official said there is no need to panic as only a small percentage of water comes to Delhi from Ganga Canal which can be balanced thorough supply from Yamuna river."There will no disturbance or shortage in water supply in the city due to closure of the Ganga Canal. We have sufficient water in Yamuna so the shortage from Ganga Canal can be met through excess water from Yamuna. There is no need to worry," the DJB official familiar with the development told PTI earlier in the day.He said the maintenance of Ganga canal is a routine exercise which is carried out every year.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department said the canal would be closed till November 5 and it might impact water supply in Delhi along with other districts of western Uttar Pradesh.Water supply in 19 districts of the state, including Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Etah, Hathras and Firozabad, is likely to be disrupted and farmers may face a shortage, the department officials said.They said during the period of maintenance, farmers may have to partially rely on tubewells and pumping sets to irrigate their fields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-supply-in-delhi-won-t-be-affected-for-ganga-canal-maintenance-says-djb-101634391254745.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||Jamia campus turns film set, students irked||New Delhi Several student groups had been demanding the reopening of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) campus, following which the university recently announced a phased reopening plan for its final-year students in undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses from November. Like most universities, Jamia too had been closed to curb the spread of Covid-19. And though the students should now be happy and prepping to go back to campus, that’s not the case. Most of them are agitated and say that while the campus has been closed for them, reportedly it has been witnessing presence of various crews that are shooting different movies and web shows including director Sahir Raza’s next project. The news of shoots happening on campus has left most students, who had been eagerly waiting return to physical classrooms, in a fit of rage. A student of AJK Mass Communication Research Centre at Jamia, shares on condition of anonymity: “I’ve been going to the campus for my practical classes since a while now. And I feel it’s shame how the university is allowing hundreds of people on campus to shoot but they can’t even open the library for the students who need it the most. Just a few days ago they allowed shooting at the central library but not a single student is allowed in on any day since the campus has been shut. It’s obvious that the university is making money by allowing some OTT platform to shoot their show on campus. And at the same time, they are not allowing students to come to the campus. Isn't this hypocritical?” Another Jamia student, Arbab Ali recently put up an Insta post that read: “I went to Jamia today and to my horror a film was being shot there. The university has remained closed for students since March 2020, but actors and directors are allowed in. Our founders must be turning in their graves to see the use to which Jamia’s classrooms, Jamia’s grounds are being put (sic).”A third year student of B Tech (Mechanical), who is also taking online classes, says on condition of anonymity, “Mine is a technical field of study and requires a hands-on experience. Online classes are like an insult to my area study... I feel betrayed that outsiders are allowed on campus and we aren’t! The canteen hasn't been opening even for the little trickle of students who come in for practicals. But, for the shooting crew it’s open. While visiting the campus to meet my friends, once I asked one of the crew members about how much they are charged for the venue, and was told that ‘Jamia charges ₹5 lakh as rent per day, to any production house that wants to shoot within the campus’. I saw this crew outside the Faculty of Engineering and Technology. They had put up a set near the Law Faculty, too, and four vanity vans were parked around campus gate number 13.” Those students who have been attending online classes only, also feel strongly about allowing film crews to shoot at a time when students are being barred entry for regular classes due to Covid-19 concerns. A student of BA (Hons) History, tells us anonymously: “At least since October 8 the shooting has been in progress here. And I feel a sense of anger and disappointment at the university for allowing them while not opening the university for students who are having a difficult time attending online classes. Our campus has been closed since the break out of Covid-19 in Delhi. And while students have been desperately demanding the reopening of campus, the university administration decided to rent out the university premises for a movie or some series shooting! Most of the students of the batch of 2020-21 never even attended an offline class or even accessed the university library even once till date. As a student, I feel disappointed.” When contacted, the university officials said they gave permissions for shooting only on the condition that Covid appropriate behaviour will be maintained on the campus. “Humne permission agar di hai toh iss condition par di hai ki voh Covid guidelines ko follow karein, jo unhone kiya... Humne shooting ke liye rent out kiya with the condition that Covid guidelines ko strictly follow kiya jayega. Bakaida voh RTPCR test ki reports ke saath, masks ke saath, sanitiser ke saath shoot karte the. Mask sirf camera ke saamne hatta tha,” says Ahmad Azeem, PRO, JMI.

16-10-2021||Pune||Diesel price in Pune breaches ₹100 mark, petrol sells for ₹110.92||Fuel prices rose again on Saturday, pushing the diesel price in Pune beyond ₹100 mark. With the price hike, diesel now costs ₹100.08 per litre in Pune. Petrol price has also increased to ₹110.92 per litre while compressed natural gas (CNG) prices have remained stable. This is the tenth hike in fuel prices this month. Subsequently, prices of petrol and diesel have increased by Rs3.45 and Rs4.2 respectively on Saturday. Petrol crossed Rs100 in May this year. On Thursday, petrol prices rose above ₹110 per litre while CNG prices increased by Rs2.6 per kg. The incessant hike in petrol and diesel prices is likely to impact transportation rates. Transport associations have asked the central government to fix the same transportation rates for the entire country. Baba Shinde, director of All India Motor Transport Congress (Maharashtra) said, “Meetings are being held with the central government by the representatives of the All India Motor Transport, an apex association of the transporters in the country.”Goods transporters are also aggrieved by the ascending fuel prices. “Diesel prices have been consistently going up and there seems to be no relief from that. As the diesel price increases, our profit margin gets affected. The transportation rates haven’t been increased yet. So, we have to sustain the burden of the added cost of the transportation,” said Ram Kadam, president of Motor Goods Vehicle Association, Pune district. Common people are also not spared from strain on their pockets because of the increased fuel prices. “I have a diesel car. I have already reduced its use when the diesel prices crossed the ₹90 mark. But in the Covid-19 pandemic situation when public transport wasn’t safe while travelling with the kids, personal cars have to be used. But it is not affordable anymore,” said Kedar Hatekar, a resident of Kothrud. CNG users are also disappointed with the price hikes as what was once the ‘affordable fuel’ refuge has now begun to walk the fossil-fuel path of regular price hikes. “People had turned to CNG because its prices were low and stable. I just hope that it doesn’t follow the path of the petrol and diesel prices. But as compared to the current prices of petrol and diesel, CNG is more affordable. Many friends of mine have got their diesel cars converted into CNG,” said Hemant Takwale, a cab driver. Sharad Pawar criticises government over fuel pricesNCP supremo Sharad Pawar criticised the Union government and said that it is apathetic towards the perils of the people. “Everyday petrol and diesel prices are increasing. The Centre says that it’s the result of international prices of crude oil. Before some months, international prices had collapsed, but the Centre hadn’t reduced the petrol and diesel prices in the country. In other countries, petrol prices are reducing but in India, it is increasing. The reason behind this is that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has adopted the point of view that petrol is the source of income for the government,” said Pawar while speaking in Pimpri on Saturday.“When UPA was in power and we had increased the fuel prices because of the fluctuation in the international market, BJP, the then opposition party, hadn’t allowed parliament to function for ten days. But now when they are in power these prices have been increasing every day and the central government is pushing Aam Aadmi into the valley of inflation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/diesel-price-in-pune-breaches-rs-100-mark-petrol-sells-for-rs-11092-101634390885744.html

16-10-2021||Mumbai||Most corrupt government… won’t come to know when it is toppled: Fadnavis||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray attacked former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying Hindutva faced a threat from “neo-Hindus” and dared the BJP to topple the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, former CM and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis escalated the war of words on Saturday stating that the present government was the most corrupt the state had seen, and that Thackeray would “not even come to know” when it was toppled. “You should keep in mind that it would be recorded in the history of Maharashtra that this is most corrupt government in the history of the state. There is only one agenda of this government, which is extortion,” Fadnavis told reporters in Nagpur. During his annual address at the Dussehra rally in Mumbai on Friday, Thackeray had hit out at the BJP and accused the Centre of interfering in the state’s day-to-day affairs. “I believe that Hindutva is now under threat. Those who have used the ladder of Hindutva can now use the strategy of the British of divide and rule,” Thackeray said during his address at the annual Dussehra rally in Mumbai on Friday. The CM also accused the Centre of misusing “central agencies” and asked Shiv Sena workers if they were ready to face the “attack by BJP leadership” in the same way that West Bengal (under Mamata Banerjee) had faced. “Does he want the unionism and extortion spree prevailing in Bengal to come to Maharashtra? Does he want to hang and thrash people with dissenting voices? Kolkata once used to be financial capital of the country. We would not allow Maharashtra to become another West Bengal,” Fadnavis said. Fadnavis said that Thackeray’s speech was a result of “political frustration” and it was time for the CM to stop acting innocent. He said the CM should pay attention to the corruption that was being uncovered by Income Tax (IT) department raids, Fadnavis said that Thackeray should decide he is for the eradication of the drug menace or against it. “We are not interested in toppling the MVA government, but he (Thackeray) would not even come to know if it is toppled. Instead of daring us to topple it, the CM should first govern it properly. He should first show the courage to face the farmers by working for their cause. I wonder how he can sleep soundly at night while his cabinet is busy in “dalali” (brokering/ middlemanship) and IT authorities have brought forward sensational facts after the recent raids,” Fadnavis said. The IT department on Friday revealed that it had recently carried out search and seizure operations at 70 premises of two real estate business groups of Mumbai and certain individuals and entities linked to a politician’s family, following which it found highly incriminating documents, evidencing unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore. These raids were conducted at Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa and Jaipur. “The “dalali” has reached to such level that some ministers have even got extortion software created to know how much money is to be extorted from whom. If such things are going on, then it is natural that ED-CBI will come to the state,” Fadnavis said. The Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation have been investigating former home minister Anil Deshmukh, who was accused of running an extortion ring. They are also investigating other politicians including Eknath Khadse. Fadnavis said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was staunchly against the use of central agencies or any interference in their work. Had they been misused, half of the MVA government would be behind the bars, Fadnavis said. “Hon Modiji is against any such use [of central agencies] or intervening in their business. He is against the misuse of these agencies like it was done during the Congress rule. We believe in democracy. Had we misused the central agencies (against the ruling politicians in Maharashtra), half of the Thackeray cabinet would be in jail,” Fadnavis said. On Friday’s rally, the Sena chief alleged misuse of central agencies to defame the Maharashtra government. “A picture is painted that the drugs business is booming only in Maharashtra. It is not so that drugs are caught only in Maharashtra. The court has directed [officials] to probe the Mundra port where drugs worth crores of rupees were found. Where is this Mundra port? You merely find a pinch of Ganja, while my police [force] busted drugs worth ₹150 crore. You catch a celebrity and beat drums about it. But my police has busted drug [network] and nobody talks about it,” he said, referring to the arrest of Aryan Khan, actor Shahrukh Khan’s son, after a raid by the Narcotics Crime Bureau in a holiday cruise. Khan was arrested but the NCB maintains that no drug was found on his person. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik reacted to Fadnavis’ remarks saying: “Why only half of the cabinet, they should put the entire cabinet in the jail. Fadnavis should mind his language while levelling such allegations. The corruption of the BJP leaders (from previous BJP-led government) will soon come to fore.” Thackeray on Friday had also called for an open debate with intellectuals and constitutional experts on federalism. “The Constitution has given us sovereign rights as the Centre, then the Centre’s daily interference cannot happen and cannot be tolerated,” he had said. Reacting to this, Fadnavis said that the BJP would not allow Thackeray and his party to touch the Constitution. “He said that he wants to change federal structure described in the Constitution. This is a hidden agenda Thackeray wants to implement with the help of a few left-wing parties and communist. But the BJP would not let it happen ever,” he said. Fadnavis asked why other Shiv Sena leaders like Subhash Desai, Eknath Shinde and Diwakar Raote were not made CM if Thackeray had no aspiration for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/most-corrupt-government-won-t-come-to-know-when-it-is-toppled-fadnavis-101634388964693.html

From 7am to 10am and from 7pm to 10pm, I used to work out. In between, I’d do my duty as well. I used to work out in Bandra as well as Nerul gyms,” Pujari said.Pujari was trained by Asian Championship of 2018, Sunit Jadhav. During the pandemic, when the gyms were shut, Pujari set up his own gym at home by purchasing the equipment.

16-10-2021||Bhopal||Pragya Thakur lashes out over ‘missing’ poster, says ‘no place in India’ for Congressmen||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Pragya Thakur lambasted at Madhya Pradesh Congress legislator for the “missing” posters about Thakur that were doing rounds when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak, saying that “ such Congressmen and traitors" have no place in India and only patriots will stay in the country. The BJP legislator made the remarks at a Dussehra programme on MVM Ground in Bhopal where Congress's Bhopal South MLA P C Sharma, who was the target, was also present. He left the event midway in a huff.At the event, Thakur described Hindus as patriots. “If the patriots understand their strength, then the country's borders will be protected, India will be integrated and the country will reach its glory,” she said."Animals also have feelings. When its offspring dies or falls sick, the animal cries. But they (Congressmen) are worse than animals. Do not treat the sick as sick. At first, they tortured (me) and when I got sick, they put up my missing posters," Thakur said at the gathering, as quoted by PTI.She further said, "Shame on such people that they become MLAs. Such people do not deserve to become an MLA, but became one. Such people call themselves Hindus, but they are insensitive. They attack us. They cry over those who kill us. Shame on such Congressmen, shame on such traitors and I say there is no place for them in India. Only patriots will remain in India."She also took a veiled swipe at Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh, saying that no person can become pious by taking up “Narmada parikrama" (circumambulation of Narmada river).Thakur said no 'adharmi' can become pious by taking up 'Narmada parikrama', an apparent attack on Digvijaya Singh, although she did not name anyone. The Congress leader had undertaken the 3,300-km Narmada parikrama in 2017.Congress legislator Sharma, who left the programme midway, later told news agency PTI, "It was a social platform and not the political one… It was a Dussehra programme, but she insulted those who undertake Narmada Parikrama, whoever his target may be. This is condemnable.“She said that her missing posters were put up. The people of Bhopal were in trouble for two years without bed and injections during the pandemic. She is MP from Bhopal and the people were demanding her to provide these facilities," he said.Thakur, who spent several years in jail after being arrested in the Malegaon blast case, has earlier alleged that she was illegally detained and beaten up by police personnel to admit the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/pragya-thakur-lashes-out-over-missing-poster-says-no-place-in-india-for-congressmen-101634380988000.html

Bad weather and festive season seem to be the reason, according to the civic body.Thane city has vaccinated 15,28,935 beneficiaries till now. These include 8,25,625 males and 7,03,310 females.The response for the second dose has not picked up yet. With the festive season, the response for vaccination at centres has dipped drastically and the civic body has ample doses left. On Saturday, TMC had scheduled a vaccination drive with 24,000 doses ready to be administered.“The bad weather last week and the festive season could have been a deterrent for many. Moreover, during Ganesh Chaturthi, we had kept the vaccination schedule closed for a few days. This time, we continued with the same on all the days,” said a civic officer from TMC.Among those above 45 years of age, there are 7.70% who have not jabbed at all and among the 18-45 years age group, there are 17.20% who have not been inoculated at all. At 84% vaccination across the city, TMC has started conducting mass vaccination drives in areas where there are fewer responses.On October 2, a massive vaccination drive was held in Diva. It received a good response and hence a similar drive was planned by the Thane civic on Saturday as well. A vaccination drive for 1,000 beneficiaries was organised at Kharegaon, Kalwa.“We also cannot rule out the possibility that there are many who get vaccinated outside the city and many from outside Thane limits who prefer to vaccinate within Thane. This could cause a difference in the vaccination figures. However, we need to focus on all strata of society and ensure that the vaccine is accessible. Hence, we organise mass vaccination drives at regular intervals in the city,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.The waiting period involved in getting the second dose could also be the reason for fewer numbers of fully vaccinated people. The mass vaccination drive in Kalwa saw a good response.“There is hardly any vaccination centre near my house. So, I had not taken the vaccine till now. This mass drive was a boon as we could finish the process within 10 minutes. This helped me as I have senior citizens and kids to take care of at home and could not leave them unattended for long,” said Savita Katkar, a 38-year-old resident of Kharegaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15-of-eligible-population-in-thane-has-not-taken-a-single-vaccination-dose-against-covid-101634386927101.html
16-10-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister lays foundation stone of railway overbridge, flyover in Prayagraj||Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya laid the foundation stone of a four-lane railway overbridge (RoB) in the Chaufatka-Bamrauli Airport-Subedarganj railway station stretch and a double lane flyover connecting GT Road to Kanpur Road, in Prayagraj on Saturday. Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh, BJP MPs Kesari Devi Patel and Rita Bahuguna Joshi were also present during the bhoomi pujan ceremony. A total of around ₹284.21 crore has been approved for the flyover and railway overbridge in Prayagraj. The projects are expected to be completed in 24 months. The construction of the 660 metre double-lane flyover and the 1.58km four lane railway overbridge will facilitate quicker travel from GT Road to the Bamrauli airport, in addition to the Buddhist pilgrimage sites of Kaushambi. These projects would speed up the development of the Allahabad West constituency area, the deputy chief minister said. At present, one has to cover 16 kilo metres to reach the airport from Civil Lines in Prayagraj in about 90 minutes after dealing with traffic jams in areas like Dhumanganj and Sulem Sarai. After the construction of the flyover, the travel time will be reduced to 20 to 25 minutes. Addressing the gathering, the deputy chief minister said that development projects across the state were undertaken on a mega scale during Yogi Adityanath’s government. The Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister also said construction work of the Inner Ring Road was underway to free the district from traffic snarls. A four-lane model road was also on the cards between Kokhraj and Handia, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-deputy-chief-minister-lays-foundation-stone-of-railway-overbridge-flyover-in-prayagraj-101634386625385.html

With almost ₹8.51Cr loss on an average every month since March 2021, it is almost 50% more than what was recorded in the 2017-18 financial year, which was ₹3.96Cr and 27% more than 2019-20 financial year, when the loss recorded was ₹6.23Cr.In the financial year 2019-20, prior to the lockdown, the average monthly income of NMMT was ₹10.27Cr, of which ₹6.41Cr was earned via the ticket fares, students pass and penalties while ₹56.41 lakh was earned via advertisements. The same was ₹11.61Cr in 2018-19 and ₹11.31Cr in 2017-18. Meanwhile, in 2020-21, after the pandemic started, the income came down to ₹5.72Cr monthly average and this year, it is ₹5.87Cr.The average monthly expenses of NMMT before the lockdown was ₹16.51Cr including the salaries, daily wages, fuel and other maintenance expenses. Even with the lockdown, the expenses had gone down only by 16% to ₹13.87Cr.“The salaries had to be paid. The fuel prices kept increasing even though the usage was less and hence the expenses did not have any remarkable cut down while the income had,” an official from NMMT said.During the lockdown period, NMMT was catering to only the people attached to essential services and around 10,000 people used the service to reach to the workplaces and return home. The service was extended to essential workers in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Badlapur, Ambernath, Dombivli, Panvel, Uran, Chembur, Govandi, Mankhurd, Dahisarmori, Kharghar and Ulwe. Besides, around 18 NMMT buses were also converted into ambulances to cater to Covid-19 patients in NMMC-run hospitals. Around 995 buses were also provided for 39,746 migrants from Navi Mumbai to go to the respective railway stations to travel to their hometowns.Currently, NMMT buses are running in full capacity on all the routes. As per the number of passengers increasing, the route trips are being added, the officer said. Around 300 buses are plying on the road, of which 50 are electric buses, 70 are CNG and 180 are diesel buses. The corporation has around 180 electric buses, of which only 50 are plying due to lack of passengers.“In order to reduce the losses, we will now try to bring as many electric buses as possible on the roads. The work on the charging points at Turbhe depot is on and is expected to be over in the next ten days. After that, we can get more electric buses on the road. Reducing diesel buses and finding ways to convert diesel buses into CNG buses would be our agenda. We also plan to reduce the fare by 30%-40% so as to attract more passengers,” Yogesh Kaduskar, general manager, NMMT, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-municipal-corporation-s-nmmt-suffers-rs8-51cr-loss-on-average-every-month-this-year-101634385439631.html

The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) has agreed to give land for the same, a senior officer said.Sanjay Jagtap, city engineer of PCMC, said, “After conducting multiple surveys in our jurisdiction, we have planned to develop these three UPHCs. Each of these centres will have OPDs and other primary medical facilities. The proposal will be presented before the general body meeting in November and we will start the tendering process as soon as we receive the approval. CIDCO has already agreed to give us land in those places and hence we will have to spend time acquiring land.”Another senior officer from PCMC said that it will need around ₹3Cr for developing these three centres. “We will explore the possibilities of acquiring funds from the central government while working on these projects. We have plans to develop three to five other UPHCs in some other parts of the city at a later stage. But nothing has been decided about that so far,” the officer said.Mahesh Shirke, a 54-year-old activist from Panvel, said, “The population of PCMC’s jurisdiction is around 8.50 lakh. However, it is rapidly increasing as people from different parts of the country are migrating to the newly-developed areas of Kharghar, Taloja, New Panvel, Roadpali and Kamothe. The public healthcare system is not so strong here and thus the residents are heavily dependent on private hospitals. The upcoming UPHCs will give some relief to the residents of those areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/panvel-city-municipal-corporation-plans-to-develop-three-urban-primary-health-centres-101634385432661.html

Earlier, the government launched the School Fagathansi Mission with an ambitious objective to give renewed thrust to the improvement of government schools both in terms of physical and manpower infrastructure.In his speech, Singh said that the education system in the state considerably improved after the successful implementation of the School Fagathansi Mission. To facilitate teachers in taking online classes for higher education, recording studios have been set up across different colleges, he added. The STAR Education Manipur programme would facilitate teachers and students in their teaching and learning process and would also play a key role in developing students’ knowledge.During the day’s function, the chief minister Biren Singh also released a leaflet on STAR Education Manipur and handed over teachers’ computer sets and school management smart phones to the director, Education (S).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/manipur-cm-launches-a-new-flagship-programme-to-transform-education-system-101634382965760.html
16-10-2021||Mumbai||Post Covid-19, mental health of research scholars takes toll||The Covid-19 pandemic has not only delayed the work of research scholars in science and technology institutes but also led to severe anxiety over deadlines and career prospects. Over the past year, research scholars have been complaining of delays in disbursal of fellowships. The pandemic also made laboratories and institutions inaccessible to researchers. Although the Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) has allowed a year-long extension to deadlines for PhD completion, many scholars said pressures were high. Mental health has taken a toll. In the past few weeks there have been two instances of PhD students dying by suicide and one attempting suicide at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. “Research scholars across the country, particularly those in the late stage and nearing completion, are under immense pressure. While delay in stipend and fellowships have marred our personal expenses, the delays were more pronounced during the pandemic,” said Priyank Samagra Jain, a PhD student at the Ashank Desai Centre for Policy Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. When Covid-19 led to a shutdown of almost all educational institutes, many scholars could not complete their PhD work on time or meet deadlines. During this time, the Democratic Research Scholars’ Organisation (DRSO)—a national group of research scholars from across sectors—demanded an extension in the deadline for PhD from CSIR. “During the Covid-19 first and second waves, we at DRSO did campaigns on extension and also other issues including fellowship, infrastructure, employment. From May 2020, we held signature campaigns, sent memorandum and conducted an all India convention. Several state and institution level conventions and campaigns are ongoing,” said Arghya Das, a post-doctoral fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Hyderabad, and one of the convenors of DRSO. Dibyasankar Das, a PhD scholar at the TIFR Mumbai, said, “The cause of degradation of mental health in academia is, according to me, that our system promises so much but provides so little - both financially and intellectually. Financially speaking, a 25-year-old needs to be financially independent, but the scholarship they get barely fulfil their daily requirements. There are scholars who are getting only Rs8,000 a month and they have to do other work in the lab to help the principal investigator also apart from their own PhD work. Even those who get Rs35,000 a month soon realise funding to labs is very limited and being cut day by day. So even if you have ideas, you can’t perform those in labs due to lack of infrastructure.” In the past five years, the number of applications for junior research fellowships of CSIR has gone up from 2.8 lakh in 2015-16 to 3.79 lakh in 2019-20. Scholars said that even as the number of applications and selected candidates go up, the career prospects are not enough. “The jobs, especially as faculty or postdoctoral fellows at various institutes, are not commensurate with the number of research scholars coming in for PhD every year,” said Jain. A grievance portal was launched by CSIR to take note of the problems faced by research scholars over delayed disbursal of fellowships. On October 10, CSIR kicked off a series of career guidance sessions with research scholars to understand and address grievances. Anjan Ray, head, CSIR-Human Resource Development Group, addressed around 500 research scholars and took note of the problems faced by CSIR. “We have been hearing from students that analytical tools are not available to them especially since campuses are shut. Scholars can use the AnalytiCSIR tool, which is a network of 35 laboratories, 1,434 equipment and 1,993 test services. Scholars can look up equipment at any of the 35 labs, book a test and send samples to the lab and download a lab report using AnalytiCSIR,” said Ray. Through the career guidance sessions, CSIR will help scholars match their work to theme areas where jobs are available, Ray added. However, deteriorating mental health remains a prime concern for many research scholars. “The education system of our country is such that by the time one comes to do a PhD, our ability to ask questions is gone completely. It is frustrating, because you have so many tools, but no question to address. Above this, the environment at research institutes/universities are not intellectually intriguing. There is no place for exchanging ideas openly, debating on something and so on.” “When we came into an institute for PhD, we had a community to converse with, various interpersonal relationships. These were stress busters. Working from home, we miss those dynamics and communities,” Jain added. Arghya said that DRSO is trying to build a national-level mental health support initiative for research scholars. “However, we realise that only counselling and voicing for a mental health support mechanism in campuses are far from enough. The entire research ecosystem and the outlook towards research and researchers (a rather complicated matter), the massive uncertainty of future post PhD, which is much more acute after Covid-19, a general lack of communication and understanding among research sector with our lives in the broader society, all these significantly factor in,” he added. Dibyasankar added, “We should always fight for our hike in salary, or funding in fundamental research, but at the end of the day we don’t have much power to implement that. What is in our hands is that we research scholars can create our campuses as vibrant as possible by having different clubs, cultural activities, open debates, outreach activities, which, I think, will solve a significant portion of mental health issues in academia.” BMC mental health helpline: 022 24131212 I Call: 9152987821The Samaritans Mumbai:842298452884229845298422984530||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/post-covid-19-mental-health-of-research-scholars-takes-toll-101634381524609.html

Randhawa said that the directive might weaken India's federal structure.As per the Centre's latest order, the BSF can now undertake arrest, search and seizure up to 50 kilometres in the states of Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Earlier, the force could only take action up to a stretch of 15 km in these states."Unseen Emergency-like situations are being created in Punjab, which will never be tolerated. Punjab is safe in the hands of the Punjab Police. The Centre should instead focus on drugs, weapons and drones coming from across the border. Peaceful Punjabis must not be harassed," Randhawa, who is also serving as the state's home minister, told news agency ANI on Saturday.He reiterated the demands of the Congress led-Punjab government that the police should be left to handle the law and order situation in the state, adding that the BSF should only be kept at the border.The deputy chief minister also pointed out that with the extension of the jurisdiction, people fear that the BSF will randomly enter their houses, cordon off villages and conduct searches, ANI further reported.Before Randhava, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi also condemned the Centre's decision and said that the extension of BSF's jurisdiction is a direct attack on federalism. He urged Union home minister Amit Shah to roll back the decision."I strongly condemn the GoI's unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within the 50 KM belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on federalism. I urge the Union Home Minister @AmitShah to immediately roll back this irrational decision," Channi tweeted on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Punjab unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Ashwani Sharma condemned the criticism of the state government and other opposition parties over the decision. Accusing opposition parties of indulging in politics, he said that incidents of drones, tiffin bombs and drug trafficking have increased.“All border states have come under this notification as national security was most pivotal to the survival of the country. Politicians should refrain from petty politics,” Sharma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-should-instead-focus-on-punjab-dy-cm-on-bsf-s-jurisdiction-extension-101634375957804.html

Doing their bit, NGOs in Delhi-NCR have been providing ration, warm meals, etc. to support the less privileged as well as refugees. On World Food Day, today, some Good Samaritans share how they are feeding those reeling under the brutal impact of Covid-19. “Since the second wave hit, we have supported over two lakh people with meals,” says Kuldip Nar from ResponseNet, adding, “We have created a model to ensure food security of migrants, underprivileged families for at least a month, at every intervention. We make sure that monthly ration is provided in their homes, and we are running this in over 13 states, including Assam, Jharkhand, Sikkim, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.” The tales of some refugees are heartbreaking, admits Anchal Sharma from Meals of Happiness. “Our team, along with volunteers, serves warm, nutritious meals to the less fortunate and refugees every day... Sometimes, donors help us get fresh mithai (sweets) made, and we distribute those too. Sweets give instant energy and also bring joy to the otherwise not-so-comfortable lives of the needy, especially in festive times. We also arrange for donation of clothes and toys,” she adds. And then, there are NGOs assisting the less privileged acquire skills to be able to fend for themselves as well as their families. Manisha Bhatia from Abhinandan says, “Sometimes, we distribute food packets among the underprivileged in Nizamuddin area. But, as they say, ‘Teach a person to fish and they will never be hungry’, so we impart vocational skills to them. Our educational and welfare society has collaborated with Nizamuddin Railway Police Station, to give kids and women in the neighbourhood a chance to earn some extra income, so that they always have food on their plates. The police station has even let us use a part of their premises for this.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/worldfoodday-how-city-ngos-are-ensuring-no-one-sleeps-hungry-101634368747256.html

Taking the incident seriously, the police should take strict action against the culprits and like done Lakhimpur Kheri. The Dalit CM of Punjab should give 50 lakh rupees and a government job to the victim's family, this is the demand of BSP," tweeted Mayawati.Earlier on Friday, a corpse of a man, with hands and legs chopped off, was found hanging on a police barricade at the farmers' protest site near the Singhu border, said Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Hansraj."An FIR has been registered in the case," said the DSP.She further compared the road mishap in the Chhattisgarh's Jashpur district, where a car ran over a group of people walking to immerse an idol of Goddess Durga, with Lakhimpur Kheri incident and asked Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel to take strict action against the accused."The incident of death of one person and injuries to many people in Chhattisgarh during Durga Visarjan is very sad, which is reminiscent of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. The Congress government should give financial help and jobs to the families of the victims and take strict action against the culprits," Mayawati tweeted.A speeding car on Friday evening allegedly mowed down one individual and left 16 persons injured from a procession that was heading for Durga idol immersion in Pathalgaon block of Jashpur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-demands-strict-action-against-culprits-of-singhu-border-killing-101634368300699.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||#BossDay: Professionals in Delhi-NCR say ‘Boss, tussi great ho!’||New DelhiLove them or hate them, bosses are your life’s true ‘constants’, if you are an employee. But, when Covid-19 was at its peak, quite a few bosses shed their strict avatars and went out of their way to help colleagues and teammates — from offering mental health breaks to helping them find emergency Covid-related supplies. On Boss’s Day today, some professionals in Delhi-NCR express gratitude to their seniors, saying: “Boss, tussi great ho!”From attending SOS calls to being available at odd hours and resolving issues — bosses did it all, and more. Gurugram-based Sarika Panda Bhatt, director of a firm, shares while talking about her boss, Manas Fuloria: “During the second wave, we were looking for a hospital bed and oxygen cylinder one night. Our boss was there for us all, even if it meant calling at 1 or 2 am. He told us, ‘Just focus on helping people, no need to do other work’. He even announced a concept wherein anyone can work from anywhere, permanently. I am really fortunate to have him as my mentor.” Jerome Jaganathan, a sales professional from Lodhi Colony, says: “When many of my teammates were worried about salaries getting cut, our boss stepped up and made sure we get full salaries throughout the Covid period. In fact, he’s often asked us if we need help, since the pandemic struck.”Some share how their bosses have helped them stay mentally healthy amid #WFH life. “In mid-August, my boss acknowledged my need for a short break to improve my mental health, and approved a week-long leave for a trip to Ladakh, that too on short notice. He has also been helping me manage overwhelming work phases. This is so thoughtful, especially in times like these,” says Dishant Passi, a Delhi-based business analyst in multimedia domain. And Preeti Chauhan, a Delhi-based marketing professional, recounts how her boss personally prepared meals for a Covid-infected colleague: “My boss himself cooked dal, rice and green vegetables, arranged medicines and nariyal pani to send to the home of that colleague and her brother, who were both infected. And when talking to the team, he told us all to take it easy and not stress about work.” Well, isn’t that a shift from the usual boss bitching?

But the rivers should not be polluted,” he added.Kumar further said that the various projects initiated by the government for cleaning rivers will not be useful unless people become aware and stop polluting the rivers. Earlier on Wednesday, DPCC issued an order stating that idol immersion at public places can attract a fine of ₹50,000. It banned the immersion at public places including the Yamuna River or any other water body, ponds, or ghats.The pollution control body directed the general public, Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs), and Pooja Samitis that the idol immersion ritual may be performed within the home premises in a bucket or a container.It further stated that the worship material like flowers, decorating material (made of paper), etc. should be removed before immersion of idols and may be collected separately for disposal or in an environmental safe handing over to the door-to-door waste collection vehicle.The Committee also directed municipal authorities and Delhi Police to ensure strict checks on the entry of vehicles or goods carriers entering into the national capital carrying prohibited idols as its cargo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-yamuna-littered-with-waste-despite-curbs-on-idol-immersion-101634359775944.html

The resurfacing work is being undertaken by the Indian Air Force (IAF), which manages the runway operations.Informing about the closure of the airport, the IAF had said earlier this month that shutting down the airstrip was "inescapable" as the condition of the runway is rapidly deteriorating and it needs re-carpeting."Flight operations will remain completely closed from tomorrow till October 29 and it will resume from October 30," Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Friday.Partial closure of the runway was done for 12 hours daily during night from October 26, 2020 for the maintenance work, in order to cause the least disturbance to daily civil operations, news agency ANI reported."A 14-day complete closure was planned from April 26 till May 9, 2021 to undertake the resurfacing of the central bitumen portion of the runway.

Celebrating Dussehra with crackers is essential to respect the religious sentiments of people.”President of the Azaad Dramatic Club in Sector 20, that organised the event, Gulshan Kumar said, “The crackers used were much lesser than previous years. When so many people have gathered to celebrate Dussehra, it is important to honour their wishes.”SDM (South) Rupesh Kumar, meanwhile, said, “The organisers behaved very irresponsibly despite being warned. Under the guise of the crowd, they deliberately broke the rules. They will face action.”In Sector 28, one of the organisers, Mukesh Sharma, said, “The orders came too late. We had already set up crackers in effigies at a cost of ₹2 lakh. Removing them would have disfigured the effigies.”Violators to face police actionSuperintendent of police (SP, City) Ketan Bansal said, “Police are investigating the matter and cases will be registered against those found at fault.”Sources said police will be registering cases under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code against the organisers of the celebrations at Sectors 28 and 34, Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, Subhash Nagar in Manimajra and Maloya.The SDM (South) also sealed Garg General Store in Sector 42 for selling crackers and a separate FIR will be registered in this regard.Congress, AAP hit out at BJPChandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said, “It seems that the administration and the BJP are in cahoots. The bureaucrats cannot enforce their orders, they should resign and go back to their parent state.”AAP Chandigarh co-incharge Pradeep Chabbra added, “The administration should not take such decisions at the last minute. It seems that the administration is under pressure from the BJP. They must ensure similar confusion doesn’t take place on Diwali.”Others find novel ways to celebrateThinking out of the box, the organisers of the event at Parade Ground, Sector 17, used an audio recording to simulate bursting firecrackers for a gathering of nearly 400. In Sector 46 as well, an effigy was burnt without crackers.As such the festival had no impact on the city’s air quality. While the AQI was 300 around 2pm, it went down to 187 by 8.30pm, as recorded at the air quality monitoring station in Sector 22.Covid norms floutedCovid protocols were disregarded at most locations. Over a 1,000 people gathered in Sector 34, where cops remained busy managing the traffic and could not keep a check on people not maintaining social distance and not wearing masks.In Mohali district, too, huge crowds gathered for celebrations at 14 places, including at the Dussehra grounds in Phases 1 and 8. This led to long queues of vehicles on the main roads in Phases 1, 7, 8 and 9, and Sector 70. Housing societies across the tricity also torched smaller effigies as part of simpler celebrations. A 100-feet-tall effigy of Ravana was burnt in Ambala’s Barara town. It was set up by Shri Ramlila Club that had erected a 221-foot effigy in Chandigarh in 2019. Several other associations also organised celebrations in various blocks of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-s-cracker-ban-goes-for-a-toss-during-dussehra-effigy-burning-101634337669483.html

16-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Coaching institute told to refund fee of student who quit midway||Terming refusal to refund coaching fee midcourse as gross unfair trade practice, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh, has directed FIITJEE Limited to refund the ₹69,909 fee to a Panchkula resident. The commission also directed the institute to pay ₹25,000 as compensation for causing mental agony and harassment to the complainant, along with ₹7,000 as litigation cost. In her complaint, Nisha had submitted that her son got enrolled in a four-year classroom programme for JEE-Advanced 2020, starting April 2016.  ₹1.92 lakh were paid through post-dated cheques as total fee for the programme.However, her son was never satisfied with the coaching provided since day one. Neither were the teachers capable of making him understand the lectures nor they addressed his complaints. Also, she was told by the coaching centre that the fee for Classes 11 and 12 through Sri Guru Gobind Singh Collegiate Public School, Sector 26, Chandigarh, was included in the total programme cost, but later she was told to deposit admission and tuition fees, etc. Besides, her son was never provided study material. So, he left the classes in October 2018. When they sought a refund from the institute, they were turned down, forcing Nisha to approach the consumer court.Denying any deficiency in services, FIITJEE Limited sought dismissal of the complaint. The institute submitted that the fee was paid by Nisha after choosing the plan as per her convenience. Fee once paid was not refundable and her son left the course midway on his own sweet will. Holding the institute guilty of unfair trade practice and deficiency in service, the commission, presided over by Rajan Dewan held that FIITJEE Limited was not justified in retaining fee for remaining period.“A student or a trainee may leave midstream if he/she finds the service deficient, substandard and non-yielding, and to tell him/her that fees once paid is not refundable is gross unfair trade practice on the part of coaching institutes,” it said in its order, while directing FIITJEE Limited to refund ₹69,909 with 8% interest since October 2018.What the consumer court said“Coaching institutes are not meant only to collect huge fee from the students and earn profits out of it…No service provider can take/charge consideration of the service, which neither it has provided nor has been availed,” read the commission’s order. “In our opinion, coaching institutes should act prudently and should not be charging fee in advance for the entire course and if they do so, they should not refuse to refund, as and when asked for, by taking shelter under some self-serving clause that fee once paid is not refundable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-coaching-institute-told-to-refund-fee-of-student-who-quit-midway-101634337665004.html

16-10-2021||Chandigarh||HT Readers’ take: City Beautiful, reclaim the streets||Teach boys to respect the opposite sexTo wipe out crimes against women, first we need to sensitise boys. Right from childhood, parents and teachers should teach boys to respect the opposite sex. Also, girls and women should be taught self-defense techniques so that they are ready for any situation. To make the streets safer, ensure that they are well-lit and have adequate closed-circuit television cameras and police presence. Also, movies and web shows must stop objectifying women. Krrish Madaan, AmbalaMake cities gender-inclusiveMen and women use public spaces differently. Therefore, we need to stop assuming that what works for men will also work for women. To build a safe city, it is important that city planning takes into account the issue of women’s safety. Simple measures such as shifting a bus stop by a few metres to a safer location and installing streetlights and CCTVs on isolated stretches can go a long way in ensuring women’s safety. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhNeed sustained efforts to wipe out the menaceThe moral character of the nation has been eroding and men with loose morals take pride in harassing women. To check this menace, sustained efforts are required on the law-enforcement front. Policing needs to be enhanced in the city and the public must be encouraged to intervene whenever they see any wrongdoing. Women, too, must be trained in self-defense so as that they can fight back sexual harassment and also report the culprits to the police. Kidar Nath Sharma, ChandigarhProactive policing, harsher punishment for offendersCrimes such as molestation, street harassment etc continue unabated because there aren’t enough police personnel on the ground and politicians don’t seem to take women’s issues seriously. We need harsher punishment for those indulging in crimes against women and more police presence around the city so as to instill a sense of safety among women. SC Luthra, Chandigarh Nip the menace in the budWomen’s harassment is largely prevalent due to poor upbringing of boys. We need to catch them young and teach them the importance of respecting women and girls. For those from the current generation who take pleasure in harassing women, strict punishment is the only way out. Even in the recent case of molestation of the UK diplomat, the man nabbed for molestation was found to have done the same with other women. Had he been caught and put behind bars after the first instance itself, other women would have been spared the agony.AK Sharma, ChandigarhInstill fear in sexual offenders It is unfortunate that sexual harassment is so prevalent in our world that every woman has faced it at some point in her life. We should no longer turn a blind eye to it and must take active measures to make public spaces safer for women. For starters, we need functional streetlights and closed-circuit television cameras in all corners of the city to instill a sense of fear in anti-social elements. Police need to intensify patrolling in crime-prone spots as well as other areas. Women of all age-groups must undergo self-defense training. And lastly, we need harsher punishment against such crimes.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurNo lessons learnt from previous instancesIt’s disturbing to know that yet another woman, this time a UK diplomat in the city, has faced sexual harassment on the city’s streets. Unfortunately, this is not the first such instance in Chandigarh. While the latest incident took place in the posh residential area of Sector 10, we have heard of similar incidents in other parts of the city too. In December 2019, a woman journalist had faced a similar experience during her morning walk at the PU Botanical Garden. On the same day, young girl, on her way to tuitions, was manhandled by a youth in the forest area behind PEC. In 2017, Varnika Kundu, a disc jockey, was stalked on the city roads. It just goes on to reiterate that despite several instances, the police and administration have taken no steps to correct the problem areas. UT police boasts of maintaining law and order on city streets but clearly, their claims are a sham.Sanjay Chopra, Mohali Safe public transportAs our country is entering a new decade with a plan to rebuild economy and push forward green initiatives, it’s time we also introduce the concept of good public transport (metro, monorail etc) in the tricity region. This will encompass the issue of women’s safety too, making them empowered. Tricity women are forced to shell out extra on private cabs etc as instances of harassment in autos etc have left them with no other option. S Krishnamurthi, MohaliSelf-defence classes for all womenWe need to empower women and self-defence classes are one way to go about it. Self-defence trainings must be imparted in schools, colleges and universities to make girls more confident about tackling harassment. We need to train women and girls to speak up and fight back harassment. The onus is also on the members of the public to come out in support of women facing any kind of harassment. It’s only when we hit back that the offenders would be scared of attempting anything similar in the future.Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaNot the ‘weaker sex’First and foremost, we need to stop referring to women as the weaker sex. Women should be trained to be bold, self-reliant and confident. Self-defense classes will go a long way in this. We need to empower women to speak up against instances of sexual harassment. Silence has never helped anyone. Police need to be more sensitive to the problems faced by women and our judiciary must penalise the offenders heavily so that no man dares to repeat such an action again. Anju Mohan, PanchkulaA safe city?Chandigarh is known to be one of the safest cities in North India, yet we get to hear of cases such as the one involving the UK diplomat. In a city like Chandigarh, there should be no place for street harassment. Sadly, every time we hear of such an incident, there is rage at first, hue and cry in the media, face-saving announcements by the police and administration but eventually it all dies down, until something similar happens again. Though we have stringent laws, its implementation is poor. Higher conviction rates can instill a sense of fear in anti-social elements. Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhA blot on City BeautifulThe recent incident of molestation of a UK diplomat on the city’s streets is a blot on the City Beautiful’s name. Even more shameful that many girls don’t have a safe space inside their own homes. The age-old patriarchy is to be blamed for the regressive state of affairs. It is sad that most women and girls are unable to be even speak up against such harassment due to the stigma attached. The need of the hour is a mindset change and concerted efforts at empowering women. Law enforcement agencies must also play an active role in bringing to book the perpetrators so that women and girls feel more confident about speaking out about such harassment. Usha Verma,ChandigarhIncrease security at vulnerable spotsWomen’s safety is of paramount importance in the tricity, but still every now and then, we hear about instances of harassment on the city’s streets. It is high time that we educate the city’s youth. NGOs and social organisations can play a great role in educating the youth on women’s safety. At the same time, authorities must create awareness on women’s safety through ads and in newspaper on women safety & security. High-definition CCTV cameras should be installed at vulnerable isolated points for reining in on such criminals. Col TBS Bedi, MohaliDon’t let culprits go scot-freeThough it may not be possible to wipe out anti-social elements from the society, it depends on the law-enforcement agencies, how they are controlled. Police must keep a vigilant eye on all vulnerable spots in the city and lay out an effective plan to nab the perpetrators and bring them to book. Police personnel in plain clothes can also go a long way in ensuring that such miscreants can’t get away after a crime. The culprits, no matter how influential, should not be spared at any cost.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliGirls, raise your voiceIt is the laxity of the judicial system that is to be blamed for the emboldening stalkers and molesters. Women sometimes fear to go out in public spaces for fear of such harassment. Worse still, women don’t even feel safe to go report to the police. The reason for this is not just the unfriendly and rude behaviour of cops, but also the fact that the cases tend to linger on, draining the complainants of time, money and energy. The need of the hour is speedy disposal of such cases and also sensitive police force. Last but not the least, we need to break the stigma and empower women to speak up. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliEffective women’s helplinesChandigarh is widely renowned as a safe city but recent instances of crimes against women have rattled this belief. To make the city safe for women, police should patrol external as well as internal roads 24/7. Hidden CCTV cameras should be installed on city roads. Police helpline should be made more effective. Only vigilant cops should be recruited by experienced recruiters. There should be security in markets, hotels and restaurants. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhFast, effective process to catch culpritsThe man who molested the UK diplomat was found to have molested several other women, but none came forward. Had he been caught and put behind bars after the first offence, he could not have done it to other women. To ensure women don’t hesitate to approach the police when they face harassment, we need more women-only police stations. Introduction of special women-only buses to educational institutions, deployment of more women constables in plain clothes at public places, awareness drives to ensure sexual harassment panels in all organisations, more CCTV cameras at public places, easy access to the IT cell to register complaints pertaining to growing social media and IT-based crimes are the need of the hour. Fast and effective processes to catch men harassing women in public places, are also needed.Vijay Malia, Chandigarh Girls, fight backUnfortunately, we live in a society where all women can recount of some horrific instance of sexual harassment that occurred at some point in their life. While police and administration can take steps such as ensuring well-lit road, CCTV cameras and more boots on the ground, women cannot be fully dependent on law-enforcement. They need to train themselves to be stronger and able to defend themselves. Little steps like, carrying a pepper spray, etc can help if one finds oneself in an unsafe place. Self-defense classes too can prove beneficial. Ishita Nara, via emailEmpower women to raise their voiceThe recent case of molestation of a UK diplomat in Sector 10 is a matter of grave concern. To make Tricity safer, we need frequent police patrolling, installation of more CCTVs, strict law enforcement so that no one can dare to behave in such a way. Women should be made aware of their rights and be encouraged to raise their voice against such incidents. Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhInstil fear in sexual offenders It is unfortunate that sexual harassment is so prevalent in our world that every woman has faced it at some point in her life. We should no longer turn a blind eye to it and must take active measures to make public spaces safer for women. For starters, we need functional streetlights and closed-circuit television cameras in all corners of the city to instill a sense of fear in anti-social elements. Police need to intensify patrolling in crime-prone spots as well as other areas. Women of all age-groups must undergo self-defense training. And lastly, we need harsher punishment against such crimes.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurCollective action requiredTo make cities safer for women, a collective action by authorities and citizens is required. Police patrolling must be intensified and the public must be encouraged to intervene when they see women being harassed. A timely response can stop sexual perpetrators on their tracks.Subhash Nagpal, ZirakpurRequire meaningful social changeEvery day, we hear about women being molested, kidnapped, raped and killed. The molestation of a UK diplomat in Chandigarh is yet another blot on the city claim of being a safe city. In the absence of meaningful social change, measures such as special banks for women, etc are mere tokenism. The civil society cannot escape its responsibility of fostering genuine gender justice. No amount of alteration in the legal system will deliver unless it is supported by the sanction of society.SK Khosla, ChandigarhSafety audit of public spacesThe authorities must carry out a urgent audit of women’s safety parameters in public spaces and taking corrective steps, such as better vigil, CCTV surveillance and faster crime detection mechanism. To instil fear in the minds of culprits, harsher laws are required.Subhash Chugh, via emailPrompt police action Even though sexual harassment is so prevalent, police aren’t proactive and in some cases, action is not taken for years on. In the case of the diplomat, Chandigarh police has shown its efficiency and promptness. The same attitude must be shown even when the victim isn’t from an influential background. RK Garg, ChandigarhBreak the stigmaProlonged legal procedures and public stigma discourages women from coming forward to file complaint of sexual harassment. Fast-track courts and harsher punishments for culprits can help change that to a large extent. Apart from that we also need to change the mindset of our youth and teach them to respect women.Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhNeed more boots on the groundCrimes against women in Chandigarh’s public spaces highlight the misplaced priorities of the UT police. It puts too much emphasis on penalising erring motorists rather than reining in hooliganism and street crime. There is no sensitisation of any sort. Also, huge contingents by way of gypsy escorts are deployed for the top police brass/administration. That should be drastically pruned to deploy more cops on the beat system. Had it not been for a British envoy, her molestation would have gone unnoticed as another stray routine incident. Nor would the police have bothered to register an FIR. It is a wake-up call for the Chandigarh Police to live up to its ‘we care for you’ motto.Ranjit Malhotra, ChandigarhExpert take Safe spacesWomen’s helpline numbers should be made more visible, streets should be well lit and the city should have a few spots where female cops are stationed 24/7 so women know where to turn for help.Varnika Kundu, Panchkula-based disc jockey AwarenessNeed awareness campaigns at schools, colleges and universities to tell women about helpline numbers and also encourage them to immediately come forward and inform the police about any harassment they face. Manvir Singh Bajwa, DSP, crimes against women, Mohali SensitisationWe need to bring more awareness and be cautious of our surroundings. At the same time, we need to have more women cells, policing and vigilance. As a sociologist, I can say that more counselling is required at the family and society levels for gender sensitisation. Rani Mehta, head department of sociology, Panjab UniversitySelf-defenceIt should be a collective approach of both citizens and police. Women should make themselves mentally and physically fit for self-defence. CCTV coverage needs to be increased and there should be immediate response to distress calls on helpline numbers. Mamta Sodha, ACP, PanchkulaPatrolling The Cheetah squad, apart from routine PCR vehicles, has been deployed to patrol vulnerable areas. We also provide pick-and-drop facilities for women commuting during night hours.

16-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala: 10 dairies yet to be shifted out of residential areas, says MC||At least 10 dairies out of 250 under the municipal corporation (MC) limits are yet to be shifted to designated dairy complexes after the deadline got over on Thursday, executive officer (EO) of the civic body, Jarnail Singh said on Friday. “In a special drive carried out on Thursday, we were able to shift animals from eight out of 18 dairies left to the dairy complexes in Kanwala and Katholi villages, as the owners didn’t act even after being issued notices. Another such drive will be carried out, if required, to shift the 10 dairies,” he said. Fulfilling this long-pending proposal, MC has been trying to shift “illegal dairies” out of the residential areas to these two dairy complexes to minimise sanitation issues in its jurisdiction. However, officials had to face severe opposition from owners, who have pointed out economic hardship and time lag between the first production of milk and its delivery, among other issues. A few also expressed helplessness due to a large number of animals and were given more time to shift. “Some of them highlighted distance issues due to which their customers might shift to other sources. But we’ve told them that keeping animals in residential areas is illegal,” the EO said. MC chief Dhirendra Khadgata said those who had shifted should ensure that the animal waste was treated at the designated place and cattle were kept leashed inside the complex. “Action will be taken against those who will be found running a dairy illegally or disposing of animal dung in the MC area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-10-dairies-yet-to-be-shifted-out-of-residential-areas-says-mc-101634332860651.html
16-10-2021||Mumbai||Hindutva faces threat from ‘neo-Hindus’, says Uddhav||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday launched a scathing attack on his former ally Bharatiya Janata Party, saying that Hindutva faced threat not from outsiders but from “neo-Hindus” and “those who climbed the ladder of power”. The Shiv Sena chief also accused the BJP of not understanding either VD Savarkar or Mahatma Gandhi.“I believe that Hindutva is now under threat. Those who have used the ladder of Hindutva can now use the strategy of the British of divide and rule. They will create a divide between Marathis and non-Marathis. They will erect a wall between the Marathas and other communities and continue to enjoy the power in the Centre. Marathi people must unite by forgetting their differences. With this unity, another unity is needed. The division between Marathis and non-Marathis should be buried,” the Shiv Sena chief said during his address at the annual Dussehra rally in Mumbai.Accusing the BJP of making no contribution to the freedom struggle, Thackeray said: “You (the BJP) have not understood Savarkar or Gandhi....When you have no contribution (to freedom struggle), what right you have to speak about Gandhi or Savarkar?”The Maharashtra chief minister’s comments came days after defence minister Rajnath Singh stirred up a row by claiming that Savarkar filed mercy petition with the British on the suggestion of Gandhi.On Friday, Union home minister Amit Shah hit out at those questioning the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue’s commitment to the freedom struggle, saying that Savarkar’s patriotism and bravery cannot be questioned.During the event, Thackeray also accused the Centre of interfering in the state’s day-to-day affairs, saying that it “cannot happen and can’t be tolerated”.“Babasaheb Ambedkar firmly said that like the Centre, the States too, have sovereign rights. If the Centre interferes in the working of the State, it will be unconstitutional. You can see this [intereference], right?” he asked.“I want the opinions of intellectuals and constitutional experts on this issue. Let there be an open discussion over this. After studying the Constitution, if it comes to light that the Centre is above us (States), then let it be so. But if Constitution has given us sovereign rights as the Centre, then the Centre’s daily interference cannot happen and cannot be tolerated. Now the time has come for all the States in the country to decide on this,” he added.The Sena chief also alleged misuse of central agencies to defame the Maharashtra government. “A picture is painted that the drugs business is booming only in Maharashtra. It is not so that drugs are caught only in Maharashtra. The court has directed [officials] to probe the Mundra port where drugs worth crores of rupees were found. Where is this Mundra port? You merely find a pinch of Ganja, while my police [force] busted drugs worth ₹150 crore. You catch a celebrity and beat drums about it. But my police has busted drug [network] and nobody talks about it,” he said.Reacting to Uddhav’s statements, state Bharatiya Janata Party chief Chandrakant Patil said, “We thought that Maharashtra CM will speak on the issues of the state including crimes against women, the issues of farmers. But he didn’t speak in these issues...,”The state BJP chief said Thackeray’s speech was nothing but targetting BJP and the central government.“When did Shiv Sena fight for Hindutva? For how many years will you use one line by Balasaheb Thackeray on Babri Masjid. He has said that if nobody is taking responsibility of the demolition then Shiv Sena will take it. But was one Shiv Sainik present there?” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hindutva-faces-threat-from-neo-hindus-says-uddhav-101634332396332.html
16-10-2021||Chandigarh||Security tightened, Ravana also frisked at Dussehra Melas in Ludhiana||With the police tightening security across the city, not even the demon king, Ravana, who was the guest of honour for the day, was allowed to take his place at different Dussehra fairs without a thorough frisking on Friday. Despite the enhanced security, pickpockets had a heyday as several people attending the jam-packed fairs reported missing wallets and mobile phones, particularly at the Daresi and Upkar Nagar grounds. Commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said foolproof security had been put in place across the city. Three gazetted officers were on security duty since 6 am and three high-ranking officers, including the assistant commissioner of police (ACP) and joint commissioner of police, were deputed at the three main Dussehra fairs at Daresi, Jamalpur and Rajguru Nagar, while one gazetted officer each was present at other locations. Around 2,000 police personnel were deputed across the 23 locations where Ravana effigies were burnt, while dog squads and anti-sabotage teams carried out thorough inspections. Police control room motorcycle squads and station house officers were also asked to keep vigil in their respective areas. The traffic police had a tough time regulating the heavy flow of vehicles. The police had barricaded the roads in the afternoon and did not allow any heavy vehicles to enter. Three-wheelers and four wheelers heading toward Daresi from Dr BL Kapoor Memorial hospital were stopped and even two-wheelers were not allowed to pass in the evening. A public parking was set up at the Dr BL Kapoor Memorial Hospital and a multilevel parking was made functional at the municipal corporation.Traffic was diverted from Old Sabji Mandi near Dr BL Kapoor Memorial Hospital, Malganj Chowk, Books Market Road, Ved Mandir Chowk, T-Point Kila Mohalla, Shivpuri Road and Ghada Bhan Chowk to avoid jams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/security-tightened-ravana-also-frisked-at-dussehra-melas-in-ludhiana-101634332561518.html

She finished second. Vani Kapoor tripped to one-over 73 and was fourth, while Jahanvi Bakshi (68) was third.Winning her first title in 2021, Amandeep finished with a superb nine-under 207, while Avani was six-under 210 and Jahanvi was four-under 212. Vani also had an under-par total of one-under 215.Amandeep, who gained tremendously by competing in Europe over the last few months, had started the week with 4-under 68 before slipping on the second day with 74.In the final round, she fell back by two shots after the first hole as she bogeyed the first and playing partner and overnight co-leader, Avani had a birdie on the same hole.Soon after Amandeep found her form as she birdied second, fourth, sixth and seventh to turn in 3-under 33. Avani dropped a shot on fourth where Amandeep had a birdie for a two-shot swing.That helped Amandeep go-ahead by one. Like Amandeep, Avani also birdied the sixth and seventh, but was still one behind at the turn.On the back nine, Amandeep drove off on her own with three birdies in a row from 11th to 13th, while Avani had gains only on 13th. Both birdied the 16th, but with two holes left and three shots clear, Amandeep made no mistake and Avani was unable to find any more birdies.The win also cemented Amandeep’s place on top of the Hero Order of Merit, which she was already leading.City’s Harendra finishes tied-thirdChandigarh Khalin Joshi’s final round of three-under 67 proved good enough for him to turn the tables on nearest rival and fellow Bengalurean M Dharma and emerge victorious at the ₹40-lakh Jaipur Open 2021 presented by the Rajasthan Tourism being played at the par-70 Rambagh Golf Club (RGC).

16-10-2021||Delhi||Street vendor count inflated: Councillors||The recently concluded survey of street vendors across Delhi has come under criticism from several municipal councillors of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation who claimed that the survey has inflated the number of street vendors under its jurisdiction.The town vending committees have identified 71,347 street vendors in Delhi, out of which 27,819 were identified in the north corporation areas.Ajay Sharma, standing committee member and AAP councillor from Mukundpur, alleged that vendors had been placed temporarily at some sites to count them in the survey. “More than 25 street vendors were placed opposite my office just for a few days and they were counted as legal street vendors. I had raised the matter with the zone officials but no action was taken. Large scale corruption is taking place through these surveys,” he alleged.The issue led to ruckus during the North MCD standing committee meeting on Wednesday when a few physically challenged street vendors, accompanied by Congress councillor Poonam Bagri, forcefully entered the committee room in the civic centre to register their protest, following which proceedings were suspended for 10 minutes. The standing committee has ordered a probe in the matter and announced a re-survey in Jahangirpuri ward, where the survey has allegedly identified an abnormally high number of street vendors.The Delhi government ordered the town vending committees to carry out a survey to identify all street vendors in the Capital in 2015, in line with the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The survey, which aims at identifying eligible street vendors and give them a legitimate status, began in January this year and concluded on September 30.The town vending committee is headed by the zonal deputy commissioner and has street vendors as its members. Many other councillors also agreed with irregularities in the survey.Satnam Singh, deputy commissioner of Civil Lines zone, said that the hawkers had appeared a few days before the survey. “We later removed them with the help of local police,” he said.Singh said that of the 2,861 vendors identified in the 18 wards under Civil Lines zone, 757 vendors (over 26%) were counted from Jahangirpuri ward. “A re-survey will be carried out to detect fake tehbazaris and a committee has been formed to investigate if the vendors are fake. At some places, the committee has found no vendor at all,” he added.The standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain directed immediate removal of illegal vendors after proper investigation in the matter.According to the North MCD report, civic body teams identified 5,912 vendors in City Sadar-Paharganj zone, 4,018 in Karol Bagh, 2,861 in Civil Lines zone, 5,334 in Keshav Puram zone, 5,080 in Rohini and 4,614 in Narela zone.Similarly, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has identified 8,140 street vendors in the Central zone, 7,789 in South zone, 4,350 in West zone and 3,672 in Najafgarh.National Association of Street Vendors of India had earlier stated that the survey had undercounted the street vendors, claiming that over 50% eligible vendors were left out.Arvind Singh, national coordinator of NASVI, said, “The actual number of street vendors in the city is at least 2 lakh... around 20% of street vendors left the city during the lockdowns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/street-vendor-count-inflatedcouncillors-101634330406784.html

Although the administration had limited the gatherings to up to 50% of the capacity of the outdoor venue, thousands of people could be seen jostling without masks at fairs, which were organised at 23 locations across the city. The 100ft Ravana effigy at the Daresi Ground was a major attraction being the tallest in the region and drew a large crowd. People could be spotted taking selfies with the majestic demon king and the chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ rang as the effigy, which symbolises the victory of good over evil, went up in flames. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, MLA Surinder Dawar, and senior deputy mayor Sam Sundar Malhotra among others prominent residents attended the Dussehra fair at Daresi. However, they too seen without masks, despite asking the people to remain vigilant and follow Covid appropriate measures. The police also turned a blind-eye to violations. Major events were also organised at Giaspura, the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) Ground on Chandigarh Road, Upkar Nagar, and Dugri, with celebrations also seen at Aggar Nagar, Rajguru Nagar, Sarabha Nagar Block-I, and Tuition Market in Model Town Extension among other areas. With thousands thronging to the fairs, the police had a tough time controlling the crowds both inside and outside the grounds.Pandemic at its nadir, says committee member Kamal Bassi, a member of the Shri Ram Lila Committee, Daresi, said a fair was being held at Daresi for over a century. “Mega Dussehra celebrations were held this year with the pandemic finally at its nadir. The crowd was ecstatic as last year only a limited crowd was able to witness Ravana Dehan. An attendee, Harpreet Singh, a resident of Model Town Extension, said, “My daughter and son were excited to watch the Ravana effigy burn as they had missed the event last year due to Covid restrictions. With cases at an all-time low, we decided to take the kids to the fair, where they had lots of fun. The festivity helped dispel the negativity, which had engulfed us during the pandemic.” Meanwhile, a heavy rush was seen in markets, especially those situated around the Daresi Ground in the old city area, Dugri, and Model Town. Large crowds were seen around sweet shops as people lined up for jalebi and samosas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dussehra-crowds-pour-in-to-see-ravana-go-up-in-flames-in-ludhiana-101634330522739.html

We came to know about the murders around 9.30pm when my maternal uncle called me over phone saying the bodies were lying in the fields of Pawanpreet,” Jagdeep said. Pawanpreet nursed a grudge against them since the land they have leased was earlier with him, the complainant claimed. The police said after stabbing the victims, Pawanpreet called Pal Singh’s in-laws and told them that he has stabbed the two in rage.

A video on social media by spectators clearly shows the inhuman side of these union leaders. This is not Afghanistan; we are a democracy and believe in equal rights for human beings irrespective of caste, creed and religion,” he said. Sharma said the police should investigate the matter thoroughly so that the guilty can be punished. Badal Sr demands impartial probe Former Punjab chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch Parkash Singh Badal on Friday condemned the lynching of a man at Kundli border and sought an impartial probe into the heinous crime. “In a civilised society, there is no place either for heinous acts of sacrilege of holy scriptures or for barbaric violence,” he said in a statement here. “Allegations that the entire sequence of events is a part of a deep-rooted conspiracy to sabotage the long, peaceful and democratic struggle of farmers against the three laws also need a thorough, fair and impartial probe,” Badal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmer-unions-to-blame-for-dalit-s-murder-at-kundli-border-ashwani-sharma-101634330040567.html

The Centre’s move, he said, would weaken the already endangered federal structure of the country and is a blow to the dignity of Punjabis. In a press release, the senior Akali leader said, “If we don’t stop fighting each other over petty stakes, the Centre will take advantage of our weaknesses. We will only repent it later.” It was unfortunate that the Union government has been usurping the rights of the states even on subjects which fall on the states’ list in the Constitution, he rued. “The Centre last year legislated three laws on agriculture which again is a state subject. Now, with this move on the BSF deployment, they have encroacher upon another state subject of law and order,” he added, The Akali leader appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revoke the three “black” farm laws and withdraw the orders on BSF deployment in 50-kilometres from the border area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/join-hands-to-oppose-centre-s-bid-to-turn-punjab-into-union-territory-ex-cm-badal-to-political-parties-101634329800542.html
16-10-2021||Chandigarh||SKM smells conspiracy in Kundli border lynching, so do victim’s kin||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Friday condemned the lynching of a 35-year-old man from Cheema Khurd village in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district at a farmers’ protest site at Kundli on the Delhi-Haryana border and claimed that there could be a conspiracy behind the incident. Family members of the victim, Lakhbir Singh, too, voiced similar views, expressing surprise at his presence at the Delhi border. Lakhbir, a scheduled caste labourer, was lynched, his hand chopped off and the body tied to a metal barricade at a farmers’ protest venue at Kundli. In a video clip circulating on social media platforms, some Nihangs are seen standing as Lakhbir lies on the ground in a pool of blood with his chopped off left hand lying next to him. The Nihangs — a Sikh order, distinguished by their blue robes — are heard in the clip saying the man has been punished for desecrating a holy book of the Sikhs. The umbrella body of 40 farm unions spearheading the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three agricultural laws also demanded a thorough probe into the matter and said those responsible should be brought to book. The body alleged that a religious colour is being given to their movement. “We are all very saddened at what happened. The SKM is fighting against the three farm laws. This (incident) could be a conspiracy. We condemn the incident in the strongest words,” said Jagjit Singh Dallewal, a farmer leader from the organisation. Dallewal said they have learnt that Lakhbir had been staying with the Nihang Sikhs, and tried to steal the Sarbloh Granth, a holy book of the Sikhs. “We condemn disrespecting of any religion. We also condemn the reaction (killing),” he said. The SKM claimed that the killing had nothing to do with the farmers’ movement, which is not a religious one. The farmers’ movement is for the rights of farmers and against the three farm laws, the body said. Lakhbir was allegedly a drug addict and stayed with his widowed sister Raj Kaur at the house of their foster parents, both dead now, at Cheema village. Lakhbir’s wife Jaspreet Kaur has been living at her maternal home with the couple’s three daughters for the last five years. “Around a week ago, Lakhbir took ₹50 from his sister on the pretext of going to the village’s grain market for labour work, but he never returned. He couldn’t have gone to Delhi alone. He was taken there by someone. So far, we don’t know who was behind it, but he couldn’t have committed sacrilege,” said Lakhbir’s brother-in-law (wife’s brother) Sukhchain Singh. He said, “Lakhbir had started taking drugs three to four years after his marriage, but he never fought with anyone in the village. We tried to keep him away from drugs, but to no avail.” Residents of Cheema Khurd suspect Lakhbir may have been “manipulated” to desecrate the scripture. “We sent him to drug de-addiction centre several times, but to no avail,” said Awan Kumar, the village head. Tarn Taran deputy superintendent of police Sucha Singh Ball said Lakhbir had no criminal background, but he was an alcoholic. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harvinder Singh Virk said preliminary investigation suggests that the victim was not seen in the village after October 10. “We are still verifying to know if he went to the Delhi border own his own, or if he was taken there by someone,” he said.

16-10-2021||Chandigarh||FCI goes slow on paddy procurement in Punjab, officials flag issue with central agency||The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has procured only 0.7% (12,478 tonnes) of its allocated 5% share (90,000 tonnes) of paddy in Punjab during the ongoing kharif marketing season against the last year’s figure of 52,800 tonnes till the corresponding date, officials familiar with the matter said. The state food and civil supplies department has asked the central agency, which drives public distribution across the country, to speed up the procurement process. Senior department officials said they have taken up the matter with the corporation management and even shot off a demi-official letter in this regard. The department said that of the 136 mandis the FCI was allocated in all 23 districts, the agency has entered only 33 mandis in nine districts. Officials in the rest of 103 mandis across 14 districts are waiting for the FCI staff to start purchase. “Historically speaking, the FCI procures less than its allocated share but this time what they have purchased so far is negligible. If they have any problem they should take up with the issue with the department concerned or should not have accepted the allocation in the first place,” said state government official. The FCI procures 10-15% of total wheat produce in Punjab but it shies away from purchasing its share of paddy as the percentage of grain loss in case of rice is higher. “The FCI should actually support the state government in this massive operation. The state has fulfilled all norms mandated by the corporation,” said state food and supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. FCI general manager incharge of Punjab Arshdeep Thind said the corporation staff was out in the field. “We are making purchases in mandis allocated to us if paddy has arrived there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fci-goes-slow-on-paddy-procurement-in-punjab-officials-flag-issue-with-central-agency-101634329444918.html

They said that the number will increase after the third week of October. Punjab has already deputed 8,000 nodal officers, apart from asking deputy commissioners to monitor farm fires.

16-10-2021||Mumbai||1 more leopard trapped in Aarey, but target animal continues to elude forest dept||The forest department trapped another sub-adult female leopard in a cage near Mumbai’s Aarey Colony’s dairy unit number 13 in the early hours on Friday, but later confirmed that the individual is not the same as the one responsible for the recent spate of attacks on humans. Department officials said the animal, which was moved to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) for examination, will be released back into her natural habitat.“On Friday early morning, a female leopard got trapped in one of the trap cages at Aarey Milk colony. The rosette pattern of the trapped animal was matched with the camera trap picture of the suspected leopard that we have. The animal that was trapped is not the suspected animal and we are releasing her in the natural habitat. The efforts to trap the suspected leopard will continue,” said Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Maharashtra.The forest department had installed a fifth cage trap near dairy unit number 13 on the night of October 8, where a 14-year-old boy was attacked by a female, sub-adult female leopard earlier in the day. Since August 31, eight people in Aarey Colony, including a 68-year-old woman and a four-year-old child, have sustained injuries after the leopard charged at them.A sub-adult female leopard aged between one-and-a-half and two years was previously captured in the early hours of October 1, but was later identified to be a different individual than the female behind the recent attacks, in what are the first signs of human-leopard conflict in the region since 2017. That leopard has since remained in the forest department’s custody.Limaye’s office has also given permission to tranquilise the problem leopardess, if necessary, though experts and officials both maintained that this option will be exercised only as a last resort as darting leopards is significantly more complicated than tranquilising other big cats. “We will continue to monitor footage from our camera traps and enforce protection camps and social messaging inside Aarey Colony. Leopards are equal residents of the forest and our priority is safety of both the animal and humans,” said Girija Desai, assistant conservator of forests (Thane).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1-more-leopard-trapped-in-aarey-but-target-animal-continues-to-elude-forest-dept-101634326080193.html

They not only raided the gurdwara but also the entire premises of the community school attached next to the shrine,” he said.Chandok said private security guards of the gurdwara initially prevented them from entering but they were also threatened with dire consequences and also manhandled.“They have also simultaneously raided the erstwhile residence and office of (former) MP Narinder Singh Khalsa located adjacent to the gurdwara. The community has expressed serious concerns and fearing danger to their lives. Around 20 members of the community were present inside the gurdwara,” he said. “The incumbent regime in Afghanistan should ensure compliance with the UN Charter and well-being of minorities living there. This is a second incident,” he said.Earlier this month, Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul was vandalised by Taliban fighters, according to reports.

16-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Raids on an ‘influential family of Maharashtra’ reveal unaccounted income of ₹184cr’||The Income-Tax (I-T) department that had recently carried out massive search and seizure operations at 70 premises of two real estate business groups of Mumbai and certain individuals and entities linked to a politician’s family, has found highly incriminating documents, evidencing unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore. These raids were conducted at Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa and Jaipur. While disclosing the details on Friday, the I-T department said that suspicious flow of funds has taken place with the involvement of an “influential family of Maharashtra”. Coincidentally, the tax department had recently carried out high-scale search operations at multiple places in Maharashtra and Goa, including at the residences of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s three sisters and son. Pawar had then termed the agency’s action as harassment and also said that the I-T department is being misused against their family for political reasons.The department’s statement has, however, not named any particular politician, individual or entity.According to the tax department, its search operations commenced simultaneously in three states on October 7. The evidence gathered during the searches revealed several prima-facie unaccounted for and benami transactions. Incriminating documents, evidencing unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore of the two groups have been found.The agency said that the search action has led to identification of transactions by these business groups with a web of companies which, prima facie, appear to be suspicious.“A preliminary analysis of the flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious methods like introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes, etc,” agency’s statement stated.The funds, introduced in a dubious manner, have been utilised for acquisition of various assets such as an office building at a prime locality in Mumbai, a flat in a posh locality at Delhi, a resort in Goa, agricultural lands in Maharashtra and investments in sugar mills. The book value of these assets aggregates to about ₹170 crore, stated Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of I-T (media and technical policy) and official spokesperson, Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT).During the five-day long search operations, unaccounted cash of ₹2.13 crore and jewellery of ₹4.32 crore have been seized, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raids-on-an-influential-family-of-maharashtra-reveal-unaccounted-income-of-184cr-101634325660431.html

To avoid any untoward incident, it was decided to deploy four more companies of central forces kept as reserve from the central paramilitary forces that the Centre has deputed to deal with the farmers’ agitation.“It is a disturbing development. See the brutality with which this man was killed…and then, the inhuman way videos were recorded crossing all limits,” said an officer refusing to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-companies-of-central-forces-deployed-khattar-holds-high-level-meeting-101634324460854.html
16-10-2021||Chandigarh||HC rules against ‘uprooting’ minor from family atmosphere to natural guardian||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed the plea of a father whose child was with his in-laws after the death of his wife.“Uprooting a child from a family atmosphere where he has been living for more than one year, at a tender age, will not be in his best interest. This is despite the fact that the petitioner is the father and natural guardian of the child after death of the mother,” the bench of justice Suvir Sehgal observed while dismissing a habeas corpus plea of the father.The court was dealing with the plea filed by a Sonepat resident, who had approached court in February this year seeking his four-year-old son’s custody. After differences between the couple, the woman had shifted to her parents’ home in Rohtak in July 2020 with her son. She died in December 2020 due to cardiac arrest.“Welfare of the child is of paramount consideration and it is the bounden duty of the court to ensure that the child lives in a healthy and congenial atmosphere,” the court said.“Petitioner (father) has failed to bring any material on record to show as to how he intends to take care of the child, who by now is more than four-years-old and is school-going. On the other hand, the private respondents are living in a joint family setup,” the court said, taking note of submissions from family of the minor’s mother that the child’s grandparents are looking after him. The child’s grandfather is a retired government servant and on pension. It was also stated that unmarried aunt and maternal uncles of the child are also there to take care of him.It came to light that the woman’s family is seeking lawful guardianship and permanent custody of the child under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, in family court.The woman’s parents had told court that their daughter, a teacher in Ambala, was harassed by the family of her husband.In October 2019, she had started living separately and in July 2020, she moved in with them along with her son. The husband never visited his wife and son. In fact, his attitude towards them was that of “aloofness and he did not show any inclination to keep the child with him”. After death of the woman, he did not even perform the last rites, they said.The court said it has been established that the petitioner’s wife and son lived separately and to his allegations that the son was snatched when he had gone to attend rituals after the death of his wife turned out to be mere “bald assertion” as the husband, who is a lawyer by profession, did not even file a complaint about it, except for filing a petition, three months later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-rules-against-uprooting-minor-from-family-atmosphere-to-natural-guardian-101634324347391.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: AIIMS doctor rapes colleague in his Hauz Khas house, on run||A senior resident doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) allegedly spiked his colleague’s drink and raped her at his house in Hauz Khas last month, Delhi Police said on Friday.The accused is at large, and searches are on across the city to trace him, they added.According to Benita Mary Jaiker, deputy commissioner of police (south), the woman called the police control room on Monday to report that she was sexually assaulted, and that she was getting a medical examination at AIIMS.“This distress call was marked to the Hauz Khas police station. A team was then sent to the hospital, where the woman was present. The victim, who is a doctor at AIIMS, told police that, on September 26, one of her senior doctors raped her at his house, where she had gone to celebrate a colleague’s birthday,” said Jaiker.Police have registered a case under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 377 (unnatural offences) of the Indian Penal Code at Hauz Khas.“The suspect is on the run. We have started technical surveillance and are making efforts to nab the accused,” Jaiker added.The man has been missing from work since September 27, said the police.A senior police officer said a medical examination confirmed the woman was raped.HT approached the AIIMS communications division for a formal response, but there was none till press time.When contacted, a member of the resident doctors’ association at AIIMS, who asked not to be named, said that the woman did not approach them, and that the matter was being handled only by the police. “Normally, the association is approached. But in this case the matter is so sensitive that the aggrieved person decided to approach the police directly, and that was the right thing to do as the police will do a better job of investigating a serious case like this,” said the person cited above.An officer aware of the matter, who asked not to be named, said the woman told police that there were seven people at her senior colleague’s house during the party. Police have recorded the statements of all others.“The party ended late and she had to stay back. The accused also advised her to stay back. The woman told us that he spiked her drinks and then raped her. She said that the man told her that she should not tell the police or anyone else about the incident. After several days, she spoke to her friends and gathered the strength to file a police complaint,” said one of the officers involved in the investigation.The accused has been missing from work since September 27.As part of the probe, police also recorded the woman’s statement before a judge. Such a statement, under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), is admissible as evidence during a trial.Between January 1 and August 15 this year, according to police data, Delhi registered 1,231 cases of rape -- up from 908 during the same period last year. At about 1,500-2,200 rape cases reported every year, Delhi is one of the most unsafe cities for women across the country.The police’s analysis of rape cases in the city last year showed that of the 1,699 rapes last year, the alleged rapist in at least 2% of the incidents was a colleague or senior colleague. In 1.77% cases, the alleged rapist was a stranger. In over 60% cases, the alleged rapist was a neighbour, partner, family member or friend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-aiims-doctor-rapes-colleague-in-his-hauz-khas-house-on-run-101634324221109.html

We were relieved that we were back to offline classes and now CBSE has announced dates of first term exams,” she said.“Our first term exams will be an evaluation of our performance and will reveal Covid and post-Covid impact on students’ education. It is good to conduct first term exams as everyone has fear that a third wave might hit the country,” she added.Aman Malik, a non-medical student, said his studies were affected a lot in the last 15 months and he faced poor connectivity issues during online classes.“If schools had not been resumed for physical classes, I won’t be able to get good marks. Offline classes are the best way of teaching. We got less time to revise the syllabus but it is good that our performance will be reviewed. The pandemic has adversely affected our studies and online education has created a digital divide between us and students studying in big cities,” he added.Vajir Arya, principal of Arya Senior Secondary School in Bhiwani, said they have covered the entire syllabus of Classes 10 and 12 for the first term exams.“Online education has not benefited students and their results might have worsened if the offline classes had not been resumed,” Aryan said.“Most students hailing from rural and semi-urban areas faced poor internet connectivity issues and teachers lacked in adapting to online mode. Most parents could not afford to purchase separate phones for their children. We are happy that CBSE has decided to conduct exams in two terms,” he added.The time period for the first term exam will be 90 minutes from 11.30AM to 1PM and the OMR sheets are to be submitted in the exam control room by 1.30PM. CBSE has asked schools to evaluate the OMR sheets between 01.30PM to 5PM and submit the sheets to CBSE by 5PM the same evening.Marks of first term will be considered while declaring results of second term in March-April. No students will be declared pass, fail or compartment after the first term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cbse-class-10-12-students-give-mixed-response-to-exams-being-held-in-two-terms-101634324220089.html

16-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra allows constables to be promoted as police sub-inspectors||In a major decision, the Maharashtra government has paved the way for constables to be promoted as police sub-inspectors (PSI). The proposal, which was approved by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, would prove beneficial for 45,000 constables. It will also provide an adequate number of investigation officers in the force, officials said.To make the promotions possible, the state has also abolished the position of police naik, which will ensure that constables get promoted till PSI rank before retirement. “From now onwards, police constables will directly be promoted to the post of head constables instead of police naik. These head constables will be promoted to assistant sub-inspector (ASI) after completing 20 years of service. After completion of 30 years of service, they will become eligible for the post of PSI. The restructuring of the organisation will lead to progressive transformation,” said Sanjay Pandey, director general of police (DGP).In the existing system, a constable gets promoted as police naik after 10 years of service and as a head constable after 20 years of service. They get promoted as ASI after more than 30 years of service. This is for the first time that constables will be able to get PSI-rank promotions, said a senior official from state home department.Earlier, ASI could be promoted to PSI rank after clearing a promotional examination, which also has been abolished. ASI-rank officers will be promoted for PSI positions on the basis of service seniority, the officials said.In the force, especially in rural areas, head constables are allowed to investigate some cases. The new decision will recharge the batteries of the investigating wing as it will help in providing more head constables and ASIs at early stages of their career to become investigating officers. This will make the performance of the force more efficient, he said.The timely and speedy promotion will motivate the police personnel to perform their duties conscientiously, DGP said.The decision will increase the existing number of head constables from 37,861 to 51,210 and ASI will be increased to 17,071 from 15,270. Each police station will get 13 additional head constables, stated a release issued by the chief minister office (CMO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-allows-constables-to-be-promoted-as-police-subinspectors-101634324160167.html

Organisers said that the government allowed public celebrations this time, but with certain restrictions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.So much so, that even the heights of the effigies of Ravan, Kumbhakarna and Meghnad were considerably reduced.“Until 2019, we prepared effigies that were about 80 feet tall. Due to the pandemic, no effigy was prepared in 2020. This year, the height of the effigies was reduced to 18-25 feet and no fireworks were used,” said Dilshad Ahmad, a craftsman from Gulaothi who has been preparing effigies for the past week.“This year, festivities were allowed in a restricted manner. I received two orders to prepare effigies for the Ghanta Ghar and Kavi Nagar Ramlilas. Earlier, it took us about a month’s stay at the Ramlila grounds to prepare tall effigies. This year, we arrived here about a week ago. Still, we were able to prepare the effigies in time and erect them on Friday evening for Dussehra,” he added.Meanwhile, Durga Puja festivities ended on a high note with the immersion of the idols of goddess Durga in ponds and designated water bodies across the district.“Immersion was not allowed in the Yamuna river but in temporary ponds created nearby. We permitted 17 different Ramlilas to be staged but did not allow any mela (fair) to be held. Effigies this time were small in size. Zonal magistrates and sector magistrates were deployed to ensure Covid protocols were followed and also ensure peaceful celebrations,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city).Before the immersion on the final day of Durga Puja festivities, women devotees performed the ritual of ‘Sindoor Khela’. Devotees also performed the Dhanuchi dance, a ritual that takes place before the idol of the goddess is immersed in a water body.“The idols were immersed in a temporary pond near the Hindon river. Unlike the previous year, there was more enthusiasm this time as the government allowed public celebrations with certain restrictions,” said Abhijit Roy, founder member of Prantic Cultural Society, Indirapuram.At Sector 10, Raj Nagar, there was no staging of Ramlila unlike the previous years, but organisers recited Ramcharitmanas, an epic composed by the 16th-century bhakti poet Tulsidas, for seven days.“The small event ended with the Dussehra festivities.

16-10-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka legislative panel orders survey of churches, staff||Barely a month since the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government mooted the possibility of bringing in a legislation to check forced religious conversions, the legislative committee on backward classes and minorities welfare has ordered a survey of authorised and unauthorised Churches and their personnel in the state.“We have asked district authorities to furnish a detailed report on the number of authorised and unauthorised churches and Christian priests,” Gulihatti Shekhar, the BJP legislator from Hosadurga and a member of the committee said on Friday, Press Trust of India reported.Shekar could not be reached for comment independently.The committee has ordered a survey on all churches, priests and registering cases against any instances of forcible religious conversions.The statements and actions come at a time when the Bommai-led government appears keen on introducing a bill to stop and punish anyone involved in forced conversions in the BJP-led administration.Shekar had chaired a meeting on Wednesday without the presence of Dinakar Keshav Shetty, the chairman of the committee.Shekar had initiated the conversation within the legislature during the monsoon session between September 13-24 when he made a passionate speech in the Zero Hour.Shekar had said his mother was among those in Chitradurga district who was “brainwashed” by missionaries along with several others. He had claimed that people from marginalised communities and even Muslims were converted or they were slapped with false charges. He said that around 15,000-20,000 people in his constituency were possibly converted.At least five other legislators had made similar claims with Devanand Fulsasingh Chavan of the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), claiming that the missionaries were targeting the vulnerable Banjara community by converting entire “thanda’s” or settlements.Shekar on October 11 had presided over the returning or “ghar wapsi” of at least four families, including his mother in his village. Shekar said those who returned were from the Sudugaadu Sidda community, among the most backward in the state.The developments come at a time when there has been hate crimes reported from across the state and country with fundamentalist groups mobilising support for such causes to “safeguard” their respective religions.Several other states in the country have introduced laws to prevent forced conversions. There have been allegations, especially against large Christian missionaries, who lure weak, oppressed and other people to convert with the promise of monetary and other rewards.Even the legislative assembly speaker, Visweswara Heggade Kageri, said this was an issue that he had spoken about in detail about during the SM Krishna-led Congress government between 1999-2001.“Till now those who lodged complaints against religious conversion were booked but we have asked police to register a case on receiving complaints and conduct a fair inquiry,” Shekhar said.The legislator said that those who leave the community cannot claim double benefit.“Due to these practices, the actual scheduled caste people are not getting the benefits,” Shekhar said, according to PTI.Peter Machado, the Archbishop of Bengaluru on Friday, said the survey would stir up “anti-religious feelings” and was “dangerous”.“We consider this exercise as futile and unnecessary. There is no good that will come out of it, In fact, in the background of the conversion bogey and anti-religious feelings that are being whipped up, it is dangerous to make such surveys. With this our community places of worship as also pastors and sisters will be identified and may be unfairly targeted,” the archbishop said in a statement on Friday.He added that there were already such instances being reported from various parts of Karnataka.“Why is the government interested in making survey of the religious personnel and places of worship only of the Christian Community? We are sad that the Hon’ble Chief Minister, Shri Basavaraj Bommai, whom we regard highly as a broad-minded and enlightened person succumbs to the pressures from fundamentalist groups, who wish to indulge in disturbing the peace, harmony and peaceful co-existence in the society,” he added.The archbishop said that they are “always against forceful, fraudulent and incentivised conversions.”Another person associated with the church said that these were “tactics” to deflect away from the more important issues like price rise and other concerns staring at the country. for a few to torment people.“There has been loss of employment, fuel price loss and this government is on a shaky wicket. After they said that the next election would be fought under Bommai, he has resorted to such gimmicks of the RSS and are disturbing the peace,” a person associated with the Church said, requesting not to be named. “We always take consent from the family, the person has to make an affidavit and we give them time to understand the learnings and its not just dipping someone in water and saying you are Christian,” the person cited above.The church said the Constitution allows freedom of religion.

16-10-2021||Bangalore||BJP eyes balancing formula for bypoll campaign strategy in Karnataka||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said he will start campaigning for the October 30 bypolls on Sunday and possibly end within four days after visiting both constituencies.Bommai said he was likely to spend two days each in Hanagal and Sindgi but added that his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, will start his campaign only after October 20 which appears to be a compromise of sorts in which the incumbent may not want to be overshadowed by the former chief minister who continues to hold significant influence over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka.“On 17th, I will go to Hanagal. After that two days in Sindgi. I have spoken to him (Yediyurappa). After the 20th, he will go to Hanagal and Sindgi,” Bommai said on Friday after meeting his predecessor at the latter’s residence.The statements come at a time when Bommai has been trying hard to emerge out of Yediyurappa’s shadows and try and stamp his own authority on a party and government that appear not to have accepted the former wholeheartedly.Bommai has rushed to Yediyurappa at almost every given opportunity as the latter resides in “Cauvery”, which was meant to be the official residence of the chief minister of Karnataka.Yediyurappa had proposed Bommai’s name as chief minister on July 27, a day after he was forced to step down from the top chair before completing his term.The opposition political parties have already stated that the recent Income Tax (IT) raids on Yediyurappa’s secretary was to “control” the 78-year-old leader.The former chief minister continues to have a significant influence over the dominant Lingayat community and was successful in getting Bommai, from the same community, to the top chair and scuttling any plans of the BJP to move away from caste-based politics and into Hindutva.The BJP is yet to give its approval for Yediyurappa to start his state-wide tour in which he hopes to mobilise support for the party ahead of the Zilla and Taluka panchayat polls as well as the 2023 assembly election. Yediyurappa has taken it upon himself to bring the BJP back to power which, people aware of the developments fear, would lead to the 78-year-old continuing to tighten his grip on the party and not allow Delhi a free-hand to run the state.Leaders like Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and HD Deve Gowda among others have been part and parcel of Karnataka’s deeply caste-influenced society and politics over the decades that has shaped their careers and the discourse in the state. The Lingayats are believed to back Yediyurappa and the BJP, the backward classes, Dalits and minorities are known to side with the Congress. The JD(S) is believed to derive their strength and numbers in the assembly elections with the backing of the Vokkaligas, another dominant community found in majoritative numbers in the Old Mysuru region.BY Vijayendra, Yediyurappa’s son and state BJP vice president, was initially left out of the list of leaders for Hanagal bypolls but was later put back in the list after outcry from his supporters who see the former as the “legitimate heir” of Yediyurappa and the Lingayat community in the state.“He (Bommai) may emerge out of Yediyurappa’s shadow but will not be able to do so from Delhi’s shadow,” said a Bengaluru-based political analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst said Bommai will remain a “puppet” in order to retain his chair and use Delhi to thwart any challenge to his position within the party and leaders who already nurse a feeling of neglect for choosing him (Bommai) for the top chair though he has been in the fold for just 13 years.The analyst added that the recent twitter posts and statements by Bommai, condoning moral policing, defending Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and mooting the idea for a legislation against forcible conversions among others add to the possibility that the chief minister remains firmly under the control of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bjp-eyes-balancing-formula-for-bypoll-campaign-strategy-in-karnataka-101634323560480.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||Dussehra spirit in Delhi amid curbs||Residents of the Capital on Friday marked Dussehra with low-key celebrations in light of Covid-19 protocols in place and a blanket ban on the use of firecrackers in order to mitigate the threat of severe air pollution, which happens every winter.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed festival celebrations this year but prohibited rallies and processions, firecrackers, idol immersions, stalls and shops inside and outside venues and also limited the number of visitors to half the venue capacity.At the Red Fort grounds, the venue of the city’s most prominent Ramlila and Dussehra event, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took part in the ritual of shooting an arrow to set ablaze the effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna and son Meghnad, to signify the symbolic victory of good over evil.Unlike previous years when the Ravana effigies used to be over 100-foot tall, this year, they were much smaller — about 30-foot tall — and though they were set afire for real, organisers used light and sound effects to mimic the sound and feel of firecrackers.“Every resident of Delhi is affected by severe air pollution. We were very particular about strictly adhering to the ban on firecrackers. We are happy that people found the light and sound show entertaining,” said Arjun Kumar, general secretary of the committee that organises the annual Ramlila and Dussehra celebrations on the Red Fort ground.The blanket ban on firecrackers and Covid-19 regulations, combined with other factors such as a decline in donations, forced numerous local Dussehra organisers in the Capital to cancel celebrations this year.A large number of Delhi residents chose to celebrate the festival at home, by tuning into TV channels and online platforms that were live-streaming Dussehra rituals.“Although Covid-19 cases are declining, it is still unsafe to participate in large gatherings. When people have easy access to smartphones and internet, it is best not to step out,” said Apoorva Kumar, a resident of Delhi’s GTB Enclave.The prohibition on sale, purchase, storage and use of firecrackers in Delhi will remain in place till the end of the year -- essentially covering Diwali, Chhath Puja, Guru Parv, Christmas and New Year celebrations.Dussehra also coincides with Durga Visarjan – the day when organisers of Durga Puja take the idol for immersion in water bodies.While the Yamuna and natural water bodies in the city have been made out of bounds for these immersions, by the guidelines of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the Delhi government this year did not make arrangements such as artificial ponds for collective idol immersion, thus forcing organisers to make arrangements of their own near the pandals.“We were told by the district administration about the idol immersion rules and we made adequate arrangements for immersion on the temple premises. We have been doing that for a few years now. The restrictions are understandable because rallies and processions are prohibited in light of the pandemic,” said Swapan Ganguly, convener of the Kalibari temple in New Delhi’s Mandir Marg, which hosts one of the most prominent Durga Puja pandals in the city.Several other organisers, however, chose to celebrate without having idols. They said the rituals are conducted in the presence of an earthen urn, which is immersed on the day of visarjan.“We had to immerse the kalash (urn), which was not a difficult task. We made adequate arrangements at the venue itself,” said Robin Bose, secretary of the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-celebrates-dussehra-sans-firecrackers-and-fanfare-but-with-much-zeal-101634323501306.html
16-10-2021||Bangalore||Study links north Karnataka tremors to hydro-seismicity||The Karnataka government on Friday said a recent study has shown that the tremors recorded in the northern part of the state normally occur post monsoon and are related to a phenomenon called hydro-seismicity.The Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) had commissioned the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) to take up a detailed analysis of the recent recordings of earthquakes in Karnataka’s Bidar, Kalaburagi and Vijayapura districts among other places after these regions witnessed tremors that were of a magnitude as high as 4.0 on the Richter scale.“In their preliminary observations, they have indicated that the micro tremors of this nature normally occur during the post monsoon period, after a heavy rainfall, is related to a phenomenon called hydro-seismicity,” Manoj Rajan, the commissioner of the KSDMA, said in a statement on Friday.The findings of the study come at a time when these regions witnessed around 15 instances of earthquakes and tremors, some that were felt 50-60 km away, adding to the panic of the population in these parts of the state.“Within crustal volumes having fracture permeability, a natural increase in hydraulic head caused by transient increases in stress due to the elevation of the water table in recharge areas of groundwater basins, can be transmitted down to depths of 10-20 km, thereby triggering micro tremors and sounds are also accompanied by some of these tremors. These are due to shallow earthquakes that generate high-frequency surface waves. This type of seismic activity is very common and nothing to worry about, since it may not cascade into a large devastating earthquake,” Rajan said.The NGRI is sending a team of scientists to these regions in the next two days to study and ascertain the field conditions.The NGRI, Hyderabad, was asked to take up field inventory and earthquake related studies in and around the affected regions in Vijayapura & Kalaburagi.JL Gautam, the head of operations at National Centre for Seismology (NCS), had earlier said these were minor events and they (earthquakes and tremors felt this time) were local adjustments or intra-plate activity or activity within plates, Hindustan Times reported on October 13.The first two tremors on October 1 and 5 were recorded near Basavakalyan in neighbouring Bidar district that borders Maharashtra.Authorities have reached out to the mines and geology department to understand the phenomena and also raise awareness among the people who have been living in constant fear over the recent events.Rajan said that the phenomenon related to the occurrence of micro tremors originating from shallow depths associated with subterranean sounds was experienced in the past during 2006-2009 at Hasargundgi, Yelakapalli, Yempalli, Chimanchod of Chincholi Taluk, Kalaburgi District.“During 2010-14, 25 micro tremors in Vijayapura of magnitude 1.2 to 3.1 have been reported by the Permanent Seismic Monitoring Stations Network established by KSNDMC along with subterranean sounds. In Kalaburgi during 2016, two micro tremors of magnitude 1.5 & 1.6 respectively has been reported and in Bidar during 2017, 3 micro tremors of magnitude 2.0 to 2.2 have been reported by the KSNDMC Network,” Rajan said on Tuesday.People of the region had spent several nights in large open areas after a series of earthquakes and tremors in the last two months. Their fears are not unfounded as Vijayapura has recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 in 1993 with significant damage done not just in this district but also Bidar and Kalaburagi. “Vijayapura is situated in the geological provinces of Dharwar Craton, which is an Archaean continental fragment of the Peninsular India. As per the Seismic Zonation map of Karnataka, Vijayapura District falls in Seismic Zone II & III (Figure 1c), II being Earthquake free zone and III being Moderate Earthquake Zone, the part of area where the Survey has been carried out and reports of sound heard falls in Zone II, making the less chance of occurrence of Earthquakes. The documented very first Earthquake in Vijayapura is during 1653-1654 and the details of Epicentre along with date & time are unknown. The next known Earthquake was on 15.11.1973 with a Magnitude of 4.0, epicentred at Almel-Sindgi, Vijayapura,” according to the KSDMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/study-links-north-karnataka-tremors-to-hydroseismicity-101634323500102.html
16-10-2021||Dehradun||In line with tradition, portals of Char Dham shrines to close for winter months||Following the tradition of announcing the dates of closing of the portals of the Char Dham shrines on the day of Dussehra, this year the portals of Badrinath Temple will be closed for the winter months on November 20. The portals of Gangotri will be closed on November 5 (Govardhan Puja, next day after Diwali)) and the portals of Yamunotri and Kedarnath shrines on November 6 (Bhaidooj). Harish Gaur, spokesperson Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board said the exact auspicious time for closing the portals of Char Dham shrines is arrived at through astrological calculations by local temple bodies and priests. He added that in the case of Kedarnath and Yamunotri, it is a tradition that their portals close on Bhaidooj, which falls on November 6 this year. He said the portals of Tungnath shrine will close for the winter months on October 30 this year. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami expressed happiness over the successful conduct of the Char Dham yatra so far. He said the yatra will go on without any impediment till the closure of the portals. This year so far, over 1.14 lakh pilgrims have visited Char Dham shrines. The influx of pilgrims increased after the Uttarakhand high court on October 5 lifted the daily cap on the number of pilgrims who can visit Char Dham following the state government’s plea that the limitation should be lifted as the Covid-19 cases have dipped significantly in the state. The daily limit of pilgrims was 1000 for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri shrines. Earlier on September 16, the court had lifted its June 28 stay on the Char Dham yatra, paving the way for the start of the yatra from September 18 to the four revered Himalayan shrines with Covid-19 curbs. According to Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board officials, last year, overall, 3.1 lakh pilgrims came for Char Dham Yatra. In pre-Covid-19 times, that is in 2019, over 32.40 lakh pilgrims had visited Char Dham shrines. The four Himalayan pilgrimage sites Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath- collectively called Char Dham, located in Garhwal Himalayas, are one of the most revered pilgrimages in the Hindu tradition and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. It is believed that every Hindu should undertake Char Dham pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime to avail the blessings of gods adorning the shrines. Traditionally, the Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, then proceeds to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east. Kedarnath shrine is located in Rudraprayag district, while Badrinath is in Chamoli district. Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines are located in Uttarkashi district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/in-line-with-tradition-portals-of-char-dham-shrines-to-close-for-winter-months-101634323383724.html

The reported residue burning events in Punjab in this period were 1,286, as against 4,216 last year. Similarly, in Haryana there were 487 stubble fires reported, against 596 for the corresponding period last year. In Uttar Pradesh’s eight NCR districts, 22 stubble fires were reported, down from 42 last year.No fire counts have been reported from Delhi and two NCR Districts of Rajasthan.To be sure, experts have said that while the stubble burning season have had a slow start this year, the daily fire count is likely to reach around 3,000-4,000 by late October and early November.“The major hot spots of paddy residue burning in Punjab are Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Patiala and Ludhiana — these four districts account for 72% of stubble burning events [in the state]. Similarly, the major hot spots in Haryana are Karnal, Kaithal and Kurukshetra. These three account for 80% of incidences [in the state],” a statement from CAQM said.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) hit 198 on Friday, according to the CPCB daily bulletin, up from 182 on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fewer-stubble-fires-in-ncr-in-past-month-compared-to-2020-pollution-panel-101634323382193.html

In a letter written to Modi, a copy of which was released by the state government, Stalin expressed that such incidents have been repeated in the past, and urged him to arrive at a permanent solution against the attack on Indian fishermen. “The continued attacks on innocent fishermen of Tamil Nadu by the Sri Lankan Navy are a matter of grave concern,” Stalin said in his letter.The chief minister asked Modi to take up this issue with the Sri Lankan authorities at the diplomatic level so as to ensure the freedom of the 23 fishermen. He explained that these fishermen from Nagapattinam set out to sea on October 11. The Navy of the island nation arrested them off the coast of Vettilaikeni near the Point Pedro on October 13 for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Border. The fishermen were detained at a naval base. “This is highly reprehensible,” Stalin said. He urged the Prime Minister to immediately intervene and take steps to permanently end the long-standing dispute between the Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen, an official press release from the Tamil Nadu government said. The maritime dispute between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu has remained unresolved for decades owing to the state’s use of trawlers and depleting resources in the seas. The attacks and arrests against Indian fishermen increased after the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009. Earlier this year, the bodies of four fishermen washed ashore in Sri Lanka believed to be from Tamil Nadu’s Ramanathapuram district that led to protests. Successive state governments in Tamil Nadu, both the DMK and AIADMK have raised this issue with the union government seeking a solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stalin-seeks-pm-modi-s-intervention-over-arrest-of-fishermen-by-sri-lankan-navy-101634323320159.html

16-10-2021||Delhi||Gangster who skipped bail arrested after a month in Delhi's Dwarka||The Delhi Police’s crime branch on Thursday arrested from Dwarka a suspected gangster who did not return to prison a month after his interim bail expired.According to the police, the arrested man — Prince Tewatia — recently joined a gang led by jailed ganglords Hashim Baba and Lawrence Bishnoi, and is implicated in at least 15 crimes, including murder, extortion, attempt to murder, and even submitting forged papers in court to secure bail or extend his stay beyond bars.“In 2020, while out on interim bail, Tewatia submitted a forged Covid-positive certificate in court to secure an extension. However, the forgery was caught and a case was registered at the Tilak Marg police station on the court’s directions,” said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (crime).Police said Tewatia was last arrested in October 2020, by the special cell. In July this year, the Delhi high court granted him interim bail, which expired on September 15. The court dismissed his plea for an extension the next day, despite which Tewatia did not return to prison.On October 14, the police raided one of his hideouts in Dwarka and arrested him. He was produced before the court that sent him to jail, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Manoj C.Son of a retired Delhi Development Authority (DDA) employee, Tewatia entered the world of crime after he left studies after Class 10. He was first booked in 2008 in an assault case and two years later he committed a murder in south Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar. The man he murdered had slapped his father in the past and Tewatia took revenge of that humiliation. He was arrested in the case and while being in jail, he filed forged documents in the court to claim himself a juvenile accused. However, his fraud was detected a case was registered against him on the court’s direction, said the joint CP.Tewatia came out of jail in 2015 and resumed his criminal activities. In 2016, he was arrested again in two different cases of robbery and attempt to murder. In 2019, he was granted three days parole for his wedding. He did not return to jail after the parole expired. This time, the special cell arrested him again following an encounter in which he was shot in his leg. After remaining in jail for seven months, he was granted bail in 2020. He also submitted his fake Covid positive certificate to get extension on the bail. His forgery was against detected and a case was registered.“While evading his arrest, Tewatia committed a murder in Wazirabad and two firing incidents for extortion in Preet Vihar and Wazirabad. He was again arrested by the special cell in October 2020 in an arms act case,” added Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhigangster-who-skipped-bail-arrested-after-a-month-in-dwarka-101634323260148.html

Kerala also reported 67 deaths on Friday, taking the toll to 26,774. Though the health department added 7,000 deaths to the Covid-19 list recently, these numbers failed to figure in the total fatality list. When asked about this, a senior health department official said some more formalities will have to be completed. Three districts, Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur, reported more than 1000 cases. State health minister Veena George said at least 25 per cent of the newly infected had not taken the vaccine. At least 93.7 per cent of the eligible population got one vaccine and 44.9 per cent got both shots, she said, adding the vaccination rate of the state is one of the best in the country. She asked the remaining people to take the jab at the earliest. According to a seroprevalence survey last week, at least 82 per cent of people above 18 years have antibodies against Covid-19 and over 40 per cent of children in the 5-17 age group is exposed to the virus. In the earlier sero survey, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July, Kerala sero positivity was lowest in the country at 44.4 per cent. The immunity has been achieved either through vaccination or natural infection, said, experts. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 16,862 fresh virus cases with a TPR of 1.43 per cent. For more than five months, Kerala has been contributing a lion’s share of virus cases in the country. After Onam festivities in August, cases multiplied and at one point it claimed more than 70 per cent of the total cases of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-reports-8k-new-covid-cases-67-deaths-101634323202632.html
16-10-2021||Other||Tamil Nadu CM Stalin urges 4 states to review ban on crackers||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday said the livelihood of about eight lakh workers involved in the firecracker manufacturing industry in the state was at stake and urged his counterparts in Delhi, Odisha, Rajasthan and Haryana to reconsider the blanket ban on sale of crackers.Stating that the blanket ban is “not reasonable”, the chief minister said the sale of crackers falling within the norms set by the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal may be permitted in their respective states.In a letter to the chief ministers of the four states, a copy of which was released to the media here, Stalin pointed out that the Covid-19 pandemic had a crippling effect on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector in the country and its impact on Tamil Nadu’s economy, which is largely dependent on MSMEs for growth and employment, has been significantly severe.“My government is now in the process of reviving the sector through focussed interventions. The firecracker industry, concentrated around the town of Sivakasi, is one of the most important industrial activities in the state,” he explained.Around 800,000 workers depend on the state’s firecracker industry for their livelihood, which is the largest in our country, he pointed out.Stating that the ban imposed by the four Indian states on the sale of firecrackers during this Diwali festival was brought to his attention, the chief minister said, “I understand that you have taken this decision based on concerns regarding air pollution.”“I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Supreme Court has already banned certain categories of polluting firecrackers and now, green crackers with significantly less emissions are being manufactured. Therefore, a blanket ban on firecrackers is not reasonable. Such a ban is not prevalent in other countries,” Stalin said.Moreover, such a ban if imposed by other states also, would lead to the closure of the entire industry, jeopardising the livelihood of about eight lakh people, he said, adding, “You would also appreciate that bursting of firecrackers is an integral part of Indian festivals, especially Diwali. A balanced approach that gives due regard to environment, livelihood and public health is possible and necessary.” “I sincerely urge you to kindly reconsider the blanket ban on sale of firecrackers,” he added.He requested that the sale of firecrackers that fall within the norms set by the Supreme Court and the NGT may be permitted in their respective states. The Chandigarh administration on October 12 decided to continue with the cracker ban this Diwali, which was also imposed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The order, issued by union territory adviser Dharam Pal, came into force with immediate effect and will remain in force until further orders. Any violation can invite up to two-year imprisonment. However, burning of effigies will be allowed on Dussehra.The Supreme Court had in July dismissed a plea challenging the NGT’s complete ban sale and use of all firecrackers in Covid-19 times in cities and said that the authorities may allow for the the sale and use of firecrackers based on the category of air quality index (AQI) in the respective cities, several news agencies reported.However, the top court also said that the production of crackers was allowed. People who want to celebrate by bursting crackers could do so with permission from the authorities based on the AQI, the court added. Further, it also said that there was no ban on the manufacture of crackers but only in places where the air quality is poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-cm-stalin-urges-4-states-to-review-ban-on-crackers-101634323081382.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||2 held for duping senior citizens of over ₹5 crore in Delhi||The Delhi Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) has arrested two men for allegedly duping an octogenarian couple of nearly ₹5.24 crore after tricking them into investing their lifetime savings into a website development company on the promise of double the returns.The arrested men were identified as – Ankit Thakur (29), and Vinod Arya (28), the police said. They got acquainted with the elderly couple while working for a mutual fund company, in which the couple used to invest money, the police said.The complainants, a woman and her visually impaired husband, who retired as senior statistical officer from the ministry of labour, sold their three flats in Dwarka as they wanted to live with their children who are settled in the United States. It was this money that the duo had duped them of. Police have withheld the names of the complainants, due to their age.The two alleged accused approached the elderly husband and wife, seeking investment for their recently launched website company. They allegedly promised the couple that their invested money will be doubled in three years, said additional commissioner of police (EOW) RK Singh.“The couple handed over around ₹5.24 crore, which they had got from the sale of their flats in Dwarka. The two men gave them post-dated cheques as security but they bounced when presented,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhitwo-dupe-elderly-couple-of-5-24-crore-with-investment-scheme-arrested-101634323020004.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: North MCD to auction 3 acres of Rajan Babu hospital for pvt facilities||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to auction three acres of land within the Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis (RBIPMT) complex -- one of the biggest tuberculosis hospitals in Asia -- near GTB Nagar to generate revenue. The site is proposed to be used for setting up three private hospitals, said a senior corporation official.According to the project report prepared by the engineering department, the three acre land abutting the Ring Road has been earmarked in consultation with the hospital director for auctioning. “RBIPMT has a huge complex and it has a scope for development of private hospitals on the vacant land. The health department has provided in-principal agreement. A land measuring three acres near the laundry block and staff tenements of RBIPMT has been identified. It was decided that three plots of one acre each be carved out for three hospitals for e-auction on lease basis,” said a communication dated September 24, 2021, from the municipal commissioner to the standing committee. The land is currently covered by bushes and trees.The standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that the matter was postponed in the last committee meeting and a further study is required. “It (the hospital) is a huge 80-90 acre complex and the project proposes to use three acres for developing three specialty hospitals on PPP (public-private partnership) basis. It is for public welfare and it will also generate revenue for the corporation. This will be further discussed in the next meeting. We will hold meetings with department officials to study it further,” he added.North MCD had faced a severe fund crunch, with the civic body being unable to even provide salaries of its staff for months and the Delhi high court even pulling it up over the issue on multiple occasions. The doctors and nurses from various municipal hospitals have organised strikes due to non-payment of salaries even during the pandemic.The Layout Scrutiny Committee (LoSC) of the civic body approved the change in layout plan of the complex on August 24, 2021, and forwarded the proposal to the standing committee. “Three plots measuring 4,125 sqm, 4,125 sqm and 4,284.6 sqm have been carved out for hospitals near laundry block. After discussion, it was recommended to place the case before the standing committee for approval of three hospitals at municipal land,” said the LOSC report.Officials from the RBIPMT administration did not respond to requests seeking a comment.A senior north corporation official said that RBIPMT and Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Disease hospital are both located in the same complex near GTB Nagar. “In 2016, these two hospitals were merged for administrative purposes. As per the land records, the area under Rajan Babu hospital is 63.3 acres while MVID hospital is spread over 26.4 acres. Both these hospitals were set up in 1935 to commemorate the silver jubilee of the coronation of King George. The location of these hospitals is very prime and the complex is well connected by Ring Road and Delhi Metro. The redevelopment of the area for revenue generation was decided in a meeting chaired by the municipal commissioner,” the official said.Meanwhile, during the last standing committee meeting, opposition AAP councillors had raised the issue of poor condition of roof and structures in Rajan Babu hospital, pointing out that it may lead to an accident. The committee has asked the hospital administration department to submit a report on the matter.Jain said that he will also visit the site to ascertain the condition of the structure and whether the staff/patients need to be shifted. The opposition AAP has been demanding hand over of six major hospitals run by North MCD to the Centre or state government. A proposal to this effect has been moved twice by the municipal commissioners but it was turned down on both occasions by the deliberative wing of the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhinorth-mcd-to-auction-3-acres-of-rajan-babu-hospital-for-pvt-facilities-101634322965981.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||After row, DDA promises more public hearings to discuss Delhi master plan||Protecting the Yamuna riverfront and green spaces in the city, reviewing the mixed land use provision, and better parking provisions — these are some of the main topics in the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 (MPD-2041) on which the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has received the most number of public comments. In all, the land-owning agency has received over 33,000 comments, officials said.The draft MPD-2041, which is the vision document for the city’s development for the next two decades, was put in the public domain in June this year.On Friday, the DDA clarified that public hearings to discuss the draft master plan will continue in November as well, but refrained from specifying the total number of such sessions that will be held. The clarification came after residents and civic society members objected to the two-day public hearing schedule — on October 18 and 20 — announced by the DDA, in which 17,162 people are expected to participate.A senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “The DDA is committed to providing sufficient time for hearings and for considering the suggestions and objections on MPD-2041. These proceedings will start from October 18 and continue into November. If need be, it will be further extended.”The public hearing, which will be held online this time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will deliberate on 16 broad issues such as environment, development control norms and heritage, among others, based on the MPD-2041 chapters.In the environment section, DDA officials said suggestions are largely related to protecting the Yamuna riverfront and ensuring adequate green spaces in residential localities.Many have expressed concern over city roads getting flooded during monsoon and suggested a proper GIS framework for drainage networks. The DDA official quoted above said, “The new master plan will be GIS based and all services, infrastructure developments, areas and their use will be mapped.”Many also suggested setting up noise monitoring stations in the city.Another pressing concern, especially for resident welfare associations, is the mixed land use (MLU) provision, which allows for commercial activities in residential areas. DDA officials said many have suggested that the provision should be reviewed and future development of mixed land use must be discouraged.Rajiv Kakria, convener of “Save Our City” campaign and a resident of Greater Kailash-1, said, “It (MLU) has destroyed the residential character of neighbourhoods. Today, safety and security have become our main concern due to rampant commercialisation...”As the draft master plan pushes for redevelopment or regeneration of old areas, the land-owning agency has received a lot of comments on revising/relaxing the existing development control norms.Two new policies (transit oriented development and land pooling) for future development of the city, introduced by the DDA in 2007, are in the nascent stages of implementation. The land-owning agency has received suggestions seeking clarification on permissible floor area ratio under both policies.Another key concern is about the successful implementation of the master plan itself. The East Delhi RWA Joint Front said people don’t know how much of the previous master plan (MPD-2021) has been implemented so far.DDA officials said the MPD-2041 has a provision for annual review of its implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-row-dda-promises-more-public-hearings-to-discuss-delhi-master-plan-101634322964873.html
16-10-2021||Dehradun||Back in Congress,Yashpal Arya gets to work. Claims more will exit BJP||DEHRADUN: Former Uttarakhand minister Yashpal Arya, who joined the Congress after his surprise exit from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, claimed that more leaders from the BJP could leave the party ahead of state elections early next year, saying his homecoming was akin to the BJP returning the principal amount and it was yet to pay back the “interest” on the loan.“My son and my return to the Congress is just the return of the principal sum. I want to tell the BJP that the interest on this capital is yet to come,” he said, claiming that there were “many other BJP leaders” who want to come to the Congress.The BJP promptly rubbished his claim, saying he was going to be the only one to leave the party and was driven by personal interest. ”No other party member would leave the party. We will unitedly contest the upcoming elections,” said state BJP president Madan Kaushik.In the Congress, six-time MLA Yashpal Arya’s claims were interpreted to signal that he was attempting to persuade some other BJP leaders to quit and party and team with the Congress, particularly those who quit the Congress in 2016 and 2017 when the BJP was in the opposition and Harish Rawat the chief minister of the hill state.Arya said he switched parties because he was feeling “suffocated” in the BJP. “One doesn’t have any freedom to express his view or opinion there. Hence, I decided to return to the Congress for which I am grateful to the party leadership for welcoming me to the party fold,” said Arya at a news conference at his house in Haldwani.He continued: “Many other BJP MLAs, who are unhappy with the party leadership, want to join Congress. Soon, they will join the party and expose BJP which has an ideology, which is against the poor, Dalits, farmers and women”. A Congress leader said Arya, considered a prominent Dalit face in state politics, was being supported by the faction led by the leader of opposition Pritam Singh. “That faction is keen on welcoming more BJP leaders especially those who had gone there in 2016 episode which brought down Harish Rawat government.”Pritam Singh, however, insisted that there were no active plans on the drawing board to induct more BJP leaders but added that the party’s doors are open for anyone willing to join. He also made it a point to emphasise that this was not anything rare in a democracy; that politicians switched sides.“Let me clear one thing...In democracy there is no party where leaders have not gone out or come in. This happens in democracy...We will welcome anyone willing to come to our side to save democracy which is in danger today. But that will of course happen with the approval of our national leadership- Sonia and Rahul Gandhi,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/back-in-congress-yashpal-arya-gets-to-work-claims-more-will-exit-bjp-101634322901827.html

The actual candidate has also been arrested, said officials on Friday.The suspects -- identified as Rahul Raj (24) and Deepak Kumar (23) -- are residents of Bihar’s Bhabhua and Rajasthan’s Alwar, respectively. Raj was appearing on behalf of Deepak, according to the police.Vinod Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 58 police station, said, “Deepak had registered himself as a candidate, but Rahul was going to appear on his behalf. The two suspects had entered the examination hall with admit cards having the name of Deepak. They had planned that Deepak would give his finger prints and Rahul would appear for the exam on his behalf. But the invigilator spotted them with the same admit card and informed the police,” he said.Police arrested Deepak with his original Aadhaar card, and Rahul was carrying Deepak’s forged Aadhaar card. During interrogation, the two suspects told police that they became friends while studying together in Mukherjee Nagar in Delhi. “Rahul is relatively good in studies and he had promised to clear the exam for ₹1 lakh,” said SHO Kumar.A case has been registered against the duo under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy), and sections 3, 6,9 and 10 of Uttar Pradesh Public Exam (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998.“The two suspects will be produced before a court, and sent to judicial custody on Saturday,” said SHO Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2-arrested-in-noida-for-impersonating-candidate-in-ssc-multi-tasking-exam-101634322720121.html
16-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: 3 of 4 suspects, aide held for harassing woman on Dadri’s GT road||Police on Friday arrested four persons for allegedly harassing a woman on Dadri’s GT road in Greater Noida on Thursday evening, said officials.The suspects were identified as Nitin Kumar (25) -- a resident of Greater Noida’s Piyawali village, and Nishant (24) and Manav (22) (both go by their first names) -- residents of Greater Noida’s Bisada village. The fourth suspect -- Sachin -- is still on the run. Police said that Nitin’s uncle, Monu (40), who is a resident of Dadri, was also arrested for assisting the suspects in escaping.Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer (SHO), Dadri police station, said that a 22-year-old man, his sister (20), and his male friend (23), were travelling from Greater Noida West to Dadri on a motorcycle on Thursday evening. “They were walking towards the nearest petrol pump after the vehicle ran out of fuel on the road. The four suspects, who were travelling in a red Mahindra XUV 300 along that road, allegedly passed lewd remarks at the woman and asked her to get in the car. When the brother-sister duo put up resistance, the three suspects manhandled them,” Tripathi said.The duo raised an alarm and a few locals reached the spot, and vandalised the car the suspects were travelling in. Fearing the crowd, one of the suspects -- Nitin -- immediately called his uncle Monu, who reached the spot in a Mahindra Scorpio, and all of them escaped.Meanwhile, the victims dialled emergency telephone number 112 and a police team reached the spot.A case has been registered against the five suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) at the Dadri police station.“A police team conducted a search in Greater Noida’s Jarcha area and arrested the four suspects from an underpass there on Friday. They will be produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Saturday,” Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-3-of-4-suspects-aide-held-for-harassing-woman-on-dadri-s-gt-road-101634322661377.html
16-10-2021||Noida||Festive mood takes over GB Nagar as Durga Puja, Dussehra celebrations conclude||The nine-day Navratri festival and Durga Puja came to a close on Friday with the celebration of Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami. In the morning, residents took out processions from Durga Puja pandals to immerse the idols of goddess Durga in artificial ponds or pits created by the authorities, and in the evening, residents burnt effigies of Ravan, his brother Kumbhkaran and son Meghnad to signify the victory of good over evil.At Sector 25’s Jalvayu Vihar Sanskritik Kalyan Samiti Durga Puja, residents held the Sindoor Khela ritual with caution. The ritual involves smearing vermilion or ‘sindoor’ on the idol of goddess Durga and on married women to mark the conclusion of Durga Puja on Vijayadashami.“Only about 20-30 women were allowed to celebrate the ritual at a time. This was followed by a small procession comprising four-five people who took the Durga idol to the artificial water pit in Sector 25 for immersion,” said Jaya De, one of the organisers.The Noida authority created six water pits in sectors 25, 62, 116-117,120,105 and 135 to facilitate idol immersion by Durga Puja committees across the city.“In line with Covid-19 protocols, only about four-five people went to immerse the idol in the artificial water pit created in Sector 105 by the authorities,” said Saugata Dasgupta from Lotus Boulevard Sanskritik Samiti in Sector 100.According to organisers, cooperation from the police ensured the five-day Durga Puja festivities took place smoothly.“Though entry to each Durga Puja pandal was restricted to just 100 people, on the eighth and ninth (ashtami and navami) days, the number of people at the pandal began to increase. However, as soon as the police were alerted of the situation, they started managing the crowd,” said Anupam Banerjee from Noida Kalibari Durga Puja in Sector 26.By evening, as residents started collecting to watch the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Meghnad being burned at Ramlila ground in Noida Stadium and in Sector 62, several hundred policemen were deployed on the ground. Authorities said 70-foot-tall effigies of Ravana were erected at both Ramlila grounds.“Almost 400 policemen were deployed in areas around the Ramlila grounds in Noida. This included 15 inspectors, 50 sub-inspectors and 300 constables. Apart from this, one company of Provincial Armed Constabulary, police guards, anti-riot teams and fire services were also on the ground as a precautionary measure,” said Rannvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida.As per a Noida traffic police advisory, vehicular movement was halted on roads leading to the Noida Stadium in Sector 21A.“The first five days of Ramlila saw a footfall of at least 8,000. But on Navami and Dussehra, the footfall crossed 12,000. None of the visitors were allowed to enter the grounds without face masks and hand sanitiser was placed at each entrance,” said TN Chaurasia, president of Shri Sanatan Dharm Ramlila Committee.The spectators, meanwhile, were ecstatic to be celebrating in public after two years. Public celebrations were not allowed last year to curb the spread of Covid-19.“It is refreshing to participate in Dussehra festivities this year,” said Ruchika Rathore, a visitor to the Ramlila organised by Shri Ram Mitra Mandal Noida Ramlila Committee (SRMMC) in Sector 62.The Shri Ramlila Committee in Greater Noida did not organise the nine-day theatrical retelling of Ramayana this year, and, instead, played a three-hour-long Ramlila recording on an LCD screen at the Ramlila grounds in Site-4.“After watching the show, the effigies were set afire. We hope that by next year we are able to defeat Covid-19 and can return to our usual celebrations,” said Vinod Kasana, one of the organisers in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/festive-mood-takes-over-gb-nagar-as-durga-puja-dussehra-celebrations-conclude-101634322660043.html
16-10-2021||Gurugram||Friday prayers amid police cordon again as Gurugram residents continue protest||embers of the Muslim community offered prayers amid heavy police presence, shouting of slogans, and singing of bhajans (religious songs) in Gurugram’s Sector 47 on Friday afternoon, as local residents continued their protest against offering Namaz in open spaces for the fourth consecutive week.The police shifted the site of the Friday prayers around 100 metres from the original designated spot to avoid any confrontation between the protesters and the devotees. But local residents, many of whom were Hindu, said they wanted prayers to completely stop.Around 100 policemen and policewomen were deployed at Sector 47 to prevent the protesters, who were singing bhajans and shouting slogans, from reaching the prayer site. Heated arguments were also witnessed between the police and protesters, who insisted on trying to get to the spot where prayers were being offered. The police also did not allow reporters to reach the prayer site and cordoned off the area.Police said protesters gathered at the parking site around 12.30pm. They started singing bhajans while walking towards the prayer site but were stopped by the police. They also carried placards demanding a ban on namaz in open spaces and shouted slogans against authorities for failing to stop Friday prayers in their sector.Sunil Yadav, president of the Sector 47 residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that they wanted the authorities to stop Friday prayers in their sector as a majority of the devotees did not belong to the area. “We have held a discussion with district administration and suggested sites near Subash Chowk and Marble Market, which have little to no residential population. If the authorities check the identity cards and Aadhaar cards of the people offering prayers in Sector 47, they would not find a single local as all are outsiders,” said Yadav.In 2018, the controversy of holding Friday prayers in public places resulted in a major dispute, after which the police and administration identified 37 sites where Friday prayers were allowed.The RWA president said the list of designated places for Friday prayers, including the Sector 47 site, finalised in 2018 has been submitted to the police. He claimed that the list mentions that the order was meant for a single day.Aman Yadav, ACP, Sadar, Gurugram confirmed that the residents submitted a list of places but its veracity needs to be checked. “In the meeting held earlier, this list was not shared,” he said, adding that the prayers were held under police protection and without any hindrance.The protesters, a majority of whom were local residents, said they were ready to offer the Sector 47 community centre for Friday prayers for the sector residents, but demanded that outsiders not be allowed to pray in public.Members of the Muslim community, meanwhile, said they were being harassed by residents.“The Muslim community is being harassed every Friday in various sectors of Gurugram and this needs to be condemned by politicians across party lines. The administration should not tolerate this kind of discrimination and needs to take strict action against this unlawful protest. The residents have also been instigated by those who want to gain political mileage and are using them as shields,” said Altaf Ahmad, founder member, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch.District officials however, assured that arrangements would be made for peaceful prayers on Friday. “Discussions are being held and the issue will be resolved soon after meeting both sides,” said a district administration official requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/friday-prayers-offered-in-gurugram-amid-slogans-and-bhajans-101634322540094.html
16-10-2021||Gurugram||NHAI misses 4th deadline to finish underpass near Sirhaul toll in Gurugram||Despite Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari announcing that the underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza near Ambience Mall will be opened on October 15, the project has missed the deadline yet again.Authorities said this is the fourth deadline the project has missed. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had fixed the initial deadlines in September, 2020, July, 2021 and August 15, 2021 for the project. Work on the underpass began on March 5, 2019; however, due to the restrictions in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019 and the construction ban imposed by the Supreme Court during winter to curb pollution, the project was delayed repeatedly, authorities said.According to officials, some work is still pending and there is a safety audit going on. Now, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to open this underpass at the end of this month, said officials.HT’s visit to the underpass on Friday revealed that while the surface road is almost complete, the electrical infrastructure is still being fixed.Gurugram residents have been demanding the construction of the Sirhaul underpass for a long time, as it will help them avoid driving all the way to Rajokri in Delhi to take a U-turn to get to Ambience Mall and DLF Phase-3.NHAI officials claimed that work on the entire project is almost complete and they are conducting a safety audit, which has delayed the opening of the underpass. “The safety audit is to ensure that the project meets all safety standards and there is no hazard to commuters. The independent auditor will take four days and the authority will also take the same time to finalise the audit. The work is almost complete and the underpass will be opened by the end of the month,” said Saurabh Singhal, NHAI consultant.Last month, union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, while visiting the Mumbai Delhi Expressway, had announced that the underpass will be opened on October 15.NHAI officials said that work was also delayed due to the non-availability of labour during the lockdown period and the festive season. “There are only minor works pending and these will be completed within a week,” a senior official said.The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres, while the entire stretch, including access roads, is 1.5km-long — it includes a 559 metre-long and 7 metre-wide service road. The designated speed in this underpass has been set at 40kmph.The width of the underpass is 14 metres and the vertical clearance of the tunnel is 5.5 metres.The 455 metre-long flyover at Shankar Chowk, which is functional, was also built as a part of this project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-sirhaul-toll-underpass-nhai-misses-4th-deadline-101634322427310.html
16-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools gear up for two-part CBSE Board exams to start next month||A day after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced that the first of a two-part system of board examinations this year will be held in-person, schools across the national capital said they have started gearing up for the new mode of examination scheduled to start next month. There are over 2,100 CBSE-affiliated schools in Delhi. The CBSE — the largest education board in the country in terms of the number of students enrolled and schools affiliated— on Thursday said the full schedule of the Term 1 exams, to be held in November and December, will be announced on October 18. The 90-minute Term 1 examination will have objective type questions while Term 2 examinations, scheduled to take place in March-April, may have subjective or objective type questions, but that and the schedule will depend on the pandemic situation at that time.In order to simplify the schedule, the CBSE has split the Term 1 exam subjects into minor and major subjects, with those classified as minor (mostly electives), being held first. There are nine major subjects for Class 10, and 19 for Class 12. These include core subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, English, and economics, among others.“As major subjects are offered by almost all affiliated schools, exams of these subjects will be conducted after announcing the date sheet as was done earlier. As for minor subjects, the CBSE will make groups of schools offering these subjects and more than one subject exam will be conducted in these schools on the same day,” the board circular said on Thursday.Talking about the revised process, Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Sector 8, Rohini, said arranging the requisite number of question papers will be a challenge.“Getting photocopies of encrypted question papers will be a challenge as our school doesn’t have a fast photocopier machine and these have to be copied within a stipulated time frame. We cannot use commercial stores since the question papers are confidential. Arranging fast photocopier machines, which are expensive, at short notice will be difficult for the school. It will be easier if the board arranged the necessary number of question papers and distributed them through zonal centres,” he said.Principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of government principals’ association, said the earlier method of collecting question papers from designated points or banks will be easier.“Starting Term 1 exams with minor subjects is a good move as students will be able to ease into mindset of appearing for the Boards. We are also waiting for clarity on how many students there will be in each school. Since this is the first time that board exams are being held in November, it will be a challenge to maintain continuity of classes for junior students, while conducting board exams simultaneously,” he said.Private schools, however, said managing an increased number of students will be a challenge if classes for junior students are also restarted before board examinations. Malini Narayanan, chairperson of the National Progressive Schools Conference, which has 122 Delhi schools as members, said, “Until now, we only had in-person classes for students of classes 9 to 12, while the remaining are continuing with online study. If schools reopen for classes from nursery to 8, we will feel the strain while conducting the board exams and we would need extra help at that point.”Last month, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had said it would consider allowing schools to resume in-person classes for students of classes 6 to 8 after the festive season.Narayanan also said printing question papers within a stipulated time frame would require more manpower in private schools as well. “As far as academic preparation is concerned, we have started practising with OMR (optical mark recognition) sheets in all our schools so that students have some familiarity with the new mode of examination. The type of questions is also different — more questions will be based on case studies, reasoning, and assertion. So, we have been training our students for that as well,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-gear-up-for-two-part-cbse-board-exams-to-start-next-month-101634321519969.html

The municipal body has so far closed 246 dhalaos while another 100 points will be shut down before December this year, as per a report submitted by the municipal commissioner. The civic body, however, said closed/abandoned dhalaos located on the RoW (right of way) of roads will be demolished to improve the traffic flow.A senior municipal official stated that a large number of dhalaos are getting vacant due to installation of fixed compactor garbage collection machines to compress solid waste. “Each compactor leads to closure of three-four dhalaos as it can handle much larger volume of municipal solid waste in smaller space,” the official said.Of the 246 dhalaos shut by the civic body, 113 are located in the Rohini zone, 71 in Keshavpuram, 36 in Civil Lines, 10 in Karol Bagh, 9 in City-Sadar Paharganj zone and 7 in Narela. “More than 50% of the dhalaos in the three zones handled by the private concessionaire have been closed down. The new fixed compactor stations have a capacity to handle 15-20 metric tons of garbage,” said the official.North MCD standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that the policy has been approved by the committee and it is likely to be operationalised in a month. “Earlier, we were planning to use the space from dhalaos closed in prime locations for revenue generation projects but most of those sites are located on PWD roads so it would have led to more legal tussle and delays. We have decided that the spaces will be handed over to RWA and NGOs which plan to use it for non-profit public welfare purposes,” he said.Jain said that the cost of repairing and redeveloping these sites will have to be borne by the allottees. “Projects like charitable dispensaries, subsidised meals, public libraries or senior citizen centres can be undertaken. A few sites which are leading to congestion will be demolished and some will be used to develop office/space for safai karamcharis,” Jain added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhinorth-mcd-to-offer-closed-dhalaos-to-rwas-ngos-for-public-facilities-101634320499973.html
16-10-2021||World||Bill Clinton 'doing fine' and will be out of hospital soon, says Joe Biden||Hillary and Chelsea Clinton arrived Saturday morning at the Southern California hospital where Bill Clinton is recovering after being treated for an infection.The former president is doing fine and will be released soon from the University of California Irvine Medical Center, President Joe Biden said Friday night.Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut that he had spoken to Clinton and the former president “sends his best.”"He’s doing fine; he really is," Biden said.“He’s not in any serious condition," Biden said. “He is getting out shortly, as I understand it. Whether that’s tomorrow or the next day, I don’t know.”Hillary Clinton has been with her husband at the hospital southeast of Los Angeles. Chelsea Clinton was with her mother around 8 a.m. Saturday in an SUV accompanied by secret service agents.Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to Covid-19, his spokesman said.An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña had said Friday that Clinton would remain hospitalized overnight to receive further intravenous antibiotics.“All health indicators are trending in the right direction, including his white blood count, which has decreased significantly,” Ureña said in a statement.“President Clinton continues to be in excellent spirits, and is deeply grateful for the outstanding care he is receiving and the well wishes that people have sent from across America and around the world,” the statement said.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn't receiving ICU care.Clinton was reading books and watching TV coverage about his hospitalization, the aide said.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-clinton-doing-fine-and-will-be-out-of-hospital-soon-says-joe-biden-101634405681066.html

The developed countries had committed to raise that money by 2020 and then by 2025.In 2009 at COP 15 in Copenhagen, developed countries decided to commit to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. Member countries decided then that this funding would come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance, and that new multilateral funding for adaptation would be delivered through effective and efficient fund arrangements, with a governance structure providing for equal representation of developed and developing countries, according to a background note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirmala-sitharaman-raises-climate-financing-issue-in-united-states-101634390105518.html

I have been searching for this medicine for the last three days but couldn't find it. The important medicines don't exist," said Shukrullah, a Kabul resident.Even medicine factories' owners have said that due to a shortage of medicine elements, some factories have stopped operating.Abdul Karim Khosti, the chief inspector of medical factories, said: "The flights are suspended and the customs stopped many trucks with medical products and now many factories lack access to medical materials to produce medicine."Expressing concerns over the issue, pharmacy owners have also raised their voices saying that the stopped-flow of medical supplies at the border is affecting their business.Abdullah, a pharmacy owner, said: "The increasing rate of the dollar and closure of ground borders and suspension of flights caused us to face a shortage of drugs."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-pharmacy-union-warns-of-medicine-shortage-as-supplies-stopped-at-borders-report-101634389260979.html

The findings of the study, published in The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine, suggest that symptomatic parturients in the third trimester had higher rates of gestational diabetes and lower white blood cell counts.The researchers assessed 2,471 women in the third trimester of their pregnancy, of which 2,299 were Covid-19 negative while 172 women had confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 during the study period. Among the 172 Covid-19 patients, 116 were asymptomatic while 56 were either diagnosed after arrival in hospital with symptoms or arrived after having been recently diagnosed.The study, however, also showed that there was no significant increase in cesarean delivery in those who were Covid-19 positive. The incidence of preterm deliveries was not significantly different among the three groups, according to the authors.Of the 172 women with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 who were monitored at the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Israel, only one parturient needed mechanical ventilation, while there were no maternal deaths in this group.Though they were at increased risk of adverse outcomes, none of the cases resulted in severe neonatal asphyxia or neonatal death. Overall maternal adverse outcomes were “not significantly different between the three groups.”Dr Elior Eliasi, the lead author of the study, said the results show that Covid-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy "has clinical implications, albeit at lower rates than expected once asymptomatic patients are taken into account.""However, There were significant differences between the Covid-19-positive and healthy controls included higher rates of GDM (gestational diabetes), low lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) which were significantly lower, postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding during birth), and neonatal respiratory complications," Dr Eliasi said, stressing the importance of vaccinating all pregnant women.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-3rd-trimester-of-pregnancy-a-look-at-adverse-complications-101634385263882.html

The Chinese foreign ministry released a brief statement on the MoU without sharing details.“China and Bhutan are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, and the traditional friendship between the two has a long history,” the ministry statement quoted Wu as saying. “It is expected that the MoU will make a significant contribution to speed up the negotiation on demarcation and promote the process of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries,” the statement added.“China will follow Xi Jinping Thought on diplomacy, follow the neighbourhood diplomacy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and be a good neighbor, friend and partner of Bhutan on the principles of equality and peaceful coexistence,” Wu said. China is a good neighbour, friend and partner of Bhutan, and the two countries should treat each other as equals, co-exist peacefully and seek mutual benefits and win-win results, said Wu.The Chinese statement quoted Bhutanese foreign minister Dorji as saying that Bhutan will work with China to implement the MoU, unswervingly push forward the negotiation on demarcation and be committed to strengthening bilateral relations.“The MoU is of historic significance and is the result of years of joint efforts and sincere cooperation between the two sides,” the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times, said in a report on the deal.Chinese experts told state media that the meeting shows Bhutan’s willingness to manage border affairs independently, rebutting India’s claims of the “China threat”, and reducing the risk on its eastern China-India border. “They noted that the territorial disputes between China and Bhutan are not significant but have not been resolved because India stands in the way as it has a special influence on Bhutan’s culture, defense and diplomacy,” the Global Times report said.“At a time when India is pursuing hegemony by coercion over its neighbors, the MoU is a victory for the region. It demonstrates that respectable, bilateral diplomacy has triumphed over New Delhi’s attempts to dominate, control and bully its neighbors, showing India has little ability to regionally isolate China,” national broadcaster CGTN’s English website said in a commentary.“The biggest lesson of the MoU for New Delhi ought to be that initiatives such as the Quad and anti-China metrics cannot reverse India’s growing isolation in South Asia,” it added.China’s official stand on the border dispute with Bhutan is that the boundary between the two countries is yet to be demarcated and the middle, eastern and western sections of the border are disputed.In June, 2020, Beijing stalled a request from Bhutan to develop the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in the eastern sector’s Trashigang district during a virtual meeting of the US-based Global Environment Facility (GEF).And, in July, 2020, China said it has a border dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, adding that Beijing and Thimphu were in communication on the issue. Beijing’s claim was seen as significant as the area in question borders Arunachal Pradesh, which also China claims as part of south Tibet.In a statement to the Hindustan Times the same month, the Chinese foreign ministry had said “a third party should not point fingers” in the China-Bhutan border issue – an apparent reference to India.“As far as I know, the China-Bhutan boundary issue was almost resolved 20 years ago. The two sides have a common understanding on how to sign the final agreement. But for Bhutan, it is difficult because of the India factor. That is the same reason why China and Bhutan have not signed the agreement,” Lin Minwang, assistant dean at the Institute of International Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University, had told HT at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hails-mou-with-bhutan-blames-india-for-souring-ties-with-thimphu-101634382546284.html

She is expected to become the first Chinese woman to conduct a spacewalk.The three will stay inside the space station for six months – the longest-ever mission involving crew in China’s rapidly developing space programme.After Shenzhou-13 successfully completed a fast automated rendezvous and docking with the space station complex, which is composed of the core module Tianhe and the cargo crafts Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3, the Shenzhou-13 crew entered the orbital capsule from the return capsule of the spaceship.“After a series of preparations, (astronaut) Zhai Zhigang opened the hatch of the Tianhe core module. At 9:58 a.m. (Beijing Time), Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu entered the core module one by one,” the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement on Saturday.The trio is the second batch of crew in China’s space station.In September, three other Chinese astronauts successfully completed a three-month stay on board the future station.They conducted two spacewalks to install equipment and worked on the station’s core module during their stay inside the space station.The assignments for the new crew include operating mechanical arms, performing extravehicular activities, and having module transfer tests.“They will also continue to verify key technologies concerning astronauts’ long-term stay in orbit, as well as recycle and life support,” the CMSA said.China began constructing the space station in April with the launch of Tianhe - the first and largest of the station’s three modules.Slightly bigger than a city bus, Tianhe will be the living quarters of the completed space station, a Reuters report said.Shenzhou-13 is the second of four crewed missions needed to complete the space station by the end of 2022.On May 30, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies including food and equipment docked with China’s first space station’s key module Tianhe as part of the preparation for the station to host three astronauts this month.The unmanned Tianzhou-2, or “Heavenly Vessel” in Chinese, docked with Tianhe (the key module).Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first spacewalk ever on the 2008 Shenzhou mission.In recent months, China has returned rock and soil samples to earth from the surface of the moon and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars; it also landed a craft on the far side of the moon in 2019.Once built, China’s space station will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency reported.The ISS – from which China is excluded -- comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-chinese-astronauts-including-first-woman-enter-space-station-101634379304813.html
16-10-2021||World||Stabbing of British MP David Amess a terrorist incident: UK Police||The fatal stabbing of British lawmaker David Amess was a terrorist incident, police said Saturday, as MPs pressed for tougher security in the wake of the second killing of a UK politician while meeting constituents in just over five years.Veteran Conservative MP David Amess, 69, was talking with voters at a church in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea east of London when he was stabbed to death on Friday.Police said they arrested a 25-year-old suspect and were investigating "a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism".Police have said the investigation is in the "very early stages", though multiple UK media outlets, citing sources, reported that the suspect was believed to be a British national with Somali heritage.Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the scene to pay his respects on Saturday, laying floral wreaths outside the church with the leader of the opposition, Labour leader Keir Starmer in a rare show of unity, along with the Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle and Home Secretary Priti Patel.Members of the public also came to lay bouquets next to the police tape surrounding the crime scene.Britain's politicians were stunned by the highly public attack, which recalled the murder of a pro-EU lawmaker ahead of the Brexit referendum.In June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, prompting demands for action against what lawmakers said was "a rising tide" of public abuse and threats against elected representatives.Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, who became an MP in the same constituency this year, said Amess' death had left her "scared and frightened"."This is the risk we are all taking and so many MPs will be scared by this," she added.Home Secretary Patel on Friday ordered police across the country to review security arrangements for all 650 MPs.House of Commons Speaker Hoyle promised no "knee-jerk reactions" but told Sky News: "We will take further measures if we need to".Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP who tried to save a stabbed police officer during a 2017 terror attack near the Houses of Parliament, on Twitter urged "a temporary pause in face to face meetings" until the security review is complete.Increasing threatsMPs and their staff have been attacked before, although it is rare.But their safety was thrown into sharp focus by Brexit, which stoked deep political divisions and has led to often angry, partisan rhetoric.Cox's killer repeatedly shouted "Britain first" before shooting and stabbing the 41-year-old MP outside her constituency meeting near Leeds, northern England.A specialist police unit set up to investigate threats against MPs in the aftermath said 678 crimes against lawmakers were reported between 2016 and 2020.Most (582) were for malicious communications, although other crimes included harassment (46), terrorism (nine), threats (seven), and common assault (three).Separate figures indicated a sharp rise in reports since 2018, including three threats to kill.Ex-MP Anna Soubry, who quit the Conservative party because of her opposition to Brexit, has spoken of being sent bullets during an intimidation campaign that also targeted her family."I do get frightened," she said at the time.Amess himself wrote about public harassment and online abuse in his book "Ayes & Ears: A Survivor's Guide to Westminster", published last year."These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians," he said.MPs have had to install security cameras and only meet constituents by appointment, he added.MPs' staff have also spoken of bearing the brunt of abuse."I would get in and all I would do is go on Facebook and report death threats and delete them," said Jade Botterill, who worked for senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper from 2013 to 2019."I reckon I reported over 1,000 death threats," she said, adding it caused her sleepless nights and fears she would be attacked.Brexit had been a turning point for staff working in constituency offices while an MP was in parliament were often on the frontline of daily public anger, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stabbing-of-british-mp-david-amess-a-terrorist-incident-uk-police-101634376746616.html

The latest spate of violence occurred in the southern town of Begumganj as more than 200 protesters attacked a temple when Hindu devotees were performing the last rituals on the final day of Durga Puja, reported news agency AFP citing police.According to the report, local police station chief Shah Imran said that the attackers on Friday stabbed an executive member of the temple committee to death. The next day, the police found the body of another Hindu man near a pond located next to the temple."Two men have died since yesterday's attack. We are working to find the culprits," AFP quoted district police chief Shahidul Islam as saying.The attacks against Hindus in the Muslim-majority nation started over the alleged desecration of the Quran, the central religious text of Islam. After footage of a Quran placed on the knee of goddess Durga’s idol at a puja pandal in Cumilla emerged, protesters attacked pandals and temples across the country.Reports suggest that anti-Hindu violence spread to more than a dozen districts across Bangladesh, including, Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.Also Read | Those attacking Durga Puja pandals will be hunted down, punished: Sheikh HasinaBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised stern action to the Hindu community leaders and warned those involved in the attacks on Hindu temples and Durga Puja pandals."The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn't matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished," she assured while speaking to the Hindu community during an event at Dhakeshwari National Temple in Dhaka.India said it was in close contact with Bangladesh authorities over the anti-Hindu violence, noting that the celebrations were continuing with the support of the government.“Our high commission in Dhaka, as well as our consulates in Bangladesh, are obviously in very close contact with the authorities in Dhaka and at local levels,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing Thursday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-hindu-men-killed-in-bangladesh-in-fresh-attack-on-a-temple-report-101634376814983.html

The rebuke, a rare reaction from the group, came as concerns about the commitment of the military junta in Myanmar to defuse the ongoing bloody crisis in that country, news agencies reported.Discussions to exclude Myanmar from the summit have been ongoing within Asean and the foreign ministers of the member states met on Friday regarding the issue. However, on Saturday, Brunei, which is the current chair of Asean, issued a statement confirming the exclusion of Min Aung Hlain, Myanmar’s military chief.Rather, the group has decided “to invite a non-political representative from Myanmar,” after some member nations called for giving “space to Myanmar to restore its internal affairs and return to normalcy,” news agency AFP reported, quoting Asean’s statement.Also read | UN says estimated 100,000 people internally displaced in Myanmar’s Kayah StateThe rebuke came after the group had insisted that Myanmar was showing an “insufficient progress” regarding the implementation of the five-point consensus agreed between the two parties in April this year. Also, the tensions increased after Myanmar’s junta refused firmly, the group’s request to allow a regional special envoy to meet all parties concerned to defuse the situation in the country, which would also include ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.This was not the first time Asean had expressed displeasure and concerns over Myanmar’s commitment to the agreement. Previously on several other occasions Asean had pushed for the military regime to enhance cooperation in addressing the crisis in that country.Earlier in February this year, the military ousted the democratically elected government in Myanmar citing voter frauds in the country’s general elections last year. Following the coup, Suu Kyi has since then been detained along with several other leaders of the party.Several protests erupted in the country following the military takeover, to which the regime has allegedly reacted with violence. Killings and internal displacement of people increased due to the violence that ensued, according to several organisations including the United Nations. Meanwhile, the UN and the international community, including countries like the US, have stated in the past that ASEAN should deal with the unfolding political crisis in Myanmar due to its proximity.Previously the UN has repeatedly expressed concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country due to the political events and also aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-decides-to-exclude-myanmar-military-chief-from-key-summit-on-october-26-reports-101634374260349.html

In a statement posted late Friday on social media, IS said two of the group's members shot and killed security guards manning the entrance of the Fatimiya mosque in Kandahar province. One detonated his explosives at the entrance of the mosque and the other inside.IS news agency Amaq in a statement gave the names of the attackers as Anas al-Khurasani and Abu Ali al-Baluchi, both Afghan nationals.The attack came a week after a bombing claimed by the local Islamic State affiliate killed 46 people at a Shiite mosque in northern Afghanistan, raising fears that IS — an enemy of both the Taliban and the West — is expanding its foothold in Afghanistan.Friday's attack was the deadliest to strike Afghanistan since the dramatic US exit from the country, which allowed the Taliban to seize control of the Afghan capital. It was also the first major attack by the group in the country's south.IS carries out frequent attacks in its eastern stronghold, but recently has shown signs of expansion, with attacks in the north and Kabul. The attacks have brought into question the Taliban's ability to counter the growing IS threat.The Taliban have pledged to restore peace and security after decades of war and have also given the US assurances that they will not allow the country to be used as a base for launching extremist attacks on other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-islamic-state-group-claims-deadly-mosque-bombing-in-kandahar-101634372118592.html
16-10-2021||World||New Zealand administers record number of Covid vaccines at 'Vaxathon'||New Zealand health care workers administered a record number of vaccine jabs Saturday as the nation held a festival aimed at getting more people inoculated against the coronavirus.Musicians, sports stars and celebrities pitched in for the “Vaxathon” event which was broadcast on television and online for eight hours straight. By late afternoon, more than 120,000 people had gotten shots, eclipsing the daily record of 93,000 set in August. The event stretched into the evening.A throwback to TV fundraising “telethon” events that were popular from the 1970s through the 1990s, it comes as New Zealand faces its biggest threat since the pandemic began, with an outbreak of the delta variant spreading through the largest city of Auckland and beyond.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who chatted with motorists at a drive-through vaccination center in Wellington, initially set a target of 100,000 jabs for the day but upped that to 150,000 after the first target was met.She also set a target of 25,000 shots for Indigenous Maori, whose vaccination numbers have been lagging and who have been hit hard by the latest outbreak.National carrier Air New Zealand converted a Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane into a vaccination clinic for the day, issuing people boarding passes on “Flight NZVAX.”Singer Lorde beamed in from abroad, saying she couldn't wait to come back home to play a concert and have everyone get sweaty and dance.“I am the first person to admit that I find getting injections really icky, but ever since I was a kid, I have treated myself by going to the bakery after an injection, normally for a custard tart," she said. "So you could do that.”New Zealand has so far used only the Pfizer vaccine.For much of the pandemic, New Zealanders have lived completely free from the virus after the government successfully eliminated each outbreak through strict lockdowns and contact tracing.That zero-tolerance strategy failed for the first time after the outbreak of the more contagious delta variant began in August. Until then, New Zealand was slow to immunize its population. It since has been making up for lost ground.Before the Vaxathon, about 72% of New Zealanders had received at least one dose and 54% were fully vaccinated. Among those aged 12 and over, the proportion was about 83% and 62% respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-dispenses-administers-record-number-of-covid-vaccines-at-vaxathon-101634369926614.html

He knew he was going to do it," it quoted Councillor Daniel Nelson as saying.The police are investigating it as a terrorist incident, and the MPs are pressing for tougher security in the wake of the second killing of a UK politician while meeting constituents in just over five years.Police have said the investigation is in the "very early stages".Britain's politicians were stunned by the highly public attack, which recalled the murder of a pro-EU lawmaker ahead of the Brexit referendum.In June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, prompting demands for action against what lawmakers said was "a rising tide" of public abuse and threats against elected representatives.Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, who became an MP in the same constituency this year, said Amess' death had left her "scared and frightened".Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday ordered police across the country to review security arrangements for all 650 MPs.Amess, who leaves a wife and five children, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 for his service, becoming Sir David.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mp-david-amess-was-stabbed-17-times-attack-was-planned-says-report-101634366303886.html

Ten members of the family, including seven children, were killed. News agency AFP reported that US intelligence officials had tracked Ahmadi’s car for eight hours before the missile was fired.The US military, which admitted its mistake, previously described the strike target as an Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) leader who was driving an explosives-laden car to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.However, multiple media reports stated that Ezmarai Ahmadi was an aid worker and had nothing to do with the Islamic State.During Thursday’s meeting, Steven Kwon told Dr Colin Kahl that Ahmadi had worked with the aid group NEI for many years, providing care and lifesaving assistance for people facing high mortality rates in Afghanistan.“Dr Kahl noted that the strike was a tragic mistake and that Mr Ahmadi and others who were killed were innocent victims who bore no blame and were not affiliated with ISIS-K or threats to US forces,” Pentagon spokesperson Kirby said in the statement and refused to comment on how much compensation will be offered to the relatives.Even though defence secretary Lloyd Austin has apologised for the August attack, the relatives said that it is not enough. “They must come here and apologise to us face-to-face,” Farshad Haidari, the nephew of Ezmarai Ahmadi told AFP. In September, Haidari, whose brother and cousins were also killed in the strike, claimed that the United States made no direct contact with the family.(With AFP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-offers-to-pay-relatives-of-afghans-killed-in-kabul-drone-strike-in-august-101634363869566.html
16-10-2021||World||Seven Hong Kong pro-democracy activists jailed over unauthorised protest in 2020||Seven Hong Kong democracy campaigners, including former lawmakers, were sentenced on Saturday to up to 12 months in jail for their role in a protest last year against a sweeping national security law imposed by China.The seven had pleaded guilty to charges that included organising the unauthorised assembly on July 1, 2020, when thousands of protesters took to the streets. Police, who had banned the demonstration citinbg coronavirus restrictions, fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse them.The activists included Figo Chan, a former convenor of the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF); Tsang Kin-shing and Tang Sai-lai of the League of Social Democrats; former district councillor Andy Chui; and former legislators Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu and Leung Kwok-hung.Chan was jailed for 12 months, while the others were given sentences from six to ten months."The nature of incitement was serious," said the judge, Douglas Yau, noting that it created the risk of violence.Beijing imposed a national security law on June 30 last year as a response to widespread anti-government protests in 2019 that roiled the city. The law, drawn up by China, sets out to punish subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.The protest took place the next day - the first full day under the new law, though civil society groups had held deminstrations on July 1 for years to champion various issues, including democratic rights.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise its wide-ranging freedoms and high degree of autonomy would be preserved. Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly denied curbing human rights and freedoms."We could only choose civil disobedience… a peaceful, rational and non-violent way to express our demand against the national security law," Figo Chan said in mitigation."In order to uphold the belief of civil disobedience, I decided to plead guilty, admitting that I violated the "evil public order law"."At least 370 people were arrested that day for illegal assembly and other offences, with ten involving violations of the security law, according to police.Tong Ying-kit, the first person convicted under the national security law, was sentenced in July to nine years in prison for terrorist activities and inciting secession.He was accused of driving his motorcycle that day into riot police while carrying a flag with the now-banned protest slogan "Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our times".According to the Security Bureau, more than 150 people have been arrested under the national security law. Among them, 100 people have been formally charged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists-jailed-over-unauthorised-protest-in-2020-101634358859985.html

Any day that we wait -- it’s a day lost for those girls that are out of school.”During the Taliban's previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996-2001, they denied girls and women the right to education and barred them from working and public life. Since their Aug. 15 takeover of Afghanistan as US and NATO forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country after 20 years, the Taliban have come under increasing international pressure to ensure women’s rights to education and work.Abdi said that in every meeting he pressed the Taliban “to let girls resume their learning,” calling it “critical for the girls themselves and for the country as a whole.”When the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harboring Osama bin Laden who masterminded the 9/11 attacks on the United States, only one million Afghan children were in school at all levels, he said.Over the past 20 years, that figure rose to almost 10 million children at all levels, including 4 million girls, Abdi said, and in the last decade the number of schools tripled from 6,000 to 18,000.“Education gains of the past two decades must be strengthened and not rolled back,” he said.But the deputy chief of the United Nations Children’s Fund said despite this progress, 4.2 million Afghan children are out of school including 2.6 million girls.If all girls are allowed to attend secondary school, Abdi said, efforts must still be made to overcome resistance from conservatives to allowing them to get a secondary education.“The authorities that I’ve met said that when they put in place the framework that they are working on, it will convince more parents to send their girls to school” because it will address concerns in conservative societies about separating girls and boys and female teachers, he said.“So, that has to be seen,” Abdi said.While in Kabul, the UNICEF deputy chief said he also visited a children’s hospital “and was shocked to see how packed it was with malnourished children, some of them babies.”Abdi said the health system and social services are on the verge of collapse, medical supplies are running dangerously low, outbreaks of measles and watery diarrhea are increasing, and polio and Covid-19 remain serious concerns.“Even before the Taliban takeover, at least 10 million children across the country were in need of humanitarian assistance to survive,” he said, “and at least one million of these children are at risk of dying due to severe acute malnutrition if they are not treated immediately.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the world to prevent the Afghan economy from collapsing and help the Afghan people, an appeal echoed by Abdi who said “the situation is critical and it will only get worse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-announce-secondary-school-for-girls-says-un-official-101634356787951.html
16-10-2021||World||Former Boeing pilot involved in Max testing indicted||A former Boeing pilot was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on charges of deceiving safety regulators about the 737 Max jetliner, which was later involved in two deadly crashes.The indictment charges Mark A. Forkner with giving the Federal Aviation Administration false and incomplete information about an automated flight-control system that played a role in the crashes, which killed 346 people.Prosecutors said that because of Forkner's alleged deception, the system was not mentioned in pilot manuals or training materials.An attorney for Forkner did not immediately respond for comment. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment.Forkner, 49, was charged with two counts of fraud involving aircraft parts in interstate commerce and four counts of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors said he is expected to make his first appearance in court on Friday in Fort Worth, Texas. If convicted on all counts, he could face a sentence of up to 100 years in prison.The indictment charges that he hid information about a flight-control system that activated erroneously and pushed down the noses of Max jets that crashed in 2018 in Indonesia, and 2019 in Ethiopia. The pilots tried unsuccessfully to regain control, but both planes went into nosedives minutes after taking off.Forkner was Boeing's chief technical pilot on the Max program. Prosecutors said that Forkner learned about an important change to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System flight-control system in 2016, but withheld the information from the FAA. That led the agency to delete reference to MCAS from a technical report and, in turn, it didn't appear in pilot manuals. Most pilots didn't know about MCAS until after the first crash.Prosecutors suggested that Forkner downplayed the power of the system to avoid a requirement that pilots undergo extensive and expensive retraining, which would increase training costs for airlines. Congressional investigators suggested additional training would have added $1 million to the price of each plane.“In an attempt to save Boeing money, Forkner allegedly withheld critical information from regulators,” said Chad Meacham, acting U.S. attorney for the northern district of Texas. “His callous choice to mislead the FAA hampered the agency's ability to protect the flying public and left pilots in the lurch, lacking information about certain 737 MAX flight controls."Forkner told another Boeing employee in 2016 that MCAS was “egregious” and “running rampant” when he tested it in a flight simulator, but he didn't tell that to the FAA.“So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly),” Forkner wrote in a message that became public in 2019.Forkner, who lives in a Fort Worth suburb, joined Southwest Airlines after leaving Boeing, but left the airline about a year ago.Chicago-based Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement to end a Justice Department investigation into the company's actions. The government agreed to drop a criminal charge of conspiracy against Boeing after three years if the company carries out terms of the January 2020 settlement. The settlement included a $243.6 million fine, nearly $1.8 billion for airlines that bought the plane and $500 million for a fund to compensate families of the passengers who were killed.Dozens of families of passengers are suing Boeing in federal court in Chicago.Crash investigations highlighted the role of MCAS but also pointed to mistakes by the airlines and pilots. Max jets were grounded worldwide for more than a year and a half. The FAA approved the plane for flying again late last year after Boeing made changes to MCAS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-boeing-pilot-involved-in-max-testing-indicted-101634354079052.html

16-10-2021||World||Joe Biden recalls single parenthood struggle in child care pitch||President Joe Biden made a deeply personal appeal Friday for a transformation of America's lagging child care services, saying that the crash that killed his wife and daughter demonstrated the importance of helping parents struggling with work and raising families.Biden, who became a single parent juggling a political career and two young boys after the accident in 1972, said during a speech in Connecticut that he "could not afford the child care" on a senator's salary, forcing him to commute daily between Washington and Delaware."It made me realize how difficult it is for the vast majority of people who need help," Biden said at child care center in the state capital Hartford.Part of a national tour to drum up support for his proposals, Biden's second presidential visit to the Constitution State came during a crucial phase for his historic but controversial spending plans, which face opposition from his own side as well as from Republicans.It is far from the first time he has spoken publicly about the crash that killed his wife Neilia and their one-year-old daughter Naomi.But the president reframed the horrific episode as a learning moment that made him realize most Americans don't have the help of an extended family that he benefited from when they are struggling to raise families."I've been conscious of the concern in a lack of access, and a lack of financial ability to have child care, for a long time," he said.Child care is being held up as critical to the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic -- but the administration argues that the United States invests far less in children than comparable economies.- 'Game changer' - The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says the nation invests less in early childhood education and care relative to the size of the economy than all but two of the world's 37 leading developed countries.The cost of child care for the average family in Connecticut is $16,000, according to Hartford's Democratic mayor Luke Bronin, who called the Biden child care agenda "a game changer.""How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, can't be part of the workforce because they can't afford the cost of childcare?" Biden said.Parents' difficulties in hanging on to jobs also contributes to a wide gender gap in workforce participation between mothers, who still take on the greater burden of care, and fathers.Biden is proposing to bridge the gap with federal subsidies for low and middle-income Americans that would cap families' child care expenses at seven percent of their income.He wants to offer large subsidies to child care centers, raise wages for those who work in the industry and increase child credit from $2,000 to $3,000 a year for children aged over six."It's never a good bet to bet against the American people. It's time for us to invest in ourselves, show the world that American democracy works," Biden said."We've always led the world not by the example of our physical power, but by the power of our example. That's why the world has followed."- 'Lift up families' - Republicans vehemently oppose White House proposals for a multi-trillion-dollar social spending package that calls for Biden's child care provisions.The Democrats in Congress have enough lawmakers without Republican help to pass the historic blueprint -- which includes improved benefits for college students and seniors, cash for health care coverage and provisions to help rescue a warming planet.But House of Representatives liberals balk at cutting the $3.5 trillion top line to $1.5 trillion over 10 years, which a small group of moderates favor.Biden has told progressives that the end goal should be around $2 trillion as he tries to wrangle sufficient Democratic votes.This means confronting grueling choices between funding fewer programs for longer periods of time or more programs for shorter stints, in hopes they will be renewed by future Congresses.Polling shows that as little as one in 10 Americans known specifics about the contents of the plan but Bronin said broad improvements in child care were overwhelmingly popular among Americans."It would lift up families across this country, open up pathways to opportunity, make sure that we keep our middle class strong," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-recalls-single-parenthood-struggle-in-child-care-pitch-101634349115776.html
16-10-2021||World||US health advisers endorse booster shot for J&J Covid-19 vaccine||US health advisers endorsed a booster of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine Friday, citing concern that Americans who got the single-dose shot aren’t as protected as those given two-dose brands.J&J told the Food and Drug Administration that an extra dose adds important protection as early as two months after initial vaccination — but that it might work better if people wait until six months later. Unable to settle the best timing, the FDA's advisory panel voted unanimously that the booster should be offered at least two months after people got their earlier shot.“I think this frankly was always a two-dose vaccine,” said FDA adviser Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It would be hard to recommend this as a single-dose vaccine at this point.”The FDA isn't bound by the recommendation as it makes a final decision — and adding to the debate's complexity, new research also suggests that J&J recipients might have a stronger immune response if their booster dose is from a competing brand.Preliminary results from an ongoing study of different ways to “mix and match” different shots showed that a booster of any sort revved up people's levels of virus-fighting antibodies — at least for a few weeks. And the most dramatic jump came from giving a Pfizer or Moderna shot after the single-dose J&J vaccination.FDA's advisers didn't vote on whether that should be recommended but told the government to allow flexibility with boosters, saying there were no safety red flags even if it's not yet clear just how much difference, if any, mixing and matching may make in long-term protection.“In the real world all these kind of combinations are already happening so I think it’s a matter of some urgency for the FDA to help sort out what is admittedly a complicated and challenging scenario,” said Dr. Ofer Levy of Boston Children's Hospital.The government says all three US vaccines continue to offer strong protection against hospitalization and death from Covid-19, and that the priority is getting first shots to the 66 million eligible but unvaccinated Americans who are most at risk. But with the spread of the extra-contagious delta variant and signs of waning immunity against milder infections, the nation is moving toward a broader booster campaign.Last month Pfizer boosters started being offered to seniors and younger adults at high risk from Covid-19 because of poor health, jobs or living conditions — at least six months after their initial vaccination. Thursday, the FDA advisory panel recommended the same approach for half-dose Moderna boosters.But J&J's vaccine has consistently shown lower effectiveness levels across a series of studies — and the FDA panel ultimately settled on another shot for any recipient 18 or older at least two months after their first vaccination."This is really -- with the second dose -- bringing it, I think, on par with those other vaccines in terms of effectiveness,” said Dr. Archana Chatterjee of Rosalind Franklin University.The FDA will use its advisers’ recommendations to decide whether to authorize boosters for both J&J and Moderna. Next, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would rule on who should roll up their sleeves.The vast majority of the 188 million Americans who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have received the Pfizer or Moderna options, while J&J recipients account for only about 15 million.J&J’s vaccine is made with a different technology and on Friday, the company pitched its booster as a way to strengthen a robust vaccine that they said has retained its protective power over eight months. But FDA scientists pointedly challenged that assertion.“There are data that suggest the effectiveness of this vaccine is actually less robust than the company’s presentation here," said Dr. Peter Marks, FDA's top vaccines official. “And that is a finding of concern particularly because that’s been seen in minority communities potentially and others.”As for its booster, J&J presented results from a large study that found giving a second dose just two months after the first bumped protection against symptomatic Covid-19 to 94 per cent from 70 per cent in US recipients. Giving that booster six months later instead prompted an even bigger jump in virus-fighting antibodies.But in their own review, FDA scientists noted only a tiny portion of cases involved the delta variant, by far the dominant strain in the U.S. And while FDA's reviewers found no new safety concerns about a second J&J dose, they noted other shortcomings. J&J followed booster recipients for little more than a month, making it hard to draw conclusions about the durability of protection. Also, FDA scientists stressed they hadn't had time to independently confirm J&J's data, which were submitted shortly before the meeting. That's highly unusual and drew serious concern from the advisory panel.The J&J vaccine was highly anticipated for its one-and-done formulation. But its rollout earlier this year was hurt by a series of troubles including manufacturing problems and some rare but serious side effects including a blood clot disorder and a neurological reaction called Guillain-Barre syndrome. In both cases, regulators decided the shot’s benefits outweighed those risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-advisers-endorse-booster-shot-for-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-101634347043212.html

The acts, the Taliban are talking about here, would constitute clear gross abuses of human rights, and we stand firm with the international community to hold perpetrators of any such abuses accountable," Price had said.In September, multiple media reports had emerged that the Taliban's official in charge of prisons and former justice minister of Afghanistan, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, said punishments such as executions and amputations will resume in the country.After announcing the government in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime has failed to get recognition. Aside from China, Pakistan and a handful of other countries, the rest of the world is taking a wait and watch policy while keeping an eye on the conduct of the outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ask-officials-not-to-carry-out-public-executions-unless-directed-by-top-court-report-101634345577622.html

It is an initiative by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. This global event marks a day calling for worldwide awareness and collective action to combat the issue of hunger and ensure healthy diets for all.This year, the World Food Day commemorations will be jointly led by the FAO, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the World Food Programme (WFP). Events will be organised in 150 countries across the globe with multiple partners and governments, according to the United Nations.The theme this year is “Our actions are our future. Better production, better nutrition, better environment and a better life”.History of World Food DayWorld Food Day was established in November 1979, as suggested by former Hungarian minister of agriculture and food Dr Pal Romany. It gradually became a way to raise awareness about hunger, malnutrition, sustainability and food production.Significance of World Food DayWorld Food Day is celebrated to mark the anniversary of the founding of the FAO of the United Nations, every year. This day aims at tackling global hunger and striving to eradicate hunger across the world.Focus area of World Food Day 2021The FAO said that today’s agri-food systems are exposing profound inequalities and injustices. At least two billion people don't have regular access to sufficient amounts of safe, nutritious food, while three billion cannot afford healthy diets and obesity continues to increase worldwide.It further said that vast quantities of food are lost even when millions of people go hungry every day. The food is either spoiled during production or transport or thrown into the waste bins of households, retailers or restaurants. Further area of concern is generation of greenhouse gas like methane by food waste which is filling up the world's landfills.FAO said that to fix this, collective action is needed so that everyone has enough safe and nutritious food to eat, and the entire food supply chain is more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.For this shift to happen, everyone must play their part, said the FAO, listing action plans for countries, farmers, private sectors and the civil society.This World Food Day is the second to be marked during Covid-19, which has had devastating repercussions for food security worldwide. The FAO said that the Covid-19 pandemic has induced an economic recession that could add up to 100 million or more to the 690 million people already suffering from hunger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101634341723308.html

She told Reuters she denies leaking.Parrish said she deleted apps that contained details of her finances and other personal information before handing her devices in to Apple as part of the probe.Parrish said she believes she was fired for her activism in the workplace."To me, this seems clearly retaliatory for the fact that I was speaking out about abuses that have happened at my employer, pay equity and, generally, about our workplace conditions," she said.Apple said Friday it does not discuss specific employee matters.Apple has recently experienced other examples of employee unrest. Last month, two Apple employees told Reuters they had filed charges investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02 against the company with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers accused Apple of retaliation and halting discussion of pay among employees, among other allegations.Apple has said that it is "deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace" and that it takes "all concerns" from employees seriously.U.S. law protects the right of employees to openly discuss certain topics, including working conditions, discrimination and equal pay.Over the summer, current and former Apple employees began detailing on social media what they said were experiences of harassment and discrimination. Parrish and some colleagues began publishing the stories on social media and a publishing platform in a weekly digest titled '#AppleToo.'Parrish said she was careful to respect company rules and never shared information that she believed to be confidential. She said she continued to publish the '#AppleToo' digest after coming under investigation at the end of September."If anything, it's made the importance of that work clearer than ever, when Apple's response to criticism is to start internal investigations into those that it wants to see gone," she said.

16-10-2021||World||Russia says it chased out US navy destroyer from its water: Report||Moscow said Friday that one of its warships chased away a US Navy destroyer after it attempted to violate Russia's territorial waters in the Sea of Japan, but Washington denied this.The incident took place as Russia and China were conducting naval exercises in the area.The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that at around 5 pm local time (0800GMT), the destroyer USS Chafee, which had been operating in the Sea of Japan for several days, "approached the territorial waters of the Russian Federation and attempted to cross the border."Russia's Admiral Tributs destroyer issued a warning to the US ship "about the inadmissibility of such actions."However, the USS Chafee ignored the warning and "took action to violate the national border of the Russian Federation," according to the Russian Defense Ministry."Acting within the framework of the international rules of navigation, the Admiral Tributs set a course for ousting the intruder from the Russian territorial waters."After that, the USS Chafee turned around and set off "on the opposite course" when it was less than 60 meters away from the Russian ship.The US Navy dismissed the Russian account as "false."It said in a statement that its ship "was conducting routine operations in international water in the Sea of Japan" when a Russian destroyer came within approximately 65 yards of the USS Chafee "while the ship was preparing for flight operations.""The interaction was safe and professional," the US navy said.The US Navy acknowledged that Russia had notified it that it was conducting maneuvers in the area, but the notice "was not in effect at the time of the interaction."The US ship "conducted operations in accordance with international law and custom," the statement read. "The United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate where international law allows."Incidents involving the Russian Navy are rare in the Pacific. The region is dominated by China, which takes a dim view of the United States and its allies patrolling the region's international waters to assert their right to freedom of navigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-it-chased-out-us-navy-destroyer-from-its-water-us-denies-charges-101634340474655.html
16-10-2021||World||UK police says murder of MP Amess was a terrorist incident||The fatal stabbing of British MP David Amess was a terrorist incident, police said Saturday, at they investigated the second killing of a UK politician while meeting voters since 2016.The Metropolitan Police said its preliminary findings had revealed "a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism".Amess, a 69-year-old pro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker, was stabbed to death inside a church on Friday while holding a fortnightly consultation with his constituents in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, east of London.Police arrested a 25-year-old man at the scene on suspicion of murder and recovered a knife.Essex police said officers had responded "within minutes" to reports of the stabbing shortly after 12:05 pm (1105 GMT) and arrived to find Amess had "suffered multiple injuries"."This was a difficult incident, but our officers and paramedics from the East of England Ambulance Service worked extremely hard to save Sir David," Harrington said."Tragically he died at the scene."A father-of-five who was first elected to parliament in 1983, Amess was memorialised with an impromptu evening mass while tributes poured in from across the political spectrum and around the world.Multiple UK media outlets, citing sources, reported that the suspect was believed to be a British national with Somali heritage."The investigation is in its very early stages and is being led by officers from the specialist counter-terrorism command," Ben-Julian Harrington, Essex police's chief constable, told reporters."We made it clear at the time of the incident that we did not believe there was any immediate further threat to anyone else in the area," Harrington said.'Much-loved'The killing has sent shockwaves around Britain.Flags were lowered to half-mast in Westminster as tributes were paid to Amess, whose death came five years after the murder of Labour party MP Jo Cox by a far-right extremist.In a book last year called "Ayes & Ears: A Survivor's Guide to Westminster", Amess noted that Cox's death had prompted new security guidance to lawmakers that threatened to limit their access to constituents."This sort of thing just was not supposed to happen in the UK," he wrote about Cox's killing."These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians."Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Amess was "a much-loved friend and colleague" and "a fine public servant"."The reason I think people are so shocked and saddened is above all he was one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics."Dozens of local community members honoured their elected representative in a mass held at another Leigh-on-Sea church near the crime scene on Friday evening."He died doing the thing he loved -- meeting his constituents," said Jeff Woolnough, a priest who led the liturgy.'Attack on democracy'All Britain's living former prime ministers also paid tribute to Amess, including Theresa May, who called it "a tragic day for our democracy".Prince William and his wife Kate said the couple were "shocked and saddened" and noted Amess had "dedicated 40 years of his life to serving his community".Condolences also came from the United States, Canada and Spain."An attack on elected officials is an attack on democracy," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted.Britain's House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said Amess had "built a reputation for kindness and generosity" during his long parliamentary career."In the coming days, we will need to discuss and examine MPs' security and any measures to be taken, but for now, our thoughts and prayers are with David's family, friends and colleagues," Hoyle added.Interior Minister Priti Patel's spokesman said she had chaired a meeting of police, security and intelligence agencies and "asked all police forces to review security arrangements for MPs with immediate effect".'Cowardly as it gets'Amess was first elected during Margaret Thatcher's tenure and was known for his advocacy of animal welfare and pro-life issues.He had advertised Friday's "surgery" -- an open meeting for constituents -- at the Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea.While public attacks on British MPs are not common, lawmakers have been the victims of stabbings in the past.In January 2000, Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones was wounded and his assistant killed by a man wielding a ceremonial sword at a surgery.Pro-EU MP Cox was killed in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, while another Labour MP, Stephen Timms, was stabbed multiple times during an event in 2010 but recovered and is still a lawmaker.Timms said he was "appalled" at this latest attack.Cox's widower Brendan said it was "as cowardly as it gets".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-says-murder-of-mp-amess-was-a-terrorist-incident-101634340153854.html
16-10-2021||World||Brazil Covid probe could lead to Bolsonaro facing 11 criminal charges: Report||A Brazilian Senate probe into the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic will recommend in its final report due next week that President Jair Bolsonaro face 11 criminal charges, the senator leading the inquiry said on Friday, though it remains highly unlikely that he will face a trial on any such charges.Renan Calheiros said during a radio interview that the investigation launched in April has collected evidence to show that Bolsonaro should be formally charged with genocide against the country's indigenous population, malfeasance, irregular use of public funds, violation of sanitary measures, incitement to crime and forgery of private documents, among other crimes.The far-right president, who himself was infected with the coronavirus in July 2020, has railed against lockdown measures, pushed unproven cures, sowed vaccine doubts and downplayed the severity of Covid-19.The report is scheduled to be released by the Senate investigative panel next Tuesday. The panel's members the following day are set to vote on approving the text before sending it on the attorney general's office on Thursday to decide if Bolsonaro and others should be charged.The attorney general's office can charge the president, but the Supreme Court, which would try him, must request authorization from the lower house to proceed. Experts say the lower house is highly unlikely to sign off on such a request.The president's office did not immediately respond to request for comment.Bolsonaro's approval ratings have fallen in public opinion polls over his handling of the public health crisis. More than 600,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Brazil, second only to the United States.The report is also likely to recommend that some of Bolsonaro's sons and his former Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello also be charged with crimes, Calheiros said. Calheiros did not identify which sons may face charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-covid-probe-could-lead-to-bolsonaro-facing-11-criminal-charges-report-101634339934504.html

But a spokesman said Friday that he was doing better and was in good spirits.“All health indicators are trending in the right direction, including his white blood count which has decreased significantly," spokesman Angel Ureña said in a statement.Clinton, 75, will remain at the University of California Irvine Medical Center overnight so that he can receive further intravenous antibiotics, Ureña said.“President Clinton continues to be in excellent spirits, and is deeply grateful for the outstanding care he is receiving and the well wishes that people have sent from across America and around the world," the statement said.An aide to the former president said that Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital, though not receiving ICU care.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, did not elaborate on the reason Clinton was in the ICU. He said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.Clinton was in good spirits and juggling books and watching TV coverage about his hospitalization, the aide said. Hillary Clinton was with him in the hospital, though not his daughter, Chelsea Clinton. There was no immediate word on any timeline for his release.President Joe Biden said Friday during remarks at the University of Connecticut that he had spoken to Clinton and the former president “sends his best.”"We’re all thinking about President Clinton today," he said. "He’s always been the comeback kid.”Later, Biden told reporters that Clinton is “not in any serious condition" and is “getting out shortly.”Clinton was hospitalized on Tuesday evening for what Ureña only described as a non-COVID-19-related infection.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.He repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, mostly notably his wife, Hillary, during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation said the former president was in the Los Angeles area for private events related to his charitable organization. The UCI Medical Center is in Orange County, about 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Los Angeles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-clinton-recovering-from-urological-infection-to-stay-in-hospital-overnight-101634339253658.html

"While CDC has not recommended mixing types of vaccine in a primary series, we recognize that this is increasingly common in other countries so should be accepted for the interpretation of vaccine records," a CDC spokeswoman said.The White House said Friday the new vaccine requirements for foreign nationals traveling to the United States will begin Nov. 8 for visitors crossing at land borders as well as international air travelers.Representative Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat representing a district along the Canadian border, had on Friday asked the CDC if it would accept the mixed vaccine doses noting "nearly four million Canadians, equivalent to 10% of their fully vaccinated population, have received mixed doses of the available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines – this includes the AstraZeneca vaccine."The CDC said the vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use, as well as those authorized by the WHO, will be accepted for entry into the United States, including the AstraZeneca vaccine.The CDC said "individuals who have any combination of two doses of an FDA approved/authorized or WHO emergency use listed COVID-19 two-dose series are considered fully vaccinated."The CDC plans to answer other questions and release a contact tracing order for international air visitors by Oct. 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-accept-mixed-doses-of-vaccines-from-international-travelers-says-cdc-101634338337192.html

An Iskcon temple was also vandalised as protests continued for the third day in the country.Shops and houses of Hindus were allegedly vandalised when the mob took out a rally in Noakhali’s Begumganj Upazila, Dhaka Times reported quoting superintendent of police (Circle Begumganj) Md Shah Imran.The victim has been indentified as 42-year-old Jatan Kumar, Imran said.Separately, Iskcon, a religious Hindu organisation, alleged its temple in Noakhali and devotees were attacked by the mob.“ISKCON temple & devotees were violently attacked today by a mob in Noakhali, Bangladesh. Temple suffered significant damage & the condition of a devotee remains critical,” it tweeted with pictures showing the damage in the premises.As many as 17 people, including the officer-in-charge of Begumganj police station Kamruzzaman Sikder, were injured in the attacks in Noakhali, the SP said.Elsewhere in Bangladesh, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as thousands of protesters took to the streets in the country’s two main cities on Friday, authorities said.The protests began on Wednesday after images purportedly showed a copy of the Quran — Islam’s holy book — on the knee of an idol during Durga Puja celebrations in Cumilla district, triggering incidents of vandalism at Hindu temples across other parts of the country.At least four people were killed late Wednesday when police opened fire on a crowd of around 500 people attacking a temple in Hajiganj, one of the towns hit by the disturbances.On Friday, up to 2,500 Muslim worshippers gathered outside Baitul Mukarram Masjid, Bangladesh’s largest mosque in central Dhaka, demanding “exemplary punishment” for the “desecration” of the Quran.Sajjad Hossain, a deputy commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said several people were injured after the police charged with batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd, which was attempting to break through a police barricade.Sazzadur Rahman, Dhaka’s deputy police commissioner, said at least five officers were injured and three protesters were held.In Chittagong, meanwhile, police fired 50 rounds of blanks to disperse hundreds of Muslim protesters who hurled missiles at officers guarding a makeshift temple, local police official Bijoy Basak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-attack-on-a-temple-as-tension-remains-in-bangladesh-101634324377071.html
16-10-2021||India||BJP only knows how to provide lip-service, says Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday took pot-shots at the ruling BJP over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, saying the ruling party only knows lip service and how to mow down people. His criticism of the BJP came days after eight people, including four farmers, were killed in violence during a farmers’ protest in Lakhimpur Kheri. Though BJP leader and Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra has been arrested after he was accused of mowing down farmers with his vehicle, Akhilesh had been demanding sacking of the minister. “The truth is the BJP knows only two things – ‘jeebh chalana’ (lip service and lofty talk) and ‘jeep chadhana’ (mowing down people). Crushing people and suppressing their voice is their (BJP) agenda,” Yadav said while addressing party workers at the Samajwadi Party state headquarters in Lucknow. Ashish Mishra and others have been named in the FIR filed in this connection and the latter was arrested last week. Claiming that the BJP government’s tenure was “full of failures”, Yadav alleged that because of “wrong policies” of the ruling party, the state was lagging behind and there was no control on inflation and unemployment. The law and order situation also got worse, said a party statement, quoting Yadav. “The BJP government has not done any work in public interest. It is a strange party, which is making tall claims without doing anything. The double-engine government of the BJP has harassed every section of society and has not done anything itself but has been appearing in advertisements claiming the work of the Samajwadi Party government as its own,” he said. Speaking about the 2022 assembly elections, he said it would decide the direction of national politics and would also be a testing time for democracy. Cautioning the workers, the SP chief said, “We have to be careful of the possible conspiracies of the BJP. Since the BJP is very clever, this time there should be no mistake and SP workers and leaders need to mobilise themselves up to the booth level.” He said people’s problems will end and the interest of farmers and youth will be protected only when the SP forms a government in the state.

The CWC is deeply distressed to note the multiple challenges that face the country and the all-round failure of the Modi government in dealing with these challenges. In fact, the catastrophic policies of the Modi government have exacerbated the situation and have placed enormous burden on the people of the country,” the resolution read.After listing the multiple failures of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, territorial disputes with China, drug trafficking through the Mundra port, “sharp decline” in the economy and the three controversial agricultural laws, they said, “The Congress Party will resist every sinister attempt to convert the country into a surveillance and police state”. The CWC members further elaborated, “Under the Modi government, the Constitutional promise of Liberty and Justice for all has receded into a vain hope.”The CWC’s resolution concluded by issuing a public call to all democratic parties to resolutely oppose the Modi government’s unjust actions. “The CWC believes that it is its duty to sound the alarm bells. We do so and call upon all democratic parties and forces to join hands to resolutely oppose the Modi government in order to protect the values on which our country was founded and to advance the causes of the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-passes-resolution-on-political-situation-says-india-has-earned-label-of-electoral-democracy-101634404928181.html

However, he mentioned the arrest of NCP leader Nawab Malik's son-in-law and said that in his case, the court highlighted that he was not possessing ganja but it was some kind of plant, Pawar said, as quoted by news agency PTI.“Since Nawab Malik who is the spokesperson of the NCP cannot be attacked directly, his son-in-law was targeted by the Centre with the help of the agency (NCB). His son-in-law was arrested and kept in jail for possession of ganja. But fortunately, a few days ago his bail was approved. The court highlighted that he was not possessing ganja but it was some kind of plant. This is the second example of the misuse of power and investigating machinery", Pawar said.Are you on the side of drug sellers, consumers? Fadnavis' question to Uddhav ThackerayA day after Uddhav Thackeray assailed the NCB saying that they are only interested in catching celebrities, taking photos with them, the NCP supremo said the NCB catches anyone and alleges that a banned substance has been found from his possession."People who are involved in crimes have been made panch (witness). In Malik's son-in-law's case, the witness is having a criminal record. In a recent raid too (on a cruise ship in Mumbai) one Gosavi, who was a witness of the NCB, is found to be a criminal on record,” he claimed.The Pune Police have recently issued a lookout circular against KP Gosavi, the man who took the viral photo with Aryan Khan after the latter's arrest. The police said he has been absconding in a 2018 cheating case. The NCB earlier clarified that the agency requires independent witnesses in each case. These witnesses are not known to the agency and fielf verification of such independent witnesses is not possible on a real-time basus as the main focus is on the operation.Pawar said when a constituent party under the MVA speaks on the action taken by the NCB or other agencies, BJP leaders jumped in to defend these agencies. “When there are allegations against agencies like NCB ideally its official or a spokesperson should come forward to present their side. However, it is found that former CM Devendra Fadnavis and other BJP leaders are coming forward to defend them,” he alleged.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-said-it-was-not-ganja-but-some-plant-sharad-pawar-on-ncb-action-101634403498391.html

16-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan case: Why did NCB refer to Showik Chakraborty case? Explained||During the hearing of the Aryan Khan case this week, the Narcotics Control Bureau referred to the case of Showik Chakraborty, who was arrested by the agency in September 2020 on charges of procuring drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput, who was found dead. Showik and his sister Rhea Chakraborty, Sushant's friend, were accused of procuring drugs for the deceased actor. Showik spent almost three months in jail after he was granted bail in December last year. The case was mentioned by additional solicitor general Anil Singh as he opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea.What is the connection between the two cases?The ASG referred to the case to cite the Bombay high court's earlier judgment denying bail to Showik Chakraborty. In October 2020, the Bombay high court refused bail to Showik Chakraborty saying that he was a part of the drug dealers' chain. As in the case of Aryan Khan, no drug was recovered from Showik Chakraborty as well, but this could not be the ground for his bail, the NCB counsel in the Aryan Khan case said this to the court."Showik's contention was that nothing was recovered from him. However, the court said the matter is being investigated and you were in touch with a drug dealer. Here, Achit and Shivraj are the drug dealers. Therefore, in this case also, no bail can be granted," NCB counsel argued before the court.One point on which Aryan Khan's lawyer has strongly stressed is the fact that no drug was found from Aryan Khan. Referring to Showik Chakraborty's case, the NCB counsel argued that the quantity of recovery is immaterial as the accused is part of a drug chain.What did Aryan Khan's lawyer say on this?Aryan Khan's lawyer Amit Desai, who are arguing for Aryan Khan on that day said Showik's case can not be compared with Aryan Khan's as the charge against Showik was not that of consumption but dealing with drugs. "Showik's case has to be distinguished from an end consumer's case because Showik didn't consume but dealt in drugs," Desai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-case-why-did-ncb-refer-to-showik-chakraborty-case-explained-101634400853944.html

We will do everything possible to save lives. We have sought the army, navy and air force’s help. Relief camps have been set up in affected districts,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement after an emergency meeting in the state capital. He also said the government is monitoring the water level in all dams. The Kerala government has also decided to stop the ongoing pilgrimage to the Sabarimala hill temple due to inclement weather. All colleges and higher education centres in Kerala will be opened only on Wednesday. Three districts of the state have been the worst hit -- Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki. Eighteen people are feared missing after a landslide in Kottayam and in Idukki two persons travelling in a car were washed away and later their bodies were retrieved. Both are yet to be identified. Four other rain-related deaths were reported from Pathanamthitta and Kottayam. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded red alerts in the six districts of Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki and Palakkad. Many of these districts have been getting heavy rainfall since Friday night and many dams in the vicinity are also filled to the brim and sluice gates of some of them have been opened to ease pressure. Some of the areas in Kottayam got 30 cm of rainfall in the last 24 hours said the IMD adding some areas will also witness high velocity winds. Weather experts said Saturday night is crucial for the state. In Kootickal in Kottayam district, three houses were destroyed in a major landslide and unconfirmed reports said six bodies have been retrieved but the district administration is yet to confirm it. Initial reports suggest 18 people are missing. Since the area is marooned after the landslide the district administration has sought the help of an army team. A senior district official who did not want to be named said the toll may go up after witnessing the intensity of the landslide. “At least four landslides have been reported in Kottayam and the one is Kootickal is major. Many people are stranded and we have have sought the help of Air Force choppers to shift them,” said state cooperation minister V N Vasavan hailing from the district. Earlier the CM said six teams of the National Disaster Response Force were deployed in affected areas and two teams of the Army will be deployed and Air Force teams have been asked to stand by. State Revenue Minister K Rajan said the government is closely monitoring the situation and least 5,000 families have been shifted to relief camps across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-killed-18-missing-as-heavy-rain-pounds-kerala-101634396526157.html

Arbind Kumar Sah from Bihar’s Banka, who worked as a street vendor in Srinagar, was shot by terrorists at around 6.40pm and was rushed to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital where he was declared brought dead.Calling the act “reprehensible”, Jammu and Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said all Sah did was to come to Srinagar in search of earning opportunities.“Strongly condemn the killing of street vendor Arvind Kumar in a terror attack in Srinagar today. This is yet another case of a civilian being targeted like this. All Arvind Kumar did was come to Srinagar in search of earning opportunities & it’s reprehensible that he was murdered,” tweeted Abdullah.People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti also condemned the attack on the non-local street vendor, saying such incidents reinforce the need to reach out to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“Strongly condemn today’s attack on a street vendor who sadly succumbed. Such unfortunate incidents only reinforce the immediate need to reach out to the people of J&K by initiating a constructive dialogue,” she tweeted.Also Read | Vendor from Bihar shot dead by terrorists in Srinagar; non-native killed in PulwamaAnother non-local labourer, identified as Sagir Ahmad from Uttar Pradesh, succumbed to his injuries after terrorists fired upon him in Pulwama.

16-10-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: October 17, 1968 — Indian shares Nobel prize for medicine with 2 Americans||Stockholm- India-born Hargobind Khorana was today named co-winner of the 1968 Nobel prize for medicine and physiology with two other American nationals for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. The other two are Robert Holley of Cornell University and Dr Marshall Nirenberg of the National Heart Institute, Bethesda, Maryland. The citation said the three scientists, who will get a record cash value this year of $70,000 ( ₹5.25 lakhs), had worked independently, but their investigation converged towards the solution of a common problem. Dr Khorana and Mr. Holley, who probed the structure of the genetic code, explained how it is used by the cell for the biosynthesis of proteins Dr Khorana, 46 started his career as an organic chemist. During 1950-52 he worked with Nobel prize winner A. Todd in Cambridge, England, on building a complex biological substance, called nucleotides. In the late 1950s, he was ready to take the next step, starting experiments to combine several nucleotides. His final aim was to be able to synthesize in the test tube nucleic acids containing a known sequence of nucleotides. The synthetic nucleic acids he managed to produce made it possible for Dr Khorana to investigate the genetic (hereditary) code for all amino acids in all the details. Ingenius experiment The Royal Caroline Institute of Medicine and Physiology, which took the decision to award the prize to the three scientists, said that Dr Nirenberg, 41, of New York, opened up this research area by a very simple but ingenious experiment By following up his breakthrough he could clarify the general character of the genetic code. Dr Nirenberg, who heads the section for biochemistry and genetics at the Bethesda Institute, had received the National Medal of Science from President Johnson in 1965. The Caroline Institute explained that the decoding of the genetic code, which Dr Nirenberg did, provides the key to a translation of one biological language into another. It translates the language of nucleid acids into the language of proteins, and thereby explains how the genes of cell direct the function of a cell.Asked for an explanation in layman terms of what the awarded experiment meant, Prof Hugo Theorell, Swedish medicine prize winner in 1955, said: “This means that we suddenly have got to understand the alphabet of life as fat as heredity is concerned. Some illnesses result from misprints in this process. There could be something wrong with the haemoglobin (the red colouring of the blood corpuscles), but also with the enzymes (active proteins) , which could be constructed wrongly, something that is in the body prone to certain illnesses.” “The three Nobel prize winners have not provided any remedy for such illnesses, but their great feat in research lies in that they have shown what it is we have to attack to combat such hereditary illnesses,” Prof Theorell said. “You can say that the three winners independently have managed to break the genetic code, Dr Nirenberg providing the very key to its structure and Dr Khorana and Mr Holley by proving its structure in detail.” he added. Dr Melvin Cohn of Salk Institute of Biochemical Research, California, who has closely worked with the Nobel Prize winner, Dr Hargovind Khorana, said in New Delhi today that if you ask any American student of elementary biochemistry he would tell you who Dr Khorana is. Dr Cohn, who is on a lecture tour of India, said Dr Khorana was one of the only 500 members of the American National Academy of Sciences. ‘This is rare honour conferred on any American scientist.” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-17-1968-indian-shares-nobel-prize-for-medicine-with-2-americans-101634396348925.html
16-10-2021||India||‘If govt upsets farmers from border states, there will be ramifications’: Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar urged the Union government to deal with the ongoing farmers protest with sensitivity."My advice to the Union government is, do not let farmers of Punjab get upset, it is a border state. If we upset the farmers and people from border regions, then there will be other ramifications," Pawar cautioned.Also Read: ‘Will meet Amit Shah to know his thoughts’, says NCP's Sharad Pawar on extension of BSF’s jurisdictionPawar also said that the stand taken by the Union government does not seem "rational", and referring to Indira Gandhi’s assassination, he warned that the country had to pay a hefty price for upsetting Punjab once."Our country has paid the price of upsetting Punjab, even (then prime minister) Indira Gandhi lost her life. On the other hand, farmers of Punjab, irrespective of whether they are Sikh or Hindu, have contributed to the food supply," he told reporters on Saturday.Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her personal bodyguards Satwant Singh and Beant Singh on October 31, 1984, at her residence in New Delhi, allegedly in retaliation for Operation Blue Star. Her death was followed by large scale anti-Sikh riots across the country, in which thousands of Sikhs lost their lives.The NCP chief stated that the border areas like Punjab face several security issues and therefore "when a person who is making sacrifices is sitting in protest with some demands for a long time, paying attention to him is what the nation requires".The Union government and protesting farmer unions have held several rounds of talks but the government has not accepted their demand of a total repeal of all three farm laws. The government has insisted that the new laws will help farmers enhance their incomes but farmers claim they are exploitative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-govt-upsets-farmers-from-border-states-there-will-be-ramifications-sharad-pawar-101634395472567.html

The minister also claimed that the police and the administration were involved in the incident and demanded a special investigation team (SIT) and a judicial inquiry regarding the incident, news agency ANI reported.“This incident (in Jashpur) has happened with [a] well thought out strategy. Police and administration are involved in this. Smuggling is happening because of government,” ANI quoted Gomati Sai as saying.Further she also questioned state chief minister Bhupesh Baghel for not visiting the place and mentioned that the CM went and visited Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh. “If CM (Bhupesh Baghel) can go to Lakhimpur Kheri then why he can't come here?” she asked. “We demand SIT, judicial inquiry of this incident and culprits should be punished,” she added.Also read | Jashpur incident: 1 dead, 17 injured; 2 cops suspended. What we know so farThe incident happened in Pathalgaon town in Jashpur district and a speeding vehicle ran over a group of people, who were on a procession to immerse idols of goddess Durga, HT had previously reported. Videos emerged of the incident, in which the car could be seen to proceed without stopping after it had rammed into the crowd. Also, the vehicle was later found at a short distance away from the side of the road.However, Babloo Vishwakarma, 21, and Shishupal Sahu, 26, both residents of Madhya Pradesh, were arrested on Friday regarding the incident. Also, CM Baghel announced a compensation of ₹50 lakhs to the dead victim’s family.“The Jashpur incident is very sad and heartbreaking. The culprits were immediately arrested. Prima facie action has also been taken against the police officers who appeared guilty. An inquiry has been ordered. No one will be spared. Justice will be done to all,” he had tweeted on Friday.The Jashpur incident has been compared to a similar one in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, where a vehicle ran over a group of protesting farmers. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed and Union minister of state Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra has been arrested regarding the violence. Farmers allege that the junior Mishra was present in one of the cars at the site, a claim which has been denied by the minister and his son.Baghel reacted to the comparison with the Lakhimpur incident and said that the Uttar Pradesh police was shielding the minister’s son but in the Jashpur case the accused have been arrested and compensation was announced. The Uttar Pradesh government had previously asked Lucknow Airport to not allow the arrival of Baghel, who was scheduled to visit Lakhimpur Kheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jashpur-incident-bjp-mp-sits-on-dharna-demands-chhattisgarh-cm-baghel-s-visit-sit-judicial-inquiry-into-incident-101634394711278.html
16-10-2021||India||Sri Lanka, India to enhance cooperation in defence, trade and energy: Envoy||High-level visits from the Indian side to Sri Lanka, including by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and army chief Gen MM Naravane, have helped bridge a trust deficit and prepare the ground for re-energising relations, Sri Lankan high commissioner Milinda Moragoda said on Saturday. Moragoda described the feeling in some quarters in New Delhi that China has strengthened its position in Sri Lanka at the cost of India as only a “perception”, and said in an interview that New Delhi and Colombo were close to enhancing cooperation in areas ranging from trade to defence and energy. Bilateral ties were buffeted in February when Sri Lanka scrapped a trilateral agreement with India and Japan for developing the east container terminal of Colombo port. Delays in several other projects and lack of forward movement in efforts to devolve powers to Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority added to problems between the two countries. An “integrated country strategy” document prepared by Moragoda before he assumed office in India acknowledged that bilateral ties were dominated by a “transactional approach” because of geo-political changes that had resulted in a “growing trust deficit”. Moragoda said on Saturday recent high-level visits and the presence of leaders in the Indian government who understand Sri Lanka, such as external affairs minister S Jaishankar and petroleum minister Hardeep Puri, have helped address this trust deficit. “The foreign secretary’s visit has helped a lot...The senior officials on the Indian side...understand us warts and all and that helps. We have the basis now to start building through the transactions on to a strategic relationship,” he said. A visit by 100 Buddhist monks and senior ministers led by sports minister Namal Rajapaksa to Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh on October 20 will also boost people-to-people contacts. The delegation will participate in the inauguration of an international airport that is meant to put Kushinagar, the site of Lord Buddha’s parinirvana, on the Buddhist tourism circuit. Moragoda referred to the integrated country strategy, which has been described as a roadmap for building relations over the next two years, and said the two countries will have to “evolve from a transactional stage to a strategic and then a special relationship”. He added, “The transactional stage is also a trust-building phase because both sides need to learn to do business with each other.” He said the scrapping of the agreement on the east container terminal at Colombo port because of pressure from trade unions was part of the “untidiness of democracy”. He also noted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had come up with the proposal for developing the west container proposal as an alternative, and the recent deal on this project between state-owned Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Adani Group will be more advantageous for the Indian firm. “From a commercial point of view, the west terminal is a better transaction because the investor has more control over it,” he said. “The west terminal shouldn’t be underestimated as 80% of the cargo in Sri Lankan ports is trans-shipment cargo. Out of this, 70% goes to India, and even from this, 35% goes to Adani Group-linked ports.” Moragoda acknowledged there is a “Chinese investment footprint” in his country but said the feeling that Sri Lanka is moving faster on Chinese investment proposals is just a “perception”. He also pointed out India’s sizeable presence in several sectors such as energy, transportation and railways. Indian Oil controls one-third of petroleum distribution in Sri Lanka, and there are plans for collaborating on an oil tank farm and exploration, while the two sides are in discussions on development of renewable energy. Indian Railways has done “immense work” to develop Sri Lanka’s rail network and there are more than one million Bajaj three-wheelers on the island nation’s roads, he said. “We are also studying whether the Aadhar Card can be used as a template in Sri Lanka,” he said, adding Sri Lanka plans to import nano-nitrogen fertiliser from India as part of a move towards organic agriculture. Moragoda said Sri Lanka will have to “work harder” because the bilateral relationship is asymmetrical. “On the trade and economic side, one of the reasons why we may not be able to make progress as quickly as possible is some of our industries feel maybe sort of overwhelmed by India,” he added. India, he hoped, will be willing to accommodate such an asymmetrical relationship in trade with opportunities for market access without looking for reciprocity. The two countries are also talking about the possibility of a bilateral currency swap and are in advanced discussions on a maritime surveillance system, Moragoda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lanka-india-to-enhance-cooperation-in-defence-trade-and-energy-envoy-101634394846197.html

Badal called on the Central government to raise the issue of alleged attacks against Sikhs and other religious minority communities at an international forum.On Friday, Puneet Singh Chandhok, head of Delhi-based think tank Indian World Forum, said that heavily armed Taliban officials forcibly entered Gurdwara Dashmesh Pita at Karte Parwan, Kabul, in presence of around 20 members of the Sikh community.Chandhok claimed that the officials intimidated the community members at the gurdwara and abused the sanctity of the holy place, according to news agency ANI. He further alleged that the Taliban not only raided the gurdwara but also the community school premises attached next to it.“The private security guards of the gurdwara initially prevented them from entering but they were also threatened with dire consequences and also manhandled,” ANI quoted Chandhok as saying.“They've also simultaneously raided the erstwhile residence and office of MP Narinder Singh Khalsa located adjacent to the gurdwara,” he added, urging the Indian government to immediately raise the issue with their counterparts at the highest level.This is not the first time that Taliban officials or fighters have forcibly entered a gurdwara in Afghanistan. Earlier, they had removed Nishan Sahib, the Sikh holy flag, from the roof of a gurdwara in Afghanistan's eastern Paktia province. The concerns over the safety and security of religious minorities in Afghanistan have increased after the Taliban’s takeover.Amid the Taliban’s quest for recognition from the international community, the Sunni Pashtun group has repeatedly promised that they’ll respect human rights and won’t harm minorities.Badal said that the Taliban government should not be recognised since the minorities are not safe in Afghanistan under their rule.“The matter of the recognition of Taliban is going on. It's a State where the minority is not safe, they should not be recognised. International pressure should be created on them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-chief-urges-centre-to-raise-taliban-s-forcible-entry-in-kabul-gurdwara-at-global-forum-101634390952851.html

This is an infringement on the rights of the state,” news agency PTI quoted TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh as saying, earlier on October 14. Meanwhile, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi tweeted, “I strongly condemn the GoI's unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within the 50 km belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on federalism. I urge the Union Home Minister @AmitShah to immediately roll back this irrational decision.”The Union government amended the Border Security Forces act to allow the BSF to search, seize and arrest within a larger 50kms stretch from the international border in West Bengal, Assam and Punjab. The earlier limit for this was 15km and the Union ministry of home affairs issued a notification on October 11 amending the act, several news agencies reported.Despite the criticism by West Bengal and Punjab, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that he welcomed the Centre’s decision. “Assam welcomes the extension of BSF’s operational jurisdiction. In coordination with state police, this move will serve as a strong deterrent for defeating cross border smuggling and illegal infiltration. It strengthens national security and national interest,” ANI quoted the CM as saying earlier.In July, Pawar, a former defence minister himself, along with Congress leader AK Antony met Union defence minister Rajnath Singh for an informal discussion regarding the border situation with neighbouring Pakistan and China and also the situation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-meet-amit-shah-to-know-his-thoughts-says-ncp-s-sharad-pawar-on-extension-of-bsf-s-jurisdiction-101634390865521.html
16-10-2021||India||Congress finalizes organizational poll schedule, to choose new chief in Aug-Sep 2022||The Congress party is set to get its new president between August and September 2022, the CWC has decided, as it finalized the long-drawn poll schedule of the party on Saturday. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been urged by “nearly all” CWC members to take over the charge of the party from interim president Sonia Gandhi, party’s general secretary KC Venugopal told the media. Till the new president is not elected, Sonia Gandhi would continue in the post. The Congress has also announced a schedule for the elections in Congress Working Committee and other bodies. “It would be held during the AICC plenary session in September or October 22. The dates would be announced later,” said Venugopal. The election process in CWC and other bodies would be significant as G23 leaders wanted election in these bodies. Rahul Gandhi had stepped down in 2019 following the dismal performance of the party in the last general elections. The Congress was unable to find a replacement and Sonia Gandhi, who had already served the longest term in the history of the party as Congress president, had to reluctantly return as interim chief. The schedule has been carefully chosen as the party faces key elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand in March-April next year. As the first step to the election, enrollment drive for members would begin from November 1 and continue till March 22. The exercise also helps the Congress to enroll new members ahead of the 2024 general elections. The membership drive, spread over five months, is significant as the party has lost considerable electoral space to the BJP and other parties in the recent few years. The District Congress Committees will publish the list of members and the eligible candidates for various party bodies between April 1 to April 15, followed by the election of president and executive committees at the block levels. This process would be completed between April 16 to May 31next year. Venugopal announced that elections at the District Committee levels—to decide the local presidents, vice presidents and treasurers will happen from June 1 and July 20. The PCCs would face election between July 21 to August 22 next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-finalizes-organizational-poll-schedule-to-choose-new-chief-in-aug-sep-2022-101634386865460.html

Workers and leaders at all levels will be trained in party ideologies, policies, expectations of a Congress worker, grassroots messaging, election management, failure of present government, and countering propaganda,” Venugopal announced during a press conference.Venugopal’s announcement comes hours after the party's top decision-making body, Congress Working Committee’s (CWC), met in-person on Saturday, for the first time since the pandemic started, to discuss key issues like upcoming assembly polls and organisational elections.The grand old party has also “passed resolutions on the political situation, inflation and 'diabolical attack' on India's farmers” during the CWC meet, Venugopal told reporters.Also Read: ‘I’m a full-time, hands-on Cong president’: Sonia Gandhi hits out at G23 leadersCongress, which has not had a full-time president since Rahul Gandhi stepped down after the party’s defeat in 2019 general elections, also decided to hold an election for the post of All India Congress Committee (AICC) president between August 21 and September 20, 2022. AICC is in charge of holding regular elections to elect the CWC members.Sonia Gandhi has been serving as the interim president since Rahul stepped down. At the CWC meet she reportedly urged party leaders to not speak to her through the media, insisting that she has always “appreciated frankness”. Gandhi also said that the elections for the post of AICC president would have been held by June 30 "but the second wave of Covid-19 overtook the country and this deadline was extended indefinitely by the CWC in its meeting held on May 10, 2021.”Congress has been in turmoil in several states where it is in power, with the recent crisis being brought by the resignation of veteran leader Amarinder Singh, after he was asked to step down from the post of Punjab chief minister. The party has also witnessed high profile exits of leaders like Sushmita Dev, Jitin Prasada, and Luizinho Faleiro in the last few months. The party has also performed rather poorly in assembly elections held in Bihar, West Bengal, Kerala, and Puducherry.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-hold-massive-training-programmes-for-party-workers-leaders-on-poll-management-grassroot-outreach-101634385913932.html

This will be Jaishankar’s first visit to Israel since he became foreign minister in 2019. Besides holding talks with his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid, he will also meet the Prime Minister, President Isaac Herzog and Knesset Speaker Mickey Levy. Jaishankar is visiting at the invitation of Lapid, who is also the alternate prime minister of the new coalition. Lapid, the head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, is set to take over the role of premier from Bennett in 2023 under the agreement that led to the formation of the coalition government. The Indian government had forged a very close relationship with former premier Benjamin Netanyahu, and the visit will be an opportunity for New Delhi to take forward relations with the new dispensation in Israel. The new government was formed after months of political turmoil, with Israel witnessing five elections in just two years. India and Israel elevated their ties to a strategic partnership when Narendra Modi became the first Indian prime minister to travel to Israel in July 2017. The relationship between the two countries has focused on expanding knowledge-based partnership, including collaboration in innovation and research and boosting the “Make in India” initiative, the external affairs ministry said. Jaishankar will interact with the Indian-origin Jewish community in Israel, Indologists, Indian students pursuing their education in Israeli universities and businesspeople, including representatives of hi-tech industries. The visit will also be an occasion to pay tribute to Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the region, especially during World War 1, the ministry said. Alon Ushpiz, Director General of the Israeli foreign ministry, had announced Jaishankar’s visit on Twitter on Friday, describing India as a “strategic partner and a very close friend”. Modi had spoken over the phone with Bennett in August and both leaders agreed to expand cooperation, especially in hi-tech and innovation. They also decided the two foreign ministries would prepare a roadmap for enriching the bilateral strategic partnership. Modi also invited Bennett to visit India in 2022, when the two sides will mark the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-visit-israel-next-week-101634385434119.html

16-10-2021||India||NSG provides anti-drone cover at Srinagar, Jammu air force stations; looks out for tiffin bombs||The National Security Guard (NSG) has deployed anti-drone systems at Srinagar and Jammu air force stations to counter any drone attacks, the Director General of specialized commando force – M A Ganapathy said on Saturday. People familiar with the development said that the NSG’s anti-drone measures have been successful so far as they have managed to detect a few drones in last few months and alert the relevant agencies on time. The development comes in the backdrop of a twin-drone attack at the Jammu Air Force Station on June 27, in which two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) travelled from across the border and dropped two 3 kg to 5 kg improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at the air facility, damaging a portion of the building. An offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba – The Resistance Front (TRF) – has been found to be involved in the drone attack and the case is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Since then, the government has had a series of meetings with various agencies, private players, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) etc to have robust anti-drone systems across the western border. Both Srinagar and Jammu Indian Air Force (IAF) stations are categorized as ‘sensitive’ installations. Ganapathy, during the 37th raising day function of NSG on Saturday, said that the federal counter-terrorist and counter-hijack commando force is enhancing its counter-terrorism profile and preparing itself to meet emerging security challenges. “The NSG has been deployed at the Srinagar and Jammu IAF stations to provide security cover to the facilities against drone attacks and this system is working successfully,” he said. People cited above said the deployment of this system will continue till full-fledged counter-drone weapons and gadgets are deployed at these two bases by the government. He said the NSG has an array of anti-drone equipment, radars, jammers and drone killer guns that essentially work for perimeter security. The DG further said that soon after the drone attack on the Jammu IAF base, an NSG ‘technical surveillance’ team was sent to the station which deployed its equipment there and the arrangement was stationed at the base. Ganapathy added that the NSG’s bomb disposal expert team has also managed to successfully intercept ‘tiffin bombs’ dropped from across the border. Indian agencies have noted that a large number of drones are being used by Pakistan army and terrorist groups to drop tiffin bombs into Indian territory, which are then picked up by the sleeper cells or overground workers (OGWs) of the outfits. The NIA is already probing the dropping of several tiffin bomb incidents in Punjab. As reported by HT on August 20, the federal anti-terror probe agency filed a case to investigate the delivery of a sophisticated tiffin bomb along with hand grenades and 100 pistol cartridges using a drone by Pakistan backed Khalistani terrorists at Daleke village in Lopoke sub-division of Amritsar district on August 9. Minister of state for home affairs, Nityanand Rai, who was present at the NSG raising day as chief guest, lauded the commando force, known as ‘Black Cats’, for its operations and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought in an independent security policy for the country. The NSG was raised as a federal counter-terrorist force in 1984 to undertake surgical commando operations to neutralise terrorist and hijack threats. It is also a special squad that provides armed security cover to at least 13 high-risk VIPs at present. The NSG has five hubs in the country, apart from its main garrison in Delhi, and in each of them, a team of commandos is stationed in readiness 24x7 to respond to any threat situation within a 30-minute mobilisation timeframe. The five NSG hubs or bases are located in Gandhinagar, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chennai and they were created post the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsg-provides-anti-drone-cover-at-srinagar-jammu-air-force-stations-looks-out-for-tiffin-bombs-101634382664827.html

This support is projected to facilitate capacity expansion to produce nearly two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2022. A joint statement issued at the conclusion of the Quad leaders’ summit last month said additional production will come on line in India later this year due to the Quad vaccine partnership’s financing of increased manufacturing capacity at Biological E. These doses will be exported to countries in the Indo-Pacific and other parts of the world to overcome a continuing global supply gap. The Quad will coordinate with multilateral initiatives such as the WHO-backed COVAX Facility to procure safe and quality-assured vaccines for low and middle-income countries. The Quad has also launched a vaccine experts group that is working to align the plans of India, Australia, Japan and the US to support health security and the Covid-19 response across the Indo-Pacific. This includes coordination of efforts to support the production of safe, effective and quality-assured vaccines and equitable access. The members of the Quad have pledged to donate more than 1.2 billion vaccine doses globally, and they have so far delivered nearly 79 million jabs to countries in the Indo-Pacific.The Quad summit also welcomed India’s announcement on resuming vaccine exports, which had been halted in March after the country was hit by a devastating second wave of infections. Since vaccine exports resumed recently, India has sent one million doses of Covishield to Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, and 300,000 doses of Covaxin to Iran. Japan will help regional partners purchase vaccines through a Covid-19 crisis response emergency support loan of $3.3 billion, and Australia will provide $212 million in grants to purchase vaccines for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Australia will also allocate $219 million to support last-mile vaccine rollouts and lead Quad’s last-mile delivery efforts.Besides the Covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness, the Quad is also working on infrastructure, resilient supply chains, clean energy, maritime security, approaches to deploy 5G infrastructure that use open and interoperable network architectures, and emerging technologies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-agreement-to-boost-vaccine-production-under-quad-partnership-for-indo-pacific-in-the-offing-101634376846029.html

16-10-2021||India||Nawab Malik hits out at Aryan Khan case investigator, says Sameer Wankhede's 'friend' used as witness||Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, whose son-in-law has been accused in a drug case by the Narcotics Control Bureau, on Saturday brought new charges against teh agency and its zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who is also the chief investigator of the Aryan Khan drug case. In a series of tweets, the minister alleged that Wankhede uses his 'friends as a 'panch' (witness) in different cases. Malik shared the details of some Fletcher Patel, who apparently was the witness in three cases of the NCB. To prove this Fletcher Patel's link with Sameer Wankhede, the minister shared Fletcher's Instagram photo with Sameer Wankhede's sister.This accusation is not directly linked with the Aryan Khan case but comes as part of the series of allegations that the minister has hurled on the agency after it arrested Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan among others from a cruise on October 3 on charges of drugs consumption. Breakfast at 7am, weekly video call: What N956 Aryan Khan's life in Arthur Road Jail looks like Here are the front pages of 3 Panchnamas where Fletcher Patel is a Panch. pic.twitter.com/NOMv5mv1CBFletcher Patel seen in this picture with someone who he calls 'My Lady Don'.Who is this 'Lady Don' ? pic.twitter.com/epTRSopDcH Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his Dusshera speech on Friday attacked the NCB and said they are only interested in catching celebrities, getting photos clicked and making some noise, while the Maharashtra Police are recovering drugs worth of crores.Since the arrest of Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty in a drug case associated with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the film industry has come on the radar of the agency with many Bollywood actors called for interrogation in the past year. In his speech, Uddhav said there has been an effort to make Mumbai look like the drug capital while a massive drug haul has been reported from Mundra port in Gujarat. Aryan Khan's arrest has created a political storm in Maharashtra and NCP leader Nawab Malik has been assailing the NCB. Earlier, he revealed details of Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi who were present during Aryan Khan's arrest and claimed that these two have questionable backgrounds -- KP Gosavi having fraud cases against him and Bhanushali being a BJP leader. Malik also alleged that the NCB released some people with powerful associations who were detained from the same cruise raid. The NCB countered all these allegations and said it did nothing illegal hinting at the minister's personal issues with the agency because of action against his son-in-law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-hits-out-at-aryan-khan-case-investigator-says-sameer-wankhede-s-friend-used-as-witness-101634373724455.html

Headline inflation is projected at 5.6 per cent in 2021-22, amid elevated price pressures."The economic outlook remains clouded due to pandemic-related uncertainties contributing to both downside and upside risks. A persistent negative impact of Covid-19 on investment, human capital, and other growth drivers could prolong the recovery and impact medium-term growth," the IMF said.It further said that while India benefits from favourable demographics, disruption to access to education and training due to the pandemic could weigh on improvements in human capital.At the same time, the recovery could also be faster than expected, it said adding that faster vaccination and better therapeutics could help contain the spread and limit the impact of the pandemic.In addition, successful implementation of the announced wide-ranging structural reforms could increase India's growth potential, the IMF noted.Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imf-hails-india-for-swift-and-substantial-response-to-covid-19-crisis-101634369853503.html

16-10-2021||India||Jashpur incident: 1 dead, 17 injured; 2 cops suspended. What we know so far||A speeding car rammed into a religious procession in Chhattisgarh Jashpur on Friday, killing one person and injuring 17 others. The police said two of the injured are undergoing treatment for critical wounds.The incident has triggered a political storm, with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel slamming his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath over "quick action" in the Jashpur case in comparison to Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people were killed on October 3.What happened in Chhattisgarh's Jashpur?According to the police, a Durga idol immersion procession was being taken out in Chhattisgarh's Jashpur when a vehicle crossing over to Madhya Pradesh suddenly dashed into the crowd at Pathalgaon. "One died, two were critically injured, while 15 received minor injuries," superintendent of police (SP) Vijay Agrawal was quoted as saying by the ANI news agency.Two cops suspended from dutyElaborating on police action in the incident, the SP added that two cops – the Pathalgaon Station House Officer (SHO) and the Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) – have been suspended from duty.Two occupants of the SUV, Bablu Vishwakarma (21) and Shishupal Sahu (26) have been arrested and the police said that they will face charges under sections 302 (murder) and 304 (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Both Vishwakarma and Sahu are residents of Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh. They were passing through Chattisgarh and trying to cross over to the neighbouring state when the incident occurred, said the police.Comparisons with the Lakhimpur Kheri incidentMeanwhile, the Jashpur incident has triggered comparisons with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh. Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Friday targeted his UP counterpart Yogi Adityanath and pointed out that while the latter failed to immediately arrest the accused in his state - the son of a Union minister - the persons behind the Jashpur incident were held within one day.“Yogi Adityanath did not succeed in arresting the accused instead Uttar Pradesh Police was shielding the son of the Union MoS (Home) in Lakhimpur Kheri violence,” Baghel told reporters in Jashpur.Hitting back, Uttar Pradesh minister Sidharth Nath Singh on Friday said that there seems to be a “conspiracy” behind the Jashpur incident and asked when Congress “brothers and sisters” are going there (to meet the victims). “The chief minister, who sat on protest at the airport during the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, should also tell if he will sit on protest over the incident,” Singh told ANI, taking a dig at Baghel.The Uttar Pradesh Police has now arrested three people, including Ashish Mishra, who is the son of Ajay Mishra, Union minister of state for home affairs. Ashish was arrested six days after he was accused in the incident in Lakhimpur Kheri's Tikunia village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jashpur-incident-1-dead-17-injured-2-cops-suspended-what-we-know-so-far-101634361996044.html
16-10-2021||India||‘I’m a full-time, hands-on Cong president’: Sonia Gandhi hits out at G23 leaders||Outgoing Congress president Sonia Gandhi hit out at the G23 leaders on Saturday who have questioned the party’s functioning and recent decisions. At the Congress Working Committee meeting, she said, “I have always appreciated frankness. There is no need to speak to me through the media.”In what is seen as a clear snub to the disgruntled senior members who questioned the party’s decision-making process, indicating that while Sonia Gandhi is the interim president, it is Rahul Gandhi and others who are taking key decisions, Gandhi underlined, “I am, if you will allow me to say so, a full-time and hands-on Congress President.”She also pointed out that it is the younger colleagues, without any mention of the senior leaders, who have taken “leadership roles” in taking party’s policies and programmes to the people— a reminder that while seniors have been asking for changes, the young leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have hit the road. Also read: At CWC, Sonia Gandhi calls for unified effort, keeping party first“In the last two years, a large number of our colleagues, particularly the younger ones, have taken on leadership roles in taking party policies and programmes to the people - whether it is the agitation of farmers, provision of relief during the pandemic, highlighting issues of concern to youth and women, atrocities on Dalits, Adivasis and minorities, price rise, and the destruction of the public sector.”“Never have we let issues of public importance and concern go unaddressed. You are aware that I have been taking them up with the Prime Minister as have Dr. Manmohan Singh and Rahul ji. I have been interacting with like-minded political parties regularly. We have issued joint statements on national issues and coordinated our strategy in Parliament as well,” she said. “I have always appreciated frankness. There is no need to speak to me through the media. So let us all have a free and honest discussion. But what should get communicated outside the four walls of this room is the collective decision of the CWC,” she cautioned as the meeting started to discuss the current political situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/im-a-full-time-hands-on-cong-president-sonia-gandhi-hits-out-at-g23-leaders-101634366283381.html
16-10-2021||India||At CWC, Sonia Gandhi calls for unified effort, keeping party first||In a clear message to the G23 or senior rebels of the Congress on Saturday, party president Sonia Gandhi at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting said the revival of the Congress requires “self-control, discipline, unity and keeping the party’s interests paramount.” She also said that the party has started preparations for the upcoming elections but “Undoubtedly, we face many challenges.” She also underlined that if “we are united, if we are disciplined and if we focus on the party’s interests alone, I am confident that we will do well.” The CWC meeting will decide the new schedule for the party’s long-pending organizational elections even as a large section of the party wants Rahul Gandhi as the president. Also read: I’m a full-time, hands-on Cong president’ - Sonia Gandhi hits out at G23 leadersSonia Gandhi’s comments on discipline, unity and self-control are significant in the context of the disquiet among the G23 leaders and their bid to gain more space in the decision-making process of the Congress. Last month, one of the G23 leaders, Kapil Sibal, launched an indirect attack on Rahul Gandhi and said, “we know and yet we don’t know how decisions are taken.” The senior leaders also raised questions about how the Punjab situation was handled by the party. “Let me now turn to the forthcoming Vidhan Sabha elections. Our preparations had already begun a while back. Undoubtedly, we face many challenges but if we are united, if we are disciplined and if we focus on the party’s interests alone, I am confident that we will do well. The respective general secretaries and in-charges will be briefing us on the states individually, so I will not like to say anything more now on this subject,” she said. “The entire organization wants a revival of the Congress but this requires unity and keeping the party’s interests paramount. Above all, it requires self-control and discipline,” she said. She also underlined that she is aware of the fact that she has been “ the interim Congress president” and announced in her opening remarks that a new schedule for organizational elections would be held. “You may recall, we finalized a roadmap for electing a regular president by June 30th 2021 but the second wave of Covid-19 overtook the country and this deadline was extended indefinitely by the CWC in its meeting held on May 10, 2021. Today is the occasion for bringing clarity once and for all. A schedule for full-fledged organizational elections is before you. general secretary, organization, Venugopal will brief you on the entire process later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-united-at-cwc-sonia-gandhi-calls-for-unified-effort-keeping-party-first-101634365082839.html

16-10-2021||India||New chapter in India-Israel relations: Jaishankar to cement post-Netanyahu ties||With an eye towards cementing diplomatic and political ties in post-Benjamin Netanyahu era, external affairs minister S Jaishankar is visiting Israel for three days via another strategic ally, the United Arab Emirates. EAM Jaishankar is reaching Dubai on Sunday and will leave for October 19-21 three-day Israel trip. The security relationship with both UAE and Israel are handled by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has restricted travel due to Covid pandemic and domestic commitments, it has been left to Jaishankar and Doval to connect with close allies on a constant basis. The focus of Indian diplomacy at present is also to directly connect with countries, which have been missed by the previous regimes like Mexico, Greece, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan apart from small nation states.While EAM Jaishankar is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Naftali Bennet, alternate PM and foreign minister Yair Lapid in Israel, the basic purpose of the trip is to engage the new coalition government and provide a fresh impetus to bilateral ties with Tel Aviv. “Israel and UAE are one of India’s closest allies like Japan and Singapore apart from big partners like US and Russia. With the new government now firmly ensconced in Israel, it is time that both close partners exchanged notes on global issues like Afghanistan, Middle East, Indo-Pacific and terrorism,” said a former foreign secretary. India has very close security relationship with Israel that ranges from top-of-the-line drones, loitering ammunition, radars, state-of-the-art missiles and border sensors.It is understood that EAM Jaishankar will be halting in Dubai for a day to meet the leadership over regional environment, including situation in Afghanistan and central Asia. The UAE is home to nearly four million Indian diaspora and has forged diplomatic ties with Israel under the Abraham Accord signed on August 13, 2020. This was the first normalisation of relations between an Arab country and Israel since that of Jordan in 1994. India wholeheartedly supported the normalisation of the ties between UAE and Israel.Afghanistan and on-going incidents of terror attacks on minorities will be a major point of discussion with EAM Jaishankar also sharing the perspective of Central Asian Republics, whom he visited last week. It is understood that Afghanistan is headed for a food crisis with drought expected in the region including Iran and Central Asia in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-firm-up-political-ties-with-israel-via-dubai-101634361927560.html

No less than 79 police station heads have been transferred with restructuring of special police units like special cell and law and order chiefs.While the security audit was conducted, it was found that some serving and retired officers of Delhi Police had 24X7 personal security officers guarding not only the officers but also their wives and grown-up children. The security to some of these police officers including ex-police commissioners, ex-home secretaries and others were given without threat assessment. Security of many others has also been downgraded by Delhi Police as there was no perceived threat, only status symbols.Apart from this, CP Asthana has asked all police units to report the number of personnel on active duty with the intention of doing away with senior police officers carrying their staff with them to new postings. It was found that some officers moved around 20 to 30 staff with them to their new postings, leaving the previous unit understaffed. So rather than the staff, including inspectors, were accountable to the posted unit, they had become personal staff of the officer they were working for. These staff members were used for personal duties like buying vegetables and dropping off children to school by these officers.The police commissioner has also decided restructure the top heavy force with more than 14 Special Commissioners and several joint commissioners now heading departments with thin work load. It is understood that consultations are on with the MHA to post several senior officers out to newly created union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh for on-field experience rather than moving files around.The special cell of Delhi Police has also been restructured and made more accountable with induction of three senior IPS officers. It is understood that the special cell has been asked not to undertake any solo operations without the knowledge of immediate superiors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-cp-conducts-security-audit-withdraws-500-personal-from-protection-duties-101634354006243.html

Fernandez, 36, once appeared before the federal agency in August and recorded her statement under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in this case.The officials said that after she skipped her fresh summons for Friday, the Bollywood actor has been asked to depose before the investigating officer of the case on Saturday. It is understood that the agency wants to confront her with Chandrashekhar and his actor wife, Leena Maria Paul. The agency, they said, wants to understand some trail of funds and transactions that are allegedly linked to Fernandez in this case.Actor and dancer Norah Fatehi, 29, recorded her statement with the ED on Thursday in this case. "Nora Fatehi has been the victim around the case and being a witness, she is co-operating and helping the officers in the investigation," her representative said. The spokesperson maintained that Fatehi has not been a part of "any money laundering activity" and urged the media to "refrain from slandering her name"."She does not know or have any personal connection with the accused and has been called by the ED to strictly help with the investigation," the spokesperson said.Chandrashekhar and Paul were recently arrested by the ED while they were already lodged in a local jail after being taken into custody by the Delhi Police on charges of cheating some people, including some high-profile individuals like former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh's wife Aditi Singh. In August, the ED had raided some of Chandrashekhar's premises and seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai, ₹82.5 lakh cash, and over a dozen luxury cars.  It had claimed in a statement that Chandrashekhar is a "known conman" and is being probed by the Delhi Police in a case of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, and extortion to the tune of about ₹200 crore."Chandrasekhar is the mastermind of this fraud. He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and is presently lodged in Rohini jail (in connection with the Delhi Police case)," the ED had said.Despite being in the jail, it said, Chandrashekhar "did not stop conning" people. "He (using a cellphone procured illegally in prison) with the help of technology, made spoofed calls to dupe people as the numbers displayed on the called party's phone number belonged to senior government officers. "While speaking (from prison) to these persons, he claimed to be a government officer offering to help people for a price," the ED had claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jacqueline-fernandez-summoned-again-today-after-she-skips-ed-questioning-in-money-laundering-case-101634352084484.html

16-10-2021||India||What are green crackers? Know which states imposed rules on fireworks this year||In view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) related situation and concerns surrounding the rising level of pollution due to firecrackers during the festive season, several states have imposed certain rules on fireworks this year. These vary from either a complete or a partial ban on firecracker sales in these respective states to permitting the sale of ‘green crackers’ instead. Here are the various mandates imposed in states across India over the use of firecrackers amid the ongoing festive season:What are green crackers?‘Green crackers’ are low-emission fireworks permitted by the Supreme Court for celebrations to a moderate degree during festivals, relaxing the ‘complete ban’ on fireworks previously imposed in 2017. These green crackers, researched and developed by experts at the CSIR-NEERI (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute), a government-funded research instutite in the field of environmental science, have a small shell size compared to normal crackers.Also Read | In a first, Delhi marks ‘virtual’ Dussehra with electronic fireworksThese green crackers are produced with less harmful raw materials, in accordance with instructions issued by the top court, and are made in a way that suppresses the dust when they are burnt – thus reducing emissions. They also do not contain harmful chemicals such as lithium, arsenic, barium, and lead and instead release water vapour that does not allow the dust to rise. Although still impactful on the climate to an extent, these green crackers are believed to cause 30 per cent less particulate matter pollution than traditional crackers and are thus considered generally less harmful than their conventional alternatives.Rajasthan to allow ‘only’ green crackersThe Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government on Friday reversed a decision to ban the sale and use of crackers in the state and instead in a revised advisory said that “only” the green crackers would be allowed. The government also issued the restricted timing for the bursting of crackers during the festive season.According to the revised advisory, green crackers can be burst from 8pm to 10pm during festivals like Diwali and Guruparb, from 6am to 8am on Chhath puja, and from 11:55pm to 12:30am on Christmas and New Year. The use of crackers would continue to be banned, however, at places having air quality index in the “poor” zone or below. The advisory further informed that the crackers could be verified as "green" by scanning the QR code on the box issued by the CSIR-NEERI.Complete ban on bursting, sale of firecrackers in DelhiThe Delhi Pollution Control Committee has ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2022. According to the order, several experts have indicated a possibility of another surge of Covid-19 and largescale celebrations by bursting of firecrackers will result not only in agglomeration of people in violation of social distancing norms but also a high level of air pollution leading to serious health issues in Delhi.Also Read | Uncertainty prevails over firecracker wholesalers in LudhianaThe bursting of firecrackers under the prevalent pandemic crisis is not favourable for the cause of larger community health given the significant relationship between air pollution and respiratory infections, it said.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police was reported to have initiated crackdowns on the distribution of illegal fireworks, the sale of which has increased as Diwali is just around the corner. According to the ANI news agency, the cops raided a godown in north Delhi's Sadar Bazar area this week seizing more than 470kg of illegal fireworks, arresting the owner of the property in the process.Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin urges counterparts to relax ban, allow green crackersTamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, on the other hand, has urged his Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Odisha counterparts to seriously consider the sale of green crackers in their respective territories, following which Rajasthan eased its norms.In a letter to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Stalin had requested to lift the ban and allow the sale of firecrackers that fall within the norms set by the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal.What did the Supreme Court say?Earlier in July, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea challenging the National Green Tribunal's order for the imposition of a complete ban on the sale and use of all firecrackers during the Covid-19 pandemic in cities and said that no further clarification or deliberation was required. The apex court said that the authorities may permit the sale and use of firecrackers as per the category of AQI in the cities.Also Read | ‘Right to life above right to employment’: SC on firecracker banThe bench said that manufacturing or production of firecrackers was allowed and those who wanted to use firecrackers could do so with permission depending upon the category of AQI. It clarified that the ban is in places where air quality is poor and there is no ban on the manufacture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-are-green-crackers-know-which-states-imposed-rules-on-fireworks-this-year-101634348648353.html

The incident was reported at the Singhu border on Friday.The gruesome incident has been blamed on Nihangs, a Sikh order identified by their blue robes and swords.Also Read | What happened at Singhu border?Hours after the macabre crime, a man wearing the blue robes of Nihangs appeared before the media, claiming that he had "punished" the victim for "desecrating" the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Saravjeet Singh later surrendered to the police, but not before addressing the group of mediapersons where he and his associates said they are ready to do things like these again if someone "dares to do crime like sacrilege again". When asked if he had any regret, Singh replies in the negative.Singh was taken in custody by the police amid chants of 'Jo Bole So Nihal'. He will be produced before a court today. His video of claiming responsibility of the killing went viral on social media platforms.In the purported video clip of the crime, some men in blue turbans and robes are seen standing around the injured man with his severed left hand close to his head.The group is heard accusing him of desecrating a Sikh holy book.The video purportedly shows the Nihangs asking the man where had he come from and who sent him to commit the “sacrilege”. Lakhbir is heard pleading with the group in Punjabi. The source and authenticity of the videos couldn’t be verified."An FIR has been registered in the case," said Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Hansraj. Haryana Police said the body was found tied to a metal barricade near the Singhu protest site stage around 5.30am on Friday.The victim has been identified as Lakhbir Singh, a Dalit farm labourer and a resident of village Cheema Khurd in Tarn Taran district of Punjab. Aged 35, Singh used to work as a labourer, and had no criminal record or affiliation with any political party, the police said.The family of the deceased man, however, said that he could not have committed sacrilege.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 43 unions coordinating the 11-month-long protest against three central agriculture laws, condemned the 'gruesome killing' of the man. In a statement, it said that "both the parties to the incident, the Nihang group and the deceased person, have no relation with SKM".The SKM has also demanded that the culprits should be punished after a lawful investigation into the allegation of murder and conspiracy behind sacrilege and they will "cooperate with the police and administration in any lawful action."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singhu-lynching-nihang-who-surrendered-says-no-regrets-skm-demands-probe-101634351170517.html

The curbs on non-essential travelers at land borders have been in place since March 2020 due to the pandemic.It will be a beginning to the end of unprecedented restrictions imposed early last year, a White House official said, adding that the policy is guided by public health, stringent, and consistent.The US officials had previously outlined the policy in September, saying that vaccinated air passengers will need to be tested within three days before travel and airlines will be required to put in place a contact tracing system.Here are the five things to know:1. Beginning November 8, the United States will admit fully vaccinated foreign air travelers from 26 countries in Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Greece, as well as Britain, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.2. The US health authorities have said that all Covid-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization would be accepted for entry by air.3. Unvaccinated foreigners will be barred from entry, while unvaccinated Americans will need a negative Covid-19 test.4. Indians travelling to the United States will need to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination before boarding a flight and will need to show proof of a recent negative Covid-19 test. The foreign visitors crossing a land border will not need to show proof of a recent negative Covid-19 test.5. The move to a vaccine-based entry system brings the United States into line with the European Union, which started using Covid-pass apps at the onset of summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-opening-its-borders-for-fully-vaccinated-indians-5-things-to-know-101634348056128.html
16-10-2021||India||Sasikala to return to Jayalalithaa memorial today. Know why it's politically significant||VK Sasikala, the former interim general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), who has been lying low for the past few months, is set to visit former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa's memorial in Chennai on Saturday. Observers say this politically significant move could be Sasikala's bid to reclaim her position in the AIADMK. Sasikala will be visiting the 14,100-square feet-wide Jayalalithaa memorial situated at the Marina Beach in the city today, a day ahead of the golden jubilee celebration of the founding of the AIADMK.Also Read | DMK set to sweep Tamil Nadu local body polls in 9 areasThe AIAMDK is currently being led by former Sasikala loyalists-turned-foes O Paneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami, who was once handpicked by Sasikala as the chief minister. In 2017, hours before she left for Bengaluru prison after being sentenced in a disproportionate assets case, she was removed from the post of AIADMK's interim general secretary. Since then, both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam have maintained that she is not part of AIADMK anymore.Sasikala, before being lodged at a Bengaluru prison, had stopped by at Jayalalithaa's grave, where the memorial has come up now, and in a dramatic gesture - thumped her palm to the ground taking a vow. Years later, she is now set to return to the same spot, her first visit to the memorial after being released from prison.Sasikala, according to people familiar with the matter, is also expected to drop by today at the residence of ex-Tamil Nadu chief minister and party founder MG Ramachandran (MGR), who formed the AIADMK in 1972 after splitting from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) under M Karunanidhi.Sasikala, now considered a threat to the AIADMK's current leadership, had earlier proclaimed to her fellow cadres that she would “set the party right” and re-establish the rule of MGR and Jayalalithaa. Although she lay low for a few months after her release from prison, she roared back after the loss of the AIADMK in the Tamil Nadu assembly elections earlier this year, releasing a series of recorded phone conversations with AIADMK members and announcing a splinter faction formed by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran - the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK). It is at this time that political strategists believe Sasikala is making use of the opportune moment to seize control of the party from her rivals.Meanwhile, the AIADMK's leadership, for its part, has released a statement urging the party cadre to celebrate the historic golden jubilee by following Covid-19 safety norms. Starting from October 17, when it turns 50, the party plans to hold a year-long celebration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-to-return-to-jayalalithaa-memorial-today-know-why-it-s-politically-significant-101634344242331.html

16-10-2021||India||Fully vaccinated foreign visitors can enter US from November 8: White House||The United States announced Friday that it will allow entry to foreign travellers who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, by both land and air, starting November 8.“This policy is guided by public health, stringent, and consistent,” tweeted White House assistant press secretary Kevin Munoz in announcing the news.In an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, US borders were closed after March 2020 to travellers from much of the globe, including the European Union, Britain and China, India and Brazil. Overland visitors from Mexico and Canada were also banned.The months of restrictions led to both personal and economic suffering.Under the new policy that was outlined last month, vaccinated air passengers will need to be tested within three days before travel, and airlines will be required to put in place a contact tracing system.Earlier this week, a White House source said the land border opening would happen in two phases.Initially, vaccines will be required for “non-essential” trips -- such as visiting family or tourism -- though unvaccinated travellers will still be allowed into the country for “essential” trips as they have been for the last year and a half.A second phase beginning in early January 2022 will require all visitors to be fully vaccinated to enter the United States by land, no matter the reason for their trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fully-vaccinated-foreign-visitors-can-enter-united-states-from-november-8-white-house-101634324280207.html
16-10-2021||India||DCGI yet to approve Covaxin’s emergency use in children||India’s apex drugs regulator is yet to approve Bharat Biotech’s coronavirus vaccine Covaxin for emergency use in children despite a recommendation from the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) earlier in the week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, attributing the delay to additional technical opinion that is being sought.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gives the requisite approval (including emergency approval) before a pharmaceutical product can be used in India and in the case of Covid-19 vaccines, the authority has typically taken a day or two at most to clear an SEC recommendation.“The drugs controller general of India (DCGI) is taking more technical opinion on vaccinating children even though the expert panel has recommended its use,” said a senior official in the Union ministry of health and family welfare, asking not to be named.The SEC is part of the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO). “We will have to be extremely careful when talking about Covid-19 vaccination in children as even the developed countries that have begun vaccinating their children, are treading cautiously. The whole world is watching and we cannot afford to slip,” said the official cited above.On Tuesday, the expert group looking into vaccine approvals gave its clearance for the use of Covaxin in the 2-18 age group, raising the possibility that children could soon begin to receive doses since Bharat Biotech’s shot is already being administered in India. For the vaccine to be included formally in the government’s coronavirus immunisation campaign for children, DCGI’s approval is mandatory.This is the second vaccine to have received clearance in this age group. The first was Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D, which was tested in volunteers aged 12 and above and is likely to be rolled out for recipients no younger than that. The product is yet to be included in the vaccination campaign. Officials last week said health workers are at present being trained to use a special needle-free applicator that is used to deliver the vaccine. An official from the health ministry said that the decision on when to begin administering Covaxin to children will depend on government the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI). Experts, however, have been saying that there is no immediate need to vaccinate all children as it has been proven that severe disease in children is not common. “The focus should be on vaccinating our adult population that is at high risk; children, especially the healthy ones, should not be our immediate priority. Eventually we will have to vaccine everyone but there is no pressing need to vaccinate all children,” said a senior public health expert, requesting anonymity. WHO chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, has similar views on booster doses. “There is more than enough evidence now that the currently used vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness and death due to #COVID19. We need to focus on expanding primary vaccination coverage worldwide, before boosters!,” Swaminathan tweeted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-yet-to-approve-covaxin-s-emergency-use-in-children-101634324100205.html
16-10-2021||India||‘All issues resolved’: Sidhu to stay on as Punjab Congress chief||Days after resigning as Punjab Congress chief, Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday said his concerns have been resolved and the party asserted that he will continue as the head of the state unit.AICC general secretary incharge Punjab Harish Rawat told reporters that Sidhu has withdrawn his resignation and will continue in his post as the matter of the resignation is now over for the party.Resolution to the issue came after Sidhu met former party chief Rahul Gandhi at his residence here and raised his concerns.“Whatever concerns I had, I have shared with Rahul Gandhi ji. All my concerns have been sorted out,” he told reporters after the over half-an-hour-long meeting with Gandhi.He later tweeted, “I have shared my concerns with Rahul Gandhi ji, was assured they will be sorted out.” Rawat, who was also present at the meeting, later said the issue of his resignation is over now.“He has assured Rahul Gandhi that he is withdrawing his resignation and resuming his duty as PCC chief,” he told reporters.Sidhu told Gandhi that he is working hard and will work harder now, and that he will join his duty as Punjab Congress president, Rawat said.“Navjot Sidhu has shared his concerns with party leaders and it is our duty to talk to the chief minister and resolve the remaining issues. We have told him his concerns will be taken care of very soon,” he also said.Sidhu had met Rawat and party leader KC Venugopal on Thursday and shared his concerns. Sidhu later said he has full faith and confidence in the party leadership.He had posted his resignation on Twitter on September 28.He was not happy with the appointment of the new Punjab Police chief and the advocate general, besides some portfolio allocations to ministers after the new cabinet formation.The Punjab government has already replaced the DGP and his other concerns are being sorted out. During the meeting with Venugopal and Rawat, the Punjab Congress leader raised his concerns over the 18-point agenda taken up by the leadership on which actions are pending. These included action against those involved in the sacrilege issue and the drugs mafia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-issues-resolved-sidhu-to-stay-on-as-punjab-congress-chief-101634323920634.html
16-10-2021||India||CWC meet today, decision on internal elections likely||The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest executive body, will meet on Saturday to give another try to fix the schedule for long-pending organisation elections — an exercise that will have to keep in mind upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa, according to people aware of the matter.The meeting, to be held offline for the first time in more than 18 months, will also discuss the current political situation, with a focus on UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people died when a car mowed down protesting farmers, and in the violence that followed. The incident led to major political protests, and several Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the families of the victims after initially being disallowed by the UP Police.The CWC expected to back the demands of the Congress delegation that met President Ram Nath Kovind, and asked for dismissal of junior minister of state Ajay Mishra, and a probe in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident by sitting judges of the Supreme Court or high court.But bigger challenges for the CWC lie elsewhere.A schedule proposing organisation elections in June this year was rejected because it was close on the heels of the five assembly polls in April-May. Now, the new schedule must take into account the upcoming elections in four states expected in the next six months, the people cited above said.They added that a majority of the Congress leaders want Rahul Gandhi to return to the helm and assume the formal position of the president of the party, particularly since he is deeply involved in nearly all key decisions of the party now. A senior leader, however, added: “If Rahul Gandhi or any active Congress leader is chosen as the president, there might not be an immediate election at all. Rahul was the last president and he resigned after the Lok Sabha elections on July 3, 2019.”But organisational polls will be necessary for election to various bodies such as CWC and the Central Election Committee. Last year, at the CWC, when demands were made to hold elections for these two important bodies, Gandhi had agreed and assured party colleagues that an internal polls would be held at least for the working committee.The other key issue in the meeting will be how issues raised by a group of Congress leaders, referred to as G23, are tackled. Last month, senior Congress leader and one of the top members of the G23, a group of 23 that wrote letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi asking for sweeping changes in the organisation, demanded a CWC meeting to discuss the Punjab and Goa situations and the “exodus” of leaders leaving the party in those two states.Two party leaders aware of the matter added that loyalists of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were expected to thwart any criticism over Punjab (where there has been a change of guard with Charanjit Singh Channi stepping in as chief minister after a bitter feud between former CM Captain Amarinder Singh and state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu) with the argument that the situation is under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-meet-today-decision-on-organisation-elections-likely-101634323680626.html
16-10-2021||India||Modi: India on track for a self-reliant defence sector||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said one of the country’s key goals under the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) campaign was to emerge as one of the most powerful militaries and develop a modern defence industry in the country on its own steam.The steps taken by the government during the last seven years were driven by this self-reliance mantra, he said, and the “transparency, trust and technology-driven approach” that the defence sector is witnessing at the moment was never seen before.“For the first time after Independence, big reforms are taking place in the defence sector. Instead of policies that were a hindrance, a single-window system has been put in place, leading to an increase in the industry’s confidence. Indian companies are looking for opportunities in the defence sector, and now the private sector and the government are working together to achieve the national security mission,” Modi said.Policy changes have resulted defence exports shooting up to more than 325% over the last five years, he added.The PM’s comments came while dedicating to the nation, on the occasion of Dussehra, seven new defence companies carved out of the now-dissolved Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). He said the new entities would play a critical role in helping the country cut down military imports in line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat.In the 21st century, the growth and brand value of any country or company will be determined by its research and innovation, Modi said.“From software to the space sector; India’s growth, its new identity, is the biggest example of this (research and innovation). I ask all companies and these seven new firms to make research and innovation a part of their work culture,” he said.“You have to not only match the big companies in the world, but also take lead in future technologies. That’s why it’s important that you have a new thinking, give maximum opportunities to research-oriented youth and give them freedom to think. I also ask Indian start-ups to be a part of this new journey in the defence sector.”He said that while cost competitiveness was India’s strength, high quality and reliability should be the country’s identity.Last month, in a public function in Aligarh, Modi said that India was shedding its image of being a major importer of military hardware and carving out an identity for itself as a defence exporter.“I am confident that these seven companies will form a strong base for the military strength of the country in the times to come,” he said on Friday in a video address, adding that the corporatisation of OFB had been hanging fire for nearly two decades.The Union Cabinet, headed Modi, cleared the board’s corporatisation in June with an aim to boost efficiency and competitiveness.OFB, which earlier controlled 41 ordnance factories, has been split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products. The government issued an order last month dissolving OFB with effect from October 1.The new companies are Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, Troop Comforts Limited, India Optel Limited, Munitions India Limited, Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (AVANI), Gliders India Limited and Yantra India Limited.The restructuring will provide more autonomy to the new companies to nurture innovation and expertise, Modi said.Ordnance factories were engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.The government expects the seven new entities to increase their share in the domestic market through better capacity utilisation and also tap new export opportunities. During the last two decades, various high-level committees underlined the need to improve the functioning of OFB and making its factories vehicles of self-reliance for the country’s defence preparedness.Modi said the ordnance factories had a glorious past, but their upgradation was ignored in the post-Independence period, leading to the country’s dependence on foreign suppliers. “These seven defence companies will play a major role in changing this situation,” he said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the corporatisation of OFB will help overcome various shortcomings in the previous set-up and provide the new companies incentive to become competitive.“The objective of this restructuring is to transform Ordnance Factories into productive and profitable assets, improve expertise in product range, increase competitiveness, improve quality, enhance cost-efficiency and ensure self-reliance in defence preparedness,” Singh said.All the indents previously placed on OFB by various services, CAPFs and state police have been converted into deemed contracts. These deemed contracts numbering 66 have a cumulative value of more than ₹65,000 crore, as previously reported by HT.The PM said the government has ensured that the interests of the employees are fully protected.The All-India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) and three other workers’ associations, however, boycotted the official inauguration of the new companies. “We wore black badges and boycotted the function along with our families. We will decide the future course of our protests shortly,” said AIDEF general secretary C Srikumar.In a major push to the self-reliance campaign in the defence sector, India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹54,000 crore during the last month-and-a-half to boost the military’s capabilities with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.India has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.The country has also decided to ban the import of 209 weapons and systems to boost self-reliance. The ban, to be implemented progressively till 2025, covers artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, and different types of helicopters.“Self-reliance in the defence sector has to be seen against the backdrop of the threats India faces, and the need to build military capabilities. Atmanirbhar Bharat is also about cutting down critical imports and filling capability gaps indigenously,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-india-on-track-for-a-self-reliant-defence-sector-101634322491256.html

16-10-2021||India||British lawmaker David Amess stabbed to death||London: Conservative British lawmaker David Amess was killed on Friday after being stabbed “multiple times” during an event in his local constituency in southeast England, in the second death of a UK politician while meeting voters since 2016.Local police did not name Amess but said a man had been arrested “on suspicion (of) murder” after the stabbing in Leigh-on-Sea.“We are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident,” said Essex police, adding that the man in custody was aged 25, and a knife was recovered.The force said officers had earlier responded to “reports of a stabbing” shortly after 12:05 pm (1105 GMT). British media, including Sky News and the BBC, identified the victim as the 69-year-old politician from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called Amess “a dedicated, thoughtful man and a true Parliamentarian, who lost his life while serving the constituents who he worked relentlessly for throughout his career”.Amess is the latest British MPs to have been attacked at his weekly constituency “surgery” with voters, which are typically held on Fridays when parliament is not sitting.Pro-EU lawmaker Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist in 2016 in the run-up to the Brexit referendum.The Jo Cox Foundation, which was set up in her memory, tweeted that it was “horrified to hear the news of the attack” on Amess. “We are thinking of him, his family and loved ones at this distressing time,” it added.Cox’s widower Brendan described the stabbing of Amess was “as cowardly as it gets”. “Attacking our elected representatives is an attack on democracy itself. There is no excuse, no justification.”Another Labour MP, Stephen Timms, was stabbed multiple times during an event in 2010, but recovered from “potentially life-threatening injuries” and is still an MP.Timms said he was “appalled” at the latest attack.In January 2000, Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones was injured and his assistant killed by a man wielding a ceremonial sword at a constituency surgery in Cheltenham, western England.- Security concerns -Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith expressed concern about the security risk of the local MP “surgeries”.“When you’re not in your office, and you’re in a public place... that means essentially, that the levels of security that sometimes you’re advised to take can’t be taken,” he tweeted.Amess, a lawmaker since 1983, had advertised his upcoming surgery at the Belfairs Methodist Church in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea.Paul Gardiner, 41, a barber at One Barbers Leigh-On-Sea, told AFP that “armed police and an ambulance” were on the scene.“There’s a couple of choppers around the place,” he said. There was no immediate comment from Johnson, who was leading an away-day for senior ministers in the west of England.But his wife Carrie, a former Conservative head of communications, tweeted: “Absolutely devastating news about Sir David Amess.“He was hugely kind and good. An enormous animal lover and a true gent. This is so completely unjust. Thoughts are with his wife and their children.”David Cameron, one of his Tory predecessors in Downing Street, said: “Very alarming and worrying news reports coming from Leigh-on-Sea. “My thoughts and prayers are with Sir David Amess and his family.”Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer called the news “horrific and deeply shocking”.An eye-witness, identified only as Anthony, told radio station LBC that the scene was “completely and utterly swamped by police, ambulance, armed police.“I saw someone get taken out the building, put into the back of a police car. Apparently he was stabbed quite a fewtimes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-lawmaker-david-amess-stabbed-to-death-101634323440053.html
16-10-2021||India||Kerala globe-trotting tea vendor couple to restart travel as restrictions ease||After two years of Covid-19 pandemic-induced restrictions, Kerala’s tea vendor couple famous for their globe-trotting adventure is busy packing their bags again – this time to Russia. They want to witness the anniversary of the October Revolution, in which the Bolshevik Party seized power in Russia in 1917. KR Vijayan (71) and his wife Mohana (69) are well known, and many celebrities like industrialist Anand Mahindra, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher and writer-politician Shashi Tharoor have lauded them. The couple has already put up a noticeat their tea stall, announcing the much-awaited trip because they don’t want to put their regular customers in the lurch from October 21 to 28. The Kongani couple’s first trip was to Israel in 2007 and has since visited 25 countries. “In many Russian books (translated into Malayalam years ago due to the communist influence in the state), Volga river is a favourite theme. I am anxious enough to see the quiet flowing Volga,” said Vijayan, while preparing tea for his morning customers and his wife busy peeling coconut to make ‘Puttu,’ a cylindrical- shaped steamy breakfast made of rice powder. Their last trip was to Australia in 2019. “Since our hotel remained closed most days for the past two years, this time I took a loan from the travel agency for tickets. Once I come back, I will pay ₹15,000 monthly and start saving for the next,” Vijayan said, adding after every trip, he turns wiser and stronger. “It is often said to experience is the best teacher. Travel is the best experience that makes you richer. Travel is in my blood. First, I visited all religious and tourist places in the country and later turned global. I visited Lord Balaji temple more than 100 times,” he said. He named his hotel in Gandhi Nagar, Kadavanthara, after his favourite deity, Sree Balaji Coffee House. “Look, money will come and go. But these memories will remain forever. Both of us will continue to travel as long as our health permits. After every trip, we feel younger. That keeps us ticking,” said wife Mohana. Vijayan said he is happy that off late Indians have also started travelling in a big way like the westerners. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation, 50 million Indians travelled abroad 2019, an increase from 23 million in 2017. Vijayan said their two daughters and sons-in-law have always supported the couple’s undying passion for travel. After Russia, they have set their eyes on Japan. Amid this, the elderly couple has a wish. “We would like to meet Prime Minister Modi once. He has a humble origin and started his life as a tea seller. We admire him a lot,” they said, adding that they are ready to go to New Delhi for the visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-globe-trotting-tea-vendor-couple-to-restart-travel-as-restrictions-ease-101634323380382.html

16-10-2021||India||Top Maoist leader dies of kidney ailments in Bastar||The Communist Party of India (Maoist) on Friday confirmed the death of its senior leader and central committee member Akkiraju Haragopal, alias Rama Krishna (RK), due to kidney-related ailments.A statement released by Maoist party central committee official spokesman, Abhay, said Haragopal (65) died at around 6am on Thursday. Though he did not mention any location, police in Chhattisgarh claimed that Haragopal died in the jungles of South Bastar, and that his last rites were performed on Thursday evening.“He suddenly developed complications in functioning of kidneys. Though he was immediately kept on dialysis, the party could not save him as he had suffered from multiple health issues,” the party spokesman said.“ We got information that Haragopal died in the forests of South Bastar... In last couple of years two other central committee members, Ramanana and Haribhushan, have also died due to illness in the forests of South Bastar. This is an outcome of the chocking of supply network and safe corridors for Maoist cadres by opening up of forward base camps in erstwhile Maoist stronghold areas,” said inspector general of police , Bastar range , Sunderaj P.Maoism, once described by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as India’s gravest internal security threat, has its origins in the teachings of the Mao Zedong, the first premier of the People’s Republic of China. While the Maoists had separate organisations that have existed for several decades, primarily the PWG(People’s War Group) and the MCC(Maoist Communist Centre), the two wings came together to form the CPI(Maoist) in 2004. The organisation is now a banned organisation by the Government of India, and carry the stated objective of overthrowing the state through revolution. The Maoists believe that the system of governance in India is “imperialist”, and want “revolution” through the use of arms, attacking state security wings. The organisation now operates chiefly in the forests of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, and varying estimates put the number of fighting cadre in and around ten thousand cadre, in a structure that mirrors military formations. The highest cadre are the Politburo and the Central Committee, who stay in the forests for years on end, evading the forces, and attempting to widen the organisation.Haragopal was born in Tumrugoti village of Macharla block in the Palnad area of Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district in 1956. He did his postgraduation, and later worked as a teacher. He was attracted towards revolutionary politics while he was working as a teacher in 1978, and became a member of CPI (Marxist-Leninist), People’s War Group in 1982. He went underground and operated from Nallamala forests adjoining Guntur, Prakasam and Kurnool district and later became the secretary of CPI (ML) Guntur district committee in 1986.In 1992, he got elected as the member of the party’s state committee and led the South Telangana movement from Nallamala forests for about four years. In 2000, he was elevated as the Andhra Pradesh state committee secretary of the party and in January 2001, he was nominated to the party’s central committee.In 2004, Haragopal, also known in the party with several other names including Saketh, Madhu and Srinivas, led a delegation of the CPI (ML) to hold discussion with then government of combined Andhra Pradesh.“He put forth the people’s demands before the government and held discussions with the government representatives effectively. Through these dialogues, Haragopal could successfully take the party’s agenda among the people all over the country,” the spokesman said in the statement.After the failure of talks with the government, Haragopal went back into the forests to lead the movement of the party, which had by then converted to CPI (Maoist) with the merger of the CPI (ML) People’s War with the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI).Following repression from the police forces in Andhra Pradesh, Haragopal was shifted to Andhra-Odisha border. He worked as the party’s Andhra Pradesh Odisha Border (AOB) committee secretary till 2014, and then moved to the Bijapur area, from where he was guiding the party’s AOB committee.“In 2019, Haragopal was nominated to the CPI (Maoist) party’s politburo. Since then, he had been effectively handling the party activities, protecting the party and the cadre from the severe repression from the government. In the process, he had suffered health complications that ultimately led to his demise,” the spokesman added.Haragopal was married to Kandula Nirmala, alias Sirisha alias Padma, also a Maoist party activist as a division committee member. His son Munna was also in the movement, and was killed in an encounter with the police at Ramaguda. Sirisha, who was later arrested by the police and released on bail, has been staying at Alakurapadu village of Tanguturu block in Prakasam district.Haragopal was named in more than 80 cases, including the attack on Telugu Desam Party president and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in October 2003, besides the killing of over 40 jawans at Balimela reservoir in Odisha in late 2000.“ Hargopal’s death would certainty deplete the strength of the Naxal movement in Bastar.. He was one of the main ideologue of Maoists movement in this part. Now a very few senior cadres are left here and I believe security forces would make an all-out attempt to soon bring an end to five decade long mindless violence by Naxals in Bastar region,” said Sunderaj P.Sirisha said her husband had dedicated his life to the people. “He was a great warrior in the people’s movement and a selfless revolutionary. He did not lose his heart even when our son sacrificed his life for the sake of the people,” she told the reporters.Notably , Ravula Srinivas alias Ramanna (56), who was Central Committee member of CPI ( Maoist ) and was also the secretary of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) -- died of heart attack in 2019 in Bastar jungles. Similarly, another CC member and Telangana state committee secretary Yapa Narayana alias Haribhushan (59) due to Covid-19 in June this year.( With inputs from Ritesh Mishra )||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-maoist-leader-dies-of-kidney-ailments-in-bastar-101634323265934.html
16-10-2021||India||One killed as speeding car mows down pedestrians in Chhattisgarh||A person was killed and at least 16 others were seriously injured when a car ploughed into a religious procession in Chhattisgarh’s Jashpur district on Friday.Locals caught hold of the two accused, alleged drug smugglers, around five kilometres from the site of the incident and handed them over to the police, officials said. The locals also torched the vehicle, a Mahindra Xylo, they said. News agency PTI, citing locals, reported that the accused set the vehicle on fire themselves to destroy evidence of drug trade.The incident took place when a group of at least 150 people was headed for the immersion of a Durga idol in the district’s Pathalgaon town, officials said.Chilling videos of the incident, which have since been widely shared on social media, show the speeding car emerge out of nowhere, hit the people from behind and run them over. While many people were thrown away from the impact, some were dragged along with the car for some distance before it sped away.The deceased was identified as Gaurav Agarwal, 22.“One death has been reported so far. Gaurav Agarwal died on the spot. Around 16 injured are shifted to a government hospital,” Jashpur superintendent of police Vijay Agarwal said.The two men in the vehicle, Babloo Vishwakarma, 21, and Shishupal Sahu, 26, have been arrested, the SP said.There was no confirmation on who was driving the vehicle.Both the accused are residents of Madhya Pradesh’s Singrauli district, and suspected to have been smuggling drugs at the time of the incident, he said.“The primary investigation suggests that the accused were smuggling cannabis from Sabhalpur (Odisha) to Singrauli (Madhya Pradesh). When they reached Pathalgaon, they got stuck in the religious procession at around 1.30pm. Suddenly, they saw policemen around the vehicle and sped the SUV in panic,” said SP.Protests erupted in the district soon after the incident, with locals assembling at the Pathalgaon police station, demanding the suspension of assistant sub-inspector KK Sahu for his alleged involvement in the drug trade.The protesters also blocked the Gumla-Katni highway after the incident, with the body of the deceased, and sought compensation. They also raised slogans against the police and the district administration.The ASI has been suspended, SP Vijay Agarwal said after the protests.Describing the incident as “saddening and painful”, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said that the accused have been arrested and action has also been initiated against police officials “who prima facie appeared guilty”.“An inquiry has been ordered. No one will be spared. Justice will be done to all. May the departed soul rest in peace. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured,” the Congress leader tweeted in Hindi.Former chief minister Raman Singh hit out at the Congress, seeking ₹50 lakh compensation for the next of kin for the deceased. He said, “This video is very painful. In Chhattisgarh, the drug mafias have no fear of anyone. Will those taking out religious processions be crushed like this now?”The incident has come close on the heels of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, where a group of protesting farmers was mowed down by vehicles allegedly driven by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to the area on October 3.Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni’s son, Ashish Mishra, has been named as the main accused in the incident, in which four farmers and a journalist were killed.In the violence that erupted after the incident, three BJP workers were killed by an angry mob at the site.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-killed-as-speeding-car-mows-down-pedestrians-in-chhattisgarh-101634323260736.html
16-10-2021||India||Protests erupt across Kerala after patient’s kin attack doc||A doctor working with a government taluk hospital in Kerala’s Kollam district was allegedly attacked by a group of people, who claimed that he came late to confirm the death of a patient, police said on Friday. After the incident, government doctors in many parts of the state boycotted the out-patient wing to register their protest. According to the police, the incident took place at the government taluk hospital at Sasthamkotta in Kollam district on Thursday night. In his complaint, the injured doctor, L Ganesh, said a group of people came to the hospital late on Thursday night with a woman who fell into a well. As he was busy with another patient, he reportedly asked them to get the woman’s ECG done to confirm the death. Infuriated with the doctor’s response, the group that came in an ambulance allegedly attacked the doctor, police said, adding that the doctor is admitted in the hospital with minor injuries. Police said they have registered a case under non-bailable provisions against Sooranad panchayat president K Sreekumar and others in connection with the attack. While no one has been arrested yet, police said the case has been registered under Section 353 (preventing an official from carrying out his duty) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the state pandemic control act among others. Later in the day, the panchayat chief also got admitted in the hospital alleging he was manhandled by the doctor and hospital staff. Soon after the incident came to light, the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association on Friday called for a protest, saying they would boycott the out-patient wards till the arrest of the accused. Kerala health minister Veena George on Friday spoke with the injured doctor and promised strict action against the accused. At least 10 such cases have been reported in recent months in Kerala, prompting the state government to issue an order demanding immediate arrest of those who attack overworked doctors and nurses. Last month, the Kerala high court also directed the government to take strong action against those who turn against health workers. The court observed that unless health workers, doctors and nurses were not allowed to function peacefully, “it will be impossible to contain the deleterious consequences of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-erupt-across-kerala-after-patient-s-kin-attack-doc-101634323204134.html

16-10-2021||India||Oil, gas extraction in forest not mining: Wildlife board||Oil and natural gas extraction in forest areas and wildlife sanctuaries is not “mining”, said the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) with regard to the proposals for six projects in Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary in Tripura. However, experts raised concerns over the move and termed it a “complete contradiction in the ministry of mines’ position”.In a meeting on January 10, 2019, the NBWL, the apex body on wildlife, tentatively recommended six proposals for diversion of forest land from Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary in Tripura subject to the condition that Tripura government obtains a legal opinion from the state advocate general on whether oil and gas extraction can be categorised as mining activity.Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) also sought the Solicitor General of India’s view on the matter and asked whether a Supreme Court order dated August 4, 2006 in the TN Godavarman Vs Union of India and others case, which says temporary working permissions for mining cannot be granted inside any National Park or Sanctuary notified under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972) also applies to oil and gas extraction.However, according to minutes of NBWL meeting held on September 24 and uploaded on environment ministry’s Parivesh website this week, the advocate general of Tripura has observed that extraction of natural gas/oil is not a mining activity under the provisions of Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 while Solicitor General of India has opined that extraction of natural gas and oil (which includes exploration and development) is not a mining activity when compared to a traditional open cast mining carried out upon large tracts of land and it cannot be considered as mining in terms of SC’s 2006 order.In NBWL’s September 24 meeting, the standing committee of NBWL has approved all six extraction projects in Tripura.Experts pointed out that NBWL’s latest decision could have far-reaching implications.“This is yet another instance of regulation by exemption. Even though the interpretation in NBWL minutes is in the context of a Supreme Court order dealing with temporary working permits (TWP) for mining, it raises some fundamental questions around oil and natural gas extraction not being a mining activity in general. This is in complete contradiction of the ministry of mines position which considers natural gas and petroleum as minerals to be regulated through mining laws. In fact, the ministry’s own forest advisory committee has referred to these sectors as being bound by the 1957 mineral legislation,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.The Mines and Minerals Act 1957 regulates the mining sector and covers mineral oils including petroleum and natural gas.“The central government’s interpretation also should be read and analysed in conjunction with decisions to exempt oil and gas exploration from public hearings in 2020 or compensatory measures against forest diversions in 2021. The most recent proposal from the environment ministry is part of the draft amendments to the forest conservation act. It seeks to free specific kinds all survey and investigation and specific technological applications of oil and natural gas from the requirement of prior central government approvals,” added Kanchi.In another matter related to oil and gas exploration in forest areas, the ministry of mines has sought exemptions on compensatory afforestation norms according to minutes of the Forest Advisory Committee’s meeting on September 17. The minutes suggest that the ministry of mines had written to the environment ministry on May 18,2021 requesting that the norm of planting 110 trees per borehole in case of mineral exploration projects be relaxed to 20 trees per borehole.“The Ministry of Mines has constantly maintained the view that mineral exploration is only a temporary scientific activity in the forest area with little or no change in land use. Whatever little changes occur due to exploration in forest areas is restored back by nature within a few months. Therefore, exploration, which is a scientific activity by which possibility of existence of natural resources within a land parcel is evaluated, should not be equated with mining activity,” the letter from mines ministry states adding that “it appears that the revision in requirement towards compensatory afforestation from 20 tall trees per borehole to 110 trees per borehole in case of mineral exploration projects, where no felling of trees is involved, is very high. I would request that the FAC may consider the matter and the earlier requirement of planting 20 tall trees per borehole may be restored.”The FAC declined the request stating that detailed guidelines have been issued by the ministry based on impact of the activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-gas-extraction-in-forest-areas-and-wildlife-sanctuaries-not-mining-nbwl-101634322903557.html
16-10-2021||India||‘Be ready for all possibilities:’ RSS chief Bhagwat on Taliban talks||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwant listed all the perils India faces, and the ills plaguing the country in his customary Vijayadashami speech: Taliban, China, Pakistan, terrorism, drugs, OTT platforms, over-use of mobile phones, and cryptocurrency.With New Delhi preparing to participate in talks with the Taliban, being hosted by Russia next week, Bhagwat has cautioned that even as it engages in talks, India must be “prepared for all possibilities”.The RSS is the ideological fount of the BJP and the annual Vijayadashami speech of its sarsangchalak (delivered on Dusherra day) are closely followed by analysts and experts to understand issues that could become priorities for the government in the future. Friday’s speech by Bhagwat revolved around the theme of population control (and having a uniform and universal population policy), a long-standing demand of the Sangh that is now beginning to make an appearance in population laws in some BJP-ruled states, but it also focused on other current issues. That included the Taliban, and Kashmir.Bhagwat advocated “accelerating” the process of “emotional integration” of the people of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country in the wake of targeted killings of minorities in the union territory. “Terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir have restarted the spate of targeted violence of national-minded people, especially Hindus to lower their morale and re-establish the reign of terror in the Valley. Efforts for curbing and finishing off the terrorist activities needs speeding up,” he said.He also called for stepping up vigilance along borders from where intrusions and attacks have happened stealthily, along the sea routes and ramp up internal security. “Taliban may have changed, but has Pakistan changed? Has China changed its intent towards India? Considering the possibility of a change of heart, of dialogue solving issues, we still need to be prepared,” he said.India has opted for a wait-and-watch policy and stressed that Afghanistan should not become a safe haven for terrorists. It has, however, announced that it will participate in the meeting being hosted by Russia involving Taliban next week. China, Pakistan and Iran will also attend the talks with the Taliban in Moscow.The Sangh has been a votary of a strong muscular policy to deal with China and Pakistan.The RSS chief also urged the government and society to together snuff out the menace of drugs. In the backdrop of the focus on drugs with the arrest of film star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan after a raid on a rave where drugs were being consumed, Bhagwat said drugs are being sent into India from certain bordering countries with the money generated from their sales is being used for anti-national activities and destabilising the country.He also expressed concern over the misuse of technology, particularly mobile and OTT platforms. “…. There is no regulation of the content being shown on OTT platforms, which could harm the country,” he said.Notably, in February, the Centre notified Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021,. The guidelines are applicable on social media intermediaries such as Twitter and Facebook, and OTT platforms such as Netflix, Hotstar and Amazon Prime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-ready-for-all-possibilities-rss-chief-bhagwat-on-taliban-talks-101634322425832.html

Ingredients for this oil would come from Maharashtra and Gujarat, police said.Superintendent of police, Indore, MC Jain said two accused — Chandra Prakash Pandey, manager at the factory and Suresh Kushwaha, a driver who used to transport the fuel to fuel stations — were arrested. “They had been supplying this concocted fuel at petrol pumps for the past four years...,” Jain said. Vijay Kumar Mundda, the owner of the fuel station, is absconding, police said.“The matter came to light after a vehicle owner filed an anonymous complain at Kishanganj police station that Munda Petrol Pump in the area was supplying sub-standard fuel. A joint team of police and food & civil supplies officials raided the petrol pump and took fuel samples, which were found to be adulterated,” another police officer said.The officer added that Suresh Kushwaha was supplying fuel mixed with some chemical and his arrest led to Chandra Prakash Pandey, who took the lid off the whole operations.Police said around 9,000 litre of petrol and 9,000 litre of diesel have been seized. Indore deputy inspector general of police Manish Kapuria said, “The adulteration caused loss of revenue to the state government as they used to mix 10,000 litre of petrol with 10,000 litre of chemical... They used to save ₹48 per litre on diesel and ₹43 per litre on petrol.”Madhya Pradesh Petrol Pump Association president Ajay Singh said, “This is over ₹10,000 crore scam and petrol pump owners are supplying adulterated fuel without any bill at ₹10 or ₹5 less than the notified price. A probe should be done...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-police-bust-adulterated-petrol-diesel-racket-2-arrested-101634322419989.html

Even Hindus need it, but it is not used for them,” Bhagwat said.Speaking at the annual Vijayadashmi address, he stressed on the need for a holistic management system of places of worship, pointing out how temples in southern India are fully controlled by the state governments, while in the rest of the country they are either managed by the government or by the devotees themselves. “…Besides the internal and external threats to the nation’s unity, integrity, security, development, prosperity and peace there are some concerns of the Hindu society; efforts to resolve the same is also a necessity. State of the Hindu temples today is one such concern,” Bhagwat said.The statement comes in the wake of the Malabar Devaswom Board taking control of the Mattannur Mahadeva temple in Kannur district in Kerala amid protests by the the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Hindu Aikya Vedi on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindus-must-get-control-of-temple-management-bhagwat-101634322179458.html

The deceased has been identified as Sadakat Ali, who was sitting on a scooter parked off the road, police said.The accused allegedly borrowed the Audi car from his neighbour to go on a long drive with two of his friends, aged 17 and 23, an official added.Police said the accused lost control of the speeding vehicle while jumping speed breakers. “The out-of-balance high speeding car first hit a street-side vendor, then a scooter, and finally a motorcycle. One person identified as Sadakat Ali, who was sitting on a scooter near the vendor died on the spot while two others got badly injured, one of whom is said to be in a serious condition,” a senior police officer told news agency PTI. Police have identified the injured as Vinod and Raju.Later, the accused was allegedly thrashed by passers-by, who handed him over to the police.Confirming the incident, Station House Officer Likhma Ram said medical examination of all three accused has ruled out any trace of alcohol, and police are checking the CCTV footage to ascertain who was on the driving seat. A case has been registered against the three under sections 279, 337 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-killed-3-injured-as-jodhpur-policeman-s-minor-son-loses-control-of-car-101634321821495.html

The remarks came a day after India dropped to the 101st position in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 of 116 countries, down seven places from 94th in 2020. India is now behind neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, according to the report that is based on estimates by the UN’s FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization).In a statement issued on Friday, the Union ministry of women and child development (WCD) said, “It is shocking to find that the Global Hunger Report 2021 has lowered the rank of India on the basis of FAO estimate on proportion of undernourished population, which is found to be devoid of ground reality and facts and suffers from serious methodological issues. The publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report, Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, have not done their due diligence before releasing the report.”Claiming that the methodology used by FAO was “unscientific”, the ministry said the assessment was done “telephonically” by Gallup -- an American analytics and advisory company that conducts opinion polls globally.“The scientific measurement of undernourishment would require measurement of weight and height, whereas the methodology involved here is based on a Gallup poll based on a pure telephonic estimate of the population. The report completely disregards the government’s massive effort to ensure food security of the entire population during the Covid period, verifiable data on which are available. The opinion poll does not have a single question on whether the respondent received any food support from the government or other sources. The representativeness of even this opinion poll is doubtful for India and other countries,” it added.The ministry further said that it was surprised by FAO’s ‘State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021’ report, which said that Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka have not been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The WCD ministry said there were as many as 13 factors that were “completely ignored” in the report. These included government’s initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna (PMGKAY) and Atmanirbhar Bharat Scheme, and the increase in MNREGA wages, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocking-unscientific-methodology-india-slams-global-hunger-index-101634321820150.html

He was a learned person, knew multiple languages and a great orator, which tells us he was gifted. The British proscribed his book (referring to The Indian War of Independence, 1857) even before it was published…it was the first such book in history. Those who banned his thoughts have gone, but that book is still inspiring us all. Such a scholar, thinker and brave person, and we are trying to create a controversy in his name?,” he added.Urging the youngsters to travel to the Cellular Jail to see what freedom fighters went through, Shah said: “All of us were born after the Independence, so we didn’t get to die for the country. Can we at least live for the country? There cannot be a better opportunity... Many died here, lost their mental balance here but they didn’t give up. They didn’t let the freedom flame douse.”Shah also laid a wreath at a memorial to the martyrs of the freedom struggle.On October 12, a row erupted after Rajnath Singh targeted the critics of Savarkar, saying that the freedom fighter was being defamed over mercy petitions. “Time and again, it was said that he filed mercy petitions before the British government seeking his release from jail...The truth is, he didn’t file mercy petitions to get himself released. It is a regular practice for a [jailed] person to file mercy petitions. It was Mahatma Gandhi who asked him to file mercy petitions,” Singh had said, drawing criticism from the Opposition parties who called it an “attempt to rewrite history”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-question-vd-savarkar-s-patriotism-and-bravery-amit-shah-visits-cellular-jail-in-andamans-101634321700800.html
16-10-2021||India||Govt determined to end terror ecosystem: J-K LG Manoj Sinha||The Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Manoj Sinha, has described the targeted killings of civilians, mainly from the minority communities in the Valley (Kashmiri pandits, Sikhs, Dogras) by terrorists in the Valley as an attempt by subversive forces in the neighbourhood to create fear and destabilise peace.In an interview, he said the government is determined to demolish the terror ecosystem, and that security forces have been given full freedom to carry out anti-terror operations and have intensified their crackdown against terror groups.Edited excerpts:What do you think is the reason for this sudden revival of targeted killings in the Valley and the increase in terror activities?I don’t think there has been an increase, but yes, some unfortunate incidents have occurred in the past few days. These are selective and targeted killings. It is evident that this is an attempt to change the narrative and give out the impression that all is not well in J&K, which is absolutely incorrect. The situation in the Valley had begun to normalise. In July, we had over 1 million tourists, in August the number went up to 1.128 million, and in September over 1.28 million came to the UT. There was an atmosphere of peace and tranquillity.Since a government portal (for reclaiming properties of minorities that were sold under duress or illegally occupied) has been launched, about 6,000 complaints have already been filed in a month and about 2,500 cases resolved.I feel subversive forces outside India were perturbed and changed their policy with an aim to destabilise the peace and developmental agenda. First, they targeted political workers and security forces, and then they decided to focus on the soft targets in the Valley so as to send out a message to the world.There are a few other reasons that can be attributed to these killings too. Virendra Paswan from Bihar had nothing to do with politics. He had come from a faraway place to earn his livelihood. I feel that since a large volume of investments… between ₹25,000-26,000 crore is coming into the Valley, these forces outside of India and their stooges here, were trying to send out a message that ‘we will not allow an outsider to even set up a stall and earn ₹100 a day’.As for ML Bindroo (the pharmacist who was killed), people say that even if someone called at midnight for medicines, he would help them. What is the purpose behind killing such a popular person?It is an attempt to create fear, but the government is determined to demolish the terror ecosystem and fully committed to take all the steps that are required to do so.What steps have been taken in the wake of these killings?In the last 5-7 days a number of anti-terror operations have taken place on the ground. Efforts are underway to uproot and eradicate the ecosystem of terrorism in the valley-- those who hold guns and even those who offer them safe haven.Some security analysts and experts link these targeted killings to developments in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. Do you agree with this assessment?Our information suggests this is the handiwork of forces in the neighbourhood who have been running terror networks and for long trying to create unrest in J&K. However, there are certain elements in the Valley who work on their instructions and such people will not be spared . We are making sure that law enforcement agencies take appropriate actions. Those aiding and abetting terrorists will have to pay a very heavy price for the killing of innocent people.It is alleged that the government and the security forces were warned of the possibility of such attacks and therefore, this is a security lapse.It is difficult to offer security to individuals in such a set-up. I don’t agree that this was a security failure. There are certain elements who want to change the discourse by making it a law-and-order issue, which it isn’t.The discourse in this country should be about the poor man (Paswan) who had travelled over a 1,000km to earn his livelihood and was killed. We should be condemning the killings of the entrepreneur (Bindroo) who used to supply medicines even at midnight, and the woman (Satinder Kour) who taught children and looked after an orphan by spending ₹14,000 from her own salary. I feel there should be widespread condemnation of these killings in Kashmir and in the rest of the county too.As LG, I take responsibility for these killings; the onus of protecting life and property rests on us. It is our responsibility to create a strong and agile security grid in such a way that everyone feels safe and there is no atmosphere of fear; and we promise to do so.The targeted killings have compelled some Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley to migrate again. They complain they don’t have secure living quarters and were forced to rejoin work after the killings.Strong measures are being taken to ensure the security and safety of minority communities in the Valley. I have had detailed discussions with the DGP and the IGP, Kashmir Division; they have been asked to remain alert so that all minorities, whether they are Pandits or Sikhs, feel safe and such events don’t recur. I also want to tell the community that we are responsible for their security, and they should not fall for the conspiracy [to create fear].What were the takeaways from your meetings with the Union home minister and the National Security Adviser?We want to assure the people that we have taken all the steps to strengthen the security grid. All (government) agencies are also supporting us in this. I also want to assure the people that we have given full freedom to the security forces, and they have intensified operations to crush terror.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-is-determined-to-demolish-the-terror-ecosystem-jammu-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-101634321641866.html

On Friday, the team took the friend of junior home minister’s son Ashish Mishra, Ankit Das and his gunner Latif alias Kaale back to Lucknow in search of the weapons. “The committee recovered a pistol and a repeater gun from the Lucknow residence of Ankit Das,” said a senior police officials on condition of anonymity. The pistol is registered in name of Ankit Das while the repeater gun is registered in the name of gunner, police officials added. Officials also visited a hotel where Ankit stayed for two days after the incident. They collected CCTV recording of the hotel.The protesting farmers had claimed that shots were fired by the minister’s son Ashish Mishra, the main accused, at the site of incident. Deputy Inspector General Upendra Agarwal had earlier said that two misfired cartridges were recovered from the incident site.But the investigators were yet to recover the firearms from which the bullets were fired. Eight people died in the October 3 violence and of them, four were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers. Infuriated farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver. In the incident, a journalist was also killed.So far, the police have arrested six accused, including the Union minister’s son, his two accomplices, Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, Das, his gunner and his driver Shekhar Bharti, in connection with the case.Meanwhile, the three-day police custody remand of Ashish Mishra ended on Friday. Mishra was lodged in Lakhimpur jail on Thursday night, where he will remain in judicial custody. The police will appeal again in the court for the custody remand of Ashish on Monday, said senior prosecution officer, SP YadavAvdhesh Kumar Singh, the counsel of Ashish Mishra, reiterated that his client was not present on the spot when the incident occurred. “We will apply for his bail before the court on Monday, basing our argument on the fact that my client Ashish Mishra was not present on the spot when the incident occurred,” said Singh. On Thursday, the four accused, including Ashish Mishra, Das, Latif and Bharti — were taken to the site of the incident to recreate the crime scene. The data of the crime scene recreation will be examined by forensic experts, said the officials on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-probe-team-recovers-weapons-from-accused-s-house-101634321522560.html
16-10-2021||India||32-year-old man hacked to death at farmer protest site, 1 arrested||Members of a Sikh group allegedly killed a 32-year-old farm labourer, hacked off his left arm, and tied his body to a metal barricade near the Singhu farm protest site on the outskirts of the Capital in the early hours of Friday, police said.Sonepat Police said Nihangs, a Sikh order identified by their blue robes and swords, targeted the man for allegedly desecrating the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book. The family of the deceased man, however, said that he could not have committed sacrilege.The victim was identified as Lakhbir Singh, a Dalit farm labourer from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district. A purported video clip of the incident -- which happened at Kundli on the Delhi-Haryana border -- went viral on social media.“We have registered a case under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The forensic team has examined the scene of the crime,” Rohtak additional director general of police, Sandeep Khirwar.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 43 unions coordinating the 11-month-long protest against three central agriculture laws, said a group of Nihangs claimed responsibility for the brutal killing after the man allegedly tried to desecrate the holy book.“Both the parties to the incident, the Nihang group and the deceased person, have no relation with the Morcha. As always, the SKM will cooperate with the police and the administration in any lawful action,” the group said in a statement, adding that the peaceful farm movement was opposed to any violence.A senior Sonepat police official said the accused, Saravjeet, surrendered before a team led by DSP Virender Rao visited the Nihangs’ camp.“He will be presented before the local court on Saturday. He had surrendered after his video of claiming responsibility of the killing went viral on social media platforms,” the official added.The victim’s post-mortem examination has been conducted and an autopsy report is awaited, said Kundli Station House Officer (SHO) Ravi Kumar.Haryana Police said the body was found tied to a metal barricade near the Singhu protest site stage around 5.30 am on Friday.“When the police reached there, the person had died. Some people were standing there. When the police tried to take the body away, the people at the spot protested ...the body was brought to the civil hospital Sonepat for post-mortem examination,” said a police spokesman .Village chief Awan Kumar said Singh could not have committed sacrilege on his own.“He might have been manipulated by some people ...we have heard that he was wearing some of the Sikh religious symbols...”He said their panchayat (village council) will investigate the matter to find out who was behind the sacrilege.“We sent him to a drug de-addiction centre several times, but to no avail,” said Kumar.Tarn Taran deputy police superintendent Sucha Singh Ball said Singh had no criminal background but that he was an alcoholic. “He went to the Singhu border alone.”“Around a week ago, Lakhbir took ₹50 from his sister on the pretext of going to the village’s grain market for labour work, but he never returned. He couldn’t have gone to Delhi alone. He was taken there by someone. So far, we don’t know who was behind it, but he couldn’t have committed sacrilege,” said Lakhbir’s brother-in-law Sukhchain Singh.In the purported video clip of the crime, some men in blue turbans and robes are seen standing around the injured man with his severed left hand close to his head.The group is heard accusing him of desecrating a Sikh holy book.The video purportedly shows the Nihangs asking the man where had he come from and who sent him to commit the “sacrilege”. Lakhbir is heard pleading with the group in Punjabi.The source and authenticity of the videos couldn’t be verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/body-with-severed-hand-found-hanging-at-farmer-protest-site-at-singhu-101634281978995.html
16-10-2021||India||2 soldiers killed, JCO remains missing after J-K encounter||Two soldiers from Uttarakhand were killed in an encounter with terrorists in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) while a junior commissioned officer (JCO) was missing, taking the number of Army personnel killed in the counterterrorism operations in the area to seven this week, the Army said on Friday.Defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand said the two soldiers — 26-year-old Vikram Singh Negi and 27-year-old Yogambar Singh — were killed during a search and cordon operation, in the Nar Khas forest area of Poonch’s Mendhar on Thursday evening.“During the operation, there was heavy exchange of fire and in the ensuing gunfight, Rifleman Vikram Singh Negi and Rifleman Yogambar Singh were critically injured and later succumbed to their injuries,” he said.“(The two)...displayed exemplary courage, devotion and made the supreme sacrifice in (the) line of duty. The nation will always remain indebted to these brave hearts for their supreme sacrifice for the nation.”Negi hailed from village Viman Gaon, Narendra Nagar, in Uttarakhand’s Tehri Garhwal district while Singh was from village Sankari in the state’s Chamoli district.An army official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the JCO was presumed dead initially, but later he was found missing.Efforts are on to trace him, the official added.On October 11, five army personnel, including a JCO, were killed in an encounter in Dera Ki Gali in the Surankote area of Poonch district.The casualties in that encounter were the worst security forces have suffered in anti-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir this year and came days after a series of targeted attacks left seven civilians dead in the region.A second army officer said the terrorists involved in the Nar Khas gunfight are likely to be part of the same group involved in the October 11 encounter.The army has launched a search operation in a forest area between the mountainous border districts of Rajouri and Poonch. The area is treacherous, making the operation difficult and dangerous, an officer said.A third Army officer said the loss of seven soldiers within four days showed that infiltration attempts were on and some of them were successful.The officer said infiltration attempts usually increase in October right before the onset of winter and closure of routes due to heavy snowfall.J&K Police chief Dilbag Singh in August said that infiltration resumed after a brief lull following a renewed ceasefire agreement between the director general of military operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan in February. He, however, added that terror camps across the border remained intact.The DGMOs on February 25 announced the two countries agreed to strictly observe the ceasefire along the LoC.The J&K Police have said that the terrorists involved in October 11 attacks on security forces in Poonch were present in the area for the last two to three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-soldiers-killed-in-j-k-s-poonch-101634278797906.html
16-10-2021||India||RSS chief renews demand for a national population policy||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday expressed concern over India’s growing population, calling it a “predicament” that could give rise to “many problems in the near future” and renewed his demand for a national population policy.Delivering his annual Vijaydashami speech in Nagpur, Bhagwat said, based on the “demographic changes and imbalance” that is being noticed worldwide, there is a need for a policy “applicable to all”.“There should be a population policy. There has been some discussion on the issue before. Based on the view of experts, the government agreed to a 2.1 children per family formula. But we feel there is a need to revisit the issue,” Bhagwat said.He said the country will need a policy that will take into account the next 50 years and strike a balance – even assessing how many people will be needed to feed the aging population after 30 years.Bhagwat referred to a resolution passed by the Sangh in 2015 demanding a population policy; and said it was in line with a resolution on population control passed in Cairo in 2005 when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister.This is not the first time that the Sangh chief has voiced the demand for a law to check population. In 2018, he underscored the need for a common law to ensure “demographic balance”, pivoted on the principle of a uniform policy that would be applicable to all and implemented without exception. The Sangh’s repeated mention of a population policy, while mentioning the perils of a large population, is also built around the belief that the Hindu population of the country isn’t growing as fast as the Muslim or Christian population, one reason why Bhagwat’s older comments on this, as well as those from his speech on Friday, emphasise terms such as demographic imbalance and universal applicability of any policy.Such a policy, the Sangh says, will serve the multiple purposes of checking illegal infiltration, conversions through coercion and ensure an equal right to natural resources.A 2019 report by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs said that India would add around 273 million people to its population between 2020 and 2050, around 13.7% of the increase in the world’s population in the same period. The report put India’s population in 2050 at 1.64 billion. India’s population is expected to exceed China’s by 2027.India will retain a demographic advantage till the middle of the century with the median age of its population increasing to 38 from 29; by then, China’s median age is expected to be 55-56 and the US’s 44-45.In 2004, at the Akhil Bhartiya Karyakarini Mandal or the executive board meeting, the Sangh referred to Census 2011 to buttress its claims of changes in numbers of Hindus and other communities.According to census data, the population growth rate in the decade 2001-2011 was lower than in the 1991-2001 decade. The overall 17.7% growth rate in 2001-2011 was 0.82 times of the 21.5% growth rate in the 1991-2001 decade.While growth rates of all major religions also decreased, they did not decrease in the same degree. The Hindu population grew by 0.87 times as it had the previous decade, while in the case of the Muslim population, the growth was slightly slower: 0.84 times of the previous decade.In case of Christians and Sikhs, the dip was larger. The Christian population grew at 0.69 times the previous decade and the Sikhs’, the increase was nearly half.To be sure, these figures are dependent on 1991 projections for Jammu and Kashmir, where the census was not conducted in 1991 due to unrestIn 2015, a year after the BJP-led NDA government came to power at the Centre with a clear majority, the Sangh at its Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal held in Ranchi, passed a resolution demanding that the government should “reformulate the national population policy keeping in view the availability of resources in the country, future needs and the problem of demographic imbalance” and that this policy should be “applied uniformly.”It was this resolution that Bhagwat read from in his speech.Following the Sangh’s concerted campaign for a population policy, at least three BJP-ruled states -- Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam -- recently announced their intent to introduce the population control policy.SS Jodhka, professor of sociology at the Jawaharlal Nehru University however, said the anxiety about changing demography is a mechanism that the Sangh uses to push its ideology.“Changes in demography have been one of the foundational anxieties of the Sangh. It is a political strategy to mobilise anxiety among the Hindus that they are a persecuted majority. There is no data-based evidence to suggest that Muslims are outnumbering the Hindus. The birth rate of Hindus in the lower socio-economic demographics has been nearly equal to the Muslims in the comparable stratum...” Jodhka said.BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP, Rakesh Sinha said Bhagwat’s demand was an “expression of the collective sentiments of 130 crore Indians who face the challenges imposed by the growing population on a day-to-day basis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sangh-renews-demand-for-population-policy-101634277599540.html
16-10-2021||India||250 prospective parents write to Irani seeking reforms in old adoption norms||A group of 250 prospective adoptive parents (PaPs) and adoptive parents has written to Union women and child development minister Smriti Irani, seeking various reforms in the existing adoption norms in the country so that the process becomes faster and transparent. While PaPs are those who have registered with the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) — a statutory body under the ministry of women and child development (WCD) — and are yet to receive a child, the adoptive parents are those who have already received a child through the authority. The group of parents, who have reached out to the ministry through an advocacy group known as ‘Adoption Action Group’, include both resident and non-resident Indians. In a letter dated October 7, the group highlighted several issues, including the delay in getting referrals (notification issued after CARA finds a suitable match for any PaP), lack of information and transparency from CARA, lack of clarity on the new processes or plans adopted during the pandemic, increased threat of illegal adoptions and trafficking of children orphaned by Covid-19, among others. “These issues have a direct impact on the process and current waiting time for PaPs...From an already long wait of two and a half years, we are now into a three-year-long process and heading towards a waiting period of more than three years,” the group said in the letter.“We need to acknowledge that the delay has a mental, financial and emotional impact on adoptive families. It has put the future of adoptive families at stake with debilitating concerns like the increasing age gap between parents & adoptees and the struggle to give children a normal and happy family life...,” it added.According to the standard process of adoption in the country, when a child is orphaned or abandoned, he or she must be produced (by anyone) before a district child welfare committee (CWC). The committee, in the interim period, sends the child to a children’s home and then passes an order conducting a social investigation to check the background of the child and the family in a structured format. Once it’s established that the parents are either unwilling to support, or simply unable to, or the child has been orphaned and nobody is coming forward, the committee declares the child legally free for adoption. Then the CWC directs the appropriate authority in CCI (childcare institution) and DCPO (district child protection officer) to complete the medical examination report and register the child on CARA. Only after following this procedure, the child is referred to any PaP. The group has put forward several demands, including acceleration of the referral process; a system to ensure that CWCs bring every possible child into the legal adoption pool; fixing delays in kids being declared adoptable by CWCs; and better coordination between the ministry, the states and CARA to plug the loopholes in the system to achieve the ultimate purpose of a centralised system, among others.“The paperwork and process involved in bringing orphaned or abandoned children to the adoption pool is very slow and fragmented between different parties. The whole system of CARA was evolved to streamline things. But the system itself has become such a deterrent in getting children inside the pool that now parents are waiting on one side for three-four years and children are waiting on another side in childcare centres. So, we decided to write to the ministry to raise all these issues,” said a member of the the Adoption Action Group. When contacted, a senior official in the WCD ministry said on condition of anonymity, “The CARA officials will soon hold a virtual meeting with this group of PaPs and discuss their concerns. The ministry is committed to addressing all the issues and make the adoption process easier, smoother and hassle-free.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/250-prospective-parents-write-to-smriti-irani-seeking-reforms-in-old-adoption-norms-101634239913104.html
