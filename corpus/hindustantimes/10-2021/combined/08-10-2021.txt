The IAF’s power packed air show, on the occasion of the 89th Air Force Day, showcased a range of aircraft which flew in different formations to commemorate the 50th year of India’s victory over Pakistan during the 1971 war. The participating Hawks were from the operational conversion unit ‘Alpha’, which is the same squadron which flew the Hunter aircraft during the 1971 war. The different formations showcased on Friday, that were named after war heroes and operations carried out during the 1971 war, enthralled spectators at the Hindon airbase. People also got a glimpse of a single seat interceptor and air defence/ground attack Gnat aircraft. The event started with a team of the ‘Akash Ganga’ paratroopers taking a plunge from an AN-32 transport aircraft, which flew at a height of 8,000 metres above the Hindon airbase. Three paratroopers, including one from the Indian Army, were seen paradropping from a height of 6,000 ft from a vintage Dakota aircraft while carrying the Indian Tricolour along with IAF flag. IAF officials said the paradrop depicted the Tangail airdrop operation it carried out during the 1971 war. “There were 75 aircraft which participated in the air show at the Hindon airbase. Different formations, such as Tangail, Meghna, Longewala, Sekhon and others, were demonstrated. In the Sekhon formation, there was a mixed use of different aircraft like LCA Tejas, Jaguars, Rafales and Mirage-2000s. The formations were either named after war heroes or operations carried out during the 1971 war,” said a spokesperson from IAF. The tandem rotor Chinook helicopters, procured from the US in 2019, demonstrated a formation--ferrying 155mm artillery guns suspended by cables-- depicting the operation that the IAF carried out near Meghna river during the 1971 war. Back then, the operation was codenamed ‘Cactus Lily.’ The five MiG-29 air superiority aircraft of the 47 squadron flew in the ‘Vijay’ formation over the Hindon airbase. Officials said the squadron undertook various missions like strikes, escorts and combat air patrolling during the 1971 war. Likewise, a group of Jaguar deep penetration strike aircraft flew in ‘Shamsher’ formation and belonged to the 14 squadron, which played a vital role during the 1971 war. The ‘Pratap’ formation, demonstrated by a Dakota flanked by two Dornier aircraft, paid tributes to the legends who operated such aircraft. A Globemaster heavy lift aircraft followed by a team of nine aircraft from the ‘Suryakiran’ aerobatic team demonstrated the ‘Tiranga’ formation, celebrating 75 years of India’s independence. The Suryakirans flew in different formations and even demonstrated the shape of a Gnat aircraft, which fought the battle of Boyra on November 22, 1971. It was an aerial interception battle that was fought between IAF and Pakistani Air Force jets, which intruded into Indian air space. “The first aerial engagement between IAF & PAF in the buildup to the 1971 war took place on Novemver 22, when IAF Gnats intercepted PAF Sabres over Boyra. In the ensuing dogfight, three PAF Sabres were claimed by the IAF Gnats, with two crashing in the Indian territory,” the IAF said in a tweet in November 2020. The Suryakiran team also demonstrated the shape of India’s light combat aircraft ‘Tejas’ and depicted the different delta wing aircraft--Mig-21s, Mirage-2000s, LCA Tejas and Sukhois, which IAF operates. The four aircraft were also at static display at the Hindon airbase. Air chief Marshal V R Chaudhary thanked and congratulated the air warriors on Air Force Day. “As the IAF enters its 90th year, the men and women in Blue who serve the nation today are proud custodians of a legacy of valour, sacrifice and pioneering spirit. It is a great honour for me to stand before you as the successor to a great lineage of commanders who charted a course of a service and brought us to where we stand today,” he said. The Rafale, Sukhoi-30 and Tejas also performed different manoeuvrers, during which they also deployed flares over the airbase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-warriors-demonstrate-formations-to-commemorate-1971-indo-pak-war-victory-101633717646886.html

08-10-2021||Noida||Noida: 12 arrested for planning digital currency fraud||The Noida Special Task Force (STF) and Sector 58 police on Friday arrested 12 people who had gathered at a hotel to launch a digital currency. Officials said that although currently there is no law allowing or prohibiting trading in cryptocurrency in India, the suspects, under the guise of launching a digital currency, were planning to engage in multilevel marketing, which is illegal. Multilevel marketing, just like any other Ponzi scheme, is the practice of selling goods or services on behalf of a company in a system whereby participants receive commission on their sales as well as the sales of any participants they recruit.  Hemraj Meena, senior superintendent of police, Uttar Pradesh STF, said police received information that some people would be gathering at a hotel in Noida’s Sector 62 to launch a digital currency ‘Coin Cake’. “A joint team of Noida STF and Noida police conducted a raid and arrested 12 people from the hotel. Police recovered 16 mobile phones, two laptops, 30 debit cards, seven Aadhaar cards--four of which were forged-- 116 visiting cards, two wristwatches, six driving licences, one Toyota Fortuner and one Tata Safari and ₹1.52 lakh cash from their possession,” said Meena.Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida STF, said most of the arrested persons previously worked in a fictitious real estate company, whose owners duped scores of investors and fled abroad in 2019. “A total of 284 cases were registered against this real estate firm. During interrogation, one of the suspects, identified as Ashish Kumar (30) from Muzzafarnagar, said he had done his MBA from UK’s Cambridge University in 2011. He returned to India and started working for that dubious real estate firm as a technical head in 2018,” said Mishra. Another suspect, identified as Vikram Singh Yadav (35), from Lucknow, was a senior manager in the same company.Mishra said Kumar and Yadav joined hands to launch a virtual currency to cheat people. “They also roped in some former employees of the same company. On Friday, they called around 80 investors for the launch of the digital currency and sought investment, promising to double their money in a year. They were planning a multilevel marketing scheme, which is illegal,” said Mishra. A case has been registered against the suspects under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of Chits and Money Circulation Act. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-12-arrested-for-planning-digital-currency-fraud-101633717484723.html
08-10-2021||Noida||Air Force Day: Year gone by challenging yet rewarding, says IAF chief||Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhary, on the occasion of the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s 89th foundation day at Ghaziabad’s Hindon airbase on Friday, said that “challenges continue to rise” and “external forces will not be allowed to violate our territory”.Air Force Day was celebrated with spectacular ground and air displays by air warriors at the Hindon airbase. The force also commemorated the ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’ to mark 50 years of India’s victory in the 1971 war with Pakistan.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also greeted air warriors and their families on the occasion.“Greetings to our air warriors and their families on Air Force Day. The Indian Air Force is synonymous with courage, diligence, and professionalism. They have distinguished themselves in defending the country and through their humanitarian spirit in times of challenges,” Modi said in a tweet.Speaking at the Hindon airbase, the IAF chief said that he is acutely conscious that he assumed command of the force at a crucial time.“As our challenges continue to rise, so does our strength and resolve to ensure best possible application of airpower. When I look at the security scenario that we face today, I am acutely conscious that I have assumed the command at a crucial time,” he said.The IAF chief said that the year gone by was “quite challenging yet extremely rewarding”.“The prompt actions in response to developments in eastern Ladakh were a testament to the Indian Air Force’s combat readiness. Our efforts in completing all Covid-related tasks were also a major achievement in support of the national efforts,” he said.During the standoff with China in Ladakh, the IAF deployed various attack and multi-mission helicopters, transport aircraft, and frontline fighters, including Rafale aircraft, to strengthen its military posture in the region. The air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters, and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the aircraft that have operated in the Ladakh sector.India and China have been locked in a border standoff for 17 months, and both sides are carrying out negotiations to reduce tensions.The air chief said that the security environment in the region and beyond has been “impacted by a complex interplay of geopolitical forces”.“Moreover, the advent of new domains over and above the traditional domains of land, sea, and air has resulted in a paradigm shift in the way military operations will be conducted. In sync with the changing nature of warfighting, ongoing capability enhancement in the IAF aims to provide the optimum means for employing airpower and achieving desired effects across domains swiftly and decisively... We must demonstrate to the nation that external forces will not be allowed to violate our territory,” he added.The IAF celebrated Air Force Day at the Hindon base with a ceremonial parade by about 233 air warriors and the participation of 75 different aircraft.The IAF’s frontline fighters, including Rafale, Sukhoi, Tejas, Mig 29, and Jaguar, flew in different formations named after different operations carried out during the 1971 war with Pakistan.The IAF chief also awarded Vayu Sena Medals for gallantry, Vayu Sena Medals, Vishista Sewa Medals, and unit citations. It is customary for the IAF to announce unit citations on Air Force Day (October 8).Those who received the medals include Group Captain Saumitra Tamaskar, Wing Commanders Bibhu Dutta SK Jenamani, Ambar Agrawal, and Rahul Basoya, besides Squadron Leaders Vivek Gairola, Arun B, Anand Singh, and Preji Raju.The IAF chief also awarded unit citations to three units of the IAF to bolster India’s posture in eastern Ladakh following the standoff with China.The three units are the No. 47 Squadron equipped with upgraded MiG-29 fighters, the 116 Helicopter Unit consisting of advanced light helicopter Mark IV (ALH Mk IV) Rudra, and 2255 Squadron Det which operates the OSA-AK-M surface-to-air weapon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-force-day-year-gone-by-challenging-yet-rewarding-says-iaf-chief-101633717406623.html
08-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG house meeting on Monday, focus on measures against vector-borne diseases||The house meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will take place this Monday at John Hall in Civil Lines. With over 100 dengue cases recorded in the district this season, issues such as procurement of an adequate number of fogging machines and fixing of drains that can become a ground for mosquito breeding are likely to be discussed at the meeting.Sheetal Bagri, councillor of ward 10, proposed an agenda for the MCG to procure new fogging machines as she said that several of the existing ones were found to be not working.“Due to the inadequate number of fogging machines as well as the fact that old machines are not working, fogging activities are getting affected not just in ward 10 but across the city. On several occasions, residents of ward 10 have asked for fogging to be carried out only to discover that the MCG fogging machines are either not working or working in a limited capacity,” said Bagri, adding that her agenda asks MCG to procure a new stock of fogging machines.As per the district administration’s media bulletin issued on Friday, Gurugram reported 10 new cases of dengue taking the tally of confirmed cases this season to 101. Gurugram has also reported two cases of malaria this year, as per the bulletin.Virender Raj Yadav, MCG councillor of ward 4 has also proposed an agenda to fix stormwater drains along Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road.He attributed the breeding of mosquitoes to the overflow of stormwater drains as one of the reasons for proposing the agenda.“Besides the mixing of stormwater and sewerage line due to broken sections, the uncovered parts and overflow are also leading to mosquito breeding. Dengue cases across the city, including ward 4, are on the rise, hence, I have floated the agenda for discussion in the upcoming house meeting,” said Yadav.Other key agendas for Monday’s house meeting include restarting water ATMs, a status update of all private colonies that the MCG has to take over, and a status update on developing a model road in each of MCG’s 35 wards, which was approved in a previous house meeting.“Under the chairmanship of MCG mayor Madhu Azad, a house meeting will be held on Monday, at 11am, in John Hall, Civil Lines. All listed agendas and other proposals will be put forward for deliberation, and decisions on the matter will accordingly be taken by MCG officials and councillors,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-house-meeting-on-monday-focus-on-measures-against-vector-borne-diseases-101633717346148.html
08-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Joint panel to assess waste dumping at Raj Nagar Extension||The National Green Tribunal (NGT), while hearing a petition filed by a resident of Raj Nagar Extension (RNE) on Thursday, issued directions for the formation of a joint committee of officials, who will assess the factual position of dumping of municipal solid waste near RNE and take remedial measures to address the issue within two months. The joint committee has also been directed to submit a report on the action taken with regard to waste dumping. The divisional commissioner (Meerut), officials of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), state pollution control board, Ghaziabad municipal-corporation and Ghaziabad district magistrate have been asked to be a part of the joint committee. A petition was filed by Vikrant Sharma, a lawyer and resident of RNE, who contended trucks of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation were bringing and dumping solid waste over a 20 bigha land at Bhatta Number 5 Road near RNE. “The state PCB will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance. The meeting will be presided over by the commissioner, Meerut division which may be organized within two weeks and remedial action taken within two months thereafter. The joint committee may also interact with the concerned authorities of the Hindon air base and other stakeholders,” the tribunal said in its order. “The joint committee may ascertain whether there is any plan for waste management in the city of Ghaziabad. It may be further examined whether requisite processing plant to process day to day waste has been set up,” said the order. Sharma said the RNE residents were suffering due to the unhygienic conditions resulting from dumping of solid waste. Recently, residents in the area also protested against the waste dumping. “It is an achievement for us that the tribunal has taken cognisance and admitted our petition. It has also roped in the divisional commissioner, who we expect will try to resolve our issues. The RNE is about 6km away from the Hindon airbase. Dumping solid waste here may attract birds, which could pose as a problem to aircraft,” said Sharma. The tribunal has also sought replies on whether the existing legacy waste at the Shakti Khand dumping site at Indirapuram has been tackled and asked for a report in this connection. Currently, Ghaziabad city generates about 1,200 metric tonnes of solid waste daily. The city’s biggest landfill site at Pratap Vihar was shut down in January 2019 on the directions of the UP solid waste monitoring committee that was set up on the directions of the tribunal. Officials said the landfill site at Pratap Vihar has about 4.5 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste, which will be completely processed by the end of the current financial year. The Shakti Khand site has about 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of solid waste, which is likely to get processed by October. The municipal corporation started dumping solid waste near RNE after the site at Pratap Vihar was shut down. Following protests from RNE residents, the civic body diverted their vehicles to Galand in Hapur district, where a waste to energy plant has been proposed. “We faced protests from locals and Galand and are trying to resolve the issues here. We have stopped dumping waste near RNE and are taking the waste to our garbage factories at Sihani and Ret Mandi. Another factory will come up at Shakti Khand site. We will comply with the directions of the tribunal,” said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-joint-panel-to-assess-waste-dumping-at-raj-nagar-extension-101633717288857.html

08-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body to set up control room to monitor illegal dumping of waste||Along the lines of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is developing its own control room to monitor the dumping of unauthorised waste, track the movement of mechanised sweeping machines and garbage collection vehicles as well as track Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) violations.A decision on setting up a control room was taken by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja during an internal meeting on sanitation-related issues held on Thursday evening. Ahuja directed officials to set up the control room by the end of this month.“GPS has been installed in all mechanised sweeping machines and garbage collection vehicles of the MCG. The movement of each of these vehicles during the Grap period is already pre-determined. Through a dedicated control room, the movement of each vehicle will be monitored and, accordingly, an alert would be sent to the MCG official concerned if there is any change in route or if a vehicle is stalled for a prolonged duration,” said a senior MCG official who attended Thursday’s meeting requesting anonymity.According to the official quoted above, MCG also decided to install CCTV cameras at 34 unauthorised dumping points identified by the civic body, as well as secondary garbage collection points, each of which will also be monitored via the control room.MCG officials said that space has been shortlisted in their Sector 39 and Sector 42 offices to set up the control room. “Officials have been directed to check if the Sector 39 or the Sector 42 office is more feasible. Accordingly, next week’s meeting on sanitation-related issues will be held at the finalised site where the control room will come up,” said Ahuja.Regarding the 34 unauthorised dumping points, MCG officials said that waste has already been cleared from 20 of the points, while the process of cleaning 14 more points is underway. They also said that besides the installation of CCTV cameras, a boundary wall will be erected and saplings will be planted at each of them.Besides the MCG, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) also has a dedicated control room.The GMDA’s Integrated Command Control Centre (ICCC) in Sector 44 was established in December 2019 for improving coordination among various public agencies through a single coordination platform, surveillance, monitoring of traffic and traffic violations, streetlights, GIS services, among other such amenities.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) is also likely to set up a control room to monitor air quality in Gurugram district by next week. Officials said that they have requested the state government to set up the control room with five members including a supervisor.Sandeep Singh, regional officer HSPCB for Gurugram south, said, “We are in talks with the department for setting up a 24x7 control room that will look into all complaints, through social media, call-in complaints, and corresponding air qualities of different places.

08-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation readies equipment to tackle air pollution in city||Ghaziabad, which is listed among 16 “non-attainment” cities in Uttar Pradesh with high levels of pollutants in the air -- will get several equipment in a fortnight to tackle air pollution in the city, officials said on Friday.The Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) is set to purchase and fit five road sweeping machines, three static anti-smog guns, and five sprinkler vehicles with mounted anti-smog guns at the hotspots identified in the city, and make those operational around Deepawali in November this year.The civic body has got only one anti-smog gun in its inventory, as the officials target a total of eight such systems to tackle air pollution in the city. “We are in the process of purchasing three static anti-smog guns, and have bought five sprinkler vehicles, which will be mounted with the anti-smog guns... Our tally of anti-smog guns will be nine altogether. These anti-smog guns will be deployed at the hotspots identified in the city. The request for the proposal is getting finalised, and it is likely that the purchases will be made within a fortnight,” said Pramod Kumar, additional municipal commissioner of GMC.The GMC also has three mechanical road sweeping machines which cover about 197 kilometres of a road distance -- both sides -- at different locations in the city. “We are in the process of purchasing five new road sweeping machines which will help us cover major road stretches in a better manner. These machines will be deployed at 36 different locations, according to the need. We have decided on a roster of water sprinkling at 34 locations where the dust pollution is high,” Kumar added.A city is declared to be “non-attainment” if it consistently does not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter (PM10) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over a period of five years. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality index in Ghaziabad was recorded at 194 -- under the ‘moderate’ category -- on Friday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”Meanwhile, officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the issue of road dust, mechanised road sweeping, and water sprinkling were also discussed at a meeting held by the Ghaziabad environment committee at the district headquarters on Friday. “With the induction of these new equipment, we hope that the air pollution levels in the city will be in check to an extent... We have also asked different departments concerned to repair roads and make those potholes-free by October 30, 2021, a deadline also given by the state officials... About the under-construction Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Road for which the work has been pending for about a year now, we have planned to initiate prosecution proceedings against the contractor,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.Under its ‘winter action plan,’ the UPPCB officials have identified 10 hotspots -- Sahibabad, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar Extension, Delhi Meerut Road, Loni, Bhopura-Delhi border, South Side GT Road, Sanjay Nagar, Vasundhara, and Siddharth Vihar -- in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-readies-equipment-to-tackle-air-pollution-in-city-101633717105017.html

08-10-2021||Noida||Now, Ganga water supply may start next year in Greater Noida||The supply of Ganga water in the city has once again missed its deadline as the Greater Noida authority is yet to complete the work on the pipeline network. Now, officials from the authority said that the Ganga water project will become operational in January next year. The project has missed its latest deadline of October 2.Senior officials of the Greater Noida authority on Thursday visited the primary water treatment plant built at Hapur’s Dehra from where Ganga water will reach Greater Noida’s Jaitpur reservoir. “We are making all efforts so that the Ganga water reaches Jaitpur within a month. We hope all works will be completed by the end of this year, and the supply of Ganga water will start in January,” said Kapil Dev, senior manager of the Greater Noida authority.Started in 2005, the ₹800 crore project was scheduled to be completed in 2010, but has missed several deadlines over the years. First, the authority extended completion deadline to 2013. In April 2016, the authority had set March 2018 as the deadline for this project.The project was delayed due to the non-availability of land. The farmers had refused to give the land for laying of water pipeline. “We are doing our best to resolve land issues. Apart from some land issues, ongoing construction for dedicated industrial corridor involving laying of railway tracks and road construction in the city are also posing hurdles in laying pipelines,” said an authority official, seeking anonymity.Residents said that the project has got delayed as the authority is not resolving land issues in a time-bound manner. “As a result, we are failing to get quality drinking water. We depend on saline groundwater for drinking and other purposes,” said Om Raizada, a resident of Sector P3.Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association, said, “The Greater Noida authority does not seem to be serious on delivery of Ganga water to city residents as the project keep missing deadlines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/now-ganga-water-supply-may-start-next-year-in-greater-noida-101633716870798.html
08-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Six held for cheating people of jewellery pretending as magicians||Six people were arrested on Friday for allegedly cheating people on the pretext of doubling their jewellery items through “magic”. Police also arrested two goldsmiths in connection with the case.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Sector 58 police on October 5 registered an FIR against three unknown persons in a cheating case. Complainant Rajendra Singh, a resident of Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad, said his wife and her two friends visited Noida’s Sector 59 for a job interview at a private company. “Three of the suspects approached the women near the company office and struck a conversation with them. They convinced the women that they are magicians and can double their jewellery. When the women handed over their earrings, rings, and anklets to them, the suspects fled with the valuables,” said the DCP. Explaining the modus operandi, police said the suspects used to strike a conversation with vulnerable people, especially women, and convinced them that they knew some magic to double jewellery items. The suspects would then wrap the valuables in some paper and ask the victims to close their eyes, while they fled with the valuables. The suspects used the same modus operandi to cheat the three women, said police. A case was registered against them under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC. The DCP said police received information about the movement of some of the suspects near Sector 59. “A police team reached the spot and stopped two cars for checking. There were six persons in the two vehicles. Police found some gold and silver jewellery from their possession. The suspects revealed that they were members of a gang which stole valuables from people by pretending as magicians,” he said. Police said the gang had been active in Delhi-NCR for the last six months.The suspects were identified as Hamid Ali, 30, from East Delhi; Mohammad Nazur Khan,25, from Simapuri in Delhi; Afroz, 26, from Vasundra in Ghaziabad; Shahid, 22, from Dilshad Garden; Mohammad Sahib, 23, from Indirapuram in Ghaziabad; and Abbas, 25, from Bhalswa in Delhi. Ali, the mastermind, told police that the gang members used to sell the stolen valuables to two goldsmiths – Sachin Verma, 28, and Prajwal Verma, 30, residents of Ghaziabad. Police then conducted a search at the goldsmiths’ hideouts and arrested them. Police have also seized the two cars.  The suspects were produced in court that sent them to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-six-held-for-cheating-people-of-jewellery-pretending-as-magicians-101633716869366.html

As per information, around 120 buses were bought under the Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in February 2011, but the authorities have not been able to use them optimally. Out of these 120 buses, only 83 were transferred to the company. And, of the 83 buses in possession of the contractor who was awarded the contract to run the city buses, only 27 are plying on roads, while the remaining ones are gathering dust at either depots or workshops on Hambran Road and Tajpur Road.Stating that the buses were purchased at around ₹68 crore, AAP leaders demanded that the government should put them to use and not waste the taxpayers’ hard-earned money.Kulwant Sidhu, AAP in-charge, Atam Nagar constituency, said if the government cannot run the buses, then it should at least rent them out to the youth and generate employment.Sidhu said, “The government made tall claims regarding providing employment to youths. It should at least rent these buses out to them as these have been lying in a dilapidated condition for years now. The issue has been raised several times in the past but to no avail. The public is being forced to pay more for travelling in private buses and auto-rickshaws as the MC has failed to run the facility at low fares.”Sidhu added as many as 37 buses worth ₹17 crore have been gathering dust at the city bus depot for over eight years, while many are lying in dilapidated condition on Hambran Road, with many of their parts stolen.Despite repeated attempts made to contact mayor Balkar Sandhu, his comments could not be elicited. The MC had also served a termination notice to the contractor company running the bus service in the city, but the contractor moved the high court and the case is subjudice. The contractor has also been seeking a hike in the fare citing the spike in diesel prices. He has also been raising the issue of auto-rickshaw unions creating hurdles in operating the bus service, especially in the Sahnewal area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taking-dig-at-ludhiana-mc-aap-leaders-clean-dilapidated-buses-101633716624922.html

In the departmental inquiry conducted then, it was found that a large number of defaulters’ electricity arrears were illegally dropped out by manipulating the data of the LESA’s online billing system by hacking the main password. However, no one was punished then.The SIT probe into the LESA’s bill revision racket now comes at a time when 23 UPPCL engineers and three clerks have recently been chargesheeted for committing serious irregularities in issuing temporary power connections of smaller loads for the construction of multi-storey apartments without any records of metering and billing to deliberately benefit builders in Noida and Greater Noida. “The SIT has started investigation into the LESA’s bill revision racket on the directions issued to it by the home department and has written a letter to the Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (MVVNL) managing director seeking certain relevant details from him to get to the culprits,” a senior UPPCL official said.In his correspondence with the MD on September 29, SIT superintendent of police (SP) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj referred to the letter sent to him by special secretary, home (police section 3) on January 2, 2021.The home department as the SP wrote in the letter, asked the SIT to identify the LESA officials, employees and consumers who caused around ₹2.50 crore loss to the UPPCL by washing out arrears from official records by manipulating LESA’s online billing data between 2004 and 2008. The SIT was given two weeks’ time to complete the probe. The SIT has sought details regarding names of LESA divisions covered under the online billing system between 2004 and 2008 and the names and all other details of officials/employees who were posted there during the same period and also the details of private companies and their staff working for LESA then.Reiterating the SIT’s letter, MVVNL director (commercial), Pradeep Kakkar sent a missive to both the chief engineers LESA (trans-Gomti and cis-Gomti) on October 6, asking them to ensure that the desired information was made available to the SIT immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lesa-bill-revision-scam-sit-begins-investigation-101633716504691.html

Our players can do wonders if the government provides financial aid and develops the infrastructure required for the game. A poor person cannot afford to play it.”He added that as there is only one shooting range in Ludhiana (Talwara village), his father got a personal shooting range constructed for him at their farmhouse.Rajveer took inspiration from his father Manmohan Singh Gill, who is also a national skeet player and the sarpanch of his village.“I am living my father’s dream. It wasn’t easy for me to practice along with my studies in school. While pursuing law from Patiala, I managed to devote time to my game. My father got me the best possible training,” stated Gill. Sharing his experience of participating in the world championship, Rajveer said that the players who can hold their nerves under pressure succeed.“A total of seven teams qualified for the finals. The pressure in the finals is always immense, and one needs to have a cool temperament while focusing on the target. There is a huge difference between the shooting ranges which we have in Punjab and the international ranges. Since it was my second international world championship, I was familiar with the pressure. I had also participated in the Skeet World Cup held in Italy in 2018,” told Singh.Meanwhile, MLA Ayali congratulated Rajveer for making the country proud.“It is so pleasing to see our young sportsmen bringing laurels to the country. His achievement will inspire many in Punjab,” said Ayali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/country-needs-better-infrastructure-for-skeet-event-shooter-rajveer-gill-101633716264713.html
08-10-2021||Pune||Pune district may have 35k malnourished kids: NFHS survey||The National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS) for the year 2019-2020 has projected that Pune district may have at least 35,000 malnourished kids, however, the district administration has defended itself claiming that the numbers are projections based on a sample survey and not actual screening. The NFHS survey which was based on samples screened in the district projects numbers based on the results in the survey and the overall population of the district. The State ICDS meeting chaired by commissioner Rubal Agarwal on Friday along with all district Zilla Parishad CEOs discussed that the reporting of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) of children in all the districts is very poor. However in the joint screening by the health department and the women and child welfare department, Pune recorded only 253 SAM children in August 2021 which contradicts the projection by the NFHS screening based on the results of sample projects that there could be more than 35,000 SAM children in the district, in both urban and rural areas. Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad said, “We have found that our active interventions including providing nutritional meal packages and medical interventions have been effective. From 600 SAM kids we are now down to below 300 in a year’s time. The projection by the NFHS is based on a sample survey and we are not aware if it is in the rural or urban areas, so that the screening is unbiased. Local administration does not intervene in the screening. However, in the rural areas we have accounted for every child and each child is physically screened by Asha workers and also verified by qualified doctors after which they are declared as malnourished or healthy. As of now we have about 253 SAM kids in rural areas and in the past one year we have had 2,500 medical interventions like surgeries and hospitalisation for children who needed medical intervention.” Agarwal, who chaired the meet, said, “The difference between the projections by NFHS and the local administration is much higher for almost all the districts in the state. So we have asked the local administrations to detect and report more cases. The NFHS has also found that multiple districts have less than 70% who have received their Aadhar card. Aadhar helps register the child and also track his or her health track.” Along with Pune, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Raigad, Aurangabad, Gondia, Jalna and thane +Palghar have reported less than 70% children who have received their Aadhar Card. The Pune administration has tied up with the postal department to ensure that each child is linked to an Aadhar card, added Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-may-have-35k-malnourished-kids-nfhs-survey-101633716084746.html

According to the result sheets submitted by the Ludhiana schools, maximum students secured between 40% to 80% marks.The teachers were made familiar with various techniques to prepare students for NAS.“Many students are habitual of mugging concepts rather than understanding the basics. We were asked to make them understand the basics. Not many students could score around 80% in these exams. To bag the top spot for the state, it is essential that our students should secure above 80%,” said a principal.‘Should take legal action against accused instead’Meanwhile, Sukhdarshan Singh, president of the Anti-Cheating Teachers’ Front, Punjab, who was the whistleblower in the paper leak case, said that instead of taking legal action against the culprit who leaked the question papers on his Youtube, the board is evaluating results.“There is no sense in evaluating the result of the papers which got leaked much before the exam date.

But ending the deadlock, 107 families of the two villages have now handed over their land for the airport project to the Ayodhya administration. “The state government has approved the proposal for extending benefits to 107 families under the Pradhan Mantra Awas Yojana who will be relocated for the airport project,” said Anuj Jha, district magistrate, Ayodhya. “After villagers agreed to relocate, an alternative land has also been allotted to them within the limits of the Ayodhya Municipal Corporation,” added Jha. According to the state government, ₹1001.77 crore has been approved for the purchase of 555.66-acre land for the construction of the airport. Families relocated for the airport project will also get benefits of various other schemes of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ayodhya-int-l-airport-project-fasttracked-101633715304589.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||IT raids on kin of Ajit Pawar: Pawar clan hints at aggressive stand against BJP||A day after Income Tax (I-T) authorities carried out raids at residences and offices of the relatives and sugar factories connected to deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar, the party took an aggressive stand against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government. The party held a show of strength in Pune outside Central Hall against I-T action against Pawar family. The party has believably started preparations to make the Maharashtra Bandh, announced by the ruling coalition on October 11, successful in a bid to corner BJP. Ajit Pawar and NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule, who is a Member of Parliament (MP) from Baramati, also reacted bitterly to I-T action. BJP said the action was being taken by the central agency and its government at the Centre was not resorting to political vendetta. I-T officers raided the houses of Ajit Pawar’s two sisters and the office of his son Parth in the past two days. Sugar factories related to him, too, were raided. While the Pawars said this was a misuse of power, the family has reportedly taken the action very seriously by contending that their members, who have nothing to do with politics, were being targeted owing to political vendetta.Sharad Pawar reacted sharply to the raids on the houses of his nieces and reminded the central agencies about the reaction of the people after the the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had sent him a notice in 2019. “I was sent a notice by ED [in connection to alleged regularities] in Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank. I had nothing to do with the bank. But the entire Maharashtra reacted on it and made a fool out of BJP,” he said in a public meeting at Solapur. Sharad Pawar was referring to the outcry witnessed among party workers when he was served the notice ahead of the Assembly polls in September. Party workers had gathered outside ED office in Mumbai in big numbers after Sharad Pawar announced that he will visit the agency office. He later cancelled the visit after Mumbai Police and then state government requested them to do so for law and order. The party won more seats in the Assembly polls and observers believe that the ED notice, too, had played a crucial role in its performance, especially in western Maharashtra, which is an NCP stronghold. Sharad Pawar deliberately referred to the incident on Friday and also made an appeal to the people to participate in the Maharashtra Bandh to call out against BJP’s rule in Uttar Pradesh in the backdrop of the killing of farmers during a protest last week. The party is believably set to resort to show of strength against the BJP and the Central government. Sharad Pawar has said he and his family were being targeted because he likened the killings in Lakhimpur Kheri to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.Referring to the IT officers as guests, Sharad Pawar said, “Guests have been visiting Ajit Pawar. We are never scared of guests.” He said the central government was misusing the agencies against political opponents. Ajit Pawar had to intervene and pacify the party workers protesting outside Central Hall in Pune on Friday and appealed people go home. He later said that he will react after the “guests” had completed their raids. “I do not want to disturb the guests. Let them complete their duty. I am not going to go anywhere. We did not get any notice before the raids. I follow all rules and comply with tax-related formalities. Once the action was completed, I will speak with evidence over the deals of the sugar factories and the people behind their sale,” he said. On Thursday, Ajit Pawar had asked why those related to BJP do not face any action. Sule termed the action against her sisters as an attack against women. She also said that those [BJP] who rule in the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj do not follow his principle of respecting women and act like the Mughals. “The action against my sisters is unfortunate. They are senior citizens and have nothing to do with politics. We are okay if the action was taken against us as we are public figures, but not on our sisters’ [properties] who have been living their lives peacefully. However, they know how to fight it out as they are from the soil of Jijau (Chhatrapati Shivaji’s mother Jijabai) and Savitribai Phule. Maharashtra will not bow before the Delhi throne,” she said. Political analyst Pratap Asbe said the Pawars will take appropriate political stand at the right time. “The Pawars are annoyed because of the attack on the family members who are not active in politics. They would not let it go easily and act at the appropriate time. It seems that the action by the central agencies has not gone down well among the general people as they also realise about the intention behind the raids. There could be the reaction same like in 2019 in the forthcoming elections,” he said. Party insiders said the leadership believes that the action by the central agencies will help them in the forthcoming local body elections, if utilised strategically. The party leaders have therefore invoked the names of Savitribai Phule and Rajmata Jijabai and termed it as an attack against women. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said holding his party responsible for the raids was a joke. “I-T officers have raided 25 residential premises and 15 offices and such a massive action cannot be carried out in preparation of a day or two. Stating that the raids are because of criticism over the UP incident is a joke. I-T is an independent central agency and works within the legal framework. The action should be replied to legally. It is wrong to relate the action with BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/it-raids-on-kin-of-ajit-pawar-pawar-clan-hints-at-aggressive-stand-against-bjp-101633715065199.html
08-10-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad HC stays DIoS order on appointment of college principal||The Allahabad high court has stayed the order of district inspector of schools (DIoS), Prayagraj, by which the DIoS had directed the committee of management of Shri Sachha Adhyatma Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, Naini, Prayagraj, to hand over the charge of “officiating principal” of the college to one Kripa Shankar Mishra.The court further stayed the order dated August 4, 2021, by which the DIoS had directed the manager of the committee of management of the college to produce all documents relating to suspension of Kripa Shankar Mishra and also the order dated August 6, 2021 by which suspension order of Mishra as “officiating principal” of the college was revoked.Mishra claims to be the senior most teacher at the said college and hence eligible for the appointment to the post of the principal of the college. Justice Saral Srivastava passed the order on a petition filed by Srikrishna Tripathi who was appointed the “officiating principal” of the college on June 30, 2021, after the superannuation of earlier principal Shradha Mishra.Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Tanisha Jahangir Monir argued, “Impugned orders are illegal and without jurisdiction since the ‘DIoS’ Prayagraj has no jurisdiction to revoke the suspension order. Suspension order has been passed by the committee of management in exercise of power conferred under Statute 17.4 & 17.5 of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University Statute and shall remain in force till it is set aside by the competent authority or by a court of law.”“There is no provision in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University Statute which confers power upon the ‘DIoS’ to revoke or cancel the suspension order passed by the committee of management,” Monir further argued.The court, while staying the orders on September 30, directed respondent authorities as well as Kripa Shankar Mishra to file their reply within four weeks and fixed November 29 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-hc-stays-dios-order-on-appointment-of-college-principal-101633714826312.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||Critically endangered turtle rescued from drain in Mumbai||Wildlife rescuers, along with the forest department, on Friday rescued a male freshwater turtle from a drainage channel in Mulund. It was about eight to 10 years old and has been identified as a Leith’s softshell turtle (Nilssonia leithii) – a critically endangered species of freshwater turtle that is endemic to peninsular India. Though they can weigh as much as a 100kg, the specimen rescued in a rare incident on Friday, clocked a weight of 13kg.“We were responding to a distress call by the Mulund fire station, which had been alerted to the presence of a large, stranded turtle in an open drain. We dispatched a rescue team which retrieved the reptile from the drain and took it to the forest department for examination,” said Pawan Sharma, founder of Resquink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), a volunteer organisation based in Mulund which supports the forest department in responding to such wildlife sightings.Dr Shailendra Singh, country programme director at Turtle Survival Alliance, who examined the turtle remotely over video from Lucknow, said it seemed healthy and without injury. “These turtles are extremely rare and are declared as critically endangered as per the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list. I have advised the forest department to release it in a confined pond or lake and monitor the area regularly to see if it is adapting,” he said.The species is also given the highest possible protection under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Even within its known ranges, the turtle is apparently rare, including inside protected areas, which is suspected to be due to a past history of exploitation for the illegal wildlife trade. The species has disappeared from much of its former range, mainly due to siltation and drying up of rivers during the summer, and is suspected to have started dwindling in number since the 1970s.This is the third time since 2015 that a Leith’s softshell turtle has been rescued from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). In May 2017, a two-and-a-half-year-old female Leith’s softshell turtle, weighing 85kg, was rescued by forest officials and a wildlife rescue team in Thane. In 2015, a turtle of the same species had been rescued from a creek in Navi Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/critically-endangered-turtle-rescued-from-drain-in-mumbai-101633714825142.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bypoll results show people have kept BJP on ground: Shiv Sena mouthpiece||Two day after the results of the zilla parishad (ZP) and panchayat samiti bypolls were announced, the Shiv Sena on Friday said that despite contesting separately at some places, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had managed to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at bay. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that the elections in five districts have clearly ascended MVA.The ZP and panchayat samiti bypolls in six districts results showed BJP had more seats among the four major parties, but lost seats to MVA. Though BJP emerged as the single-largest party in ZP bypolls with 22 seats, followed by Congress (19), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) (15) and Shiv Sena (12), collectively MVA allies have 46 ZPs under control.“MVA has definitely wrested control of more seats in ZP-panchayat samiti bypolls. But BJP could not win even after the constituents of MVA went solo in some places. This means people have kept BJP on the ground. Accepting that MVA has won this contest requires a big heart. Does the opposition party in the state have it?” the editorial stated on Friday.Mocking BJP leaders over their claim that their party has emerged at the top in the bypolls, the editorial asked which mathematician told them that their numbers were higher than the ruling coalitions. “There is no reason to be unhappy about BJP winning 22 (ZP) seats but what about the fact that the party has lost many seats in the bypolls,” the editorial said.It further added, “In the panchayat samiti elections, MVA got 73 of the 144 seats, while BJP got 33 seats. Now the ones who are claiming ascendence should tell us which mathematician or Aryabhatta said 33 is more than 73. In ZP, MVA got 46 seats, while BJP got 22. Anybody who knows to count will say MVA got more than double of 22.”The Sena mouthpiece also said that BJP emerged the single-largest party in the 2019 Assembly polls but had to play the role of the opposition. “BJP’s 105 MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly) were elected but BJP is now functioning as a strong opposition party. So anyone is free to do an analysis of ZP and panchayat samiti bypolls but the people will not accept the opposition party’s argument,” it remarked.As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of BJP does not comment on Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bypoll-results-show-people-have-kept-bjp-on-ground-shiv-sena-mouthpiece-101633714769491.html
08-10-2021||Lucknow||Blanket ban on crackers in Agra this Diwali||Agra This Diwali, there will be a blanket ban on use or sale of crackers in Agra. The district administration has clarified that no license would be issued and no shops allocated this year for sale of crackers. Additional district magistrate, Dr Prabha Kant Awasthi made it clear that there would be no use or sale of crackers in the light of orders issued by the National Green Tribunal and concern exhibited by the Supreme Court on the adverse impact on air quality. “All steps would be taken to ensure the restriction on sale or use of crackers is implemented. No shops would be allocated, nor any license granted for sale of crackers this year,” he said on Friday. Earlier, shops were allocated at more than two dozen places for sale of crackers and licenses were issued to shop owners ahead of Diwali. These licenses were issued for sale of crackers last year but had to be withdrawn in view of restriction imposed on crackers in Agra, the epicenter of Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) created around the Taj Mahal. The district administration had to refund the security deposit made by the shop keepers availing license. The ban on crackers, however, will have an impact on Diwali falling in the first week of November. This is the second consecutive year when there would be ban on crackers. However, last year there were violations despite the ban and crackers were burst here and there in the city. Notably, last year the National Green Tribunal had imposed ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during Covid-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/blanket-ban-on-crackers-in-agra-this-diwali-101633714584638.html

Leader of the Opposition and BEST committee member Ravi Raja on Friday said, “Losses have been more than ₹2,300 crore. For the past three years, from 2018 to 2021, ₹3,500 crore has been given by the municipal corporation to BEST. It is high time the administration has to think about ways to stand on its own feet. BEST has a lot of assets and needs to come up with ways in which it can utilise these assets to generate revenue and reduce its losses.”Presently 65% of BEST electricity consumers pay their bills online. BEST plans to promote this to 80% of online bill payments and will focus on the expansion of bill collection centres through bank branches and other digital payment methods, a statement from BEST said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/best-to-procure-2-100-electric-buses-set-up-55-electric-charging-stations-in-mumbai-101633714524648.html

08-10-2021||Mumbai||Can’t compel tender-age girl to have an unwanted child: Bombay HC||Compelling a tender age girl to have an unwanted child may lead to disastrous consequences for the rest of her life not only for her, but for her entire family, said the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday while allowing an 18-year-old unwed girl to get her unwanted pregnancy medically terminated.The division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar took into consideration the fact that the petitioner has just completed 18 years of age, who has last year appeared for HSC exam, and is unmarried and disregarded opinion of the Medical Board of the Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai.Pursuant earlier HC orders the specialized board had examined the girl and opined that there was no mental, obstetric or medical reasons warranting termination of the pregnancy.The board had said there was no abnormality detected in the foetus and the mother also did not have any medical or pregnancy related issues. It added that though the mother had moderate depressive episode, with treatment the continuation of the pregnancy was unlikely to adversely affect her mental health.HC disapproved the opinion and referring to one of its earlier decision, noted that the legislature has consciously used the term “mental health” - an expression of wider connotations in section 3(2) (b)(i) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, in contradistinction to the expressions “mental illness” or “mentally ill person.”The bench said, therefore, for determining whether continuance of pregnancy would involve risk of injury to mental health of the pregnant woman, her actual or reasonably foreseeable environment should be taken into account.The bench took into consideration the fact that the petitioner before it has one elder sister, one elder brother and one younger sister and her father is auto-rickshaw driver and mother sells vegetables near their house. “From the above, the socio-economic condition/ status of the petitioner is clearly discernible,” said the bench while allowing the girl to get her unwanted pregnancy medically terminated at the state-run hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cant-compel-tender-age-girl-to-have-an-unwanted-child-bombay-hc-101633714404421.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to provide ₹1.21 lakh to resident doctors||Thousands of resident doctors across the state had reason to cheer on Friday as the state government via a notification announced they would provide ₹1.21 lakhs for their contribution in the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the ongoing pandemic.“We have worked round the clock during the pandemic. It has also badly affected our post-graduation specialisation, as for the past 18 months we have been on Covid duty. So, we deserve this grant,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhoble, president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), Central.As per the government resolution (GR) passed on October 6, all resident doctors of government and municipal medical colleges, as well as government Ayurveda colleges, will be given ₹1.21 lakh each. This is a one-time incentive that will be given in halves, once in November and the other one in March 2022.Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice president of Central MARD welcomed the decision of the state government. “We are overwhelmed by the swift response of the state government and Directorate of Medical Education and Research. This is for the first time that a GR has been passed within two days of holding a meeting,” he said.MARD started a strike on October 2 but called it off on October 4 after holding a meeting with the state chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray. MARD had put forward three primary demands – waiver of academic fees during the pandemic year, non-deduction of the tax deducted at source (TDS) from the stipend and better upkeep of the hostels.While issuing a media statement on Monday, MARD said that fee waiver was not possible due to technical reasons. However, the state has decided to discuss this issue with experts from the field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-provide-1-21-lakh-to-resident-doctors-101633714284381.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||Approach NGT with challenge to 2019 CRZ notification, Bombay HC tells NGO||The Bombay high court (HC), while disposing of public interest litigation (PIL) wherein the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification had been challenged by Vanashakti, a non-government organisation (NGO) has permitted it to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with its grievances. The court further observed that as the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Mumbai was finalised, the tribunal should decide on the representation by the NGO expeditiously. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik which had heard the PIL and reserved its order on October 7 observed that as the tribunal had been granted wide powers to cover almost everything under the sun it would not be appropriate on its part to pass orders on the objections raised by the petitioner. “Regard being had to the wide contours of the tribunal’s powers to address all concerns pertaining to the environment, it would not be appropriate for us to entertain this writ petition on the specious ground that issues relating to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act may also incidentally arise for consideration of the tribunal,” noted the bench in its order adding “We are also minded to observe that no court ought to interfere in respect of matters over which the tribunal has jurisdiction, or else the very purpose for enactment of the NGT Act would stand defeated.” The NGO which was represented by senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond and advocates Zaman Ali and Akash Rebello had been informed that the notification issued under the Environment (Protection Act), 1986 issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) was challenged on the ground that some of its provisions were manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Dhond had argued that the notification also violated the right to live in a healthy environment, and consequently violated the right to life of citizens protected by Article 21. The NGO had also submitted that the notification contained provisions which were a reenactment of provisions earlier struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court or have been read down by the Supreme Court in earlier judgments. In light of these submissions, the NGO sought to declare that the notification was illegal and ultra vires Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution and to declare that the 2011 notification continued to be valid and binding. “The unconstitutionality of the regulations is extensive, wide-ranging, comprehensive and far-reaching. Rather than protecting and improving the quality of the environment or preventing and controlling environmental pollution, the notification instead removes various protections which were present in CRZ 2011,” stated the petition. However, advocate Parag Vyas for the central government opposed the plea and said that the notification was consistent with environmental laws and sought dismissal of the plea as it was not maintainable before the HC as the issues could be dealt with by the NGT. The court held that it could not entertain the plea and interfere in the 2019 decision. It noted, “Since the CZMP for Mumbai has been finalised, we grant petitioner to approach before the NGT. The NGT will expeditiously decide the plea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/approach-ngt-with-challenge-to-2019-crz-notification-bombay-hc-tells-ngo-101633714224540.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities confirmed on Friday that they have been mulling reopening the zoo, as the city is slowly opening up from its restrictions imposed in March 2021, post the second wave.The zoo was last opened in February 2021, after 11 months of being shut due to the pandemic, since March 2020. However, it had to be closed for the public almost immediately, as the Maharashtra government announced restrictions in the state, owing to the second Covid-19 wave.The two new members, who have been added to the penguin family of seven at the zoo, were born on May 1 and August 19. The older chick has been named Oreo and was born to the pair Donald and Daisy. The younger chick was born to the pair Flipper and Mr Molt and is yet to be named.Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo said, “The baby is still waning off its parents, and is always in the nest. It rarely comes out. Once we can identify the sex of the baby penguin, we will be able to name the chick.”The other prime attraction is the walkthrough aviary. Dr Tripathi said, “This is an amazing experience, and now it is all complete. It will be open to visitors when the zoo reopens.” Other animals such as fox, hyena, bear, leopard and pond turtle will also be up for public viewing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-two-new-members-in-penguin-family-mumbai-s-byculla-zoo-likely-to-reopen-next-month-101633713984383.html

Once fully functional, the airport would see operations of both domestic and international flights, boosting tourism as well as pilgrimage from the Budhdhist countries as huge number followers of Lord Buddha visit this historical place, known for Buddh’s Parinirvana (the place where Buddha breathed his last). Kushinagar airport would see arrival of its maiden flight from Sri Lanka, carrying a 125-member delegation, including Sri Lankan president, Buddhist monks and followers, the administration said. The PM would also lay the foundation stone of a medical college at Kushinagar in presences of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who would reportedly visit Kushinagar to take stock of the preparations on October 12 or 13. The PM’s visit assumes significance as polls are due early next year in Uttar Pradesh, it added. On Friday, officials of Airport Authority of India (AAI), took stock of the ongoing preparations and inspected the airport infrastructure, including runway, terminal and control rooms. According to officials, operations of flights can start soon, but the AAI is facing problem in acquisition of land required for setting up an instrumental landing system (an aviation technology which will enable planes to fly smoothly in case of poor visibility caused by fog or rainy weather). However, they hoped that the issue would be resolved soon as talks were underway with the district administration on it.

The officials said the woman had been murdered somewhere else and later her body was dumped on the roadside with intent to conceal the crime. They said no injury marks was, however, discovered during the primary examination on the body and it had been sent for post-mortem examination to ascertain the actual cause of the death. Lucknow additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), East, Qasim Abidi said that the local residents of the colony discovered the body as the woman’s hand was visible out of the bedsheet used to tie it. He said that the locals informed the police about the incident at around 7am. Another police official privy to the investigation said that the identity of the deceased was ascertained as Mithilesh Srivastava after several hours of search in the near-by areas. “The woman often used to stay at ‘Rain Basera’ setup at Lohia hospital and used to earn money by selling pan masala outside the hospital. Her nephew stays in the same colony where her body has been found,” he said. He said the police had taken the nephew into custody and questioning him. The ADCP said that four teams had been formed to scan the footages of CCTVs installed on routes leading to the colony and further investigation was on.

A senior official, aware of the ongoing investigation, said that Balbeer Giri was questioned about the incident at the Bhaganbari Gaddi Math for an hour during which he was also asked about Anand Giri, one of the three accused, of abetting Narendra Giri for suicide, and allegations that he was harassing Narendra Giri since being sidelined by him last year. The CBI officials also tried to get information regarding land deals and other financial transactions that could have a role in the seer’s death. The three-member CBI team questioned two of the Sewadars Babloo and Sumit, who were among the first to reach the site where Narendra Giri’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan on September 20. This was the third time when the sewadars have been questioned regarding the incident by the CBI officials. “The team visited the Bade Hanuman temple located at the banks of Sangam that was being headed by Mahant Narendra Giri till the time of his death. CBI team questioned the workers and the priests there regarding Anand Giri, second accused and a priest at the temple, Aadya Tiwari as well as Aadya’s son Sandeep,” the official added. The CBI is believed to be carrying out psychological autopsy of the incident which is considered one of the most valuable tools of research on suicides. The method involves collecting all available information on the deceased via structured interviews of family members, other relatives, friends and colleagues to reach to the bottom of the circumstances that could have led to a death. As part of it, CBI officials are also trying to piece together the scenario by informal interactions with individuals who had regular access to the Math premises and directly or indirectly were aware of the daily goings on in the Math campus. Though CBI sleuths right from the beginning have maintained their distance from media persons, suicide angle is still believed to be emerging as the reason for death of Narendra Giri despite insistence of Anand Giri of foul play in his Guru’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akhada-parishad-former-chief-s-death-cbi-questions-balbeer-giri-math-sewadars-as-part-of-its-probe-101633710208413.html
08-10-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka picks up broom again at Valmiki temple, says it’s a message to Yogi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday responded to a barb thrown at her by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath over sweeping the floor at a makeshift detention centre in Sitapur where she lodged earlier this week, heading to a Dalit-dominated area of Lucknow and sweeping the floor at the locality’s Valmiki temple.“Yogi Adityanath’s comments are anti-Dalit. No work is menial. Sweeping and mopping the floor is not a small job. Millions of women and Dalits do so every day,” said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a statement issued by the Congress leaders, quoting her on social media after her visit to Lucknow’s Luv Kush Nagar.Priyanka Gandhi also said she went to clean the floor to tell the chief minister that this was the work of self-respect and symbolised simplicity, adding that he should change his mindset.Her dart, aimed at Yogi Adityanath, was triggered by his swipe at her during his interview to a news channel.“Janata unko usi layak banana chahti hai aur janata ne unko usi layak bana diya hai (People want to make her fit for such work and they have made her fit to do so). These people (opposition) do not have anything to do except creating a nuisance and spreading negativity,” Yogi Adityanath said.Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker and UP vice-president Vijay Pathak brushed aside her reaction as a stunt to try reviving the Congress. “The Congress should also work to sort out problems of Dalits instead of doing stunts. The BJP government is doing a lot of good work and she should also look at that too and give suggestions for what more can be done. We are members of the BJP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi invites suggestions from all sections in his Maan Ki Baat. So Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should show some positivity.”Senior Congress leader PL Punia said Priyanka Gandhi’s cleaning the temple premises was her reply to chief minister Yogi Adityanath comment that appeared to consider sweeping the floor a menial job. Congress workers raised slogans outside in her favour as Priyanka cleaned the temple inside.“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s comments can’t be appreciated. But did Priyanka Gandhi Vadra ever visit a Valmiki temple or a Dalit’s house earlier to sweep the floor? No one has seen Priyanka doing so in the past five years. Her action at this point of time, when assembly elections are closer, speaks of her political motives of wooing the Dalits and get their votes,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department of political science, Lucknow University.BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan: “The Congress has no concern for the Dalits. They (Congress leaders) come to the state as political tourists. The BJP has undertaken a lot of measures for the welfare of Dalits. The BJP government has got a record number of toilets constructed. The Congress has done nothing for the welfare of Dalits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-picks-up-broom-again-after-barb-from-yogi-cleans-valmiki-temple-101633710085209.html

The facility has been introduced to boost patient footfall under the government’s AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) programme, said the officials quoted above. The Ayurveda department, which was introduced at AIIMS-Patna in 2016, has seen fewer patients as compared to the homeopathy department, established on October 31, 2015. The homeopathy department already provides free medicines to its patients. As many as 135 Ayurveda medicines, including ‘churna’ (plant-based powder extract), ‘vati’ (tablet), ‘ashav’ and ‘arisht’ (different forms of syrup), ‘bhasma’ (metal-based powder extract of gold, copper, etc. after burning them over fire), ‘avleha’ (formulations in form of paste), ointment and oil, are now available for patients at the institute’s formulary, said Dr Ajeet Kumar, medical officer, Ayurveda, AIIMS-Patna. “The medicines available cater to ailments related to joint pain, digestion-related disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, hyperacidity and constipation; skin diseases, including eczema; and post-Covid-19 complications suc as persistent cough and weakness,” said Dr Kumar. “As of now, we have the approval to purchase Ayurveda medicines up to ₹2.50 lakh per month, at an average 10 patients per day. Later, we plan to buy some expensive ‘bhasma’ for chronic kidney related disorders, after assessing the requirement of patients,” he added. There are three sanctioned posts of medical officers at the Ayurveda department, of which two have been filled up on a regular basis in February this year. Officials said that around 260 patients have benefitted from Ayurveda from the day of its functioning on February 15 this year, after regular appointments of medical officers. Homeopathy has received a comparatively better response, said Dr D Balachandran, senior medical officer, homeopathy, and head of the AYUSH department at AIIMS-Patna. “As many as 15,320 people have benefitted from homeopathy at our institute ever since its OPD services commenced in 2015. Of them, 2,076 availed our homeopathy facilities this year,” said Dr Balachandran. The homeopathy pharmacy has 206 medicines of varying potencies. Meanwhile, Dr Hemali Heidi Sinha, dean (examination) and professor and head of obstetrics and gynaecology at AIIMS-Patna, expressed her desire to commence an orientation program for MBBS students regarding role of Ayurveda in healthcare and also to work in tandem with modern medicine to treat patients with chronic illness, where the scope of modern medicine was limited. The AIIMS-Patna has 71 departments, including 31-odd functional clinical departments and those under AYUSH on one campus, which makes it a composite multi-speciality health hub in the state. Earlier, AIIMS-Patna director, Dr PK Singh, inaugurated the free-drug facility at the AYUSH building of the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/free-ayurveda-medicines-for-patients-at-aiimspatna-101633708043670.html

08-10-2021||Patna||Tej Pratap, Misa missing from RJD’s star campaigners’ list for bypolls, Tejashwi second only to Lalu||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son and MLA Tej Pratap Yadav and elder daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti have not found place in the party’s start campaigners’ list for bypolls to the two assembly seats in Bihar due on October 30. The list, which was submitted to Election Commission of India ( ECI) on Thursday by party’s national principal general secretary Abdul Bari Siddiqui, has Lalu Prasad’s name at the top, followed by his younger son and leader of the opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, and Siddiqui in the third place. There are in all 20 names in the list, including of former minister Jay Prakash Yadav and former MLA Bhola Yadav and other state leaders. Former chief minister Rabri Devi doesn’t figure in the list. In the past, Tej Pratap, state’s former health minister, has often voiced his frustration against several party leaders. Two days back, RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tiwary raised eyebrows when he publically said Tej Pratap was “not in the party as he had formed his own outfit”. Tej Pratap had recently formed a student outfit, called Chhatra Janshakhti Parishad. He had also alleged recently that the RJD chief was being kept “hostage” in New Delhi by some leaders in the party. Prasad, who suffers from multiple ailments, has been recuperating at Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi after being granted bail in fodder scam cases in April this year.RJD’s state unit president Jagdanand Singh, who has been at the receiving end of Tej Pratap’s outbursts many a time, said the latter’s omission did not have anything to do with him. “We have picked leaders for the campaigning who have been regularly working in these two constituencies and have a connect with the electorate. Is my name there in the list?” he asked. “The list has been approved by the RJD chief,” Siddiqui said on phone from New Delhi. BJP’s state spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the omission of Tej Pratap and Misa Bharti indicated that the elder son has been “ousted” from the party and the daughter would not get a fresh Rajya Sabha nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tej-pratap-misa-missing-from-rjd-s-star-campaigners-list-for-bypolls-tejashwi-second-only-to-lalu-101633707983912.html
08-10-2021||Patna||After 4-year absence, Lalu set to visit Bihar||Former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad, who has been away from the state for almost four years, mostly in jail in Jharkhand before being shifted to New Delhi for treatment, is set to visit the state to campaign for his party Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for bypolls in two assembly seats of Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, to be held on October 30, party officials said.Bhola Yadav, a former MLA and close aide of the RJD chief, said Prasad would address a few election meetings in both the constituencies on October 25-26 and return to New Delhi, if his health allows. “Tentatively, Prasad would join electioneering for Arun Kumar Sah and Ganesh Bharti, in the fray from Tarapur in Munger district and Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga district, on different dates through helicopter,” he said. Prasad, who was serving jail terms following his conviction in fodder scam cases since December 2017, has been away from political activity, including from the 2019 parliamentary polls and Bihar assembly elections in 2020, barring a few posts on the social media. He was granted bail in April this year and has since been recuperating at his daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi. Both the seats bound for bypolls were won in 2020 by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), which is in the fray there again. In the past, Kumar has sought to play down the impact of Prasad’s return to active politics, saying he was working from jail anyways.The Congress, which had contested from Kusheshwar Asthan in 2020 as part of the RJD-led alliance but lost by over 7,000 votes, has fielded candidates for both seats this time after a fallout with the ally. The party, too, sought to make light of the possible campaigning by Lalu Prasad. “In 2010, RJD broke ties with Congress and teamed up with Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP and contested the assembly elections when Lalu Prasad was free. And the result was disappointing for RJD,” said Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra. Party insiders said Prasad would stay at 10 Circular Road, the official residence of former CM and his wife Rabri Devi, under constant supervision of doctors and stay away from the crowd to avoid any health hazard. “A separate enclosure equipped with all emergency medical facilities annexed to the former CM’s bungalow is still not ready. He will come to Patna once the doctors declare him fit to go out of Delhi,” said Bhola Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/after-4-year-absence-lalu-set-to-visit-bihar-101633707926189.html

He reiterated that his son Ashish Mishra was “innocent”.The Union minister also said that his son skipped the police summons because of “ill health” and was at his residence in Lakhimpur Kheri.Ajay Mishra Teni said this to newspersons at the Chaudhary Charan Singh airport in Lucknow on his return from New Delhi.The Lakhimpur police had pasted a notice at the Union minister’s house in Lakhimpur on Thursday afternoon, asking his son to report at the Crime Branch office in Lakhimpur by 10am on Friday. When the son failed to show up on Friday, the police pasted another summon, asking him to record his statement by 11am on Saturday.Deputy inspector general (Headquarters) Upendra Agarwal, who is heading the team probing the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, waited for him at the crime branch office on Friday morning but Ashish did not show up.At the Lucknow airport, the MoS, whose son faces a murder case in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence of October 3, said: “We have full faith in the law. My son is innocent. He will appear before the police tomorrow and give his statement and evidence as he is innocent.”He further said: “Our government is investigating the matter impartially, and we will take action against the culprits.”On the opposition’s demand for his resignation and speculation of Ashish having fled to the neighbouring Nepal, the minister said: “Opposition demands anything. My son is very much at his residence in Lakhimpur Kheri.”The minister reiterated: “My son would have been killed had he been present at the spot (of the incident). Any other party’s government wouldn’t have registered an FIR”.Before leaving for Bahraich to meet the grieving families there, Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav said in Lucknow: “First of all the MoS must resign immediately...any police person if he goes to MoS for investigation, he will first have to salute the MoS...what kind of probe will the police person do. So minister must resign...pasting summon is just a formality, it’s like going with a flower bouquet to them (minister and his son).”When asked about speculation of Ashish Mishra having escaped to Nepal, Akhilesh Yadav said: “And if it is true that MoS’s son has escaped to Nepal, then it is out of the UP government’s hand and it won’t be able to do anything...and thus the Government of India should step in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-ajay-mishra-teni-says-his-son-will-report-to-police-on-saturday-101633707925042.html

The Dharmakot DSP’s suspension has been recommended due to his alleged negligence and connivance in illegal mining activities,” said SSP Dhruman H Nimbale, while refusing to share any details.Earlier, in two back-to-back notices issued to the DSP, the SSP had questioned his alleged negligence and inaction due to which illegal mining was rampant in the Sutlej riverbed and other areas despite a statewide ban from July 1 to September 30 this year. Following a probe marked by the SSP, at least a dozen cases of illegal mining had been registered and multiple arrests were made along with seizure of a number of vehicles.

08-10-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: New platforms for creativity and commerce||Going by the burst of creativity and craft that is being witnessed during the staging of the ongoing FDCI X Lakme Fashion Week, it would not be wrong to say that the fashion industry seems to have taken a leaf out of nature itself and emerged from the long winter of its pandemic-induced hibernation with its most vibrant offerings in a long while. And what a delight it is proving for the eye and the soul, after these many months of drabness and absence, to see the breathtaking creations of industry leaders like Tarun Tahiliani, Anamika Khanna and JJ Vallaya: palettes and styling that evoke our rich heritage and history; heirloom embroideries and bead work which show case India’s best talents; a multiplicity of interpretations on traditions and themes; lehengas fit for princesses; jewel’s fit for kings, and the heralding of renewal and regeneration as gorgeous models swan up and down showcasing the outfits with confidence and elan, reminding us of how things used to be in pre-pandemic times, before the world was sent up to its room, without dinner, by the virus. Truly Indian fashion at its best along with Bollywood and cricket is one of the country’s most significant soft powers. Predicated on the extraordinary textile legacy of India, our designers are creating works of unimaginable beauty and excellence. And while doing so, are giving a much-needed fillip to the country’s karigars and craftsmen. Because let’s face it, more than just the fickle fancy of a handful of men and women deciding what’s in one season and out the other, or the whims of rich ladies who shop, the fashion industry spawns jobs and careers, nurtures talent and creativity and communicate the confidence of a young Republic that is very cognisant of its heritage and place in the world. For this they ought to be afforded respect and regard and encouragement and support. *** *************************************************************************************************************************This year, bowing to the protocols of the pandemic, the people behind FDCI X Lakme Fashion Week have decided to host a ‘phygital (physical plus digital)’ edition of the show, which means that both online as well and offline presentations are on display. And according to many, this appears to be one more instance where the pandemic has proven to have had a beneficial effect on things. Eliminating the last-minute adrenalin rush and the crush of the hoi polio as they rubber neck to catch a glimpse of their favourite Bollywood stars on the ramp and in the audience, true lovers of fashion can now get a more appreciative feel for the actual work that goes in to the creation of the outfits, presented by the designers, most of which have taken months to create. Because let’s face it, unlike the serious platform it was meant to be, to showcase the industry’s best and brightest, in recent years the fashion show had become nothing more than a tamasha, a social circus, where everything but the clothes on show were being noticed and commented on. Now, with their well thought out digital offerings showcasing their latest lines, the designer and his work have been placed once again, centre stage and their creativity seems to have found a resurgence. Both Tahiliani and Vallaya’s digital presentations of their works (available for all to see, on YouTube, without the bother of craning necks and bruised egos in a stuffy dark hall) demonstrated the deep thought and refined sensibility that had gone in to the creation of their films. Rather than have their outfits flashing on and off the ramp in a few seconds, their digital films this year have afforded designers one more platform to present their vision, replete with story lines, set design and direction. This marks the advent of the designer as an auteur – someone who not only creates outfits but an entire lifescape of their sensibility. Besides, the scope A digital presentation affords the designers, of course there is the convenience for their audience – of viewing fashion in the comfort of one’s own home, and at one ‘s own leisure. A welcome relief for those like me who had tired of the rush, the crush, the long delays and the endless silliness of what Fashion Week had degenerated in to in recent years. Because viewing the digital interpretations of their works while removed from the circus that used to surround them in earlier years, one can truly appreciate the creativity and commitment to excellence that inspired them. Of course, a few offline shows were hosted this year, but mercifully they were small, intimate and many of them we notice avoided the mandatory Bollywood star show stopper that had contributed to what is in our opinion fashion’s declining trajectory. After all, when you have clothes that cost a king’s ransom, surely, they ought to be perfectly capable of holding their own in the spotlight without the support of some Bollywood tinsel. Hopefully, this is a trend that continues and the yoke that fastened fashion to Bollywood (Follywood?) will further unravel in the coming months. *** This year’s fashion week also saw the advent of another brave new direction for the industry: the introduction of fashion NFTs by designers and artisans. The initiated will know that (NFTs) non-fungible tokens or digital assets are the result of blockchain technology and the latest craze in the international marketplace; now the digital versions of garments and accessories on sale will open up a new platform for commerce and creativity for the industry. Fittingly, leading designer Manish Malhotra has launched the initiative by creating five exclusive NFTs which will be available during the week to collectors. “I hope my participation encourages more designers and artisans to explore and take advantage of this new opportunity,” Malhotra one of the senior-most in his trade, is reported to have said. Which brings us to the end of our comment on the season’s ongoing premier fashion event. All in all, we notice many welcome changes: an online presence that appears to have resulted in a burst of inspiration and craft. New platforms for creativity and commerce. And the option to stay at home and savour the beauty of fashion for stay at homes like me. Nice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-new-platforms-for-creativity-and-commerce-101633703423540.html

The PMC’s vehicle department proposes to hire 38 e-cars for eight years. The proposal has been tabled before the standing committee. The corporation claims this will be a saving of ₹1.77 lakh per year. The total cost of the plan is estimated at ₹23 crore, i.e. rent for 38 EVs for eight years, including maintenance and a diver for each vehicle.Hitendre Kurne, superintendent, PMC Vehicle department said, “The company will set up one charging station for every five EVs. The corporation will pay the electricity charges to the company.”Ashish Mane, a civic activist said, “Corporation has compared the rent of a non-AC jeep ( ₹63,000) per month to an e-car ( ₹58,000 per month), and claims to save ₹4,655 per car, per month. Actually, PMC saves only ₹2,105 per EV per month. Besides that, PMC will pay electricity bills. So, we are demanding that instead of taking an EV on rent, PMC should buy the e-cars. State has already announced a concession of around ₹1.50 lakh to promote purchasing EVs in the state. This will save taxpayers’ money.”Kurne responded, “As per state government order, there is a cap of ₹8 lakh to purchase any vehicle for office bearers and the cost of a single EV is at least ₹15 lakh. Therefore, we cannot purchase a car.”Vivek Velankar, civic activist said, “At present, corporations cannot purchase vehicles that cost more than ₹8 lakh. If the government is promoting EVs, there should be clear cut guidelines about purchasing EVs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/purchase-evs-instead-of-renting-to-save-money-activists-tell-pmc-101633703363388.html

The testing done at the station, which was around 1,500-1,700 per day, has reduced to around 200 per day.“Even though the cases are less, there is a need to have more random testing as the festive season is going on and people are moving out in large numbers. More testing will ensure the tracing of more cases on time. The civic body should do the testing by reaching out to areas if the response at the centres is less,” said Akash Mehta, 37, a resident of Beturkarpada, Kalyan (W).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/75-to-80-of-covid-cases-in-kalyan-dombivli-asymptomatic-kdmc-data-101633702888702.html

Don't we have the right to air our views in democracy?,” Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The income tax department’s teams conducted raids on businesses linked to the family members of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.

Premises linked to DB Realty, Shivalik, Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK) and businesses linked to Ajit Pawar's sisters were raided, news agency PTI reported.Pawar earlier this week drew a parallel between the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, where eight people died, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.Pawar accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of troubling the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress coalition government. “The state government is not being given its rightful share in the central funds,” Pawar said.Pawar said that the BJP must be removed from the path of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition. “In the recent by-polls of local bodies, the MVA allies, which contested separately, won 70 per cent of the seats. There is no doubt in my mind that if we fight together we will get better results. We have to now figure out how to contest the future elections,” Pawar said.The veteran leader accused the BJP of being ‘anti-farmer’ and said it is indulging in ‘misuse of power.’ Pawar also lent support to the Maharashtra Bandh call given by the MVA government on October 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pawar-says-it-raids-conducted-because-he-raised-his-voice-for-lakhimpur-victims-101633701971170.html

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||She brought an idea from Korea and turned it into reality in Kashmir||A trip to a strawberry field in South Korea and encouragement from her husband motivated Insha Rasool, who is in her mid 30s, to set up organic farms in Kashmir.Insha and her husband, both scientists, were working in South Korea when a school trip with their children sparked the idea of pursuing organic farming back home. A thought, clubbed with dedication and support from her family members, is now a reality. “On seeing vast magnificent fields in South Korea, I asked my husband why can’t anybody establish similar beautiful farms in Kashmir. And my husband said why not me... This is how my journey began in organic farming in 2018,” says Insha, who now spends most of her time on her farms, guiding her workers on the organic and exotic vegetables. When she isn’t busy with farming, she is engaged on social media selling or marketing her produce, including varieties of vegetables and sweetcorn, which are in great demand here. “Being a scientist, I studied a lot about organic farming and then took up this initiative. We had a chunk of ancestral land in Budgam. With the encouragement from my parents, my journey in this field has been rewarding, though I have a long way to go,” she says. Insha, who left a lucrative job in South Korea to chase her dreams, adds, “Though we are still doing this on an experimental basis as it needs a lot of research, my venture has been a successful one so far.”Through ‘Home Greens’, she markets the produce grown on her farms in Budgam and Pulwama. “I have tied up with several cultivators, who grow organic vegetables and sell them. My products have a tremendous demand. Before the harvest, most of my products are sold,” says Insha, who studied at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.She says that organic farming wasn’t easy, especially in Kashmir. “I took this as a challenge, but the feedback and clientele that I have managed to win through my products are appreciable,” she adds. Insha has been guiding people how to grow organic vegetables in their farms or kitchen gardens and her portal attracts a lot of queries from people. “If all goes well, I would build a school where we will teach how to grow organic products, especially vegetables. It is necessary to consume good products that are free of chemicals and pesticides,” she says. For Insha, organic farming had its own challenges. “We need specialised seeds that have to be arranged from the United States and at times, delay in their arrival causes problems. Besides, organic pesticides need to be bought in bulk that requires huge investment and at times, that too is a problem,” she shares. Despite her hard work, Insha feels a lot needs to be done in the field. “We are still experimenting. We want to do a lot more in the coming years and tie up with people to turn organic farming into a movement and lucrative venture,” she adds. To make her products affordable, Insha has kept their prices well within check. “With each passing day, our demand is growing, so are the profits,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/she-brought-an-idea-from-korea-and-turned-it-into-reality-kashmir-101633701383277.html

The salary for the month of August was paid by the contractor company on Friday.Earlier on Wednesday, 100 contract drivers stopped working to demand their dues. The drivers have been employed by the MPG group that then contracted them to the PMPML. On Friday, drivers at 9.30am gathered in Aundh for the protest.. “I am working with the contractor company for more than one year and for the last two months we have not got salaries. I want to pay the school fees of my children, and we are struggling to survive. I have already taken a loan of ₹70,000 from one of my relatives and now the festival season is coming, so we will need money,” said a driver on condition of anonymity. Most of these drivers work the PMML long routes, which go across Pune district. “The protest is for the rights of these drivers and PMPML is responsible. It should immediately clear the pending dues as it is affecting hundreds of families. We will continue our fight till the salaries are given away to the drivers,” said advocate Amrapalee Sandeep Dhiwar, legal representative of the drivers. Ganesh Sumbhe, vice-president of MPG said, “For the last eight months we have been paying salaries of drivers on our own. We have not received payment from the PMPML yet. Due to the Covid pandemic we are struggling financially and have repeatedly sent demand letters to PMPML to clear our dues immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-contract-drivers-stage-rasta-roko-over-unpaid-salaries-101633700487133.html

Any major work of development after the merger with the PMC is yet to start, claims residents. “For the last year-and-a-half, traffic signals are not working on most roads. Pothole-ridden roads continue to torture residents. Since July, we have complained about the roads,” said Harcharanjeet Butalia, director, Wagholi Housing Societies Association. Wagholi is densely populated and the most urbanised of 23 village areas merged within the PMC limits. Keshnand chowk, Wagheswar chowk, Lohegaon chowk, and Wagholi market square – suffer traffic jams every day. “The traffic signals will start soon in Wagholi. We are coordinating with PMC for completion of the remaining work. Once roads are completed, speed breakers will also be created to control rash drivers,” said Jaywant Patil, assistant sub-inspector, Lonikand traffic division. “The work of road completion is going on and most of the road will be completed in a couple of months,” said an official from the PMC’s road department on request of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nonfunctional-traffic-signals-incomplete-roads-work-irk-wagholi-residents-101633698982759.html
08-10-2021||Pune||44 species of butterflies spotted on Pune’s Fergusson College campus||PUNE As part of the Big Butterfly Month 2021 activity, at least 44 species of butterflies were spotted by the students of Fergusson College, department of environmental sciences on and around the campus. These species include Grass Jewel, India’s smallest butterfly; Blue Mormon, the state butterfly of Maharashtra; Plain Puffin, a rare sighting in Pune, among others.The Big Butterfly Month 2021 involves the participation of several educational institutes and organisations as they come together to celebrate the bio blitz. As a part of this, Fergusson College took part and organised an open event named “Let’s count butterflies” in association with the Pune Butterflies WhatsApp group. The event was held from September 4 till September 30, 2021, and its findings were released by the college on Friday.“Butterfly is a symbol of freedom and aesthetic pleasure. To celebrate their importance in the ecosystem, Big Butterfly Month is celebrated across the country. During this month, we observe, document and learn about butterflies,” said Rajat Joshi, a student and coordinator of the event for the department of environmental sciences.Principal Dr Ravindrasinh Pardeshi and head of department environmental sciences, Rupali Gaikwad supported the event.“The event focused on documenting different butterfly species present on the campus of Fergusson College, the hill in the campus was also monitored. During the event, butterflies were observed, photographed and documented on well-defined paths in the college campus between 8:30 am to 11 am. Butterflies were monitored on sunny days except for a few cloudy ones when maximum species were found,” added Rajat.According to the report, the group found species like Lemon Emigrants, Common Grass Yellows were seen in abundance due to the presence of their host plant; Senna tora situated near the foothills of Fergusson hill. Other than that, due to the mass plantations of palm varieties on the college campus, a great number of palm flies were spotted on them. Even a few of their life cycles were also witnessed by the participants. A small section close to the department of botany has plants of Bryophyllum, on which the Red Pierrot Butterflies were also seen in good numbers.Lantana camara remained the most favourite nectar plant of butterfly species in the college premises. Lantana has widespread in the area and was favoured by most of the butterfly species which were observed during the survey. The survey even had a rare sighting of the Plain Puffin Butterfly which is a forest species but turned out in substantial numbers fluttering on the nectarine sources like Lantana in the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/44-species-of-butterflies-spotted-on-pune-s-fergusson-college-campus-101633698022690.html
08-10-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan minister Raghu Sharma appointed Congress in-charge for Gujarat||In a surprising political development, the AICC appointed Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma as the in-charge of Gujarat, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli late on Thursday. The development comes about two weeks after Sharma had a one-to-one meeting with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence on September 24. The same day, Sachin Pilot too had met Gandhi. The appointment of Sharma, who is known to be close to Gehlot, has come as a surprise for a majority of people in the party, especially when Gujarat will be going for assembly polls next year in December 2022. It will be the second time that a leader from Rajasthan will be leading the party in Gujarat elections; earlier it was CM Ashok Gehlot, who had brought the party close to victory in the 2017 assembly elections. BJP has remained undefeated in Gujarat since 1995. The majority in the party believe that the appointment has come as an elevation for Sharma and it will bring him close to the leadership, but there is a section, which thinks that the move is to give him a safe exit, following resentment among MLAs. A minister in the Gehlot government said, “Raghu Sharma’s stars seem to be moving in the right direction as this appointment will add to his career. Gujarat is Modi and Amit Shah’s state, and is important for Congress. Earlier, there was speculation that the state would be given to Pilot, looking to his stature but now that it has been given to Sharma, he too has been elevated to the same level.” Besides, it was reported that MLAs also harboured resentment against Sharma and the same was conveyed during a feedback meeting chaired by AICC general secretary Ajay Maken. A senior MLA close to Sachin Pilot on condition of anonymity claimed that Sharma’s exit comes following displeasure of the high command after resentment against him but by this appointment he has been given a respectable exit. He added that it will also help Gehlot while doing a cabinet reshuffle. Besides few more could be used by the leadership at the central level. He believed that all rumours of Pilot leaving the state are baseless as he soon would be getting a big responsibility in Rajasthan. Political analyst Manish Godha said his appointment seems like an elevation, especially when the responsibility i handed over deals with states such as Gujarat, which was earlier handled by Gehlot. For Congress, Gujarat is a key and politically important state, especially when the party fared well in the 2017 assembly elections and came close to victory because of Gehlot. He continued how Sharma might face an exit from the Gehlot cabinet as Gujarat needs full attention. “This new responsibility would bring Sharma closer to the high command as it did for Gehlot, who was appointed general secretary headquarters after Gujarat. But simultaneously, he would be under pressure to perform and bring the party back into the race,” said Godha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-minister-raghu-sharma-appointed-congress-in-charge-for-gujarat-101633694542324.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||2 additional lanes of Kopri Bridge connecting Mumbai and Thane ready for inauguration||The first phase of Kopri Rail Over Bridge (ROB) has been completed. The two additional lanes are ready to be inaugurated.Despite the assurance to open the bridge by August this year, the last-minute beautification work is still going on. The Kopri Bridge is a vital link between Thane and Mumbai along the Eastern Express Highway and the two additional lanes will help ease out the traffic in the city. However, commuters continue to face traffic snarls as the inauguration of these lanes is delayed.The work on widening the bridge constructed in 1965 has been delayed multiple times. For the last several years, many agencies including the PWD and MSRDC have been assigned the work. Now, MMRDA has taken over.“It is ready to be reopened. We only have certain beautification and lighting work going on. All the approvals are also in place. It will be opened shortly” said SVR Srinivas, commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA). Meanwhile, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) is awaiting a go ahead from the MMRDA authorities. “The bridge falls under MMRDA and we cannot take a call about its inauguration,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.The girders of the bridge were laid down in January after which only the approach road was pending. However, in July, various political parties conducted inspection of these areas and noted that they were ready to be inaugurated. It was announced that within a month it would be opened for vehicles but commuters are still awaiting the launch.The widening of Kopri Bridge was first proposed 13 years ago when the cost of widening was ₹9Cr. The delay in implementing the plan has escalated the cost to ₹258.76Cr.The work will be undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, two new lanes were constructed on one side of the bridge. During the work, vehicular movement continued from the existing two-lane bridge. In the second phase, the newly-constructed two lanes will be open for traffic and the MMRDA will demolish the existing two-lane bridge and construct a new one. The second phase is expected to be completed in nine months.Thane city has been facing traffic snarls regularly with relaxations being implemented in the State post pandemic. The launch of the bridge will be a boon to commuters and can avoid the daily peak-hour rush.The Kopri Bridge is on the Eastern Express Highway. The eight-lane Eastern Express Highway turns into two lanes on this bridge, leading to a bottle neck during peak hours. Widening the bridge would resolve the peak-hour congestion, giving relief to people going towards Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. This bridge will be a relief for motorists travelling from Mumbai towards Thane, Nashik, Gujarat and Pune. There are around 1.22 lakh vehicles using the Kopri Bridge every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-additional-lanes-of-kopri-bridge-connecting-mumbai-and-thane-ready-for-inauguration-101633693828205.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||NMMC to develop waste composting unit in each slum in Navi Mumbai||Under its ‘zero slum waste’ programme, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has decided to develop waste composting units at all slums in its jurisdiction. The waste collected from a particular slum will be composted there itself. Thus, no waste from the slums will go to their landfill area and the civic body will not have to incur expenses for the transportation.There are 41 slums in the NMMC jurisdiction from Digha to CBD Belapur, an official said. According to its plans, the civic body will develop one or multiple composting units at each slum depending on its area and population.Babasaheb Rajale, deputy municipal commissioner of NMMC (solid waste management), said, “We have decided to outsource the task of collecting waste at the slums to outside agencies and our officials will oversee their work. With this system in place, we will be able to keep the slums neat and clean like the nodal areas of the city, and that will help us a lot in the upcoming Swachh Survekshan survey.“Likewise, for keeping the city roads clean, we have started another programme – ‘adopt a road’. Under this programme, any individual, housing society, NGO or private institute can take the responsibility of one road in their area.”This apart, NMMC is now focussing on the overall cleanliness of the city and proper waste segregation as they prepare themselves for the next Swachh Survekshan survey. From November, it will start a massive beautification drive to give the city a fresh look.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmmc-to-develop-waste-composting-unit-in-each-slum-in-navi-mumbai-101633692254928.html
08-10-2021||Bangalore||Services of Bengaluru Metro to be curtailed tomorrow. Check details here||The operations of Bengaluru Metro will be curtailed on Saturday due to structural maintenance work on the Purple Line. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) will be taking up the maintenance activity on Saturday evening."To facilitate the works, there will be a curtailment of metro train services on the Purple Line from 4 pm onwards on Saturday till 6 am on Sunday between Baiyappanahalli and M G Road metro stations," the BMRCL Chief Public Relations Officer said in a statement today.The statement further said that metro trains will continue to run between M G Road and Kengeri Metro Stations on the Purple Line as scheduled. Metro Services on Green Line and the entire purple line will run normally as per schedule on October 9 and 10, it said.The extended Purle Line was inaugurated by Union minister Hardeep Puri and Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai in August this year.The line under Phase 2 of the Namma Metro project has six stations - Nayanadahalli, RR Nagar, Jnanabharathi, Pattangere, Kengeri Bus Terminal and Kengeri. The services of the Metro are operational between 7am and 8pm and the trains run at a frequency of 10 minutes between Kengeri and Baiyappanahalli.Last month, Bommai reiterated that the Phase-II of the Bengaluru Metro should be completed by 2024, a year ahead of the original deadline, so as to ensure that the project becomes a “lifeline” for the residents of India’s IT capital.The metro project has seen several delays since its announcement in Bengaluru. The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has managed to complete just around 60 kms in the last 13 years, averaging around 4 kms per year, Hindustan Times reported in February.But Bommai attributed those delays to the project being a new thing for the IT city. He said the learnings from this phase would help quicken the other stages and make it operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/services-of-bengaluru-metro-to-be-curtailed-tomorrow-check-details-here-101633691753584.html
08-10-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Seat belts on please... how sustainable aviation is lining up a post-Covid take-off||This is a busy year. A busy, busy year. Not for me, but for the aviation industry in general, for Indian aviation in particular and definitely for all those who are rebuilding aviation in a sustainable mode.Given that the global aviation industry is reeling under billions of dollars of losses, redundancies, and relentless pressure from climate-change activists to atone for its carbon-emission sins, I was delighted to find that the industry is facing up to the current decade as it always has: rebuilding with its sense of responsibility for the world intact.While the industry at large has been actively investing in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), more airlines are now committing to a phased switch-over to SAF. More airports are switching to eco-friendly energy sources. In June 2021, Delhi International Airport was recognised as a green airport by the Airports Council International. Also in June, Bengaluru International Airport achieved one of its sustainability goals by becoming Energy Neutral for FY2021 (it consumes power through onsite solar installations and Power Purchase Agreements from solar and wind energy suppliers). In August, Mumbai International Airport won a CII award for energy efficiency. Meanwhile, Cochin International Airport (which had won UN recognition in 2018 as the world’s first fully solar powered airport) continues to forge ahead with environment friendly initiatives, but these are matters for another day.Closer home, this week (October 9) a new airport in Maharashtra goes live, with Allianz Air beginning flights from Mumbai to Sindhudurg. This is hot on the heels of the recent expansion of the Shirdi airport. As I was reading about the newly developed infrastructure of these airports and the features and the facilities and the expected passenger loads and connectivity, I was excited. Sindhudurg has fascinated me since high school when I first read (in history textbooks) about the famous fort built by Shivaji. I have never gotten around to making the trip there, probably because I prefer flying to long road trips.I don’t understand much about sustainability at an industry level, but I understand that we have to change (now) and that means making wise choices, not superficial changes under intimidation from well-meaning and genuinely concerned climate activists. Thankfully I know dependable people who not only know sustainability, but are also involved in shaping initiatives and preparing next-generation professionals to act responsibly. I reached out to Suzanne Kearns in Canada, who is a pilot, author, aviation educationist, new technology advocate, and now, the founding director of Waterloo Institute of Sustainable Aeronautics (WISA). Kearns has been at the forefront of what I call “applied education”. Naturally, I asked her about sustainable aviation and what she thinks is the way forward. She wrote back promptly.“If we think back to before the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a growing flight-shaming movement. Greta Thunberg led a climate protest outside of ICAO headquarters during the last General Assembly. I was beginning to see this reflected among my young students – who love aviation, but would increasingly come to me and report that their friends ask them ‘why would you want to be part of an industry that’s contributing to climate change’ and say they should be embarrassed to be passionate about aviation,” Kearns offered as a background. “My follow-up discussion would often point out that, yes, aviation is responsible for 2% of global emissions and we need to lean into exploring new technologies and practices to do better. However, aviation is ultimately a powerful force for good. Providing millions of jobs around the world, supporting cultural exchange, moving more than 1/3 of the world’s cargo by value (including critical medical supplies). Yet, in addition to the environmental challenges, aviation was also facing personnel shortages (pre-pandemic) and a rapid evolution of technology that we were challenged to stay ahead of. Interestingly, these align with the ‘3 pillars’ of sustainability – environmental, social, and economic. The motivation behind the WISA was that I wanted to do my part to support our sector – so I have been working full-force to mobilise the University of Waterloo’s full innovative capacity (one of the leading computer science, engineering, and environmental schools in the world). My primary goal is to support a bright future for our sector,” says Kearns.WISA was formally launched earlier this week (October 5) and Kearns is hoping to generate momentum with industry participation since sustainable practices touch every aspect of aviation – social sustainability includes human factors, flight physiology, modern training/educational practices, equity/diversity/inclusion. “Environmental sustainability is focused on reducing emissions (engine emissions and noise emissions) through new technologies, sustainable aviation fuel, and other practices. Economic sustainability will require wide-reaching innovations, which we’re focusing on through new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, crew and aircraft optimisation, and many others. As a quick example, consider a study we’re working on to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyse ab-initio pilot skill development in a flight simulator. We hope that this evidence can further support evidence/competency-based training approaches, to justify efficiently moving more hours out of aircraft into the simulator early in training. Interestingly, when this happens it supports the 3 pillars of sustainability: 1) environmental – simulators are electrically powered so reducing in-aircraft hours reduces engine and noise emissions, 2) social – training in simulators is generally less expensive than in aircraft, and training is customised to learner needs so it better supports individual skill development, 3) economic – flight schools generally have higher profit margins on simulators than aircraft.”Kearns opines that it doesn’t make sense for the academic sector to be only exploring theoretical challenges – it is also essential for universities to mobilise the talent they have towards directly addressing applied research challenges with a direct value return to industry and regulatory partners.She also feels that India and developing nations where aviation is really starting to grow can contribute and benefit a lot from the experience of the developed nations. “Similar to parts of the world that were able to ‘jump ahead’ of laying telephone wires and begin service using cellular phones, I hope that this work will directly support air transportation in developing nations by supporting practices that are best supporting environmental, social, and economic sustainability,” she says.All of which reminded me of a Hindustan Times report in September that spoke of the civil aviation minister’s 100-day plan. I must admit I had been super excited reading about the five new airports, six heliports and 50 new routes. The Sindhudurg airport inauguration is part of that plan. Earlier this week, the state chief minister also appointed the operator for the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. These are a small part of the overall investment into aviation. Given India’s strong commitment to sustainability and addressing climate change issues, I am sure there will be checks and balances within policy to ensure private operators are truly innovating while they build infrastructure and fly us into the digital age. The opportunity for us to make wise choices is as big as the opportunity to grow and develop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-seat-belts-on-please-how-sustainable-aviation-is-lining-up-a-post-covid-takeoff-101633690809631.html

The civic body has set aside a budget of ₹12Cr for the project.The population of Digha is now around one lakh. They have been grappling with water issues for the past several years as the area has no reservoir of its own. A senior officer of NMMC said, “A few months ago, we purchased a plot of land from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) at a subsidised rate for developing the reservoir. We are done with the tendering process and the work at the site will be started within two weeks. We will give the contractors a timeframe of one-and-a-half years for completing the project. Thus, from 2023, the residents of Digha will not have any water issue.” Datta Patil, 49, a resident of Digha said, “NMMC gets sufficient water to distribute among its residents as it has its own dam (Morbe dam). However, despite being a part of its jurisdiction, the area of Digha is deprived of the required amount of water simply because there is no reservoir. The water pressure is extremely low in our area and it takes up to fifteen minutes to fill a bucket.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/digha-residents-will-not-have-any-water-issue-from-2023-says-navi-mumbai-civic-official-101633690452003.html

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal CM quells dissent over BJP ticket at Fatehpur||In a reprieve for the ruling BJP, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday managed to mollify state party vice-president Kripal Parmar, who was planning to contest the Fatehpur assembly byelection as an Independent after being denied the ticket. Also read: Haryana CM withdraws ‘tit for tat’ remark in the ‘interest of peace’Parmar’s supporters, who had announced mass resignations on Thursday, attended the rally after BJP candidate Baldev Thakur filed his nomination. Though Parmar did not attend the public meeting, he later met the chief minister in private at a party worker’s house and backtracked on his plan to contest as a rebel. Later, Parmar flew with the chief minister in his helicopter to Jubbal-Kotkhai, where BJP nominee Neelam Saraik also filed her nomination on Friday. Parmar shared the stage with the CM at Jubbal-Kotkhai. Rivalry between Parmar, Baldev Thakur Fatehpur, Jubbal-Kotkhai and Arki assembly constituencies besides the Mandi parliamentary seat go to the polls on October 30. Parmar was a frontrunner for the BJP ticket from Fatehpur assembly segment. However, the BJP fearing a rebellion chose Baldev Thakur as its nominee. Baldev Thakur, a member of state BJP working committee, had earlier unsuccessfully fought the 2012 election. In the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP replaced him with Parmar. Thakur revolted and contested as an independent, securing more than 13,000 votes which was the primary reason behind Parmar’s defeat at the hands of Congress’ Sujan Singh Pathania, whose death has necessitated the byelection. CM sure of BJP’s win in all four constituencies Addressing the public meeting at Rehan in Fatehpur, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that the BJP has taken to the field after full preparation and will win all four byelections. He said achievements of the central and state governments will be the poll plank of the party. On ticket allocation, he said it was the decision of the party and must be accepted. “I urge all party workers to be united and ensure the BJP’s victory. You give us victory in Fatehpur and the government will do whatever possible to develop this segment,” the CM said. Attacking the Congress, he said the opposition party lacks in leadership and policy. Citing the example of Punjab, he said the Congress made Navjot Singh Sidhu the state party president and he stepped down a few days later. BJP nominee Baldev Thakur urged people to come forward in large numbers on polling day and vote in his favour. State party chief Suresh Kashyap, in-charge for Fatehpur byelection industry minister Bikram Singh, forest minister Rakesh Pathania and social justice and empowerment minister Sarveen Chaudhary were among those present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-cm-quells-dissent-over-bjp-ticket-at-fatehpur-101633689188588.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||40 more victims approach EOW to complain against VGN Jewellers owner, who has been arrested for cheating||Around 40 more victims have approached the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Thane Crime Branch to register complaints against the owner of VGN Jewellers, who was arrested earlier this week for allegedly running a Ponzi racket, officials said on Friday.The owner of the popular jewellery chain, Virithgopalan Nair, was booked along with his wife Valsala by the Kolsewadi police in Kalyan after 13 investors approached the police earlier this month. The investors had alleged that the couple had swindled them to the tune of ₹7.99Cr through various investment schemes, promising attractive returns. The case was transferred to the EOW and Nair was arrested on Tuesday.Deputy Commissioner of Police (EOW), Sunil Lokhande, said on Friday that apart from the 13 original complainants, 40 more had come forward with complaints of their own since Nair’s arrest.“Statements have been recorded from all the victims and the total amount of money swindled by the accused has now gone up to around ₹15Cr. More victims are also expected to come forward in the days to come,” Lokhande said.People have also started taking to social media to contact the police about having been cheated by the accused. One such victim, whose Twitter username is ‘Yatin59064881’, tweeted to the Thane Police on Friday saying, “@ThaneCityPolice Just got information that VGN Jewelers Owner is arrested by Economic Offense Wing(Thane) for Fraud. I have also invested 1.5 lacs in VGN scheme, so for this which police station I should approach as I stay in Dombivli. Thank You in Advance. (sic).”The Thane Police replied to him, asking him to approach his local police station.

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana CM withdraws ‘tit for tat’ remark in the ‘interest of peace’||Faced with widespread criticism over his “pick up sticks” call during a recent address to BJP Kisan Morcha workers, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said that he was withdrawing the controversial remarks in the interest of peace. Khattar, who sounded apologetic, told journalists in Panchkula that his remarks were not made with a malicious intent but were aimed at self-defence. Also read: ‘Not satisfied with UP govt probe in Lakhimpur Kheri case’: Supreme Court“Farmers have been hurt by this comment. Hence, I withdraw this comment as I don’t want a law and order situation, disturbing the peace of the state. Everyone has a right to protest peacefully,” the chief minister said after paying obeisance at Mata Mansa Devi temple on the second day of the Navratri festival. Khattar had on Sunday asked the party’s Kisan Morcha workers to raise groups of farmer volunteers in the state’s northern and north-western districts who can “pick up sticks”. Controversial remarks widely shared on social media The controversial remarks seen in a video were widely shared on social media platforms and evoked much criticism. The reference was evidently aimed at the protesting farmers who have been chasing the ruling BJP-JJP leaders and disrupting their visits and events. “We will have to encourage upcoming farmer groups...in every district, particularly the northern and northwestern districts, we will have to raise groups of 500-700 kisan volunteers... And then sathe shathyam samacharet (tit-for-tat). Pick up sticks,” Khattar was seen telling he workers in the video. Responding to a remark by a person in the gathering (which was not audible), Khattar told the gathering not to worry about jamanat (bail) after picking up the sticks. “If you spend a couple of months...you will become a leader. You will learn much more than these meetings and become a tall leader. Your name will get etched in history,” he said in a reference to doing time in jail. CM’s remarks shown selectively: Official A government official said that the chief minister’s remarks were shown selectively in the video. “The video lacked perspective and is misleading. It was an internal meeting of the party workers. The CM told them to oppose wrong actions but by maintaining discipline. In fact, the CM told the party workers to maintain discipline and not to take law in their hands,” said an official. Former BJP MLA Sukhwinder Sheoran, who was present at the BJP Kisan Morcha meeting at Khattar’s house on Sunday, said that the remarks regarding raising kisan volunteers were only aimed at countering the propaganda about the three central farm laws. Opposition quick to target CM The remarks drew criticism from the opposition parties. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, in a tweet, said that rule of law cannot be maintained in the state if the CM himself speaks about inciting violence and breaking law and order. “The anti-farmer face of the BJP stands exposed. It’s time to get rid of this government,” Surjewala tweeted. The fresh controversy with the “sticks” remark has come after an IAS officer posted as Karnal SDM was, in August, seen telling cops to hit the farmers on the head if they try to disrupt a BJP event. The remark and a police lathicharge at a toll plaza in Karnal fuelled protests by farmer unions. The farmers relented after the government set up a commission to probe the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-agitation-haryana-cm-khattar-withdraws-pick-up-sticks-call-in-interest-of-peace-101633683608050.html

Police first registered a case of unnatural death when Arbaz Mullah’s body was found on September 28. Later a murder case was filed on the basis of his post-mortem report and the nature of injuries to his head.The Belagavi Police said the woman’s parents, Eerappa and Susheela Kumbhar, and Maharaja Nagappa alias Pundalik Mutgekar, a member of Hindu group Sri Ram Sena Hindustan, are the prime suspects in the murder.In a statement, police added the parents opposed the woman’s relationship with Mullah and approached Nagappa to end it. But the woman remained adamant. Police said the parents met Nagappa multiple times and when Mullah refused to end the relationship, they threatened him. As the threats did not work, Nagappa allegedly hired seven contract killers to kill Mullah on September 28. The killers dumped his body on the railway tracks.The arrests come after Mullah’s family complained about the delay in the investigation. In her complaint to the police, Mullah’s mother, Nazeema Mohammad Sheikh, accused the woman’s family of murdering her son to end the relationship.“We knew about the relationship, and I had spoken to the woman’s mother to ensure she does not meet him. I also told my son not to meet her. I shifted from Khanapur to Azam Nagar in Belagavi with my son. But the two continued to meet, and we started getting threats from her family,” Sheikh said.A protest was held in Belagavi on Monday against the police inaction.The seven other suspects arrested are the alleged contract killers. They have been identified as Maruti Pralhad Sugathe, Manjunatha Thukaram Gondali, Ganapathi Jnaneshwara Sugathe, Prashanth Kallappa Patil, Praveena Shankara, Qutubuddin and Shreedhara Mahadeva Doney.The accused have been booked under the Indian Penal Code’s Sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence ), 341 (wrongful restraint), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 384 (extortion ), and 149 (unlawful assembly).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/parents-among-those-arrested-for-muslim-man-s-murder-over-his-relationship-with-their-daughter-101633683129035.html

During the march, Tiwari will also interact with people of the Purvanchali community and ask for their take on the Delhi government's decision to prohibit Chhath Puja celebrations at public places.This comes after the Delhi's 'Chhath puja' Committee's functionaries met Tiwari and favoured celebrating the festival in public places like riverbeds, ponds, and other water bodies.However, the celebrations have been prohibited by the Delhi government in an order passed on September 30, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. 'Chhath puja' celebration shall not be allowed in public places, public grounds, riverbanks, and temples citing the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital, the government had stated in the order.Instead, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has advised devotees to celebrate the festival at their homes.After the conclusion of the march, the BJP leader will meet Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to seek permission for the Chhath puja celebrations. Baijal is also a chairman of the DDMA."There is no chance of Covid-19 infection spread when people celebrate Chhath in public places because devotees get into only knee-deep water while offering prayers," said Tiwari, addressing the concerns regarding the Covid-19."When people can enjoy swimming in the pools without any Covid-19 threat, how can Chhath spread infection," he also questioned. The Delhi government should make body temperature checks mandatory for entry into Chhath puja sites, the singer-turned-politician also said.In the past, Tiwari has also warned of staging protests in the city if the government doesn't revoke its order.Chhath Puja is a widely celebrated festival in India. It is dedicated to worship of Sun, where devotees express their gratitude for bestowing the bounties of life on earth. On this day, women observe a fast and worship the Sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjps-manoj-tiwari-to-hold-march-against-ban-on-chhat-puja-celebrations-101633677830542.html

Five other accused too have been convicted,” CBI special prosecutor HPS Verma said. HC dismissed victim’s son’s plea to transfer trial On Tuesday, the high court had dismissed a plea of Ranjit Singh’s son Jagseer Singh seeking the transfer of trial to another court in neighbouring states, levelling allegations against a CBI lawyer. However, the high court termed the allegations based upon surmises and conjectures. Acting on the plea of Jagseer Singh, the high court stayed further proceedings on August 24, two days before the trial court was to pronounce the final judgment. Ranjit Singh, a follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra. Ranjit highlighted sexual abuse of women disciples According to the CBI, he was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter highlighting sexual exploitation of female disciples at the dera. The dera head is lodged in Rohtak’s Sunaria Jail, serving a 20-year jail term for raping two disciples. There were mainly three cases registered against the Sirsa-based dera chief in 2002. All were investigated by the CBI. The dera chief has been convicted in two cases, one related to sexual exploitation of women disciples and the second of the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. The third case was of Ranjit Singh in which he was convicted on Friday. The first conviction was in a sexual exploitation case in August 2017, which had resulted in widespread violence in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cbi-court-holds-dera-sacha-sauda-head-ram-rahim-guilty-of-follower-s-murder-101633675207690.html

He was addressing a public meeting at Fatehpur after nomination of Congress’ Bhawani Singh Pathania. He said the ruling party was jittery due to its poor performance for four years and growing dissent. “Be it Jubbal or Fatehpur, Arki or Mandi, alarm bells are ringing for the BJP due to rebellion and saffron party workers have lost the confidence,” he added. Rana also took a jibe at HP chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for his statement wherein he said “Mandi is ours”. “Only Mandi? What does the chief minister think about other parts of the state?” asked Rana. Pathania, meanwhile, said bringing industry which may open large number of employment opportunities for local youth will be his priority. BJP slams Congress for promoting dynastic politicsBJP state general secretary Trilok Jamwal on Thursday said that the Congress always promoted dynastic politics. Talking to the media at Shimla, he said while the Gandhi family dominated the Congress at the national level, in Himachal, it was former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s family. “It is strange that the Congress could not find any candidate from Mandi parliamentary constituency other than a relative of Virbhadra Singh,” he said. “Pratibha Singh’s only qualification is her being the wife of Virbhadra Singh. As a former MP, she has no achievement to count,” Jamwal added. He said there was huge difference in the talks and deeds of the opposition party. The BJP state general secretary said when in power, the Congress had promised unemployment allowance to the jobless youth, but never fulfilled it. About the BJP, he said, “The party is united. The election is being fought under the leadership of CM Jai Ram Thakur and state BJP president Suresh Kashyap. We will surely win all the four seats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-congress-will-win-all-four-seats-says-sujanpur-mla-101633647485552.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: Voices of dissent grow louder in BJP||Trouble is brewing up for the BJP in Himachal’s Fatehpur ahead of the October 30 bypolls as more than three dozen office-bearers and elected representatives resigned after party chose Baldev Thakur as its candidate for the byelection. Those who quit the party included BJP’s Fatehpur block president Kartar Pathania, block development council chairperson Nisha Sharma, vice-president Dharmender Shunna, block mahila morcha president Suman Bala and 40 elected pradhans. Kartar said they wanted to know why the BJP chose a person who fought against the party’s official nominee in 2017 assembly elections. “Why was the ticket denied to Kripal Parmar who has dedicatedly served the party for many decades?” he asked. “BJP workers of Fatehpur are with Parmar. If the party doesn’t change its decision, we all will work against the BJP candidate,” he said. Meanwhile, Parmar, who had extended wishes of Navratri on his social media page in the morning, is keeping a cryptic silence and his cards close to his chest. Amid such infighting, it would be a daunting task for the ruling party wrest Fatehpur where it has lost three consecutive elections since 2007. Chinks in the BJP Fatehpur’s unit became more visible when posters calling him an outsider, referring to his routes in Punjab and not in Himachal, surfaced two days ago. Parmar had lost the 2017 assembly election to Fatehpur seat by a slander margin of just 1,200-odd votes, primarily due to the infighting. At that time also, similar posters were put up in Fatehpur against him. Baldev had contested the 2017 assembly election as an Independent. He had secured more than 13,000 votes breaching in the BJP’s vote bank which ultimately resulted in Parmar’s defeat. Another BJP rebel, former MP Rajan Sushant also contested as an Independent and polled more than 6,000 votes. He has this time floated his own political outfit ‘Hamari Party Himachal Party’ and is again in fray. He will only harm the BJP’s prospects. Traditionally, voters in areas under Fatehpur assembly constituency have mostly favoured Congress candidates. Fatehpur was carved out by merging areas of Jawali, Gangath and Nurpur assembly segments in the delimitation process before 2012 assembly elections. Congress veteran Sujan Singh Pathania, whose demise necessitated the October 30 byelection, had won seven elections from the seat while former BJP MP Rajan Sushant was victorious on four occasions. Meanwhile, Congress has fielded Sujan Singh Pathania’s son Bhawani Singh Pathania from its traditional stronghold. He filed his nomination on Thursday. Apart from him former MP Rajan Sushant also filed his nomination. Bhawani Pathania before taking the poll plunge worked as top executive in insurance and banking companies. He has already hit the campaign trail and attended more than a dozen public meetings. Chetan Bragta questions ticket allocation in Jubbal-KotkhaiHimachal BJP’s IT cell head Chetan Bragta on Thursday raised a banner of revolt against the party after Neelam Seraik was chosen over him for the Jubbal-Kotkhai seat. Till Wednesday, it looked certain that the party would field Chetan as he was in the forefront of campaigns after his father Narendra Bragta’s death. Neelam is said to be close to urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj. Chetan’s supporters also staged a protest in Kotkhai’s Gumma on Thursday and decried the party’s decision to allocate ticket to Neelam. Questioning the ticket allocation, Chetan asked, “What was my fault? I was mourning my father’s death when the party high command asked me to start campaigning. My father had died serving the party. He would not have contracted Covid had the party not sent him to Solan for municipal election campaigning. The BJP will have a lot many questions to answer.” He added, “If I was denied the ticket due to party’s formula of discouraging dynastic politics, then it should have at least chosen anyone among the senior leaders. Rather it chose a leader who all these years had been conniving with the Congress to weaken the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-voices-of-dissent-grow-louder-in-bjp-101633647305452.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court asks Ambala police to look into fight between transgenders||Latika, 39, an Ambala-based transgender, had filed a plea in the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking protection of life and liberty, stating that she is living under constant threat after being allegedly threatened by chelas (associates) of mahant Rajkumari Haji, as she continued asking for offerings in the area even after leaving the dera. The petitioner was a former associate of Rajkumari and visited door-to-door in 25 villages and neighbouring localities seeking offerings and giving blessings on special occasions. However, Latika parted ways and the mahant started pressuring her to leave the city.Petitioner’s advocate Maninderjit Singh on September 28 told the court that his client had been attacked and threatened in the past by fellow transgenders under the mahant, Twinkle and Heena along with a driver, Rehmat Ali, alias Laddu, and a local property dealer, Rahul Singh Walia. “A representation was given to the SHO, police station, Sector 9, Ambala City, in May 2021, but no steps were taken…In June the petitioner was attacked at the police post No.5, who was saved by the police and was dropped home by them. This incident was brought to the notice of the DGP, Haryana, but to no avail. In September, the said accused came to Latika’s house in her absence and had openly threatened to eliminate her if she doesn’t leave Ambala City. This was brought to the notice of the SSP, Ambala, but no action was taken,” the petition says.Latika said there were apprehensions that the said people might attack her and asked the court to protect her life and liberty.On October 1, the court of Justice Deepak Sibal disposed of the petition and directed the SHO of the police station concerned to take action as per law. Meanwhile, Maninderjit Singh said as per the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, forcing any transgender to leave household, village or other places of residence was a punishable offence with two years of imprisonment and a fine. Section 18 of the Act explains that compelling a transgender person to indulge in the act of forced or bonded labour other than any compulsory service for public purposes imposed by the government, denying them the right of passage to a public place or obstructs such person from using or having access to a public place to which other members have access to or a right to use or harming their life, safety, health or well-being, whether mental or physical, tends to do acts, including causing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional and economic abuse, are also punishable offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-asks-ambala-police-to-look-into-fight-between-transgenders-101633645265237.html

Addressing media persons at the lightpoint, Sidhu lashed out at the BJP and asked if a union minister is above the law. “Even after four days of registering an FIR and nominating the union minister son’s in the FIR, UP police have not arrested him. This protest will continue till they are arrested. I am going to be on hunger strike from tomorrow (Friday) if they will not be arrested,” said Sidhu. “This fight is of my leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi.

Deputy chief minister OP Soni said, “Navjot Singh Sidhu will lead the march and most of the MLAs have joined the march to get justice.” Former cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “The BJP has crossed all limits by not arresting Ashish Mishra Teni, who is the son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni. He is nominated in the FIR and it was a preplanned murder.” Massive traffic jam There was a massive traffic jam on Patiala road and Airport road for nearly two hours on Thursday as most of the Congress leaders and workers had parked their vehicles on the road.

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh police goofs up, reveals name of diplomat who was molested||Call it an oversight or sheer callousness, Chandigarh police ended up revealing the identity of the senior British diplomat, who had filed a molestation case on Wednesday. A day after her complaint, UT police uploaded the FIR on the website, revealing her name, phone number, address etc. Normally, in cases filed by women and children, the identities are not revealed. Even though the UT police uploads such cases on its website, these are classified as sensitive and not accessible to the general public. Even in routine crime cases, where no sexual assault is involved but the complainant is a woman, Chandigarh police withholds the name. But in this case, the FIR was uploaded as a routine FIR thus making it available to any person who logs on to the website. When contacted, superintendent of police Ketan Bansal said, “The FIR should not have been uploaded on the website, I will get it checked.” The 60-year-old diplomat was allegedly molested near Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA) in Sector 10 on Wednesday morning while she was on her way to play tennis. The envoy alleged that she had crossed Jan Marg and was at the roundabout near hotel Mount View when an unidentified man arrived on his motorbike and molested her. Her complaint said, “I was walking past the residential houses when a motorcycle came up behind me. The rider hit me hard with his hand or something on my back. I shouted at him and ran after him but he sped away.” On the basis of her complaint, a case under Section 354 (sexual harassment) and 354 A (assault or use of criminal force on any woman or abet such act with the intention of disrobing) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Sector 3 police station. Police yet to arrest accused Even a day after, the police have failed to arrest the accused who had touched her inappropriately. Police are scanning closed circuit television cameras in the area to trace the number of the motorcycle which they still have not been able to find. Police are even scanning the dump data of mobile phones active in the area at the time, but so far, they haven’t got any clues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-goofs-up-reveals-name-of-diplomat-who-was-molested-101633643825321.html

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sans approvals, 24/7 water supply in Chandigarh still a pipe dream||City residents will have to wait more for 24/7 water supply as the project’s commencement itself is set to get delayed by at least three to six more months. With the requisite Union government approvals still not in place, the municipal corporation (MC) will miss the October 15 deadline for signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the French firm, Agence Française de Développement (AFD). After October 15, the AFD can revise the rate of interest to be charged on the loan amount, making it more expensive for the city and consequently raising the cost of the project. MC can end up re-negotiating the interest rates. Confirming the development, UT adviser Dharam Pal, said, “MC will not be able to sign the agreement with the AFD by October 15. It will take another few months.” A senior MC official pegged the delay at three months to six months. The fact that the MC hasn’t taken all the requisite approvals came to light during the two-day visit of MC commissioner Anindita Mitra to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) this week. The adviser held a meeting with Mitra here on Thursday. Mitra briefed the adviser on her MHA visit and the status of the project. Notably, MC officials had earlier claimed that requisite approvals were in place. MC officials, in May this year, had even announced the timeline for the project, stating that agreement would be signed in August/September, tenders floated by October-end and work on the project to start by February 2022. Officials had declared that by December this year, AFD would release ₹43 crore while EU would release around ₹9 crore as the first installment for the project. The AFD is to provide ₹413 crore to the project in the form of a loan, which is to be repaid in 15 years. In addition to it, the European Union (EU) is also giving a grant of ₹98 crore to the project. But before the grant is released, the AFD has to sign “Credit Facility Agreement” (CFA) with the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Union ministry of finance. Thereafter, a MoU will be signed between the MC and the donor agencies. MC yet to take MHA “in principle” approval An MC official who didn’t want to be named said, “The MC is still to take the “in-principle” approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the nod of the standing finance committee (SFC) of the Ministry of Finance. Without both, DEA of will not come on board and sign the CFA with the AFD.” “MC has not submitted the requisite papers for the process to begin,” said the official. “The MC officials are still to assess whether the union government will consider the project worth ₹6,000 crore incorporating the operations and maintenance costs over its 20-year period or just ₹591 crore, the construction cost,” said the official. Taking a serious note of MC officials’ earlier laxity on the issue, Pal, said, “I am going to monitor it very aggressively. Commissioner will also take it up on priority basis. This project is very important for the city. I have directed the MC to complete the paperwork as quickly as possible so that necessary approvals of the MHA and the DEA are taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sans-approvals-24-7-water-supply-in-chandigarh-still-a-pipe-dream-101633642325532.html

08-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Portrait of a key maker||It’s like discovering all the passwords of your online existence copy-pasted into a stranger’s laptop. Such is the alarm one feels on coming face-to-face with hundreds of keys hanging in several bunches, from a series of nails rammed into a low wooden block.The Old Delhi pavement stall of the so-named Chabi Wale specialises in making keys, or chabi, for various kinds of big and small locks. The Chabi Wale’s mobile phone number is scrawled all over the stall’s wooden booth, including on the wall behind him. On receiving a call, the Chabi Wale walks over to the customer’s gali or kucha, surveys the lock, and makes a replica of the lost key on the spot. Customers also occasionally walk to the stall to get “duplicate chabi” made.The establishment has been in Tiraha Behram Khan for more than 40 years. The founder is sitting in a spotlessly white kurta and white lungi; his beard is also white. In his 60s, Muhammad Ateek feels his occupation will never be threatened by recent innovations in automated locking. Even though at least one house in the Walled City—near Pataudi Chowk—has replaced the familiar tala-and-chabi with an electrical lock based on programmed codes. “Fancy chochle (blandishment) cannot replace the chabi,” the Chabi Wale declares, expressing confidence that his son will keep the stall alive.This afternoon the bazaar is crowded with shoppers, and the street looks like a blur from the Chabi Wale’s chair. The counter on his booth is filled with a variety of handy tools. Son, Salman, identifies each with its name—“reti, sansi, hathori, pechkas, plaas, chenni, batta...”While the young man has obediently taken up his father’s occupation, the elderly Chabi Wale rebelled against his father. “He sold fruit, I didn’t like doing that work.” He was intrigued by a friend, who was working as a Chabi Wale in Chawri Bazar. “I learnt key making from him and set up my shop on this same spot.” The stall is located outside Masjid Bar Wali—the mosque’s bar tree no longer exists. Neither does the Chabi Wale’s ancestral home behind the mosque, on Gali Rohilla. “We now live outside Old Delhi, in Minto Road… it’s less noisy there.”No customer has appeared during the course of this conversation. The mobile phone has also remained silent. The venerable Chabi Wale shows no anxiety. He knows that somebody sooner or later is bound to lose a key.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-key-maker-101633641838794.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Close shave for truck driver as road caves in||It was a close shave for a truck driver after the road caved-in under the weight of his wheat-laden heavy vehicle in Guru Nanak Pura near Kailash Chowk on Wednesday night. The road had been built over a five-decade-old brick sewer line, which could not take the load of the truck and collapsed. The truck, which fell into the crater thus formed, was pulled out with the help of a crane. Area councillor Jai Prakash said, “Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident and MC staff has been deputed to repair the damaged portion. The movement of traffic was blocked and diverted.”Water, sewer lines damagedPrakash said that sewer and water supply lines had been also damaged in the incident and temporary arrangements had been made on Thursday so that the residents are not inconvenienced. “MC teams will take up repair work at night and directions have been issued to repair the road at the earliest,” he said. Road cave-ins are being increasingly reported across the city. Residents blame old brick sewer lines for the menace. Old sewer lines are still in place in several areas such as the Kaka Marriage Palace Road, Dugri, and Model Town extension. In fact, a motorist had lost his life due to a sudden cave-in on the Kaka Marriage Palace Road in 2011. In 2013, a 80-ft crater had formed near Dhami Eye Hospital after the sewer line collapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-close-shave-for-truck-driver-as-road-caves-in-101633641424977.html

LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said that under the scheme, the department had proposed to develop 576 flats, including 330 high income group(1,610 square feet) and 276 middle income group (1,210 sq feet) apartments. Semi-finished flats will be allotted to residents through a draw of lots. The cost of HIG flats will be below ₹50 lakh and that of MIG flats will be below ₹40 lakh.Facilities such as a swimming pool, community centre, gymnasium, and small commercial centre will also be provided and the maintenance of the common area, roads, and sewer will be handed over to the contractor for five years.Technical approvals have been taken from the state government and Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). The prices of the flats have to be finalised, after which the proposal will be sent to the state government, the LIT chairman said. Draw of lots in December “It is expected that applications will be called in by mid-November and draw of lots will take place in mid-December. Construction will start in around six months and the flats will be handed over to the allottees within three years,” he said.The Atal apartment scheme was initially launched in 2011, when the then local bodies minister had laid the foundation stone for the project. The department had even allotted flats, but the scheme was cancelled after allottees failed to pay for the apartments. The scheme was relaunched in 2018 and applications were sought from the residents, but it was again cancelled in 2020.Expect new design. On the name change, the chairman said, “The name of the scheme has been changed to pay tribute to the legendary poet. The Atal apartments scheme has been scrapped and the design has also been changed completely. We decided to name the scheme after Ludhianvi as nothing in the city has been named after him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lit-relaunches-atal-scheme-as-sahir-ludhianvi-apartments-101633640406098.html

My son and locals present at the office got involved and saved me,” Mal said in his complaint. Meanwhile, the ME claimed that Mal wanted to get a no dues certificate (NDC) and had come with a pre-planned conspiracy to attack him.“I told him that I don’t have any responsibility related to the NDC and if I’m not receiving his calls, he should have complained to my senior officials. He was adamant that I’m always unavailable on the phone. I also received some injuries after he attacked me and a complaint was given to the MC commissioner,” Boora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ambala-former-mayor-mc-engineer-get-into-scuffle-101633640225119.html

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Our core constituency, farmers, still intact; Modi saab should repeal farm laws: Parkash Singh Badal||The grand old man of Punjab politics, 93-year-old Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch and five-time Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal has set his eyes on yet another political battle of his seven-decade-long career. This time, however, he plans to play from the sidelines and watch his son SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal at the forefront. He may not be fast with the body movements but he’s still quick-witted and possesses an astute thinking mind. Currently staying in his resort-like farmhouse at his native Badal village away from the political action, he keeps his ears to the ground. He meets people of Lambi and surrounding constituencies three days a week and is often visited by the leaders of Akali Dal and its new ally Bahujan Samaj Party. He spoke with Hindustan Times on a variety of issues and also ducked a few questions, including the ones related to sacrilege. Excerpts of an interview: Punjab is heading for polls in four months, how do you see the political scenario building up? It is difficult to predict the outcome. Things will be clear only when polls are near. There are too many contenders; Congress party has two camps of (former CM) Capt Amarinder and (state congress president Navjot Singh) Sidhu; then there are the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP. Akali Dal will give a tough fight. Some people in the government are trying to be vindictive against us, but I always refrained from such tactics. What happened in the past? Amarinder Singh made a case against me, which fell flat in the court. What role do you see for yourself in the elections? SAD has announced 70 candidates, but not from Lambi yet. Do you plan to contest again?I do not want comment on that now, let’s wait and watch. I have addressed two rallies in the past week and am active as much my health permits. Contesting polls will depend on my health. I will be speaking on important matters like the one concerning the farmers. It is a good move to announce candidates early as it gives more time for strategising and campaigning. Where do you place the Congress and the AAP vis-a-vis the Akali Dal? Both the parties take directions from their leaders in Delhi. People of Punjab, in my opinion, will choose the one that understands their issues and stay close to them. Local parties serve people better and regional should unite for a bigger say at the national level. People have a short memory. SAD had fought for the Punjabi Suba for which I was jailed for 15 years. We maintained communal harmony and have done a lot of development…thermal power plants, oil refinery, road network, mandis, irrigation system, memorials...there is so much to count. What the Congress govenrments had done is not even a fraction of that. People know Congress was behind the 1984 genocide and Harmandar Sahib was demolished during their tenure. AAP convener (Arvind) Kejriwal promised a Sikh as the Punjab CM face but failed name one. Your long-time associates Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Ranjit Singh Brahmpura will not be with you in the 2022 elections. Do you feel the void in the party? Main Dhindsa saab atey Brahmpura saab di dilon izzat kardan...ehe oho jandey han. (I respect Dhindsa and Brahmpura from the core of my heart and they know this). I have done a lot from them, and they also have helped me. I want them back. Ekta vich shakti hai (Unity is strength). Parminder is a sober leader and worked well as a finance minister in the Akali government. Farmers seem to be annoyed with SAD? How do you plan to bring party’s core strength back? I think, some (farmer) leaders may be annoyed but our core strength, the farmers, is still intact. SAD governments had done a lot for farmers and all my decisions as chief minister were farmer-centric. At the time of voting over the three farm laws, it was only Sukhbir (Ferozepur MP) and biba ji (Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal) who voted against the laws, while the Congress and AAP preferred to walk out. We broke alliance with the BJP and quit the Union government. You compare this with 1984 riots and Operation Bluestar; Congress leaders late Giani Zail Singh (then President) and late Buta Singh (then home minister) didn’t relinquish their positions. Akali Dal had a long association with the BJP. Was severing the ties the right decision? No doubt, we had a long association and supported them. But there is no question of regret because for our party, the interests of farmers are the priority. We have moved on and it’s good that we have an alliance with the BSP. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a great leader as he took everyone along. Narendra Modi is a different man. He passed the farm laws not acceptable to the farmers. Around 700 farmers have lost lives during the agitation, which is very painful, and Lakhimpur hadsey da mainu barra dukh hoya (Lakhimpur incident has saddened me). The scenario could take a worse turn, I appeal to Modi saab to repeal the farm laws. How do you rate the four-and-a-half years of the Capt-led Congress government? As a chief minister, responsibilities are huge…you have to meet aspirations and redress problems of a cross-section of society, but he failed. I used to hold sangat darshans, visit villages and wards, and meet people in my office and at home also. What about newly appointed CM Charanjit Singh Channi? Let us see how he performs; I wish him good luck. The way Channi was made the CM is not empowerment but humiliation. What’s your advice for Sukhbir Singh Badal? Main ohnu kehna jazbe naal kamm kro (I tell him to work with passion). In my opinion, he is in total control and is doing fine. I only advise him to give prominence to communal harmony before taking decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/our-core-constituency-farmers-still-intact-modi-saab-should-repeal-farm-laws-parkash-singh-badal-101633639925455.html

A case was registered on September 24 against Ashwani Kumar, councillor from Patti’s ward 17, for allegedly raping a woman relative, a day after he joined the SAD in the presence of former minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon. Kumar was absconding since. MLA Gill even posted a picture of him with the accused on his Facebook page. “Patti’s ward 17 councillor Ashwani Kumar has been re-inducted into the Congress. A few days ago, some people got him honoured by Adesh Partap Singh Kairon,” the photo caption read. Gill, however, didn’t respond to repeated calls. The woman had told the police in her complaint that Kumar was raping her since May 2020 and would even thrash her for opposing his advances. “Then, he drove me and my one-year-old daughter out of my husband’s house. I had told my husband everything but he didn’t react,” she had alleged. Talking to HT over phone, the victim’s uncle said, “She has been living in her maternal house for the last six months. Kumar was not allowing her to live with her husband. The police should arrest him immediately.”Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Kuljit Singh said, “The accused is absconding. He has not got any pre-arrest bail from any court. Our teams are working to nab him.”The opposition has termed the incident as a ‘mockery of the law’, claiming that it was the police who brought the accused to the MLA for his rejoining.Kairon’s political adviser Gurmukh Singh Ghulla said, “First, Ashwani was booked at the instance of the MLA because he joined SAD. He was nabbed by the local police who instead of lodging him in jail produced before the MLA who made him re-join the state’s ruling party. The MLA is using police and civil administration to meet his petty political ends. He is also threatening our other party workers to join the Congress.”Earlier, ward 12 councillor Surjit Singh was re-inducted into the Congress by the MLA. Surjit had also joined the SAD in the presence of Kairon earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/absconding-in-rape-case-turncoat-councillor-re-inducted-in-congress-by-patti-mla-101633638306344.html

We showed her somevideos related with the Lakhimpur violence. Watching these, Priyankaji saidnow she has some more evidence in connection with the violence,” he added.Later, Priyanka went to Banjaran Tanda village to meet the family of another deceased farmer, Daljeet.Earlier on way to meet the two grieving families in Bahraich, she spoke to media persons and said the BJP government did not want the truth to come out. “I wanted to meet the two families of BJP workers (who also died in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident) on Wednesday. I asked the IG that I would like to meet them if their families want to...but he told me ‘no, they don’t want to’. Then I said: Convey my condolences to them,” said Priyanka. Priyanka, along with her brother Rahul Gandhi, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and others had met grieving families of Lovepreet in Palia, journalist Raman Kashyap in Nighasan and Nakshatra Singh in Dhaurahra in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday night. After Rahul Gandhi left for New Delhi on Thursday morning, Priyanka, who was released after a nearly 55-hour detention amid high drama on Wednesday, left for Bahraich. On the way, she stopped at Mari Mata Mandir at Arjunganj to perform ‘puja’ on the first day of ‘Navratri’. As her cavalcade reached the Barabanki-Bahraich border, district administration officials stopped her vehicle for a while. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other party leaders were stopped at Barabanki-Bahraich border with the district administration insisting on not allowing more than five persons. After brief arguments, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with PL Punia, Varsha Gaekwad, Naseemuddin Siddiqui and KL Sharma, were allowed to proceed to Bahraich. We are coming back with a large group of partymen who were not allowed to proceed further,” said Onkar Nath Singh, spokesman, UP Congress Committee. Meanwhile, a Congress delegation staged a brief dharna at the gates of Raj Bhawan inn Lucknow when they were not allowed inside to submit a memorandum addressed to the President to the governor.

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Son held for killing Phagwara man for not giving money to go abroad||A 21-year-old youth and his accomplice were arrested for allegedly killing the former’s father in Kapurthala district’s Phagwara for not giving him money to go abroad, police said on Thursday. Baljit Singh, 48, was murdered on the intervening night of September 24 and 25 with sharp-edged weapons. Those arrested are Baljit’s son Sukhraj Singh and Parshant Rai while their another accomplice Balwinder Singh is absconding. Sukhraj and Parshant worked at an electrical hardware shop after completing their school. Initially, a case was registered under section 302 (punishment to murder) of Indian Penal Code at Phagwara sadar police station against unidentified persons. Kapurthala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh said their teams were working on different angles to solve the case. “We found some clues from crime spot during forensic investigation. During interrogation, it came to light that Sukhraj along with his mother and his younger sister was evicted from their house by Baljit nearly four-five years ago. Baljit was not employed and had taken to alcohol. He even used to thrash his wife and children under the influence of alcohol,” he added. Phagwara SP Sarabjit Singh Bahia said Sukhraj was in touch with his father for the past few months and was asking for money to go abroad. “Sukhraj even asked his father to sell two-kanal land but Baljit did not agree. Enraged, Sukhraj decided to kill him,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/son-held-for-killing-phagwara-man-for-not-giving-money-to-go-abroad-101633637524484.html
08-10-2021||Kolkata||Four TMC candidates for Bengal bypolls on Oct 30 file nomination papers||KOLKATA: As West Bengal geared up for Durga Puja, the state’s most important religious festival, candidates for the four assembly seats that go to the bypolls on October 30 filed their nomination papers on Thursday.The constituencies are Dinhata in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, and Santipur in Nadia district, Khardah in North 24 Parganas and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas, in south Bengal.Analysts feel that Dinhata will witness the most-fierce contest among the four seats as the BJP is perceived to have rapidly expanded its base in north Bengal. The party bagged seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019, and 30 of the 54 assembly seats in the eight north Bengal districts although the TMC won 213 of the state’s 294 seats.DinhataThe Dinhata seat fell vacant after the local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha member Nisith Pramanik, who contested the March-April election and won by 57 votes in a close contest, did not take oath to remain in the Lok Sabha. He was appointed Union minister of state for home affairs in July.Ashok Mondal, the BJP candidate, said, “I am not new to elections. I am sure voters will support me and my party.”The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has once again fielded Udayan Guha, the former Forward Bloc leader who bagged the Dinhata seat for the ruling party in 2011 and 2016.“He is daydreaming. The TMC’s victory is certain,” quipped Guha who was injured in an attack after the March-April polls and hospitalized for more than two months. Two security personnel assigned for his protection suffered head injuries in the attack.SantipurLike Dinhata, Nadia’s Santipur goes to the polls since the local BJP Lok Sabha member, Jagannath Sarkar, opted to remain in Parliament after winning the state poll.The BJP has fielded Niranjan Biswas against the TMC’s Brajakishore Goswami, a member of the Vaishnav community.Located close to the Indo-Bangladesh border, Nadia has witnessed caste and religion playing a major role in recent elections because of the sizeable presence of Hindu refugees from Bangladesh. Most of them belong to Hindu Dalit communities, such as the Matuas, who were the focus of the BJP’s campaign in both Lok Sabha and assembly elections.Mahua Moitra, the TMC Lok Sabha member from Krishnanagar in Nadia, wasted no time and started campaigning for Brajakishore Goswami on Thursday along with Saayoni Ghosh, president of the TMC youth wing.“If people can elect a TMC candidate for the Lok Sabha, won’t they vote for us in the assembly? We will surely win the seat,” Moitra said at a campaign meeting.Santipur used to be a Congress stronghold and its leader Ajoy Dey has bagged the seat five times since 1991. He crossed over to the Trinamool Congress and contested the election on a TMC ticket in 2014, winning it for the sixth time. But the Congress wrested it back in 2016.“Though we have left the other three seats for the Left parties to honour our electoral alliance, we will contest from Santipur,” Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury declared on Thursday.KhardahThe Khardah seat is vacant because TMC’s Kajal Sinha, who won it, died of Covid-19 before the results were declared on May 2. The TMC has fielded Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who won the Bhawanipore seat in south Kolkata but stepped aside so that Mamata Banerjee could contest again from her old constituency and continue as chief minister. Banerjee was defeated at East Midnapore district’s Nandigram by her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari.Khardah, which was once a stronghold of the CPI(M) and represented five times by former finance minister Asim Dasgupta, became the winning seat for Amit Mitra, who also became finance minister in Mamata Banerjee’s team, in 2011 and 2016. But Mitra did not contest this year owing to health issues.Since Mitra will not be able to continue as minister without winning a seat, the chief minister is planning an alternative arrangement for him, TMC leaders said.“People of Khardah have always stood by us. I have full faith in our voters,” Bengal power minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, said after filing his nomination papers.The BJP has fielded Joy Saha, a much younger leader compared to 77-year-old Chattopadhyay, who is among the TMC’s founder members.GosabaAt Gosaba in the Sunderbans region, TMC veteran Jayanta Naskar who represented the seat twice since 2011 died after his third victory. The TMC has fielded Subrata Mondal, a local leader, against the BJP’s Palash Rana, a debutant.In 1967, when the newly-formed Gosaba constituency went to the polls for the first time, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh bagged the seat. But between 1969 and 2006, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), a Left Front partner, had absolute control over the constituency. The Congress managed to win it only once in 1972 when the Siddhartha Shankar Ray government came to power.The BJP, which won 77 seats in the state’s general elections, is now left with an effective strength of 71 legislators. The ruling party, on the other hand, have increased its numbers from 213 to 215 by winning two seats in Murshidabad where elections could not be held because of the death of two candidates. These results were announced on October 3 along with that of the Bhawanipore bypoll which Mamata Banerjee won. The CPI(M) and its partners have announced that they will contest all four bypolls, including Santipur where the Congress will field a candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/four-tmc-candidates-for-bengal-bypolls-on-oct-30-file-nomination-papers-101633637344730.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Government interfering in Sikh affairs, alleges Akal Takht jathedar||The Akal Takht on Thursday accused the government of interfering in the matters of the Sikh community, days after Manjinder Singh Sirsa was disqualified as a member of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and a court reinstated Giani Iqbal Singh as jathedar of Takht Patna Sahib. In a virtual meeting with the Sikh clergy comprising Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh, Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh, Akal Takht head granthi Giani Malkit Singh and Takht Hazoor Sahib jathedar Giani Kulwant Singh, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said, “ While going through the letters received from the DSGMC and Takht Sri Patna Sahib Management Board, the five Sikh clergymen feel that the Delhi government and the Centre are interfering in the internal matters of the Sikhs,” read a statement issued by the clergymen. He added, “On August 25, dirty tricks were played to restrain the members elected for the DSGMC from constitute a committee. Also, interference is being made by the government into the religious affairs of Takht Patna Sahib Board by rejecting its decision of accepting resignation of the jathedar.” “Some Sikh leaders are violating the maryada by facilitating interference by government in the management of gurdwaras to fulfil their political ambitions. They must abstain from this,” he added. He also condemned the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri of Utter Pradesh. “The government is duty-bound to take action against the guilty. Playing politics on the deaths of the farmers is not acceptable. The political parties should put a united face to ensure stringent punishment to the culprits,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/government-interfering-in-sikh-affairs-alleges-akal-takht-jathedar-101633637284603.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||GMCH-32: 60% spike in admissions to paediatric ward in Sept||Admissions to the paediatric ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, have seen a 60% uptick in the last month.Since September, around 80 children in the age group of 1 month to 18 years have been consulting the hospital’s paediatric ward daily, with most of them suffering from fever. Of these, 25 have had to get admitted, due to health complications and severity of the ailment.“Earlier, 50 paediatric patients were consulting the hospital daily and most of them were being given consultation in the outpatient department (OPDs). Only 10 to 12 patients of the total were getting admitted. Since September, the daily consultations have risen to 80, with most of them complaining of fever,” said Dr Vishal Guglani, head of paediatrics, GMCH-32.Health experts believe that the spike is mainly due to the dengue outbreak in Chandigarh and neighbouring states. In the last three weeks, the hospital recorded 15 deaths within the paediatric population.Dr Guglani added, “Cases of fever among the paediatric population are rising mainly because of the dengue outbreak. Also, viral fever is very common during this season. Besides, infants are catching fever due to acute respiratory infections. The other reasons behind the surge in hospital admissions are snake bites and routine ailments like diabetes. Deaths among the paediatric population occurred due to chronic diseases and late admission to the hospital.”The authorities also said that tertiary care hospitals are getting referrals from other government and private hospitals, which is increasing the caseload at GMCH-32.Chandigarh director of health services Dr Suman Singh, said, “Hospitals witness a rush of patients complaining of fever every year in September and October. This is a season where catching fever is common due to viral infection, dengue or malaria. Not only the paediatric population, but adults also get infected. The cases increase annually and there is no specific reason for the hike in admissions this year.”Airing similar views, Dr Surjeet Singh, head of advanced paediatric centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said, “The period between July and mid-October is crucial as seasonal diseases grip the states. Due to dengue, malaria and viral infections, children get sick and need hospital admission every year. We are well equipped to provide better medical facilities.”Chandigarh records 47 dengue cases in past nine daysThe Chandigarh health department has registered 47 confirmed cases of dengue in the last nine days, taking this year’s total caseload to 125 till Thursday. No death has been reported so far.Cases of dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, started spiralling in the city after spells of rain. The total infection count was 265 last year, 286 in 2019 and 301 in 2018. Chandigarh had reported 1,951 dengue cases in 2017, the worst figures since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gmch32-60-spike-in-admissions-to-paediatric-ward-in-sept-101633637167063.html

08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Cotton prices at all-time high in Punjab, kharif crop fetching ₹7,500 per quintal||BATHINDAAs the second picking of raw cotton crop is set to gain momentum in Punjab, rates of the cash crop have reached an all-time high of ₹7,715 per quintal, 23% higher than the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹5,925.Punjab Mandi Board authorities say till Wednesday, 2.75 lakh quintal of cotton was purchased and private players are paying an average rate ₹7,500 for a quintal of raw cotton.This has come as a relief to farmers of the south Malwa belt, who are battling the threat of damage caused by the pink bollworm attack.In the semi-arid region of the state, cotton bolls are harvested thrice. Second picking is crucial as it comprises 60% of the total production. Due to the quality, the second harvest determines the profitability of a cotton grower.Industry watchers attribute higher prices for the kharif produce to an increase in demand by the international textile market.Director of Indian Cotton Association Limited, a body dealing in export, spinning, ginning of cotton, Rakesh Rathi said the trend may continue for another month.Bulk supply in the coming weeks may stabilise rates, but it is highly unlikely that cotton would see a sharp decline this season, he added.“Bangladesh and China, the international hub of the textile sector, are the major buyers of Indian thread and raw cotton. Since there has been a sharp increase in the global market since September 15 and the slow arrival of cotton crop in different states, farmers are getting handsome rates,” said Rathi.With 3.03 lakh hectares under area cotton this year, southern Punjab recorded an increase of 17% than 2020 when cotton was sown on 2.51 lakh hectares.But pink bollworm attack in Bathinda, Mansa and few pockets in Sangrur has left farmers worried about their major cash crop.Punjab Mandi Board cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said by October 6, a total of 2.74 lakh quintal cotton was purchased in centres of all seven districts of the region. By October 6 last year, Punjab mandis saw 1.29 lakh quintals of purchase. “For the first time, cotton rates have touched ₹7,700 per quintal. In 2011 the maximum rate of cotton was ₹7,000 and ₹6,725 in 2014. Mandis are recording daily average arrival of 25,000 quintals,” said Goel.Cotton Corporation of India assistant general manager and Punjab in-charge Neeraj Kumar said despite pink bollworm infestation, Punjab is likely to achieve last season’s production of 50 lakh quintals.“After an increase of 17% area under cotton this year, the CCI pegged Punjab’s production at 60-65 lakh quintals. Pest attack has hit several villages, but farmers are getting up to ₹1,800 more than MSP for their produce. The CCI is following its protocol of maintaining a watch on the market and the agency will entre if cotton rates are crashed and farmers get less than MSP,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cotton-prices-at-all-time-high-in-punjab-kharif-crop-fetching-rs-7-500-per-quintal-101633635306371.html

The iconic Gol Kothi was restored by the department after some parts turned into debris.A senior official said, “We have sent a proposal to the Punjab infrastructure development board for setting up a restaurant or a clubhouse under the public-private partnership mode on its premises because the location is suitable for the purpose.”He said, “We have conserved the basement and a part of the tunnel during the restoration with glasses.” Kapurthala deputy commissioner Deepti Uppal said the project had been completed. Spread over nine kanals and nine marlas, the building is being renovated under the ‘conservation and adaptive reuse of colonial heritage’ project at an estimated cost of ₹4.98 crore. The task of restoring the heritage building has been assigned to Rajputana Constructions Pvt Ltd, a Rajasthan-based company. The Darbar Hall and Buggy Khana will also be renovated under this project. The building was declared unsafe by the public works department (PWD) five years ago because it had fallen into a state of disrepair.Gol Kothi which stands opposite the official residence of the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Kapurthala, has a rich history. It was built by Raja Fateh Singh in 1833 and was once the residence of Mahamantris (prime ministers) of this erstwhile princely state. It is also believed that Maharaja Jagatjit Singh spent his formative years in the building in the 1880s. Skilled labour from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has been hired to repair the building.The official said a mixture of red brick dust, slaked lime and other materials known for their cementing properties are being used to strengthen it. The project has been divided into two parts — one is conservation and the second is adaptive reuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kapurthalas-iconic-gol-kothi-restored-to-have-restaurant-101633635064602.html

So far, the state has given 2.04 crore doses to eligible persons above 18 years of which 1.50 crore have been given the first dose whereas 54 lakh have been provided both doses. “Out of the total 2.06 crore target population that is eligible for the vaccine in the state, till date, nearly 72% have been given the first shot. Since there is an increase in supply from the Centre, we are confident about giving the first jab to the entire eligible population of the state by the end of this month,” said state’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. As per health department officials, in the past 10 days, Punjab has received 7.66 lakh doses of vaccine. Government officials claim the state is likely to get 50 lakh doses this month. The entire population of the state is likely to be fully vaccinated by the end of November, said former director PGIMR, Dr KK Talwar, who is the head of the expert group of the state government on tackling Covid-19. Out of the total doses given, 1.79 crore are Covishield doses whereas around 24 lakh are Covaxine. According to a few doctors involved in the vaccination, a sudden rush in demand is being witnessed in the rural areas of the state contrary to their earlier shyness for the vaccination. “As the elections are around the corner, sarpanches are asking for more doses in a bid to earn more points in front of voters. Villages which earlier had banned the entry of health staff giving jabs are now repeatedly asking to speed-up vaccination,” said a doctor posted in Sangrur. Health experts claim that there has not been any sign of the third wave in Punjab like most of the other parts of the country. “After analysing samples through genome sequencing, we don’t find any signal for the third wave. But we should not let our guards down. Though there is no sign of the revival of the virus, it’s nature has been unpredictable,” said Dr Talwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-adults-in-punjab-to-get-first-covid-jab-by-monthend-101633634947648.html
08-10-2021||Kolkata||Trinamool MP cautions his party as another TMC rebel returns from BJP||KOLKATA: Former Salt Lake mayor Sabyasachi Dutta on Thursday returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) nearly two years after he walked out to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prompting a prominent TMC leader to caution the party that letting leaders who jumped off the ship before the elections to return might not be such a good idea.“Our workers feel aggrieved when people who insulted Mamata Banerjee in the recent assembly polls come back. Isn’t it natural that sincere party workers will feel disappointed to see people returning to become leaders again after opposing us till the other day,” TMC’s senior Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said without naming Dutta or any other leader.Dutta’s homecoming on Thursday was a low-key affair compared to the return of the five turncoat legislators who have headed back to the TMC since June this year. The modest event was held at parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee’s chamber in the state assembly shortly after governor Jagdeep Dhankhar administered the oath of office to Mamata Banerjee and TMC leaders, Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam, as legislators. They won the polls held on September 30.But such events do offer the TMC an opportunity to take swipes at the BJP, which had projected the desertions from the Trinamool camp in the runup to the elections to indicate that the BJP was within striking distance of power. But Mamata Banerjee stunned her rivals with her party’s performance in the March-April assembly elections. Her party won 213 seats, the BJP just 77.“Let the BJP realise the effect of welcoming someone amid great hype and making him a state committee secretary,” said TMC’s Bengal general secretary Kunal Ghosh, a reference Sabyasachi Dutta who was appointed as BJP’s secretary.Ghosh continued to rub it in. “Did BJP think that it could win polls in Salt Lake? People who have realized that they have no existence outside the TMC and cannot survive without Mamata Banerjee are coming back. This will make everyone understand that TMC is the only force to reckon with. It has no alternative,” said Ghosh.Sabyasachi Dutta, who was earlier a lawmaker from Rajarhat-New Town constituency located east of Kolkata, could not be contacted for his comments.At Thursday’s event, Dutta acknowledged that his exit from the TMC was not a smart move.“I took an emotional decision and joined the BJP after some misunderstanding with my colleagues. I will earnestly serve the TMC in whatever role it gives me,” Dutta said after receiving the TMC flag from Chatterjee. Transport minister Firhad Hakim was also present.“This is homecoming for Sabyasachi,” said Chatterjee.Prepping for his return to the TMC, Dutta on Wednesday criticised his former boss, the Bengal BJP’s ex-president Dilip Ghosh for a comment on Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri killings.Bengal BJP vice president Jay Prakash Majumdar slammed Dutta for crossing over, describing him as an opportunist. “He probably came to the BJP looking for lucrative opportunities and found that our party does not allow its members to make a fortune,” said Majumdar.On September 4, BJP legislator from Kaliaganj in north Bengal Soumen Roy joined the TMC. There were others before him. Tanmay Ghosh, who won the Bishnupur seat in Bankura district, Biswajit Das, the lawmaker from Bagdah in North 24 Parganas district, and Mukul Roy, who was a BJP national vice-president and represents the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district, had earlier returned to the TMC.These defections have brought down the BJP’s tally in the 294-member assembly from 77 to 71.The BJP has sought their disqualification as legislators under anti-defection law as they have not resigned from the party.Krishna Kalyani, the BJP legislator from Raiganj in the North Dinajpur district of north Bengal announced on October 1 that he was leaving the party, triggering speculation that he may join the TMC. Kalyani, an industrialist who started his political career with the BJP in January this year, has been speaking against the party leadership for quite some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/trinamool-mp-cautions-his-party-as-another-tmc-rebel-returns-from-bjp-101633634824412.html

Before quizzing seers, who have come from various Hindu holy cities to attend ‘shodashi’ or the 16th day post-death rituals of Narendra Giri, the CBI officials had also questioned sewadars and seers at Baghambari Gaddi Math of which Narendra Giri was the Mahant (head priest). CBI officials said during their questioning none of the seers and sewadars alleged foul play behind Mahant’s death. Though Anand Giri alleged a conspiracy behind his Narendra Giri’s death, CBI, so far, has found no concrete clues which may indicate towards that. “The investigating agency may now question those who didn’t attend the ‘Shodashi’ and ‘pattabhishek’ ceremonies organised at the Baghambari Gaddi Math despite being invited. CBI has still not found any morphed video or photograph which had found mention in Mahant Narendra Giri’s purported suicide note. CBI has recovered the laptop and mobile of Anand Giri from his Haridwar ashram after taking him on seven days remand. Anand Giri’s lawyer Vijay Kumar Dwivedi who met him at the jail on Wednesday said that on Anand’s request a set of religious books including ‘Sundar Kaand’, Hanuman Chalisa had been provided to him. “Anand Giri has expressed faith in judiciary and said that conspiracy behind his guru’s death will soon be uncovered. He is ready for a narco test on the condition that all others who have been questioned by CBI should also undergo the same test. He has answered all questions of CBI officials with honesty and has hidden nothing related to the case,” Dwivedi informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-quizzes-saints-over-mahant-narendra-giri-s-death-101633634344382.html

It claims to have installed over 1 lakh street light points in the city. However, it was decided that the company will also install 15% additional lights in the city as per the contract to cover the areas with no streetlights, but nothing such has been done yet. Issues will be resolved at earliest: MayorDawar stated that the mayor had assured them that all issues will be resolved at the earliest.Mayor Sandhu said that directions have been issued to the concerned officials to speed up the development works and the department is already working to get the additional street lights installed by the contractor.Contractors burdenedWith MC claiming to have allotted development projects worth over ₹300 crore ahead of assembly elections, the contractors have been assigned more contracts than they can take on. This is also adding up to the delay in development projects as the contractors have limited resources, said Dawar, while adding that the authorities have been asked to find a solution for the problem.A few councillors also raised objections over allocation of a cabin to OSD to mayor, Parminder Mehta, in Zone B office of MC. They stated that Mehta is not even a councillor and he intervenes in their work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianamla-councillors-raise-concern-over-delayed-development-projects-missing-led-streetlights-101633634224451.html

After sharing information regarding the same on social media networks on Thursday, the chairman stated that the allegations levelled by the BJP leaders were baseless and defamatory.Terming the allegations as fake propaganda, the chairman said, “The e-auction was organised as per the norms and the reserve price was fixed by the committee led by the DC. Even though the local bodies department had cancelled the auction citing discrepancies in the statement issued by me and the DC regarding the reserve price, there is no proof of a scam. Baseless allegations were levelled by the opposition to gain political mileage.”“The BJP leaders and journalists defamed me by levelling baseless allegations, due to which I filed the criminal defamation suit. The petition was filed on August 28 and the documents including the news cutting, videos of these leaders etc. were submitted with the court on October 6. The next hearing is scheduled to be held on November 23,” he added.Meanwhile, Sidhu and Monga stated that the action was a tactic to suppress the voice of the public, who have highlighted the wrongdoings of the chairman and his political boss- a cabinet minister in the past. They stated that they have full faith in the judicial system.Sidhu said,” The land scam was unveiled after procurement of relevant documents and the DC also clarified that the reserve price was not fixed by the committee even when the chairman claimed that the price was fixed by the committee led by DC. We are not afraid of these tactics and will continue to unveil the frauds committed by the chairman in the past.”Monga reiterated the same and stated that the chairman filed the suit out of frustration after they highlighted the alleged scam.Earlier in August and September, BJP had raised an agitation against the alleged e-auction of prime land worth around ₹350 crore in Model Town Extension at throwaway price of around ₹98 crore.In September, the local bodies department had cancelled the e-auction of 3.79 acres of land in Model Town Extension. BJP stated that the auction was cancelled by the state department due to the alleged scam.Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra had, however, stated that the auction was cancelled as there was a difference in the statement of the DC and the LIT chairman regarding fixation of reserve prices for the said land. An inquiry was marked in the case.It was cancelled due to discrepancies, not allegations of any scam, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/eauction-of-prime-land-ludhiana-improvement-trust-chairman-files-criminal-defamation-suit-against-bjp-leaders-101633633804725.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad all set for a triangular contest||The Ellenabad byelection which is scheduled on October 30 is likely to see a triangular contest after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pitted Gobind Kanda, younger brother of Haryana Lok Hit’s lone MLA Gopal Kanda from Sirsa, and the Congress threw its weight behind BJP rebel Pawan Beniwal to take on Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala.Both BJP and Congress reposed faith on new faces and both their candidates had joined the respective parties a few days back. Gobind Kanda and Pawan Beniwal had unsuccessfully contested the assembly polls in 2014 and 2019 from Rania and Ellenabad seats on Haryana Lok Hit and BJP’s tickets, respectively.The Congress had played its cards on Pawan Beniwal while ignoring the potential of former Darba Kalan MLA Bharat Singh Beniwal, who too had unsuccessfully contested from the Ellenabad seat on Congress’s ticket in 2014 and 2019.Retired professor Anant Ram, of Bhiwani Government College, said Pawan Beniwal’s candidature is likely to upset his uncle and rival Bharat Singh Beniwal and all eyes are on him.“It is a tough task for the Congress to stop factionalism in the Ellenabad bypoll. Everyone knows how bitter rivals Pawan and Bharat Beniwal are and both of them have high political aspirations,” he added.The Jat-dominated assembly seat, Ellenabad, fell vacant after INLD’s lone legislator Abhay Singh Chautala resigned in support of farmers protesting against Centre’s three farm laws on January 27.He had defeated his nearest rival Pawan Beniwal of the BJP in October 2019 assembly polls by 12,000 votes.Abhay, who had shot to limelight after winning Sirsa’s Rori assembly seat in 2000, had secured victory from the Ellenabad seat in a bypoll in 2010. He had later won the same seat in 2014 and 2019 assembly polls.INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala is eyeing for a third bypoll win in his political career and fifth term as a legislator.This time, he will face his old lieutenant and now ace rival Pawan Beniwal and his childhood friend Gobind Kanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-all-set-for-a-triangular-contest-101633633684563.html

He had to leave the army in 2007 due to loss of vision. While serving in the army, he was posted at the border where he suffered an eye injury resulting in permanent loss of vision.Initially, he was found to be 75% visually handicapped as per his medico-legal examination carried out in June 2006 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.During his 22-year tenure with the army, he was awarded commendation medals from the army known as: 9 years medal, Special Service Medal 20 years medal and Operation Vijay Medal (Kargil War).He had applied for a government job in 2014 under the Haryana sports policy. But government kept dillydallying on his appointment and he was told to apply afresh in 2019 under the new policy notified in 2018, as per which he was declared overage. Following this, he had approached the HC in 2019.The court found that while he was denied job in 2014, one Rajesh Kumar, who had participated in the same event, was given employment.“...rejecting the candidature of one and accepting that of another, for the persons who are equally placed, does smack of an element of red-tapism, perhaps nepotism and most certainly discrimination,” the court said on government handling of the case.It also came to know during the proceedings that though his application was rejected terming him overage in 2014, it was never communicated to him and he got to know about the decision in 2019.The court found that he was eligible for appointment as per the prevalent policy of the government in 2013 as there was no upper age limit prescribed for giving appointments to the candidates.The court said there is another aspect of him being 70% disabled. He was entitled to special benefit of age relaxation as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-asks-haryana-to-give-government-job-to-kargil-war-solider-101633633514295.html

Baghel, on Wednesday, announced a financial assistance of ₹50 lakh each to families of four farmers and a journalist killed in the incident of violence in Lakhimpur Kheri following which Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Channi also made a similar announcement. On Wednesday, the Chhattisgarh’s BJP unit reacted to the announcement and termed it as “cheap politics” by Baghel. The BJP raised question over the farmers’ deaths due to suicides in Chhattisgarh and four tribals being killed in police firing in Silgar in Sukma district in May this year. “Lakhimpur tragedy was a heart wrenching incident. The way the son of a Union Minister of State Ajay Kumar Mishra allegedly crushed the farmers reflects the fascist mentality. This incident cannot be linked with other incidents,” Baghel said. He further said that BJP leaders of Chhattisgarh have not even condemned the Lakhimpur incident. “They talk of Silger incident. When did Raman Singh and his party leader went to meet (the affected people) after the Maoist incident during their 15 year rule. After the Silger incident, our party MLAs and leaders went and met people there. Has Raman Singh spoken to affected families in Silger… but I have spoken to them virtually and over phone. I called them here and asked them what they wanted. They said they will not take compensation,” Baghel said. The CM said he is not describing any incident as small but Lakhimpur violence should not be associated with other incidents. When asked about curfew imposed in Kawardha town following an incident of communal violence on Tuesday, Baghel said stern action will be taken against those who try to encourage such an incident. “Chhattisgarh is a peace-loving state and people belonging to different communities live here together in harmony. No one will tolerate such indeint and strict action will be taken against the people behind such incident,” Baghel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/lakhimpur-kheri-tragedy-should-not-be-linked-with-any-other-incident-bhupesh-baghel-101633633084403.html

I have repeatedly requested my teachers to provide the same, but they asked me to buy the subject guides.

He works hard to earn money. I don’t feel like putting pressure on him,” added Khushi.Another student, Ajay Pal Singh of Class 10, expressed the same concern.“My father works at an electronic shop.

At that time, we never knew we were at the top in the country. But after being praised by the PM our responsibility has increased. Now, we have to streamline them, like we tried in Charbagh. Soon, street vendors in Alambagh, Chowk, Aminabad, Nazirabad, Qaiserbagh will be streamlined.

The Pradhan Mantri Swanidhi Yojana came as a big relief for them.“Before March 24 this year, only 11,000 street vendors were registered with LMC. But now, the number of registrations has increased to 96,000 in Lucknow,” Dwivedi said.LMC had formed 55 teams to increase registration of street vendors and negotiate with various banks to provide them with loans.

On the occasion of Indian Air Force Day, Nair speaks with Shalaka Shinde.How did you navigate a fire of that enormity?Majority of our methods and instructions were coming from Coast Guard headquarters and Salvors, who are experts in handling such fires. The 16-member Salvors’ team had set course from Hong Kong on a tugboat, but by the time they reached, the fire was already under control. The Coast Guard is the only agency which is able to handle such disasters at sea. It is our job and we have the wherewithal for it. There were some Navy ships in the vicinity but they are not equipped to fight fires and explosions of such magnitude. There were a few challenges during the operations viz strong winds, rough sea, marginal weather and flying in international waters in a ‘single engine’ Chetak helicopter manoeuvering through thick smoke. At a given point of time there were at least six different type of aircraft from the Indian Coast guard, Indian Navy, Sri Lankan Air Force and Sri Lankan media operating in the same area. There were a lot of intricacies and protocols to be followed to maintain adequate separation and contact between the aircrafts and also continue with the fire fighting operations.Tell us about the operation.September 3, 7pm, we left Chennai port. Our plan was to reach the destination by 3pm-4pm the next day. With whatever speed we were able to get, we were not able to cover the distance. Also, the distressed vessel was drifting and shifting continuously. It was almost 50-60 miles from us the next day at 4pm. We were supposed to click pictures and videos and be the eyes for coastguard headquarters, hence, reaching the site the same day before sunset was very important. All pictures that were subsequently published by Indian media, were released by Coast Guard headquarter (CG HQ) and were clicked by my crew. The Chetak is a VFR aircraft and can only fly during daylight. Sunset was at about 5:45pm. After taking off, the first challenge was to search for the distressed vessel in the ocean. Searching for that vessel which had been continuously drifting from 50 miles away was like searching for a needle in a haystack.What was your assignment?Initially, we were to locate the vessel and click pictures for damage assessment and further necessary course of action as directed by the CG HQ. The sea was quite rough, there was heavy rainfall in the vessel’s vicinity and the winds were also very strong. Once we identified the general location of the vessel, the thick smoke emanating from the vessel made it easier to locate it. As we went closer, we could identify the other ships that were in the area. On a detailed assessment of the pictures, we could gauge the source of the fire to be the main engine room and pinpoint the exact seat of fire. We were aware that the cargo compartment where the crude oil is stored is protected by thick metal plates. So, our job was to ensure that the fire doesn’t breach those metal plates and we succeed in avoiding a major catastrophe. The ship was reported to be carrying 340,000 metric tonnes of crude oil. Coastal tourism and marine fishing are a huge source of income for Sri Lanka and any spillage could have seriously affected it. The oil spill on the surface ensures that the sunlight doesn’t penetrate the water killing the flora ,fauna and corals underneath. Meanwhile, the Maldives government had also voiced their concern to avoid any oil spill reaching their shores.At sea, what was the fire-fighting strategy?Dry chemical powder (DCP) was air dropped directly on the seat of fire. Foam along with sea water was continuously sprayed using external fire-fighting(EFF) devices from various Coastguard ships round the clock. As we were airborne and had a better field of view, our job was to direct the ships to point their EFF towards the exact seat of fire. Overall, a total of eight Indian Coastguard ships of different classes were involved in the fire fighting operations. We were able to douse the fire for a short while after about four days, but it soon reignited and the fire fighting efforts continued. Once the fire was finally visibly doused after a week, we resorted to boundary layer cooling to avoid re- ignition, which entails maintaining surface temperature of the ship by continuous pouring of water and foam. While the fire fighting effort continued the ship was continuously drifting towards the Sri Lankan shores and was being held 30 miles away by a tug boat.What security measures were you following for your own safety?Our helicopter was required to fly in close vicinity of the vessel through thick black smoke for continuous monitoring of the fire and damage assessment. We were very well aware that Sri Lanka was staring at grave threats if we did not succeed in controlling the fire and if there was any oil spill. Hence, personal safety was our least concern. We were quite optimistic that we will succeed in not only dousing the fire, but prevent any oil spill. We were very well briefed and prepared to take calculated risks.What are the lessons learned?The entire mission was flown on a very reliable, but very old platform, ‘The Chetak’ which has quite a few limitations. In the near future the Coastguard will have twin engine helicopters operating from its ships. Well-equipped indigenously made ALH - Dhruv are already being delivered to the Coastguard since June 2021.Tell us about your childhood.I have been born and brought up in Yamunanagar, Nigdi. I’ve done my schooling from St Ursula High School, Nigdi. I completed my junior college from Jai Hind Junior college, Pimpri. I graduated with a BSc in Physics from Fergusson College in April 2007. I joined the Air Force Academy at Hyderabad in July 2007 through the NCC direct entry. I have always been fascinated by airplanes and spent most of my NCC days building and flying radio-controlled model airplanes. I am a firm believer of destiny as I recall an incident wherein, I had applied for a job interview for the post of a ‘draftsman’ at Tata Motors and got selected. Later, the interviewer summoned my father and requested him to take me away and send me for higher education. My father who has been a fire fighter in the Dehu Ammunition Depot, told me this story after I had joined the Indian Air Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/how-iaf-squadron-leader-kept-lankan-coast-from-disaster-101633632244872.html

Today, Didi (West Bengal chief minister Banerjee) called me and asked me to come back home (TMC),” he told news agency ANI.Notably, Dutta was inducted into the ruling party of West Bengal in presence of state cabinet ministers Partha Chatterjee and Firhad Hakim in Kolkata. With this, Dutta joined a string of politicians, including former BJP MP Babul Supriyo, BJP MLAs Tanmoy Ghosh and Soumen Roy, among others, who have exited the saffron party for the TM.Soon after joining the TMC, Dutta told reporters that whatever he is and his achievements are all because of the “grace of Mamata Banerjee.”Dutta had joined the BJP prior to the 2019 Durga Puja, and had an unsuccessful bid to win the Bidhannagar constituency in the 2021 West Bengal Assembly elections as a saffron party candidate.The Banerjee-led TMC has also been conducting recruits from other opposition parties with Assam MP Sushmita Dev quitting the Congress and joining TMC in August. Following in her footsteps was yet another Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro, the former chief minister of Goa, who joined the TMC in Kolkata last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/joined-tmc-as-didi-asked-me-to-come-back-home-sabyasachi-dutta-on-leaving-bjp-101633630851278.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||With teachers out on Covid duty, Delhi’s public schools flag staff shortage||With the Class 10 and 12 board examinations scheduled for November and authorities likely to deliberate on reopening schools for students of classes 6 to 8 next week, principals and teachers across government schools in Delhi are concerned about the shortage of staff, with many still engaged in Covid-19 duties.Hundreds of Delhi government school teachers are currently working with district administrations in various capacities —at the airport, in vaccination centres at hospitals, as well as cracking down on Covid-norm violations across the city.Sant Ram, the district secretary of the government schoolteachers’ association in west Delhi-A, which has over 58 schools in the area, said institutions need even more teachers than usual to ensure Covid-19 protocol are followed inside school premises.“Due to Covid-19 protocols, classes have been split into two or three batches, which necessitates thrice the number of teachers. Instead of allocating more teachers, the sanctioned staff has been given other duties. We need staff to look over mid-day meal preparations or to ensure Covid-19 protocols on the premises. If we reopen schools for classes 6, 7 and 8, where there are more students than secondary and senior secondary classes, the shortage of teaching staff will create a problem,” he said.An education department official, however, said these considerations will be taken into account while the government decides to resume in-person lessons for more classes.“This is going to be one of the factors while deciding whether to reopen schools for classes 6 to 8, and it will not be overlooked. When the decision is taken to reopen the schools, it will be ensured that the teachers are back to schools from the Covid-19 duties,” said the official.Principals across several Delhi government schools echoed similar concerns.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of the government principals’ association, said, “We are in touch with several schools where 20% of the staff are engaged in Covid-19 duties. Principals have expressed concerns in helping students learn under the new exam pattern and address learning gaps. Due to the festive season, there are several holidays in the coming weeks, including an autumn break. Students’ preparations have been hit, even as the pre-board exams start from October 21. Without allowing teachers to join schools, it is not possible to reopen classes 6 to 8, especially when an increased number of students from private schools have been admitted this year.”In September, the Delhi government said the enrolment figures in government schools had reached 1.76 million for the 2021-22 session — a jump from 1.62 million from the 2020-21 session and 1.50 million in the pre-Covid academic year of 2019-20.Principals across government schools said that this was due to the migration of students from private schools under the non-planned admissions category which saw a sharp spike this year.Referring to an order released this week asking teachers to report back to school duties, Yadav said, “Teachers from classes 9 to 12 have been waiting for relieving letters from district administration to join schools. This will happen in a phased manner,” he said.On Tuesday, education director Udit Prakash Rai also issued directives asking all district and zonal deputy directors of education (DDEs) to ensure that teachers of classes 9 to 12 report back immediately “so that the students’ preparation with regards to pre-board/mid-term/projects and board examination is started immediately.” This came after the divisional commissioner issued a letter on September 3 asking district magistrates to deploy staff from other departments not teaching classes 9 to 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-teachers-still-out-on-covid-duty-delhi-s-public-schools-flag-staff-shortage-101633630387883.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||E-charging stations set up by Delhi’s south civic body to charge ₹10 per unit||Electric vehicles charging stations being set up by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will fix a fee of ₹10 per unit, officials aware of the matter said on Thursday.A senior municipal official from the remunerative projects cell said that in the first phase, three public sector undertaking companies and BSES are installing 109 charging stations, of which 35 will specifically cater to electric scooters. SDMC officials say the overall tariff will be kept lower than other parts of the city.The official said that of ₹10, the municipal body will take ₹1 for infrastructure and land, and the rest will be shared by the power distribution company and the installation agency. Standing committee chairman Col (retd) BK Oberoi said the policy aims to encourage people to buy electric vehicles by providing a large number of charging stations, and keeping the operating cost low. “We will complete the phase 1 of installation work within this year. The south corporation will also procure four electric mechanical road sweepers, the proposal for which will be tabled in the next standing committee meeting. We are also using electric cars for movement of senior officials,” he added.The Delhi government notified the Delhi EV policy last year which aims to ensure that 25% of all registered vehicles in Delhi by 2023 are electric vehicles. The policy is part of the Delhi government’s larger long-term action plan to fight air pollution in the city.In July, the Delhi government floated a tender to select vendors to set up charging stations for electric vehicles in spaces such as shopping malls, theatres, multiplexes, departmental stores, hospitals and residential areas. It was separate from tenders floated and work orders issued by the government to empanel vendors to set up 500 EV charging points across 100 public spaces locations – most of them located in bus depots and outside metro stations – in the city.Talking about the focus on providing exclusive charging stations for electric scooters, a senior SDMC official explained that the electric two wheelers take five units of power to charge fully in 15 minutes. “35 e-bike charging stations are being developed. With five units of charging, these two wheelers can cover 70-80 kms,” the official said.Within next one year, SDMC plans to develop 200 charging stations in two phases, and the north civic body has approved 50 charging stationsThe New Delhi Municipal Council was the first local body in Delhi to set up an e-charging station. An NDMC official said that they are operating e-charging stations with EESL (Energy Efficiency Services Limited) and a charging plaza has been developed on Rafi Marg. “The tarrifs being charged by EESL are divided in two categories. The charging rates for high-capacity vehicles is ₹26 per unit, and the rates for normal capacity vehicles is ₹9.5 per unit,” he added.Speaking at the EV forum organised by the Dialogue and Development Commission, a Delhi government’s think tank, in August, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the number of electric two-wheelers during August 2020-July 2021 doubled in the state from 1,013 units to 2,243, and the adoption of electric four-wheelers has grown by 20%, from 813 to 1,002 units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/echarging-stations-set-up-by-delhi-s-south-civic-body-to-charge-10-per-unit-101633630325619.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Many SDMC citizen service centres run only on paper, say RWAs||Nearly one year after the South Delhi Municipal Corporation cleared a proposal to set up a large number of Citizen Service Centres (CSCs) in municipal wards to provide access to digital services such as issuance of certificates and licenses, a large number of such facilities continue to exist only in papers. Local councillors have alleged that many CSCs in their area remain non-operational, and several RWAs added that no such units were there in their areas. The lack of such facilities has hit the citizens who do not have access to digital devices. The official website of the south corporation lists 1,441 citizen service centres where services like birth certificate and death certificate, updating birth certificate and filing of property tax returns have been operationalised. 477 centres are listed in the Central zone, 307 in Najafgarh zone, 338 in the South zone and 319 in the West zone. Last year, the civic agency signed an agreement with a company for setting up these services. The centres are expected to provide 13 more services such as veterinary licence, community hall booking, e-mutation of properties among others. CSCs can charge citizens Rs10-Rs100 for providing assistance in accessing these services under various categories.Atul Goel, president of URJA (United Residents Joint Action) --a collective body of RWAs, said the process of digitisation of services needs to be reviewed. “I have only seen one such centre. Overall, the new service portals developed by corporation are not performing well, and people end up paying cyber cafes or touts for accessing services. The quality of digital services can be gauged from the fact that corporation doesn’t provide any acknowledgement, and it will not inform applicants about faults in the rejected applications,” he added. Chetan Sharma, general secretary of the Confederation of NCR RWAs said that they are not aware of any such CSC centres operational in Greater Kailash area.Khanpur councillor Suresh Kumar Gupta said earlier people were able to get a certificate manually by paying ₹10. Now, they are forced to pay Rs500 to private cyber cafe operators for the same online service, he added. “80% of applications get rejected. We should open assistance counters in zonal offices to help people,” Gupta said. Other members of standing committee agreed that people are facing problems in accessing even basic services such as getting birth and death certificates. Standing committee chairman Col (retd) BK Oberoi acknowledged the problem and added that the project will be reviewed. “We agree that this problem exists. Many of these CSCs are not working. We will review their operations. If people are not doing their job after signing agreement with SDMC, they are either professionally not capable or not taking their work seriously. We can choose a new vendor if required,” Oberoi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/many-sdmc-citizen-service-centres-run-only-on-paper-say-rwas-101633630027364.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Durga Puja, Ramlila organisers in Delhi reel from bruising Covid punch||Durga Puja and Ramlila organisers in Delhi are battling a severe cash crunch, even as they prepare to set up festivities in sync with the state’s norms for celebrations, which were issued last week. To exacerbate matters, organisers said, the changes wrought by the advent of Covid-19 will leave the industry reeling for a few years at least, and are likely to leave an irreversible impact on public celebrations of two of the Capital’s biggest festivals. The changes, organisers said, could range from reduced sponsorships, to fewer people at the food stalls due to a heightened sense of hygiene, and an overall reduction in repeat visitors.Mrinal Kanti Biswas, general secretary of the Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella body of 38 Durga Puja committees in east Delhi, said sponsorships and donations have reduced by about 70%. “It will take at least two to three years to recover. Sponsorship for Durga Puja committees in Delhi used to come from small, medium and micro industries, which have been hit badly by the pandemic. Our dedicated sponsors have never been big companies or industries. So, funds are really tight. Before the pandemic, our budget to organise Durga Puja used to be at least ₹35 lakh. This year, we are doing it within ₹5-6 lakh, not just because it’s a low-key affair, but also because donations and sponsorship have dried up. Why will a company give us money if they are running into losses? Some of them have even closed down,” he said.Even donations have taken a major hit. Before Covid-19, individuals used to donate up to ₹20,000, which now has come down to a maximum of ₹5,000. “This trend is likely to continue for a few years, and even then we will only see an incremental increase. People have either lost their jobs or faced salary cuts, so there’s nothing that we can do about it,” said a member of Kali Bari puja committee. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) last week allowed Durga Puja celebrations this year but with several riders — organisers will have to ensure venues do not have visitors beyond the seating capacity, and there can be no stalls of any kind.Arjun Kumar, secretary of the Luv Kush Ramlila Committee, which organises the Ramlila on the Red Fort grounds, said such events may no longer be the same as, before people’s priorities have changed. “People have become more health conscious now. Many have either reduced or stopped eating street food and going to extremely crowded areas,” he said. Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate, said pandals used to be hubs for friendship and “adda”.“A majority of the Bengalis would come to the pandal on each day of the Pujo only for the adda. But people are now more comfortable within the confines of their homes. They have gotten used to it,” he said.Bose also said that the magnitude of celebrations will also be scaled down, due to a sharp drop in sponsorships. He said they are spending from the committee’s funds, since there have been no sponsorships.“There used to be cultural performances each day, all day long. All that may reduce as it entails a lot of prize money or sponsorship items,” he said. Ravi Jain of Shri Dharmik Leela Committee, recalled how Ramlilas, used to be a meeting point for families to fix marriages. “The families would meet and let the man and woman spend some time in the fair. This gradually changed and Ramlilas became an event where parents would bring their children to give them an insight about the story of Ram and Sita. Now, they just Google it. So, times will continue to change and we have to adapt to it. For instance, we are live-streaming our Ramlila now and the five-day affair has been reduced to just a day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/durga-puja-ramlila-organisers-in-delhi-reel-from-bruising-covid-punch-101633629725100.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Delay in land for compensatory plantation delays Akshardham-EPE highway project||The construction of a nearly 15km-long elevated corridor in the trans-Yamuna area, a part of national highway 709B between Akshardham (Delhi) and Saharanpur Bypass (Uttar Pradesh), is yet to start, despite the work having been awarded, as the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is yet to provide National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) with 15 hectare of land for compensatory plantation.NHAI has written to DDA to expedite the process. “The environment clearance for the project is stuck as DDA is yet to provide us land for compensatory plantation. From our end, the work is complete and we can start the construction within 15-20 days,” said a senior NHAI official aware of the development.In January 2019, Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone for the 31.3km-long corridor between Akshardham and Eastern peripheral Expressway (which includes the 15km-long stretch in Delhi). The corridor is an extension of the NHAI’s ongoing national highway 709B project that is aimed at providing seamless travel between Delhi and Saharanpur.The 14.7km-long elevated corridor will pass through some of the most densely populated areas in east and northeast Delhi, such as Geeta Colony, Shastri Park, Khajuri Khas, Karawal Nagar etc.NHAI officials said that the land-owning agency had provided them a 15 hectare of land in Delhi a few months ago. “But it turned out that the land was already in use for compensatory plantation by another agency. So, we wrote to DDA again for an alternate land parcel,” said the official.When contacted, DDA officials said, “There was an overlap due to some miscommunication. We are in the process of addressing the issue. The request will be processed soon.”The official added, “We are finding it difficult to meet the demand for land for compensatory plantation and afforestation. Delhi is largely urbanised and most of the areas identified as recreational green under the Master Plan have already been used either as parks or for plantation.”NHAI officials said that to carry out preparatory work for the project, they will have to make space for traffic diversions. “The corridor will be constructed on an extremely congested road. The piers of the elevated corridor will be constructed on the median so we will have to make space for traffic diversions. So, we need tree-cutting permission before we start any work on the ground,” said a senior NHAI official. The ₹2,388-crore project in Delhi has been marred by delays. Months after the project was announced in 2019, the road transport and highways ministry asked NHAI to reassess the financial viability of the project and explore options to bring down the cost. The direction came as the ministry was focusing on prioritising highway projects after evaluating them financially.After the evaluation, the total cost of the project was revised to ₹2,388 crore from the earlier estimate of ₹2,820, said an official. In February this year, the work was awarded.“Now that everything is ready, we hope we get the permission at the earliest,” said the NHAI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delay-in-land-for-compensatory-plantation-delays-akshardham-epe-highway-project-101633629664356.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||After Covid lull, Delhi tax collections pick up in 1st two quarters||The Delhi government has collected ₹9,560.52 crore in goods and services tax (GST) in the first two quarters of financial year 2021-22, compared to ₹5,712 crore for the corresponding period the previous fiscal -- an indication that trade and commercial activities are recovering in the national capital after remaining in a state of limbo due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Similarly, government data showed that the government collected ₹2,546.18 crore in value added tax (VAT) in the first two quarters of the current fiscal, against ₹1,532 crore collected between April and September in 2020-21.It is important to note that the collection of indirect taxes such as GST and VAT in a particular month essentially provides a reflection of the scale of trade and commerce activities in the month preceding it. Indirect taxes are those in which the tax burden is on the ultimate consumer of a product on which the tax is levied. While VAT is levied on automobile fuel and liquor, GST is levied on almost all products and services, ranging from groceries and medicines to garments and electronics.A closer look into the monthly collection figures of VAT and GST this financial year shows a direct correlation with the Covid-19 situation.According to government records that HT has seen, Delhi collected VAT of ₹417.01 crore and GST of ₹2,325.64 crorein April. In the month of April, the capital also witnessed its Covid-19 peak, which left the health-care system overwhelmed and forced the government to impose a lockdown from April 19. Therefore, in May, the VAT collection dropped to ₹358.17 croreand GST to ₹ 991.05 crore.For the whole month of May, Delhi was under lockdown, which reflected in the VAT and GST collections of June, with the tax figures further dropping to ₹207.35 crore and ₹968.4 crore, respectively.The government started implementing a phased relaxation of lockdown curbs from May 31 and markets in the city were allowed to open at 50% capacity from the first week of June and at full capacity from mid-June, even though working hours were truncated.These relaxations are reflected in the collections for July, which show a sharp rise. In July, the government collected VAT of around ₹440 croreand GST of ₹1,584.75 crore.Government records showed that the numbers have been going up steadily since then. In August, the government collectively recorded VAT and GST of ₹2,271.56 crore and in September, it further went up to ₹2,542.74 crore.“The numbers show clear signs of economic recovery. In Delhi, we have implemented a data-based enforcement system and a mechanism for internal assessment of finance through key performance indicators. These efforts have contributed to higher filing of tax returns and we also plugged gaps in the system,” said Ankur Garg, commissioner of trade and taxes department, Delhi government.For 2021-22, the Delhi budget tax revenue is ₹43,000 crore of which around ₹30,000 crore is supposed to come from GST and VAT. In 2020-21, Delhi’s budget GST and VAT collection was ₹30,000 crore but, during revision, it was later slashed by around 41% in light of the pandemic.In the first two quarters of 2019-20, Delhi’s VAT collection was ₹2,507 crore and GST was ₹9,150 crore, data showed,Between April 2020 and now, Delhi has witnessed four distinct waves of Covid-19, with the worst one in April 2021 which peaked at a weekly average of around 25,000 new cases a day and a daily positivity rate that often exceeded 30%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-covid-lull-delhi-tax-collections-pick-up-in-1st-two-quarters-101633629606202.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt launches anti-dust campaign to curb air pollution||The Delhi government on Thursday kick-started a month-long anti-dust campaign to ensure that pollution from construction sites is controlled ahead of winters.During an inspection at construction sites on Thursday, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the government will take strict action against agencies found violating the dust control guidelines. Rai also conducted a surprise inspection of the construction site at Pragati Maidan, and levied a fine of ₹5 lakh on the contractor for not adhering to dust control guidelines while constructing an underpass.“During an inspection, we found lots of dust at the site. The green net installed to control dust pollution was torn. There was no water in the tank of the anti-smog gun,” the minister said.Rai also said that a notice has been issued to the construction company, asking it to comply with the 14-point dust control guidelines issued by the Delhi government. If it fails to do so in two days, a fine of ₹5 lakh per day will be imposed, he said.According to a study by IIT-Kanpur in 2016, road dust contributes 56% of the overall pollution in the national capital.The Delhi government also launched a ‘dust pollution control self-assessment portal’ to further bolster the anti-dust campaign. Senior officials said that monitoring of sites will start from November 1, through the portal, till October 29. Thirty one teams have been tasked with on-ground investigation.Rai said that all agencies, both government and private, will have to mandatorily adhere to all anti-dust norms, adding “the Delhi government will not tolerate any laxity”.“The online portal that we have launched as part of the anti dust campaign will prove to be a historic step. Through this portal all the construction work going on in Delhi, whether it is a house or a project, it will be closely monitored. Training will start from next week to help people connect with the portal,” Rai said.Environment department officials said agencies including Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the three municipal corporations are already being trained to register and use the website.A senior nodal official from East Delhi Municipal Corporation said they were not aware of any order regarding mandatory registration of smaller construction sites with a government website.“We will enforce the dust control measures as stated in the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). Our Junior Engineers will make regular visits to the construction sites to ensure that green screens are used, construction material is not left uncovered and water is used to suppress dust,” the official said.The civic body issued an order on Wednesday that building plan approval may be cancelled if the owner of a property or developers fail to safely dispose of and transport the construction and demolition waste from their site to Shastri Park plant.The junior engineers (building department) have been asked to make fortnightly visits to the construction site in their area, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-anti-dust-campaign-to-curb-air-pollution-101633629484637.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||‘Need to come together to tackle pollution’: Delhi environment min Gopal Rai||The Delhi government has been working persistently throughout the year to prevent an air pollution emergency this winter, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said. In an interview, he added that the state government has not only come up with an action plan, but is also building resources to monitor pollution in real-time across the city so that containment measures are taken at the source. Excerpts: Delhi has come up with its own winter action plan against the annual winter pollution. Has there been any assessment to check, how effective it would be if implemented fully. It would be difficult, but we extensively studied the patterns over the past years, and considered them while making the 10-point winter action plan. We saw that besides the local sources of pollution such as vehicular emission, waste burning, dust etc, but during winters it is the external factors like stubble burning that aggravate the situation. Because of a common air shed, which spans up to 250km, the impact of pollution in the neighbouring areas is witnessed in Delhi too. We cannot sit idle.We are doing our best. Last year we were able to bring the pollution levels down, and we are constantly taking to experts on measures to further reduce pollution in the city. Through the winter action plan, we are planning to tackle both internal and external causes of pollution. We have launched India’s first war room to monitor pollution. From there, we will keep a close watch on how the stubble fires contribute in pollution load, and note which local sources are active. This will help us take timely action. You spoke about how Delhi does not have control over external pollution sources, but even within the city there is a multiplicity of agencies. For instance, the municipal agencies and the police do not report to the government. What is the plan to bring all the agencies together this season?Before coming up with the winter action plan, we held several meetings with all agencies, including municipal corporations and Delhi Traffic Police to sensitise them about the gravity of the situation. We also conducted several training sessions for all agencies so that they are better equipped to handle the emergency measures as the season progresses. The point is that we all have to come together, irrespective of our political ideologies, to tackle this problem. Because pollution impacts you as much as it impacts me or the next person. From an accountability point of view, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) will be assessing action being taken by each agency, and if any laxity is found, the pollution monitoring and control agency has the power to take action and even levy fines on them. You have made a detailed plan for winters, but there has been criticism that the government acts only when air quality becomes hazardous, instead of taking measures throughout the year. This is not true. Though we have been planning to avert the worst, we were taking up both long and short-term measures. However, we have intensified action because of the unique challenges during winters. The smog tower that was inaugurated recently, did not come up overnight. Work on setting up of our dedicated war room for pollution monitoring was also going on for the past six months. Apart from this, we have also worked on the e-vehicles policy, transplantation policy and plantation drives, which proves our government’s commitment towards resolving this problem. There have been mixed reactions to the ban on crackers. Some people have backed your decision, but some people have said that this could not be only solution.Diwali is traditionally a festival of lights, and that’s how the festival got its name. Firecracker bursting was something we picked up on the way. But we are not against the traditional practices. However, we cannot ignore ground realities. We need to understand that these are not regular circumstances. In a few months, pollution levels will spike, and people’s health will be at risk. We will have to choose if bursting crackers is important or the lives of our children and senior citizens. Last time, we had announced a ban but since it was a late decision, many cracker traders had already stocked up on green crackers. This time, to avoid any inconvenience to traders, and also to ensure that violations are kept in check, we announced the ban early. You had also requested the Centre to consider imposing a cracker ban on other states around Delhi. Did you get any response?Not yet. But the idea behind our request was that Delhi cannot implement a strict ban without the Centre’s support. Last year, we saw violations because people bought crackers from UP and Haryana. You have said repeatedly that environmental protection is a priority for your government. Over the years have you seen any change in the attitude of people and agencies in Delhi towards the issue of environment and pollution control? Definitely. We are seeing that every year people’s sensitivity towards the issue of air quality management is increasing. This year we launched our green war room and the Green App, and we have received over 27,000 complaints on it. Out of this, we have managed to resolve 23,000 complaints. We also managed to increase the number of pollution hotspots from 13 to 150 based on the complaints of waste burning and dumping, traffic jams etc we received from people last year. We are also going to launch a large scale ‘Jan Bhagidari’ campaign in a few weeks to ensure public participation in our fight against pollution. As I said, everyone needs to come together to tackle pollution in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-to-come-together-to-tackle-pollution-delhi-environment-min-gopal-rai-101633629307899.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: East civic body to hand over 15% parks to RWAs for maintenance||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to hand over around 15% of its parks to the local residents’ welfare association (RWA) for maintenance and upkeep. The civic body will compensate the RWAs at a rate of ₹2.14 per square metre per month. Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, the east corporation mayor, has given anticipatory approval to the policy, officials said on Thursday.Aggarwal said the scheme will be on a public-private partnership (PPP) model. “The EDMC has approximately 950 acres of parks and, under this scheme, about 135 acres will be handed over to RWAs in each area for maintenance. The EDMC will make quarterly payments to the RWA concerned on priority basis,” he said.The EDMC has 2,098 parks in Shahdara North and Shahdara South zones. The three municipal corporations together oversee 15,064 parks in the city with the south corporation alone managing the maximum number of parks at 6,812. There are more than 18,000 parks and gardens in Delhi spread over about 8,000 hectares. Several of them are looked after by central agencies and garden society.A senior EDMC official from the horticulture department said under the scheme, RWAs will be given the responsibility of maintaining the parks, appointing gardeners, irrigation, greenery and beautification of the park. “The compensation rate has been determined as per the central public works department manual for the maintenance of parks and the RWA concerned will be paid ₹2.14 per square metre per month. The rates will be increased when changes are made to the manual,” official said, asking not to be named.Aggarwal said if the RWA is not willing to do the maintenance work, then any NGO with three years of experience in this particular work in the zone concerned can also apply and a no objection certificate will be needed from the local RWA for the handover of the park to the NGO. “Officials of the horticulture department will inspect parks from time to time to ensure that proper maintenance is being done,” Aggarwal said. Similar PPP schemes are also run by the other two civic bodies and the Delhi parks and garden society but payment delays have often impacted park upkeep, EDMC officials said.BS Vohra, who heads the East Delhi RWA joint front, said the timelines for payments must be adhered to. “RWAs want to maintain and beautify their parks but payments should be timely and the quantum should be enough to sustain the parks on a no profit, no loss basis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-east-civic-body-to-hand-over-15-parks-to-rwas-for-maintenance-101633629305581.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 3 arrested in connection with stolen CCTV camera hard disks in Burari||Two men, who stole hard disks from CCTV cameras on roads, have been arrested, along with a third person who bought the stolen hard disks, Delhi Police said on Thursday. Police said the three were arrested in connection with a case registered in Burari regarding the theft of at least 17 CCTV cameras installed on the roads of north Delhi’s Burari.Police recovered three stolen hard disks of 4TB storage each and five DVR boxes from the three men. Deputy commissioner police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said that on September 22, CCTV cameras in the Burari area had stopped working. “Service engineers of the CCTV camera company confirmed that the hard disks of 17 cameras were missing. A case was then registered based on the complaint of the company’s area manager,” said DCP Kalsi. During investigation, police said, the investigating officers checked footage of at least 150 cameras in nearby areas. “On the footage, we saw the two persons involved in stealing the disks. They were also seen riding a motorcycle after stealing the hard disks. With technical help, a clearer photograph of the suspected persons was obtained and many photos were circulated on social media. Local informers were also deployed. With the help of local sources combined with technical support, the team conducted raids and succeeded in arresting the two accused persons Rajan Billa alias Sonu,42, and Pankaj Saini, 29. Police found one of the hard disks in their possession.Police said the two men confessed to have stolen the hard disks and selling them to their contact at the Lajpat Rai Market near Red Fort.“After questioning the two men, we conducted raids and arrested the third person, Chander Shekhar Chauhan, 41. He admitted his role in the present case. Two other hard disks were recovered from his possession. He also disclosed that he had sold the rest of the disks to unknown customers for ₹20,000,” said DCP Kalsi. Police said Billa has a history of being involved in burglary cases. Police have found his name registered in connection with at least 21 burglary cases across the city. His accomplice Pankaj too has at least two cases of burglaries and one of motor vehicle theft registered against him. Police are probing the criminal history of Chauhan. The two men told police that they stole the CCTV hard disks at night and sold them to Chauhan for about ₹1000-1500 each. Chauhan then sold them for ₹3000-4000 each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-arrested-in-connection-with-stolen-cctv-camera-hard-disks-in-burari-101633629244948.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Mark an emergency lane at Nehru Place: Delhi high court orders authorities||The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the authorities to earmark a lane for unhindered movement of fire engines and ambulances at Nehru Place, and sought a status report within 15 days containing suggestions and observations.The directions passed by a bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla came on hearing over poor safety measures in the busy market where a fire incident took place in August.The bench directed the Delhi Police, Delhi Development Authority and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to conduct an inspection within the next fortnight in the area and file the status report.The court itself initiated a plea after the August 12 fire incident. On Thursday, it said that only verified vendors will be allowed to squat in the area. “This court directs SDMC, DDA and Delhi Police to ensure that no other individual or entity other than 95 vendors, hawk in and around Nehru Place. Even the identities of the 95 vendors shall be verified and the respondents shall ensure that the vendors comply with the terms and conditions of Tehbazari/vending,” the bench said.While initiating the PIL, the court had said that the enormity of the problem caused by hawkers and vendors in the Nehru Place area is shown in the difficulty faced by the fire tenders in accessing the building where fire broke out due to a short circuilt.During the hearing, advocate Divya Prakash Pande, who was representing SDMC, told the court that despite the specific area being delineated for hawking, the vendors are not restricting themselves to the area. He further said that only 95 vendors have interim orders in their favour from the Supreme Court and the high court to operate from the area.Pande also told the court that the hawkers are not complying with the terms of Tehbazari/conditions of vending. He also stated that out of 95 street vendors who have injunction in their favour, 33 have filed petitions in the high court while 62 street vendors who are part of Manushi Sangathan have filed petitions before the Supreme Court.The Delhi Fire Service (DFS) told the court that it had conducted a mock drill in Nehru Place area and highlighted the challenges that emergency services face in the area.The fire services told the court that none of the vehicles (fire engine, ambulance) could reach the incident spot on August 12. It said that fire tenders could only reach up to the upper plaza, and lower plaza was not reachable for the vehicles.It also said that the time taken by the first fire unit was 11 minutes, and as the lower plaza was not approachable to fire units, pitching of rescue vehicles like hydraulic platforms was not possible.“The time taken by the various agencies was too much, which indicates that there are significant hindrances due to heavy pedestrian movement, heavy traffic, hawkers and parking problems,” the fire services said.The DFS recommended that all the entries to the upper plaza as well as lower plaza should be cleared of boom barriers, barricades, etc, adding that the market may be made a hawker-free zone. It also said that all levels in the market must be made approachable to fire engines by making a minimum six-metre wide motorable road/ramps.Taking note, the court said that the issue is “serious” and asked the authorities to take necessary steps.“DCP (Traffic) will ensure that the said lane (emergency vehicles lane) is not encroached upon, and is always free for movement for fire brigade and ambulance,” the court said.The matter will now be heard on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mark-an-emergency-lane-at-nehru-place-delhi-high-court-orders-authorities-101633629064204.html
08-10-2021||Delhi||Kerala students row: DU says academic merits of all valued equally||The Delhi University on Thursday rejected assertions that students from a particular state board were being favoured in admissions to the undergraduate admissions, saying that the university equally values the academic credentials of all students.In a press statement released on Thursday, DU Registrar Vikas Gupta said, “The University of Delhi strongly refutes and condemns the falsity of news which is being circulated regarding favouring candidates from a few boards.”The university statement comes a day after the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) on Wednesday alleged that top scorers from the Kerala state board were being denied admission on flimsy grounds by various Delhi University colleges in a controversy that erupted amid condemnation of a physics professor from Kirori Mal College who coined a communally sensitive and derogatory term -- “marks jihad” -- to contend that students from the state were being given higher marks in Class 12 so that they could systematically take over the country’s top higher education institutes.In the statement, the Registrar said, “DU equally and uniformly values the academic credentials of all the candidates irrespective of their States and School Boards. This year too, equal opportunity was maintained by accepting applications based on the merit only.”The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-linked SFI, in a statement on Wednesday, said that DU must “stop discriminating against” students from Kerala state board.“It has come to our attention that certain colleges are rejecting applications without stating any substantial reason or withholding applications arbitrarily stating ‘clarifications to be sought from the university’. DU is bound to admit students satisfying all the eligibility criteria, it is a matter of shame that applicants are being discriminated against based on their board,” second-year law student Akhil KM, who is convener at SFI-DU, wrote in the statement.According to admissions committee members of several colleges, students from the Kerala state board had mark sheets under two names– Board of Higher Secondary Examination and Directorate of Higher Secondary Education. The list of approved boards only had the former’s name, leading to confusion. The university officials later found out that both the boards were eligible for admission.Till Thursday evening, DU received 60,904 applications, from which 27,006 candidates completed the formalities by paying the fees. The numbers are expected to increase by Friday as applications of 14,205 candidates have been approved by principals of various colleges, and the students were yet to pay the fee.The Registrar also said that of 60,904 applications received under the first cut-off, 46,054 were from the CBSE board, and the rest from all other boards across the country. “By the end of October 7, 2021, 31,172 candidates from CBSE board, 2,365 from Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education, 1,540 from Board of School Education Haryana, 1,429 from Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations and 1,301 from Board of Secondary Education Rajasthan in addition to other State Boards have successfully secured their admissions,” Gupta said in the statement.Last week, eight DU colleges announced a 100% cut-off in 11 undergraduate courses due to an increased number of top-scorers this year.The DU will announce the second cut-off list on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kerala-students-row-du-says-academic-merits-of-all-valued-equally-101633628824194.html
08-10-2021||Mumbai||ED’s intentions behind summons questionable: Anil Deshmukh to Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC), while hearing the petition filed by former home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking quashing of the proceedings arising out of the summons being issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), was informed on Thursday that the actions of the ED created apprehension in his mind on their intentions, as they neither provided him with the list of documents they sought from him nor waited for the outcome of the petition filed by him before the Supreme Court while issuing a third summon on August 2. Deshmukh’s counsel argued that as the central agency refused to share the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) or the list of documents they wanted from him showed that they wanted to play the game of ‘Heads I Win, Tails you Lose’ which was prejudicial to his interests and hence sought to quash of the proceedings arising out of the summons. The ED has filed an ECIR against Deshmukh in connection with the April 21 Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) first information report (FIR) which has accused Deshmukh of being involved in corruption and money laundering. The ED has been issuing summons to Deshmukh since June 25.The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal while hearing the petition was informed by additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi for the ED that the petition was not maintainable as Deshmukh had sought similar reliefs in his petition in the Supreme Court.However, senior advocate Vikram Choudhary for Deshmukh submitted that the petition could be heard and decided by the HC. The court accepted the same but asked Choudhary to stick to the merits of the matter only.While making submissions, Choudhary informed the bench that the ED had conducted a raid at his client’s house and he had cooperated and his statement was also recorded thereafter by the ED officials. After that ED had issued him a summons and asked him to appear at the ED office to which he responded and had said that an authorised representative would appear which was accepted.Choudhary submitted that after the authorised representative had appeared, the ED issued him a second summon, to which he sought a list of documents required from him and also requested a video conferencing appearance. Deshmukh also informed the ED officers that he was approaching the SC. After hearing the petition SC had said it would pass orders on August 3, however, ED issued a third summons on August 2 without responding to Deshmukh’s request and only asked him to appear before it.Choudhary submitted that this created apprehension in Deshmukh’s mind as the ED had similarly called two persons attached to him and when they had reached the ED office they were arrested. Choudhary argued that ED was playing the ‘Heads I win, Tails you Lose’ game with Deshmukh and hence he was seeking quashing of the proceedings arising out of the summons.Choudhary, however, reiterated that his client was willing to cooperate with the agency but was apprehensive of their intentions, hence sought interim protection.Lekhi, however, interjected and submitted that Deshmukh could not dictate the way in which the agency carried out its investigation by asking for appearance through video conference.Due to paucity of time, the bench adjourned the hearing to Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eds-intentions-behind-summons-questionable-anil-deshmukh-to-bombay-high-court-101633621263849.html

BJP MP Saini has refuted the allegations and said in fact, his driver was attacked by the farmers. Cross-complaints have been filed by both the parties, police said.The lawmaker was in Naraingarh to attend a social event organised by a local Saini Sabha, where Haryana sports minister Sandeep Singh was also invited but was said to be busy in Ellenabad. Instead, state transport minister Moolchand Sharma was the chief guest at the event to honour corona-warriors.Farmers alleged that a protester was hit by a Toyota Innova in the convoy when Saini was leaving the event, fearing their protest. Protesters demand police actionMalkit Singh, the district president of the Gurnam Singh Charuni-led Bharatiya Kisan Union faction, said: “A serious accident was averted. Farmer Bawan Preet Singh of Yamunanagar received minor injuries on a leg and was not taken to any hospital.”“Saini left the venue before we could reach. He was not in the vehicle that hit the farmer. We’ve submitted a complaint to the Naraingarh DSP for action, otherwise we’ll gherao the police station on October 10,” Malkit Singh said.However, Singh, along with other farm leaders, asserted that a video of the incident is not available and they are trying to arrange it.In the complaint, the injured farmer has alleged that Innova driver Rajiv Kumar tried to run him over with the intention of murder and he sustained injuries after he was kicked away. “He told us that if we protest again in Naraingarh, he’ll turn it into another Lakhimpur Kheri, as instructed by the MP,” the complaint reads.My driver was attacked: SainiHitting back at the farmers, the MP has alleged that no farmer was hit, instead, his driver was attacked by the protestors and he has filed a police complaint.“I, along with the transport minister, was leading the convoy in my car, followed by an escort and an Innova that was left behind. Farmers followed it thinking that I’m at the back seat and instead attacked my driver, who was rescued by my staff,” he told HT.He added, “Farm unions are most active on social media nowadays and they should release the videos. We have a few of the incident and are arranging more.”The MP assured of sending the complaint’s copy and videos through his staff, but it was not received till the filing of this report.SSP Hamid Akhtar remained unavailable for a comment, while Dhoom Singh, station in-charge, Naraingarh police station said, “We have received both the complaints. No FIR has been lodged and the matter is under investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vehicle-in-haryana-bjp-mp-s-convoy-hits-farmer-in-ambala-district-101633606083146.html
08-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana byelection: Gobind Kanda is BJP’s nominee for Ellenabad contest||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced the candidature of Gobind Kanda for the October 30 Ellenabad byelections in Haryana. Kanda, who is the elder brother of Gopal Kanda, the lone MLA of the Haryana Lokhit Party, joined the BJP in Sirsa last week. His father, the late Murlidhar Kanda, was an advocate and an RSS worker. Sirsa MLA Gopal Kanda has been supporting the BJP in the 90-member Haryana Vidhan Sabha. The 54-year-old Kanda filed his nomination papers on Thursday in the presence of party’s state chief OP Dhankar, bypoll in-charge Subash Barala, state sports minister Sandeep Singh, state power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala, JJP’s state chief Nishan Singh and others.Gobind faced protest from farmers while filing his nomination and it might be a tough task for him and other BJP-JJP leaders to campaign in Haryana villages as farmers are boycotting their entry.The nomination filing exercise ends on October 8. The nominations will be scrutinised on October 11 and the last date of withdrawing it is October 16.Gobind Kanda, 54, had unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections in 2014 and 2019 from Rania segment in Sirsa district, and will be the joint nominee of the ruling BJP and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP). Keenly contested election The Ellenabad slugfest will be keenly contested. The challenge before the ruling BJP-JJP combine is how to reach out to the electorate in view of the farm agitation and the cultivators not allowing its leaders to move freely in the state to hold public meetings or government functions. The Jat-dominated assembly seat in Sirsa district had fallen vacant after Abhay Singh Chautala, the lone MLA of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), resigned in January from the assembly in protest against the Centre’s three farm laws. The INLD has again fielded Abhay Chautala, who during the October 2019 Haryana assembly elections won the seat by 12,000 votes as he got 57,055 votes of 1,49,947 valid votes polled. His nearest rival in the fray BJP’s Pawan Beniwal polled 45,133 votes and Congress’ Bharat Singh Beniwal had got 35,383 votes. The BJP had to look for a new candidate as its nominee in the October 2019 assembly elections, Pawan Beniwal, has deserted the party to support the ongoing farmers’ agitation and joined the Congress recently. The Haryana Congress is yet to announce its candidate for the byelection.

The Kremlin critic narrowly survived a nerve-agent attack in Siberia last year that he and Western governments blamed on Russian secret services. Russia denied any role in his poisoning.The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, in August accused Bellingcat of being staffed by former foreign secret service agents.The designation of Bellingcat came on the same day that Dmitry Muratov, one of the founders of independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, won the Nobel Peace Prize together with a journalist from the Philippines.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/investigative-outlet-bellingcat-labelled-foreign-agent-by-russia-101633714845255.html

The committee had said that the margin of benefit against risk is “too small” to advise on a universal programme of vaccination for healthy 12 to 15-year-old children.While the United States has continued to administer the Pfizer vaccine to adolescents, it had issued a warning to watch for the symptoms of myocarditis, the rare inflammatory heart condition.In July, European Medicines Agency said that it had found a possible link between myocarditis and mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have developed mRNA-based vaccines which are being used in the United States on a massive scale to vaccinate the population.Here are some of the steps some countries are taking:United KingdomBritain has opted for a cautionary approach in administering mRNA-based vaccines by offering only the first shot Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The second dose of the two-dose regimen will not be offered until at least spring when there may be more data on the cases.SwedenCiting an unpublished Nordic study, Sweden has decided to halt the use of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine for younger groups. The Swedish health agency said it would pause using Moderna's Covid shot for people born in 1991 and later.NorwayThe Scandinavian country has been offering only one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to children aged 12-15.DenmarkThe Danish Health Agency has clarified that the statement suggesting suspension of Moderna's vaccine use was in fact a miscommunication. Denmark on Friday said that it was continuing the use of mRNA-based vaccine among under-18s.FinlandData from some studies have suggested that reported cases of rare heart inflammation were higher after receiving Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech shots. Finland has halted the use of the Moderna vaccine to men born in 1991 and later and instead offer Pfizer's vaccine.Hong KongAn advisory panel to the Hong Kong government has recommended that children aged 12-17 should get only one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heart-inflammation-risk-from-pfizer-moderna-shots-here-s-how-countries-are-responding-101633702972813.html

The total bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan for 2019-20 was at $ 1.5 billion.India also helped operationalise the Chabahar Port in 2017 and also established the India- Afghanistan Foundation (IAF) in the same year which enhances economic, scientific, educational, technical as well as cultural cooperation between the two countries.Jaishankar said that based on what India has done for the people of Afghanistan they are in a better position to understand who has been a better friend. “The differences are obvious,” Jaishankar said.Jaishankar also criticised Pakistan and said that every nation wants to have a good relationship with its neighbours but in a manner that respects the rules-based international order. “Everybody wants to be friends with their neighbours. But you want to be friends on terms which a civilised world will accept. Terrorism is not one of those terms,” Jaishankar said.He said that Pakistan uses terrorism as an instrument of statecraft which is unacceptable. He also said that neighbours exist to foster connectivity, trade, bilateral cooperation and growth. “Nothing like this has happened with this neighbour,” he further added.‘Multipolar Asia’The external affairs ministers said that a multipolar world cannot exist without a multipolar Asia, in an apparent reference to the race between India and China to become the world’s largest superpower. “In the next 75 years, India and China will be among the premier powers in the world.Jaishankar said that both nations should give each other space and mutual respect should remain between both nations. “It is important that there is mutual respect between both nations and they give each other space. I’ve spoken earlier about a multipolar world. I think it's very important we have a multipolar Asia. You're not gonna have a multipolar world if you don't have a multipolar Asia,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-know-who-were-better-friends-jaishankar-slams-pak-for-aiding-terror-101633704473853.html

What do we know about the blast so far||An explosion at a Shiite mosque in Afghanistan's Kunduz city has left at least 100 people killed or wounded, The Associated Press reported citing a Taliban police official. Dost Mohammad Obaida, the deputy police chief for Kunduz province, told AP that the “majority of them have been killed” in the blast, which the Taliban government has deemed as a suicide attack.If the death toll from the latest suicide attack is confirmed, it would be the highest since the US and NATO troops completely pulled out from the war-torn country.Citing initial findings, Matiullah Rohani, director of culture and information in Kunduz, has said that the explosion in the Shiite mosque was a suicide attack, reported news agency AFP. While no group yet has claimed responsibility for the attack, the Islamic State has a long history of targeting Shiite Muslims and has claimed similar recent atrocities.ISIS Khorasan was behind the suicide blast outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport which killed dozens of civilians and 13 US Marines in the final days of US troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan.The blast occurred at the Gozar-e-Sayed Abad Mosque during a Friday noon prayer service, the highlight of the Muslim religious week when the mosques are typically crowded. Photos and videos from the scene showed the stairs at the entrance of the mosque was covered in blood as rescuers were trying to carry a body to the ambulance. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had initially said that an unknown number of “Shiite compatriots” were killed or injured.ISIS-K is made of hardline Sunni Islamist militants, just like the Taliban, but the two groups are sworn enemies. ISIS-K has been involved in some of the deadliest terror attacks in recent years. The leaders of ISIS-K rejected the deal between the Taliban and the US that has led to the withdrawal of foreign troops. According to a UN report, the strength of ISIS-K could be anywhere between 500 to 10,000.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-attack-in-afghanistan-mosque-what-do-we-know-about-the-blast-so-far-101633701106510.html

A number of sailors on board the USS Connecticut were injured in the accident. None of the injuries were life-threatening, a statement from the US Pacific Fleet said on Thursday.It's unclear what the Seawolf-class submarine may have hit while it was submerged."The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition. USS Connecticut's nuclear propulsion plant and spaces were not affected and remain fully operational," the US Navy statement said.Asked for his reaction, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that “China is severely concerned about this accident”.“The US as the side involved in this incident should inform the relevant details including the location, purpose of this navigation, details of the accident and what did the submarine run into and whether any nuclear leakage has taken place and whether local maritime environment was harmed”, he said.He also said that the US' assertion to conduct air and naval sorties in the name of freedom of navigation was the cause for this incident.“I also want to emphasise that for some time the US side has been acting, making waves in the SCS under the banner freedom of navigation. This is the source of this accident, severely threatening and imposing serious risks to the regional peace and stability”, he said.“The US has been delaying uncovering the details of this accident. It is acting without any transparency and responsibility,” he said.Zhao said that China and the relevant countries in the SCS have to doubt the facts and the US intention.China claims most of the SCS. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims over the area. Over the years, China has built a number of military installations in the reclaimed islands in the SCS and deployed a big fleet of its naval ships and submarines.Citing the incident, China also said that the US' move to sell nuclear subs to Australia under AUKUS will increase nuclear risks in the region.“This incident has shown that the sales of the nuclear submarine through AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) to Australia will lead to dissemination of nuclear technology and materials and intensify regional security risks,” he said.This would increase the possibility of nuclear risks in the region.“Relevant countries should abandon the outdated cold war mentality and narrow minded geopolitical vision and stop such wrong acts that will destroy the regional peace and stability as well as development,” he said.China also asked the US to sever defence and official ties with Taiwan while reacting to reports that US troops were training Taiwanese troops.He also asked the US to sever military and official ties with Taiwan, while reacting to reports that a small number of US special operations forces were deployed in Taiwan on rotational basis to train Taiwanese forces.Reports quoted a Pentagon spokesman John Supple as highlighting that the US support for defence relationship with Taiwan “remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China."China views Taiwan as a breakaway province. However, democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state. Beijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification with Taiwan.The One China principle which emphasises that Taiwan is part of China is the political foundation for China-US ties, Zhao said.“The US must sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan and abrogate its mutual defence treaty with Taiwan and must withdraw” from the estranged island, he said.The US should only stick to the commitments to maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan, he said, adding that China is firm in defending its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.Tensions flared up between China and Taiwan as the Chinese military since October 1 flew a record 150 air force jets into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the weeklong holidays to celebrate China’s National Day.The issue figured in Wednesday's talks between top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Zurich during which the two sides have agreed to improve the strained ties.The intensity of China’s air raids prompted US President Joe Biden to remind his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that they have agreed to abide by the “Taiwan agreement” during their telephone talks last month."I've spoken with Xi about Taiwan. We agree ... we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement. We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement," Biden had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demands-answers-as-us-nuclear-submarine-suffers-damage-in-south-china-sea-101633699423928.html

The talk focused on the recognition of the Taliban government in Kabul, international sanctions on Afghanistan, access to Afghanistan and counter-terrorism cooperation, it was reported,The US outlined to Pakistan that it wants the nation to ensure that the Taliban uphold its pledges made during the takeover of government in the war-torn nation. The US wants Pakistan to make sure that the Taliban respect inclusive governance, human rights, education for girls and allow women to work. It stressed that Pakistan should continue making efforts to soften the Taliban stance regarding these issues.The Taliban have disallowed women from working in government offices and have not accommodated any woman minister in its Cabinet.During the meeting with Qureshi, both Pakistan and the US agreed to work together for peace in Afghanistan. “We look forward to continuing to address pressing regional and global challenges,” Sherman said after meeting with Qureshi. Her meeting comes days after Qureshi met US secretary of state Antony Blinken.Sherman met Pakistan NSA Yusuf to also discuss the areas of cooperation in the US-Pakistan relationship as well as the Afghanistan situation. Moeed reiterated that the global community must not isolate Afghanistan and maintain contact with the interim government.Sherman earlier visited New Delhi and held discussions with the Indian government regarding peace and stability in Afghanistan as well as the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-taliban-us-outlines-objectives-for-pakistan-101633695941016.html

Peace and tranquility in these areas of differing perceptions has been possible by adherence to existing agreements and protocols between the two countries,” an official told the Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet opposing New Delhi’s consistent stand that the northeastern state is an integral and inalienable part of India.India and China are locked in an ongoing 17-month long military standoff along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged Sino-India bilateral ties to the worst chill in decades.Several rounds of diplomatic and military dialogues have failed to resolve the dragging impasse between the two militaries.The latest incident comes days ahead of the next round of military talks with the PLA, which is scheduled to take place on October 12, as per reports from New Delhi.Speaking at a virtual India-China track-II dialogue in September, India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, had urged China to separate the ongoing border tension in eastern Ladakh from the larger boundary dispute, saying the primary concern now is to restore peace and tranquility along the LAC and not resolving the decades-long boundary disagreement.Misri said day-to-day affairs along the disputed border should be addressed through existing established agreements and protocols, which are not to be confused with the long-term mechanisms in place for the final resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-aware-china-on-reports-of-its-soldiers-detention-in-arunachal-pradesh-101633691888935.html
08-10-2021||World||At least 50 dead in Afghanistan's Kunduz mosque blast||An apparent bomb attack on worshippers at a Shiite mosque in the Afghan city of Kunduz killed at least 50 people Friday, in the bloodiest assault since US forces left the country.Scores more victims from the minority community were wounded in the blast, which has not been claimed but appears designed to further destabilise Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban takeover.A medical source at the Kunduz Provincial Hospital said that 35 dead and more than 50 wounded had been taken there, while a worker at a Doctors Without Borders hospital reported 15 dead and scores more wounded.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had earlier said an unknown number of people had been killed and injured when "an explosion took place in a mosque of our Shiite compatriots" in Kunduz.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Islamic State group, arch-rival of the Taliban, has claimed similar recent atrocities.Residents of Kunduz, the capital of a province of the same name, told AFP the blast hit a Shiite mosque during Friday prayers, the most important of the week for Muslims.Zalmai Alokzai, a local businessman who rushed to Kunduz Provincial Hospital to check whether doctors needed blood donations, described horrific scenes."Ambulances were going back to the incident scene to carry the dead," he said.An international aid worker at the MSF hospital in the city told AFP there were fears the death toll could rise."Hundreds of people are gathered at the main gate of the hospital and crying for their relatives but armed Taliban guys are trying to prevent gatherings in case another explosion is planned," he said.Frightened crowdsGraphic images shared on social media, which could not immediately be verified, showed several bloodied bodies lying on the floor. Pictures showed plumes of smoke rising into the air over Kunduz.Another video showed men shepherding people, including women and children, away from the scene. Frightened crowds thronged the streets.Aminullah, an eyewitness whose brother was at the mosque, told AFP: "After I heard the explosion, I called my brother but he did not pick up."I walked towards the mosque and found my brother wounded and faint. We immediately took him to the MSF hospital."A female teacher in Kunduz told AFP the blast happened near her house, and several of her neighbours were killed. "It was a very terrifying incident," she said."Many of our neighbours have been killed and wounded. "A 16-year-old neighbour was killed. They couldn't find half of his body. Another neighbour who was 24 was killed as well."Kunduz's location makes it a key transit point for economic and trade exchanges with Tajikistan.It was the scene of fierce battles as the Taliban fought their way back into power this year.Often targeted by Sunni extremists, Shiite Muslims have suffered some of Afghanistan's most violent assaults, with rallies bombed, hospitals targeted and commuters ambushed.Persecuted communityShiites make up roughly 20 percent of the Afghan population. Many of them are Hazara, an ethnic group that has been heavily persecuted in Afghanistan for decades.In October 2017, a lone IS suicide attacker struck a Shiite mosque as worshippers gathered for evening prayers in the west of Kabul, killing 56 people and wounding 55 including women and children.And in May this year, a series of bombings outside a school in the capital killed at least 85 people -- mostly young girls. More than 300 were wounded in this attack on the Hazara community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-multiple-causalities-as-explosion-targets-mosque-in-kunduz-city-101633690667794.html

They will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine instead. The government agency said it found that young men and boys were at a slightly higher risk of developing myocarditis.The move by Finland followed similar decisions by three neighboring countries on Wednesday. Sweden suspended the use of Moderna for people under 30, Denmark said those under 18 won't be offered the Swiss-made vaccine, and Norway urged those under 30 to get the Pfizer vaccine instead.All four countries based their decision on an unpublished study with Sweden's Public Health Agency saying that it signals “an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle or the pericardium” — the double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the main vessels. It added: “The risk of being affected is very small.”The preliminary information from the Nordic study has been sent to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction committee to be assessed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-backs-sweden-other-nations-against-moderna-s-covid-19-shots-101633687969740.html

08-10-2021||World||Journalists Maria Ressa, Dmitry Muratov awarded 2021 Nobel Peace Prize||Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize “for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression", which the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a “precondition for democracy and lasting peace.” Announcing the name of the peace prize laureates, Norwegian Nobel Committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen said that Ressa uses freedom of expression to expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in the Philippines, her native country. In 2012, Ressa co-founded Rappler, a digital media company for investigative journalism. Ressa has focussed on Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's controversial “war on drug” campaign that has claimed thousands of lives. Human rights organisations have claimed the Philippines' police are falsifying evidence to justify the unlawful killings. Ressa and her digital media company have also documented the spread of fake news, harassing opponents and manipulation of public discourse using social media.Russian journalist Dmitry Andreyevich Muratov co-founded the newspaper Novaja Gazeta, which, according to the committee, is the most independent newspaper in the country today. The committee said that Murato has for decades defended freedom of speech in  Russia under “increasingly challenging conditions.”The Russian newspaper has been publishing critical articles questioning the abuse of power, corruption, electoral fraud and “troll factories”. Novaja Gazeta's journalists have faced harassment, threats, and violence from its opponents and six of its journalists have been killed so far, including Anna Politkovskaja who wrote “revealing articles” on the war in Chechnya.“Despite the killings and threats, editor-in-chief Muratov has refused to abandon the newspaper’s independent policy,” the committee said.The committee stressed that free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda. It further stated that freedom of expression and freedom of information are crucial prerequisites for democracy and protection against war and conflict.“The award of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov is intended to underscore the importance of protecting and defending these fundamental rights,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-maria-ressa-dmitry-muratov-awarded-2021-nobel-peace-prize-101633682118858.html
08-10-2021||World||Greta Thunberg to Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: Here are the Nobel Peace Prize 2021 favourites||The Nobel Institute will announce the much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize 2021 in the Norweigan capital of Oslo on Friday, and a host of names – from climate campaigner Greta Thunberg to Belarus opposition leaders, and even media watchdogs are among those who have been tipped for the prestigious prize. It is, however, a giant guessing game as the institute is not known to publish a shortlist unlike some of the other Nobel recognitions. The Nobel Peace Prize this year will be announced at 0900 GMT (around 2:30pm Indian time) when the wooden doors of the Nobel Institute's main hall creak open to make way for Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who will announce the winner.The Nobel committee received as many as 329 nominations this year, and it will have the tough task to choose who is deemed most worthy of the prestigious honour in 2021. Among those whose names have been generating the most buzz this year are –> Media watchdogs: Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or the International Fact-Checking Network> Anti-corruption watchdog: Transparency International> Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and her two allies, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo> Ales Bialiatski, another opponent of Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko, who is widely regarded as authoritarian and his claim to power in the August 2020 elections fraudulent> Climate change activists such as Greta Thunberg, who was 2019's TIME Person of the Year and has been a favourite for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since then.> Alexei Navalny, one of the most influential critics of Russian president Vladimir Putin, although his name is being bandied about to a lesser extent this year.> The World Health Organisation could also be a potential laureate this year, considering the impact that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has left in this world and the emergence of a global authority on the associated protocols.> Other world leaders – such as US president Joe Biden, German chancellor Angela Merkel, or New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern, are also said to be in the race, according to TIME Magazine, but the matter is entirely speculative at this point.Whoever wins, it is not yet known whether the laureate will be able to travel to Oslo to pick up the award, due to the pandemic. The prize -- consisting of a diploma, a gold medal and a cheque for 10 million kronor (980,000 euros, $1.1 million) -- is traditionally awarded on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prize creator Alfred Nobel. The Peace Prize is the only Nobel to be awarded in the Norwegian capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-to-svetlana-tikhanovskaya-here-are-the-nobel-peace-prize-2021-favourites-101633679431168.html

The development comes a day after a landmark court ruling that experts said could lead to Poland's divorce from the EU like the United Kingdom's exit."Poland's place is and will be in the European family of nations," Morawiecki said in a Facebook post, adding that joining the bloc was "one of the highlights of the last decades" for Poland as well as the European Union, as quoted by news agency AFP.The Polish top court on Thursday ruled that some EU treaty articles were "incompatible" with Poland's constitution and warned EU institutions not to "act beyond the scope of their competencies" by interfering with the country's judiciary.The ruling rejecting EU's supremacy, France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told the BFM-TV broadcaster in an interview, "is very serious... there is the risk of a de-facto exit" of Poland from the EU. "I do not want the exit of Poland," he added.Poland and the EU are at odds over judicial reforms introduced by Poland's governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party which Brussels warns threaten the country's democracy.However, the EU Commission said that it would use all the tools available to to ensure the primacy of EU law in Poland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-will-be-in-the-european-family-of-nations-pm-morawiecki-on-polexit-speculations-101633679809731.html
08-10-2021||World||Merck's Covid-19 pill must be combined with other treatments to avert resistance, says expert||Merck & Co.’s experimental pill for Covid-19 should be accompanied by other treatments as soon as they’re available to cut the risk of drug resistance that would limit its effectiveness, Welcome foundation director Jeremy Farrar said.While yet to be cleared by regulators, Merck’s molnupiravir has been hailed as a potential breakthrough, as it could be relatively cheap and easy to make, doesn’t require infusion and has shown it reduces the risk of hospitalization in a trial. Yet it may need to be combined with other drugs to head off resistance, Farrar said.Resistance occurs when viruses and bacteria evolve to blunt or defeat drugs’ mechanism of attack. It’s a constant concern for antivirals and antibiotics and has already been seen with Covid treatments such as Eli Lilly & Co.’s antibody therapy. Farrar suggested Merck’s pill would be no exception, despite optimism that it may be a potent new weapon to fight the pandemic. “The thought that you could have an oral drug readily available that you could take as soon as you have a suspicion of infection -- that’s a huge step forward globally,” Farrar said. But he emphasized the importance of combining it with other drugs as soon as possible to “delay the onset of resistance.”Earlier ExperimentsWhile this is always a concern for anti-infectives, the likelihood that it will become a severe problem for molnupiravir appears to be low, said Nick Kartsonis, senior vice-president of clinical research for infectious diseases and vaccines at Merck Research Labs. Earlier experiments with other viruses showed that the evolution of resistant mutations was rare, he said. The course of treatment is short, meaning that viruses get few chances to evolve into resistant forms. Another reason lies in the drug’s mechanism of action. Pioneered by researchers at Emory University and other academic centers and later licensed by Merck’s partner Ridgeback Therapeutics LP, molnupiravir works by introducing errors into the coronavirus’s genetic material. The errors are then replicated until the virus is defunct.Merck’s analysis has shown that the errors induced by the drug are spread more or less randomly throughout the viral genome. That means that the virus has fewer opportunities to develop mutant forms that will overcome those errors. “That in and of itself makes resistance a tough thing,” Kartsonis said. Still, although Merck isn’t pursuing combinations right now, molnupiravir may be more effective if used with other drugs that prove successful, Kartsonis said. That may also lower the potential for resistance even further, he said. Attacking PathogensMany drugs have been far more effective in combination than when used on their own. The first drugs developed for HIV, when used singly, quickly stopped working because resistant strains evolved that could defeat the drugs’ attack. By attacking pathogens from several angles, drug cocktails make the evolution of such variants less likely. Now, HIV combination treatments stay effective in individual patients for years. Numerous other companies are working on pills to treat Covid through a variety of approaches. Pfizer Inc. began late-stage trials of an oral treatment this summer and expects data before the end of the year. Israel-based Redhill Biopharma Ltd.’s experimental therapy, opaganib, cut deaths in a group of patients with moderately severe Covid, according to data released earlier this month. Wellcome itself has pledged 8 million pounds ($11 million) for a project, called Covid Moonshot, to find a drug that would block a key protein the coronavirus uses to replicate. An early study published last week showed molnupiravir has the potential to cut the rate of hospitalization and death by around 50% in mild to moderate Covid patients. A widely available Covid pill could be “massively important” in developing countries where hospital access is limited and vaccinations aren’t readily available, Farrar said.Lining UpCountries are already lining up to secure supplies of the Merck drug. The company has said it will file for U.S. authorization as soon as possible, and European Union drug authorities may begin a rolling review of the drug that could speed clearance there. Still, preventing the disease through vaccines remains a better strategy than relying on treatment, U.S. presidential adviser Anthony Fauci said Wednesday.The Wellcome foundation has been fighting for more equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments for Covid-19 and is funded by a 29 billion-pound ($39 billion) investment portfolio. Farrar spoke in an interview ahead of a conference of Gesda, the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Accelerator, a group that tries to bring scientists and politicians closer together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mercks-covid-19-pill-must-be-combined-with-other-treatments-to-avert-resistance-101633668754130.html
08-10-2021||World||Isolated China, the last country chasing Covid zero, resolves to stamp out every infection||For much of the pandemic, a group of places in the Asia-Pacific brought infections to zero, becoming virus-free havens in a world ravaged by the pathogen. Now, with the rise of the delta variant and the proliferation of vaccines, only one is still holding fast to that goal of eliminating Covid-19: China. With New Zealand preparing to shift away from the zero-tolerance strategy, China’s isolation is complete, raising the stakes on how long it can stick to a playbook that requires closed borders, abrupt lockdowns, and repeated disruption of social and economic activity. One by one, Covid Zero places like Singapore and Australia have decided that the approach is unsustainable, pivoting instead to vaccination to protect people from serious illness and death while easing off on attempts to control the number of infections. In contrast, China’s resolve to stamp out every infection appears to have only grown stronger, though 75% of its vast population is fully vaccinated. The country is now grappling with its fourth delta-driven flareup in two months and this week locked down a prefecture in the western Xinjiang province over two asymptomatic infections during a peak tourism period. The Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which has so far avoided local transmission of delta, has also made clear that its status as a global financial hub is less important than links to the mainland and the joint goal of elimination. The task is likely to get even harder as cold weather -- the conditions in which the virus spreads best -- descends. In three months, Beijing will host the Winter Olympics, welcoming thousands of athletes from around the world. “Covid Zero in the medium- to long-term is unsustainable,” said Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician and professor at the Australian National University Medical School. “Delta shows the almost impossibility of that. It’s hard to see how China will be able to get to zero Covid this winter.” Still, the status has become a political point of pride for China, with authorities trumpeting their success in containing the virus as an ideological and moral victory over the US and other nations now treating the virus as endemic.China’s Covid-Zero strategy risks leaving it isolated for yearsNew Zealand pivot New Zealand’s planned shift underscores the mounting futility of the elimination strategy. In mid-August, the country went into the highest level of restrictions when a single person was diagnosed with Covid-19 in Auckland. No working in the office. No going out to dinner or the gym or church. In most cases, no leaving the house. Seven weeks later, it’s still reporting more than two dozen infections daily, prompting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to acknowledge on Monday that “long periods of heavy restrictions have not gotten us to zero cases.”  “But that is OK,” she said. “Elimination was important because we didn’t have vaccines. Now we do, so we can begin to change the way we do things.”It’s an adjustment already made by Singapore and Australia, two other lauded examples of containment. In both places, fatigue among the population had grown over stop-start cycles of lockdown and travel curbs that imposed weeks of mandatory quarantine on new arrivals. In Taiwan, officials said that elimination was too difficult to achieve earlier this year after a large outbreak, though it’s now reported no cases for several days straight. The abandonment of the zero-tolerance goal now does not mean the strategy was wrong-headed from the start. The approach allowed these economies to suppress Covid fatalities to a very low level, getting through the pre-vaccine period of the pandemic with little damage -- unlike the U.S. and Europe. New Zealand has suffered 27 Covid-related deaths while Singapore has seen just 121. “If New Zealand can vaccinate widely, get access to new treatments and open cautiously, they’ll have escaped the pandemic with little economic or health loss,” wrote Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University Medical School, in Scotland. “They managed to press pause and wait for scientific solutions toward a sustainable exit.” Degree of control The question is now what China’s exit strategy will look like. It reported two new local cases on Oct. 5, one in each of the outbreaks - in Harbin and Xinjiang - that are currently underway. In the most recent flareup in Xinjiang, tens of thousands of residents are being tested, while Yining city has halted all trains and flights and closed the local highways, The Paper reported. Two people were found to be infected in the city of Horgos on Oct. 3, which borders Kazakhstan. Though all 38,376 residents were tested and found negative for the virus, and the two original cases were asymptomatic, all tourists in the prefecture Horgos is located in -- Yili -- have been stopped from returning home and told to stay indoors until further notice. Local governments were arranging food and lodging for them, the Beijing Youth Daily reported.The latest breakout followed the contours of earlier ones. Officials shut down the northern city of Harbin after a single patient was hospitalized in September. The port of Ningbo, one of the world’s busiest, was closed in August, while manufacturing took a hit because of the restrictions. The sporadic resurgences are unlikely to stop, public health experts said. But China’s authoritarian government has always been capable of feats beyond the imagination of most other countries. “The kind of capacity and degree of control they can exert is remarkable,” said Michael Baker, a professor at the University of Otago’s Department of Public Health in Wellington, who sits on the New Zealand government’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Group. “It’s way beyond what we can do, not just from a point of view of resources but the social license that governments have. We wouldn’t be able to exert the kind of control that China is able to exert, even in achieving a good end, which is managing an outbreak.” Officials in China have said they won’t stick to Covid Zero forever, though it will only consider a change when the approach no longer works or the costs are too high -- parameters of which have not been made public. City governments are being asked to create specialized quarantine facilities that could house thousands of overseas arrivals by the end of October, signaling that onerous travel curbs are unlikely to be eased in the near term.  Achieving elimination allowed life in China to be largely normal through most of 2020 and 2021, powering its economy even as most others were sapped by mitigation measures of various efficacy. But as its snap lockdowns and restrictions on movement continue through this year -- and western economies resume full operations after vaccination -- the impact is starting to show more deeply. Retail sales growth slowed to 2.5% in August from a year earlier, falling far short of the 7% expansion estimated by analysts. The best and worst places to be as we learn to live with deltaRegardless of China’s tolerance for the approach, some experts say that Covid-free havens may yet return. Governments like New Zealand could resurrect the goal if and when new medical options become available.“Maybe we are reaching the limits of what we can do with our current tools to eliminate transmission,” said Baker, who believes a Covid Zero strategy is still on the table. “We could find that the next generation of Covid vaccines or anti-virals are so effective that they can eliminate the virus quite effectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isolated-china-the-last-country-chasing-covid-zero-resolves-to-stamp-out-every-infection-101633668485859.html

According to the Reuters news agency, Ing-wen made the statement on Friday, amid high tensions in the country over the latest hostile policies initiated by Beijing and the Xi Jinping-led regime ramping up its military might in recent years.Also Read | Taiwan says China could launch ‘full scale’ invasion by 2025, tensions aggravateChina claims the democratic island of Taiwan as its own territory and says it should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan resists, saying it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy in the face of China's aggression.Beijing seems to have aggravated its hostile policies in recent days, with a record number of Chinese military aircraft repeatedly flying over Taiwan's air defence identification zone throughout the week. Taiwan's radars spotted as many as 150 Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing's continued harassment of the island.On Wednesday, Taiwan's defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng, while replying to a lawmaker's question in the country's parliament, said that military tensions with China are at their worst in more than 40 years. He noted that there was an added risk of “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait; and that while China already has the required arsenal to take Taiwan by force, the cost of a “full scale” war for Beijing might be at its lowest by 2025, when a potential invasion seems likely.Meanwhile, Taiwan is doing whatever it can to defend itself. The government has introduced a plan, currently under parliamentary review, for special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for homemade weapons including missiles and warships. Over the next five years, the country plans to invest mostly in naval weapons – including anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems.Also Read | Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-PacificThe United States, Taiwan's main military supplier, has confirmed its “rock-solid” commitment to Taiwan and also criticised China. A small number of US special operations forces have also been rotating into Taiwan on a temporary basis to carry out training of military forces, the Reuters news agency reported citing two people familiar with the matter, on the strict condition of anonymity. The Pentagon, which historically has not disclosed details about US training or advising of Taiwanese forces, did not specifically comment on or confirm the deployment.The United States is Taiwan's largest supplier of weaponry and has long offered some degree of training on weapons systems, as well as detailed advice on ways to strengthen its military to guard against an invasion by China's Peoples Liberation Army. Beijing, on the other hand, blames Washington's policies of supporting Taiwan with arms sales and sending warships through the Taiwan Strait for raising tensions. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-concerns-rise-over-chinese-invasion-taiwan-says-it-does-not-seek-military-confrontation-101633657567335.html

Nasa's Perseverence rover gets images of ancient river delta||Images from Mars reveal how water helped shape the Red Planet's landscape billions of years ago, and provide clues that will guide the search for evidence of ancient life, a study said Thursday. In February, Nasa's Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater, where scientists suspected a long-gone river once fed a lake, depositing sediment in a fan-shaped delta visible from space. The study in Science analysed high-resolution images captured by Perseverance of the cliffs that were once the banks of the delta.Layers within the cliffs reveal how its formation took place.Nasa astrobiologist Amy Williams and her team in Florida found similarities between features of the cliffs seen from the crater floor and patterns in Earth's river deltas.The shape of the bottom three layers showed a presence and steady flow of water early on, indicating Mars was "warm and humid enough to support a hydrologic cycle" about 3.7 billion years ago, the study says.The top and most recent layers feature boulders measuring more than a metre in diameter scattered about, probably carried there by violent flooding.But it is the fine-grained sediment of the base layer that will likely be the target of sampling for signs of long-extinct life -- if it existed -- on Mars.The findings will help researchers figure out where to send the rover for soil and rocks that may contain precious "biosignatures" of putative Martian life forms."From orbital images, we knew it had to be water that formed the delta," Williams said in a press release."But having these images is like reading a book instead of just looking at the cover."Finding out whether life may have existed on Mars is the main mission of Perseverence, a project that took decades and cost billions of dollars to develop.‘Profound’ missionOver the course of several years, the multi-tasking rover will collect 30 rock and soil samples in sealed tubes, to be eventually sent back to Earth sometime in the 2030s for lab analysis. Last month mission scientists announced Perseverance had collected two rock samples in Jezero that showed signs they were in contact with groundwater for a long period.Their hope is that the samples might at one point have hosted ancient microbial life, evidence of which could have been trapped by salt minerals.Learning that Mars might once have harboured life would be one of the most "profound" discoveries ever made by humanity, Williams said.She also expressed wonder at having a window onto an ancient river system on another planet.“It's really eye-opening to see something no one on Earth has ever seen before,” she said.Perseverance landed on February 18, and the study looks at long-distance images it captured during its first three months on Mars.About the size of an SUV, it is equipped with 19 cameras, a two metre (seven foot) long robotic arm, two microphones, and a suite of cutting-edge instruments.One of them is called the SuperCam, a tool that laser-zaps rocks from a distance in order to study their vapour with a device that reveals their chemical composition.It took seven months for Perseverance to travel from Earth to Mars with its sister craft Ingenuity, a tiny helicopter whose rotors have to spin five times faster than Earth versions to get lift in the far-less-dense atmosphere.The plan is for the rover to cross the delta, then the ancient lake shore, and finally explore the edges of the crater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasa-s-perseverence-rover-gets-images-of-ancient-river-delta-101633655916775.html

According to the reports, the US navy officials issued a statement on Thursday informing that there were “no life-threatening injuries” and that the submarine remains “fully operational”; however, the statement missed out on providing any clarity as to the nature of the object that the vessel encountered.Also Read | China lashes out after US warship sails past Mischief Reef in South China SeaThe Seawolf-class nuclear-powered submarine, named USS Connecticut, ran into the said ‘object’ five days ago, but the incident was not announced before Thursday in order to maintain operational security. The statement issued by the US Pacific Fleet was quite brief and did not mention what the object actually was, although it clarified that Connecticut remains in a “safe and stable condition”. The submarine's nuclear propulsion plant also remains unaffected, the statement noted.“The extent of damage to the remainder of the submarine is being assessed,” the US Navy said, without elaborating much on the location of the encounter. It added that that the incident will be investigated.Two officials of the US Navy, however, speaking to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, discussed details not yet announced publicly. They confirmed that the incident occurred in the South China Sea while the USS Connecticut was conducting routine operations. According to the officials, it is not yet clear what exactly the object was that the submarine encountered underwater, but it was definitely not another submarine. One of the officials said that it could have been a sunken vessel, a container, or any other sort of uncharted object.Also Read | Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-PacificThe impact of the encounter was noticeable to everyone on board the submarine, the officials said. Two sailors sustained moderate injuries, while at least nine others had minor injuries like scrapes and bruises.

08-10-2021||World||Tesla will move its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas, says Elon Musk||Tesla Inc. is moving its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas, where a new factory for the Model Y and forthcoming Cybertruck is nearing completion, relocating from California after making the Golden State its home for 18 years.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced the move at the Austin plant on Thursday during the electric vehicle maker’s shareholder meeting.Tesla has been based in Palo Alto, California, the leafy Silicon Valley suburb that’s home to Stanford University and several venture capital firms, since its founding in 2003. But the company has grown from a scrappy startup to the world’s most valuable automaker and Texas -- centrally located between the two coasts -- has become its center of gravity in the US.Musk’s decision to move the headquarters to Texas comes despite growing discomfort among some companies with the state’s policies, such as a recent abortion law -- that’s been temporarily blocked -- and efforts to restrict voter rights. But Tesla is just the latest California company to move to Texas, which has lower taxes, a lower cost of living, and fewer business regulations. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. has shifted its base to Houston and Charles Schwab Corp. moved its headquarters to the Dallas area from San Francisco.“We welcome Tesla home!” Austin Mayor Steve Adler said in an email. “It’s a tech company that creates the clean manufacturing, middle-skill jobs Austin needs.”The carmaker joins a number of other tech companies with operations in Austin. Dell Technologies was founded in the city, and Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. have a large presence. Oracle Corp. said last year it was moving its headquarters to Austin from Silicon Valley, one of several transplants to the Texas state capital during the pandemic.“This is the newest economic development trophy on Governor Abbott’s wall,” John Boyd, a corporate relocation consultant based in Princeton, New Jersey, said by phone on Thursday. The move is important to the state’s efforts to attract tech talent and also to Tesla’s efforts to appeal to a wider swath of U.S. consumers with the launch of its new pickup, he said.“Tesla is trying to expand its brand and appeal to Middle America,” Boyd said.Musk said Tesla isn’t abandoning California, noting the electric-car maker will continue to expand manufacturing in the state and aims to boost production at its vehicle factory in Fremont -- and at its Nevada battery plant -- by 50%.  “We will continue to expand our activities in California. This is not a matter of Tesla leaving California,” he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office and the state’s economic development agency didn’t respond to requests for comment. There have been several clues such a move was in the offing. Musk, the world’s richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, moved his private foundation to Texas in December. Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s chief financial officer, bought a house in a tony district of Austin and Tesla has datelined each of its last two press releases from Austin. Musk moved to Texas himself last year to focus on two big priorities for his companies: SpaceX’s new Starship vehicle, under development on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville, and Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin. Texas has no personal income tax, while California imposes the highest personal income levies in the nation on its wealthiest residents. Texas is the company’s third-biggest market in the U.S. after California and Florida, though years of opposition from auto dealers mean it can’t sell its electric cars directly there. In 2010, Tesla purchased a shuttered auto plant across the San Francisco Bay in Fremont. Roughly 10,000 people work at the plant, a former joint venture between General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., and scores of other Tesla employees work at showrooms, service centers, and offices throughout the region. Musk’s long-term relationship with California soured in the spring of 2020 during the first wave of the coronavirus. When Alameda County ordered production stopped at Tesla’s plant in Fremont, Musk openly defied public health officials by closing late and reopening early, blasting the rules as “fascist” on an earnings call. He briefly sued the county, but Tesla has continued to expand its footprint in the Golden State. A new “Megafactory” that will make Mega packs -- the energy-storage product Tesla sells to utilities -- is under construction in the Central Valley city of Lathrop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-will-move-its-headquarters-from-silicon-valley-to-texas-says-elon-musk-101633652579866.html
08-10-2021||World||Pakistan quake kills at least 22||An earthquake of magnitude 5.9 hit southern Pakistan in the early hours of Thursday, killing 22 people, most of them women and children, and injuring about 300, at a time when many victims were asleep, authorities said.Disaster management officials said the death toll may increase, Geo News reported.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre in Islamabad reported that the epicentre of the earthquake was near Harnai at a depth of around 15km. It further said the exact damage has not yet been confirmed.The quake affected Quetta, Sibi, Harnai, Pishin, Qila Saifullah, Chaman, Ziarat and Zhob in Balochistan. Most of the deaths and injuries were reported from the remote north-eastern district of Harnai, with landslides triggered by the jolt blocking some roads and hampering rescue efforts in the area.The US Geological Survey said it was a 5.9 magnitude quake that struck at a shallow depth. Shallow quakes can cause more damage.The death toll of 22 was confirmed by deputy commissioner of Harnai district Sohail Anwar Hashmi. There were six children among the dead.“I was sleeping when suddenly my entire house jolted,” Munir Shah, 40, a resident of Harnai district in Balochistan province, told Reuters.“I took my children and wife outside. It was a terrifying situation as houses in Harnai were collapsing, my house was also damaged,” he added. “I found a large number of people under debris. Some of them might have died.”“I tried to take out my children, but the jolt was so strong,” Rafiullah, a farmer in the mountainous Pakistani district of Harnai, told AFP.The roof of his mud house collapsed and knocked Rafiullah unconscious when the earthquake struck.“When I regained consciousness, I pulled out two of my sons,” he said. But his youngest boy, only around one, had been struck by a wooden beam, and “had already died”.More than 100 mud houses collapsed and many buildings were damaged, said district official Anwar. Television images showed buildings with gaping cracks, caved-in roofs and crumpled walls.About 250 homes collapsed and many people were killed by falling roofs and crumbling walls in the district’s Babu Mohallah neighbourhood, said Nawab Khan, a local journalist.“The entire town is a picture of devastation, as no house looks safe, thousands of people are rendered homeless and are under open sky,” Khan said, adding that almost 70% of power supply to the district had been disrupted.Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered immediate assessment of the damages and offered condolences to families that lost loved ones, adding, “I have ordered immediate assistance on an emergency basis ... for the earthquake victims.”Social media showed houses shaking and light fittings swaying as the quake struck. Stunned residents later gathered in the streets in the dark. Geo Television carried CCTV footage of trucks shaking.Rescuers sifted rubble for survivors, with some of the injured being treated on stretchers in the street by torchlight from mobile telephones.“The earthquake struck at about 3am,” said one resident, Muzaffar Khan Tareen, adding that some of the seriously injured were in hospital awaiting ambulances to take them to Quetta.An army helicopter flew at least nine of the seriously injured to Quetta, state-run Associated Press Pakistan said.Aftershocks were being felt across the region. Pakistan sits on top of colliding tectonic plates and earthquakes are common.A quake of 7.7 magnitude that hit Quetta in 1935 killed between 30,000 and 60,000 and destroying much of the city.In 2005, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 killed about 73,000 people when it struck about 95km northeast of the capital, Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-quake-kills-at-least-22-101633648302047.html
08-10-2021||World||China-US talks: Joe Biden, Xi Jinping likely to meet virtually before year-end||Top Chinese and US diplomats have held talks which were constructive and conducive to enhancing mutual understanding in Zurich, paving the way for further talks in the future, the Chinese official media reported on Thursday.Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met US national security adviser Jake Sullivan for six-hour talks in the Swiss city on Wednesday.While the Chinese official statement on the talks did not mention it, reports quoted a White House official as saying that President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden were likely to have a virtual meeting before the end of the year.According to the Chinese readout, the two sides agreed to take action, following the spirit of the phone call between Chinese and US heads of state on September 10, to strengthen strategic communication and properly manage differences.The two countries, it added, agreed to “…avoid confrontation and conflict, seek mutual benefit and win-win results, and work together to bring China-US relations back on the right track of sound and steady development”.“The US side needs to have a deep understanding of the mutually beneficial nature of China-US relations and correctly understand China’s domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions,” Yang said, adding that China opposes defining China-US relations as “competitive.”Yang Jiechi said that China attaches importance to the positive remarks on China-US relations made recently by Joe Biden, and China has noticed that the US said it has no intention to contain China’s development, and is not seeking a “new Cold War.”White House statement on the Swiss meeting said Jake Sullivan stressed to Yang Jiechi the need to maintain open lines of communication, while raising concerns about China’s recent military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities and Beijing’s efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong.The White House said the meeting was intended to serve as a follow-up to last month’s call between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in which Biden stressed the need to set clear parameters in their competition.The meeting in Zurich was held in the backdrop of heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington over a range of issues including Taiwan.It was Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with Yang Jiechi since their bitter exchanges in Alaska in March, which also involved US secretary of state Antony Blinken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinaus-talks-joe-biden-xi-jinping-likely-to-meet-virtually-before-yearend-101633604642885.html
08-10-2021||India||J&K L-G Manoj Sinha vows to avenge killing of civilians, likely to meet Amit Shah today||Amid a spate of targeted attacks, Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha has vowed to avenge the killings of civilians and “completely demolish” the terror ecosystem. Sinha is likely to meet Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss the security situation on Saturday, people familiar with the matter said.In a statement on Thursday night, the L-G said: “I am deeply pained and anguished and I promise the family members of the innocent victims that perpetrators of the barbaric acts will be punished soon,” Sinha said in a statement on Thursday night.“My tributes to the civilians martyred in the terrorist attacks. My heartfelt condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones. The UT administration and the whole country stand in solidarity with the families of the victims in this hour of grief,” he added.Sinha’s remarks came after a government school principal and teacher were shot dead by terrorists in the school premises earlier in the day. The Resistance Front (TRF), which police say is the front for terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack and said the teachers were killed for their role in getting students to participate in a “function at school on August 15”, India’s independence day. As many as seven civilians have been killed by militants in Kashmir Valley in the last five days.In a stern warning to those aiding and abetting terrorists, Sinha said: “Everyone wants justice. I assure you that we have given a free hand to the security agencies to eliminate the enemies of humanity, and soon the terrorists and those aiding and abetting them will pay for their heinous crimes.” “Every drop of innocent civilians’ blood will be avenged,” he added. Sinha said the peace and progress accomplished by J&K in the last two years has rattled the neighbouring country and some of its terror sympathizers in the UT. “I want to assure the people that we will completely demolish their terror ecosystem,” he added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-l-g-vows-to-avenge-killings-of-civilians-likely-to-meet-amit-shah-today-101633717407368.html
08-10-2021||India||Goa governor reverses decade-old stand on RTI, says will honour info requests||PANAJI: Goa governor PS Sreedharan Pillai on Friday reversed a decade-old stand by Raj Bhavan that the gubernatorial office was not obliged to respond to information requests under the Right to Information (RTI) Act 2005.“I would like to publicly declare my policy that governors are bound to furnish information to the people and people are supreme,” Pillai said on Friday, deciding in favour of a legal case pursued by the Raj Bhavan for years after the Goa Information Commission and the Bombay high court at Goa held that the governor’s office was a public authority under the RTI Act.Rashtrapati Bhavan, and Raj Bhavans in the rest of the country have mostly responded to information requests filed under the transparency law. Goa’s Raj Bhavan, however, insisted that the governor was a sovereign, not a public authority under the RTI Act, and no direction could be issued to the governor for disclosure of any information under the RTI Act.Pillai, a practising criminal lawyer before he was appointed as Mizoram governor in 2019 and later transferred to Goa by President Ram Nath Kovind, clearly didn’t agree with his predecessors.“I do not want to blame anybody, but hereafter RTI with respect to Raj Bhavan will be available for all the citizens,” said Pillai, who once led the Bharatiya Janata Party in Kerala.“The basis of democracy is that people are supreme rather than the governor, chief minister, or opposition leader... all are expected to serve the people. They are not the boss of the people,” PS Sreedharan Pillai added.The matter was first argued before the Goa Information Commission with the transparency watchdog ruling that it was indeed within the ambit of the RTI Act and would have to furnish information. The Bombay High Court at Goa too upheld the view after the Raj Bhavan filed an appeal. An appeal was then preferred before the Supreme Court where the matter is currently pending. Adv Aires Rodrigues, who has pursued the matter for more than a decade said it was “great news.” “This will end the needless protracted litigation which is now pending before the Supreme Court after having commenced before our High Court. For over a decade the Goa Raj Bhavan has not been submitting itself to this Transparency law by strangely claiming that it is not a ‘Public Authority’ despite all other Raj Bhavans across the country and even the Rashtrapati Bhavan being under the purview of RTI Act which was enacted to ensure Transparency and Accountability in Governance,” Adv Rodrigues said.“The move now by governor Pillai is most appropriate while sending a powerful message on the need for a citizen-centric approach of transparency, openness and accountability in governance. This would be in the best interests of the democratic principles and the Constitutional mandate of the RTI Act,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-governor-reverses-decade-old-stand-on-rti-says-will-honour-info-requests-101633717405326.html
08-10-2021||India||Nearly 7,000 deaths added to Kerala’s Covid-19 toll amid charges of undercounting||The Covid-19 death toll in Kerala is set to shoot up as the state government on Friday decided to add 7,000 more deaths which were excluded due to various reasons to the Covid-19 fatality list. With the new addition, the death toll will go up from 26,072 to 33,072 in the state. State health minister Veena George said in the assembly that around 7,000 deaths which were not included in the list due to absence of various certificates and other technical issues will be added to the list of Covid-19 victims. The minister denied the opposition charge that there were deliberate attempts to underplay the death rate to keep the state’s low mortality rate intact. Earlier many medical experts and opposition leaders questioned the government’s rule to declare Covid-19 deaths and sought more transparency to rectify undercounting. But the government insisted that the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) were being followed and refuted the charges. However, it was forced to dilute its adamant posture after the Supreme Court announced a relief of ₹50,000 to families of the victims and government offices were flooded with inquiries. After the verdict, the government modified the guidelines and launched an online service to obtain Covid-19 death certificates. “There was no deliberate attempt to exclude deaths of many from the list. We have been following the guidelines of the ICMR and due to a few technical glitches some deaths have been left out. We will revise the list again,” the minister said while replying to an adjournment motion moved by the opposition. She said some deaths were excluded during the period between March 2020 and June 2021 and later the health department introduced a better reporting system. But the angry opposition members insisted on an explanation and later walked out of the house. “The government did it deliberately to maintain its record of low mortality. The list is incomplete as many Covid-19 deaths have not figured in the list. Its public relations exercise fell flat. No government should have done such a disservice to its people,” said opposition leader VD Satheesan. He said the government was even denying the paltry relief to victims due to its indifferent attitude. Earlier Covid-19 deaths were ascertained in the state if they tested positive at the time of their death. But many patients developed pneumonia even after they tested negative and died after their condition aggravated. Also many other patients whose co-morbid conditions worsened after recovery were also not included in the list. There was a death audit committee in the state capital which used to declare Covid-19 deaths after analysing the reports given by the respective hospitals. This weird system drew enough flak but the government took refuge in the ICMR guidelines which was modified several times but it stuck to its initial position. “The government is slowly admitting its mistakes. It has done a grave injustice to victims. We need more transparency and these measures should not be politicised,” said public health expert Dr SS Lal, who was earlier with the World Health Organisation. Kerala reported 10,944 new virus cases on Friday after 95,510 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 11.45 per cent. The active case load is 1,16,645, according to the data released by the state health ministry. For more than four months now, the state has been reporting the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-7-000-deaths-added-to-kerala-s-covid-19-toll-amid-charges-of-undercounting-101633716744845.html

08-10-2021||India||In run-up to Assam bypolls, 39 candidates filed papers for five assembly seats||A total of 39 candidates have put in papers for bye-election to five assembly seats in Assam till Friday, the last date for filing nominations. Gossaigaon had the highest number of 13 candidates while Mariani with 4 has the least. Nine candidates filed nomination papers in Tamulpur, 8 in Bhabanipur and 5 in Thowra seat. With the ruling United People’s Party Liberal and opposition Congress, All India United Democratic Front and Bodoland Peoples’ Front fielding candidates, Gossaigaon is set to be the most keenly contested of all five seats. In Tamulpur, it seems like a two-way contest between the UPPL and Congress candidates. Tamulpur and Gossaigaon seats had fallen vacant due to deaths of Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and UPPL legislators. But the focus would be on Thowra, Mariani and Bhabanipur seats which are going to polls again, months after this year’s assembly polls, due to sitting MLAs from opposition Congress and AIUDF switching sides to join the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Phanidhar Talukdar (Bhabanipur) who was with AIUDF and former Congress MLAs Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain, who had represented Mariani and Thowra seats respectively, have all got BJP tickets from the same seats for the bypolls.On Friday, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma accompanied all three candidates-Borgohain, Kurmi and Talukdar-to file their nominations papers. “Our candidates will win easily in Thowra, Mariani and Tamulpur. But as per my political assessment, in Bhabanipur and Gossaigaon there will be exciting contests,” Sarma told journalists in Sivasagar on Friday. “The candidates who joined our party did so because they wanted to develop their constituencies. I was also called a traitor in 2015 when I quit Congress and joined BJP. I am the chief minister now,” he added. At present the ruling BJP has 59 MLAs, UPPL 5 and AGP 9 while opposition Congress has 27, AIUDF 15, BPF-3, CPM 1 and newly floated Raijor Dal has 1 seat in the 126-member house. Bye-election to the Majuli seat, which fell vacant after Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal resigned last week, will take place later. Voting for the five seats will take place on October 30 and counting will happen on November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-run-up-to-assam-bypolls-39-candidates-filed-papers-for-five-assembly-seats-101633713804413.html

The terrorists were said to be out for one more targeted killing when they were intercepted by Srinagar police and opened fire. The encounter took place in Natipura, a locality in Srinagar.Jammu and Kashmir Police said the terrorist who was killed during the encounter has been identified as Aqib Bashir Kumar, a resident of Shopian, who was affiliated with The Resistance Force (TRF), an offshoot of Pakistan terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba. Another terrorist who managed to escape is said to have infiltrated from across the border.According to top Jammu and Kashmir police officials, three modules of six locals have been involved in the recent targeted killings of civilians, all of them led by terrorists from Pakistan.The militants of the TRF have regrouped after the Jammu and Kashmir Police in August killed Mohd Abbas Sheikh, the top commander of the outfit. Sheikh was responsible for numerous attacks on civilians, lawmakers and security personnel. Sheikh was killed after terrorists were challenged by the police dressed in civvies and opened fire.The Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been witnessing protests and marches after at least five civilians, all of them religious minorities in the Valley, were killed by terrorists this week. Supinder Kour, a Sikh woman school principal, and a Hindu teacher were killed by terrorists on Thursday.TRF has claimed responsibility for the recent killings, including the murder of a prominent pharmacist Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit.Union home minister Amit Shah is likely to visit Jammu and Kashmir later this month as part of the government’s mass outreach programme and review development schemes.

08-10-2021||India||Resentment grows in Bengal BJP over promotion of former TMC minister Rajib Banerjee||The induction of former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Rajib Banerjee in the national executive committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday has triggered strong resentment in the party’s Bengal unit. Several state office-bearers told HT on Friday that they were “shocked” and “surprised” by the national leadership’s decision because Banerjee not only criticised the BJP’s opposition to Mamata Banerjee but distanced himself from the party after his defeat at the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah in the March-April polls. Banerjee had won the seat twice since 2011 when the TMC came to power for the first time. On January 30, days after he resigned from the cabinet and the TMC, Banerjee drew attention when he and a team of turncoat legislators under his leadership were flown to Delhi in a chartered plane so that they could join the BJP at the residence of Union home minister Amit Shah. The special privilege, which no other TMC leader has enjoyed till now, made bigger news than the shift in allegiance which was anticipated. Similarly, Banerjee drew media attention when he carried home a large photograph of Mamata Banerjee while vacating his chamber at the state assembly. He even broke down after tendering his resignation as minister to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. “I cannot figure out what prompted our leaders to promote a man who wrote social media posts questioning our strong stand against the chief minister. Although the BJP made no demand for imposition of President’s Rule in Bengal, Rajib went out of his way and said in public that such a step would be suicidal. The media lapped it up,” said a senior BJP leader who did not want to be named. Another leader, a state general secretary, said, “After losing the Domjur seat by more than 40,000 votes, Rajib completely cut himself off. He has skipped meetings and avoided public events. We have been reliably informed by TMC insiders that he is trying to make a comeback. Our workers in Howrah are furious since yesterday. Similar feedback has come from other districts as well.” A newly-elected BJP legislator said, “Unlike TMC leaders and workers who were driven by conviction and switched sides before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the BJP set a record by winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats, Banerjee is perceived as one of those who looked for an opportunity, thinking the BJP might come to power.” Speculations over Banerjee’s return to the ruling party started in June when he paid a surprise visit to the residence of TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. Both described it as a courtesy call. “Whether it is Rajib Banerjee or any other former TMC leader, the decision to welcome someone back is taken only by our topmost leaders. We have no separate policy for anyone,” Ghosh told HT on Friday, hinting that it is Mamata Banerjee who takes the call. Rajib Banerjee could not be contacted despite several efforts but his associates said even if he tries hard, returning to the ruling party will not be easy. “Banerjee’s strained relationship with minister Arup Roy, the TMC’s most heavyweight leader from Howrah, is widely known. In July last year, their tussle caused an embarrassment for the party when the chief minister was leading a rectification drive,” said a TMC leader from Howrah who is known to be close to Rajib Banerjee. “Rajib alleged before the media that corrupt mid-level leaders were being shielded by the district leadership. His target was Roy who was then the district unit president. Roy, who shares a good rapport with the chief minister, will vehemently oppose Banerjee’s comeback,” the leader said. During the March-April poll campaign the former forest minister also raised allegations of nepotism against TMC leaders involved in distribution of compensation for people whose homes were damaged by Cyclone Amphan in May 2020. This, TMC leaders said, did not go down well with the party’s rank and file. Among the 11 Bengal BJP leaders inducted in the national executive committee are actor Mithun Chakraborty, Rajya Sabha members Swapan Dasgupta and Rupa Ganguly, former Rajya Sabha member Dinesh Trivedi, national vice-president Dilip Ghosh, former Union minister of state Debasree Chaudhuri and minority front leader Mafuja Khatun. Mukul Roy, who was made a national vice-president of the BJP before he returned to the TMC in June, was taken into the national executive committee after he joined the saffron camp in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resentment-grows-in-bengal-bjp-over-promotion-of-former-tmc-minister-rajib-banerjee-101633710804138.html

08-10-2021||India||Grant permanent commission to women army officers with vigilance nod: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday told the Centre and the Indian Army to come back with orders granting permanent commission to those among the 72 women short service commission officers (WSSCO) who do not have any disciplinary or vigilance cases pending against them.Dealing with contempt petitions filed by 72 officers who were declared unfit for permanent commission (PC), the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna told the army, “You have to set your house in order,” and directed them to segregate names of officers who are of doubtful integrity or face serious disciplinary issues.Directing this exercise to be done by the next day of hearing on October 22, the court reminded the army that no additional factors can be introduced to deny permanent commission under the top court’s March 25 order which prescribed 60% as the cut-off marks, medical fitness, and vigilance or disciplinary clearances.Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain said the 72 officers have been declared unfit as their service records show serious charges such as “disobedience of orders, lapses in government procurement, forging medical documents, poor work ethics, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct, poor performance in courses” that renders them unfit under the Army Policies of 1983 and 2012. In June, the army filed a clarification application in the top court to know whether the judgment of the court requiring the women officers to clear the 60% benchmark and medical fitness will automatically mean they are fit for a permanent commission or the army can declare them unfit on issues of integrity and discipline. This application was dismissed on August 2 as “not maintainable”; the court told the army to comply with the March 25 order.On Friday, the court explicitly gave the army a free hand to decide cases where there was a vigilance or disciplinary issue.“We are conscious of the fact that this is the army. If there is a problem on vigilance or disciplinary grounds, you can remove them. But for the rest, come with orders granting permanent commission on the next date. If an officer has issues relating to vigilance/discipline, we make it clear we will not interfere.”It was only on September 28 that the army released the results of the 72 officers when it became clear that they did clear the 60% threshold fixed by the court verdict.Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for some of the women officers, in the contempt petition said, “The fact that these officers have been issued release orders shows that they do not face any discipline or vigilance issues. Now, there are new grounds being brought in to deny us PC (permanent commission).”The court responded: “All women officers who have attained 60% marks shall be entitled to PC, subject to medical fitness, disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The question is, can there be supervening or additional factors to be considered beyond what the court has stated. You wanted this but did not get this in your clarification application.”ASG Jain explained that the Special No 5 Selection board held in September 2020 that considered the grant of permanent commission for these officers considered even their vigilance and disciplinary clearance. “We are willing to share the confidential records of each of the 72 officers to the court to satisfy the grounds on which they were denied PC. These pertain to serious questions of integrity as per army policies,” Jain said.It was the army’s claim that out of 529 WSSCOs who opted for permanent commission, 514 fulfilled the 60% marks criteria but 72 among them were held ineligible on other grounds. It filed an affidavit explaining that all orders passed in the March 25 judgment were complied with.“We are not faulting you but we do not want to get behind our judgment and scrutinise each file. We have already undertaken a long exercise,” the bench said. The court directed Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian, who represented the army, to scrutinise each case and examine where there are serious vigilance or disciplinary grounds to reject permanent commission. “We would trust you as officers of the court to carry out this exercise,” the bench added.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, also appearing for a woman officer, told the court that the army has asked the 72 women officers to put in their papers or else their pension benefits will be withdrawn. The court said, “Tell your clients not to be anxious about these issues, We understand the feeling of humiliation they have suffered. Till the next date, hold your horses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grant-permanent-commission-to-women-army-officers-with-vigilance-nod-supreme-court-101633709003933.html

On national highways, the maximum speed limit is 100 kmph.The road transport and highways minister added that there is a mentality regarding speed that if the speed of the car increases then there will be an accident."My personal view is that the speed limit for vehicles on expressways should be increased to 140 km per hour," he said while addressing the 'India Today Conclave 2021'.Gadkari added that while the speed limits on national highways should be at least 100 km per hour on four-lane roads, the respective speed limit for two-lane roads and city roads should be 80 km per hour and 75 km per hour.He said the parameter of the speed limit for vehicles in India is one of the big challenges."There are some decisions by the Supreme Court and high courts regarding car speed, due to which we are not able to do anything," he said.Gadkari added that today, such expressway has been built in the country that not even a dog can come on those roads because barricading has been done on both sides of the road.He said he has prepared a "file to revise the maximum speed limits for vehicles for different categories of roads"."In a democracy, we have the right to make laws and judges have the right to interpret the law...a Bill will soon be introduced in Parliament to revise the speed limit for vehicles on Indian roads," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-wants-to-increase-speed-limits-on-expressways-to-140-kmph-bill-soon-101633708101209.html

In the surveys done earlier, the state showed a sero-prevalence of 32% in October-November last year and 29% this April.The third survey was conducted in July and August just after the second wave of infections began to decline and shows that 70% of the population have IgG antibodies against the Covid-19 infection. According to the survey conducted by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, blood samples were drawn from 24,586 people from 827 clusters to be tested using Chemiluminescence based Immuno Assay (CLIA). Each cluster consisted of 30 participants drawn randomly from a village in a rural area or a street in the case of urban regions. Nearly 17,090 people were found to have the presence of IgG antibodies against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Coimbatore, Erode and Salem, in the western region of Tamil Nadu which had fewer infections during the first wave but were severely affected during the second wave showed a sero-positivity of 71%, 70% and 60% respectively. The lowest sero-prevalence was found in Karur district with 51%. The health department says that this is a re-survey as the findings were first released on July 31 which showed a sero prevalence of 66.2%. “We conducted the third survey in July from which we took two extremes--the highest positivity in five districts and the lowest positivity in five districts-- and we re-did the survey in these 10 districts to check if there are any variations but it’s almost the same,” said director of DPH, Dr V S Selvavinayagam.“However, the re-survey confirms our findings and the ground situation so we have now released the combined results of July to August,” he said. This comes at a time when Covid-19 infections have declined and there is an increase in vaccinations. “It’s a reflection of the vaccination status. 70% positivity is good but we need to go beyond this,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seroprevalance-survey-in-tamil-nadu-shows-70-people-have-antibodies-against-covid19-101633707803985.html

However, the reason for the rejection of the bail plea on Friday was technical as additional solicitor general Anil Singh, the NCB counsel, said a magistrate has no jurisdiction to hear these applications. The ASG also said he is not opposing the bail, though it may seem so.So what next for Aryan Khan and others?Aryan Khan will have to spend the weekend in jail and Friday will be the first night he will be spending at Arthur Road jail as the arrested spent Thursday night at NCB custody for Covid tests.Aryan Khan's lawyer will have to file an interim bail plea in a special court.For the next few days, Aryan Khan along with the others arrested in the case will be kept in the quarantine cell according to Covid protocol.Reports said there has been no special request from Aryan Khan's family regarding his stay in the jail. Aryan Khan will be lodged in barrack number 1, which is the quarantine cell of the jail.Why Aryan Khan and others have been denied bail so farThis is the third time that Aryan Khan's bail plea was rejected. After he was arrested on Sunday after the NCB raided the cruise rave party, his lawyer agreed to one-day NCB custody for the sake of investigation. A day after, the NCB custody got extended till October 7.The NCB sought an extension of the custody till October 11 for further investigation. The court sent all of them to 14 days' judicial custody.On Thursday, the NCB opposed their bail plea saying the agency needs their custody as they will be confronted with the new arrests that the agency has made. On Friday, the NCB said Aryan Khan might be a regular consumer of drugs as his WhatsApp chats revealed some 'bulk quantities'. If he is released on bail, he may tamper with evidence as he is from an influential family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whats-next-for-aryan-khan-in-the-cruise-rave-party-case-101633707315367.html

08-10-2021||India||Full circle, after 7 decades: Tatas win back Air India||The divestment of Air India to the Tata Group is the culmination of a story that has come full circle after nearly seven decades. Tata Airlines was formed in April 1932 under the leadership of Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy (fondly called JRD) Tata, India’s first civil aviation pilot, Tata Group Chairman from 1938 to 1991, and the only industrialist to receive the Bharat Ratna. The story of Indian commercial civil aviation began on October 15, 1932, when JRD took off on his first official Tata Airlines flight from Karachi’s Drigh Road aerodrome and landed ahead of schedule at what was then Bombay’s Juhu airstrip (actually the wetlands of Juhu beach) . Over the next five years, Tata Airlines’ profits rose from ₹66,000 to ₹600,000, with 99.4% punctuality. The Indian princes loved the idea of airplanes linking their states with the outside world and Tatas’ business did very well ferrying the maharajas in special chartered planes. In 1938, Bobby Kooka, among the first employees at the company, designed the iconic Maharaja as the brand identity of Tata Airlines and a symbol of hospitality. It continues to remain the carrier’s identity 83 years later. During the tumultuous post-Partition period, Tata Airlines had flown refugees from Pakistan to India and vice versa, a gesture acknowledged by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. In October 1947, Tata Sons proposed the establishment of a new company for international air service – Air India International. The proposal was accepted within three weeks by the newly-formed Government of India. Air India International’s first overseas flight from Bombay to London landed on-time (after stops at Cairo and Geneva) in June 1948. JRD was welcomed at the London Airport to a battery of floodlights and cameras, which had gathered to welcome the first Asian airline connecting the East to the West. Over the years, Air India International developed an admirable reputation for its high-class on-board service. It had made an icon of its airhostesses in their exotic silk saris. However, clouds of nationalization were hovering over the civil aviation sector since independence. JRD opposed it on several platforms, and at a luncheon meeting with Nehru in November 1952, he even expressed his anguish at what he thought was a planned conspiracy to suppress private civil aviation, particularly Tatas’ air services. Nehru reassured him that there were no such intentions. All along, JRD’s contention was that the new government had no experience in running an airline company, and nationalization would mean bureaucracy and lethargy, decline in employee morale, and fall in passenger services. The government didn’t yield to JRD’s pleas and in 1953, Tata Airlines along with seven other domestic airlines were nationalized and rebranded as Indian Airlines while Air India International (the only international carrier in India) was nationalized and rebranded as Air India. The government invited JRD to lead both corporations. He accepted and became chairman of Air India and a director on the board of Indian Airlines.Over the next 25 years he helped maintain high standards of service and micro-managed the carrier’s operational aspects. He wandered about on flights making notes of tiny details that needed to be fixed. If he saw a dirty airline counter, he would shame everyone by requesting a duster and wiping it himself. On one occasion, he rolled up his sleeves and helped the crew clean a dirty aircraft toilet. In later years, JRD even admitted that during the vital years of his chairmanship at Tata Sons, he was effectually dedicating nearly 50% of his time to Air India, an entity that provided no financial rewards to him or the Tata Group. Yet, through his personal example, he wanted to communicate that Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) could be profitable by maintaining world-class standards. In 1970s, when Singapore Airlines (SIA) began attracting global tourists, it chose to collaborate with Air India to learn its world-class service standards.In February 1978, the Morarji Desai-led government dropped JRD from the chairmanship of Air India and the directorship of Indian Airlines. The decision deeply impacted the man who had served the company for 45 years without a penny in remuneration. In 1980, when Indira Gandhi came back to power, she re-appointed JRD on the board of both airlines, though not as chairman. JRD continued to serve on the boards till 1986, the year in which Ratan Tata was appointed as the chairman of Air India. Post-liberalisation storyIn 1990, Prime Minister VP Singh’s government asked the Tatas if they would be interested in starting a new domestic airline. An opportunity of this kind had come their way after nearly four decades and the Tatas started putting together a proposal. But before things could take shape, the government fell. In 1994, under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao’s Open Skies Policy, the Air Corporation Act — the 1953 law under which air transport services were nationalized— was abolished. The sector was now open to private players and the Tatas decided to enter the fray. While JRD had passed away the previous year, Ratan Tata, the new group chairman and an avid aviator too, led the charge. However, the following few years saw multiple coalition governments. Diverse political and vested interests prevented the Tatas from entering the civil aviation sector. In contrast, most of the newer breed of airlines were founded by small-time entrepreneurs – Jet and East West by travel agency owners, Damania by a poultry farmer, NEPC by a maker of windmills, and Sahara by a chit-fund owner. Lack of management expertise in a specialized industry and mandatory flights to non-economical social routes severely affected their financials. Consequently, most of them were grounded or acquired. It was only in 2014, after revised foreign investment norms permitted foreign carriers to invest up to 49% in air transport services that Tata Sons started Air Asia India, a low-cost airline, in partnership with Malaysia-based Air Asia Berhad. Six months later, they started Vistara, a full-service airline, in partnership with SIA.In the 1990s, Air India’s market share steadily declined, and losses mounted. Passenger complaints, political interventions in day-to-day operations, impracticable policies, and bureaucratic delays had a deleterious impact on the national carrier. Between 1995 and 1997, it reported consolidated losses of ₹671 crores. In 2001, under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government a decision on divesting 40% stake in Air India was taken. The national carrier was an attractive investment proposition because of its lucrative slots at key airports, flying rights to global destinations, its fleet size and market share. A feasibility study conducted by Tatas and SIA revealed that robust-middle level managers at Air India would be an asset in turning around the enterprise. SIA and Tata Sons offered to take 20% stake each in Air India. When their joint proposal emerged as sole bidders, it was almost a done deal. Yet, attacks by rival airline lobbyists and opposition from unions marred the atmosphere. Discomforted by these developments, SIA withdrew its participation, and Tatas’ entry into the airline sector was stonewalled yet again. In the last year of the Vajpayee-led government, Air Deccan, India’s first low-cost carrier (LCC) was launched. The idea became tremendously popular in India. For a 100-crore population, India was operating just 500 commercial flights every day; with a third of that population, the United States operated 40,000 commercial flights daily. The next few years saw several new LCCs enter the market including Indigo, SpiceJet, and GoAir. Between 2003 and 2010, the market share of LCCs increased from 1 to 70%, and Indian Airlines slipped from the first to the fourth position. A steady declineTo arrest this decline, the Union Cabinet under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decided to merge Air India and Indian Airlines. A government report highlighted two reasons for the national carriers’ sub-optimal performance. One was the ageing fleet of aircrafts and the other was the stand-alone operation of the domestic and international services. Despite opposition from both state-run airlines, a new company (Air India Ltd.) was formed in 2007 to manage the combined entity. The merger process took four years for completion and had disastrous effects on the profitability of the new entity. Between 2007 and 2009, combined losses increased from ₹770 crores to ₹7,200 crores and borrowings rose from ₹6,550 crores to ₹15,241 crores. The merged company had over 30,000 employees i.e., 256 per plane, twice the global standard. Air India ended up spending almost one-fifth of its revenue on employee pay and benefits while other private airlines spent about one-tenth. Attempts to streamline employee base and cost-cutting led to repeated stirs and hunger strikes by its unions. Even before the merger, the Civil Aviation Ministry had decided to purchase 111 new narrow and wide-body aircrafts for a whopping ₹67,000 crores through debt. As a result, between October 2012 and March 2013, the merged entity suffered an average loss of ₹400 crores every single month.Since 1996, India was consistently adjudged the world’s fastest growing domestic travel market with a year-on-year growth of 26.6%. By 2019, the Indian aviation sector had grown to become the fourth largest in the world with over 13-crore passengers flying every year with 13 Indian carriers and 500 aircrafts. It replaced Japan to become the largest domestic aviation market globally and was poised to reach the third spot in world aviation by 2026. Steady rise in income levels, stability in global oil prices, development of new greenfield airports, entry of new full-service carriers and LCCs, capacity addition by airline operators, reduction of taxes on Aviation Turbine Fuel prices (ATF), and new policies such as the UDAN scheme were key drivers of this phenomenal growth.By the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Government first put-up Air India for sale in 2018, the airline had succeeded in accumulating losses of ₹50,000 crores and a debt of ₹55,000 crores. Besides the huge debt, some of the key problems plaguing the airline included routing and network issues, lack of decisive leadership, managerial complications, and internal incompatibility between the merged airlines. However, there were no takers for the once iconic brand. In the pandemic years, the civil aviation sector was the worst hit, and the government prioritized the privatization of the ‘Maharaja’ with more attractive conditions in 2020-21. Today, when India’s national carrier returns to its founding institution, one wonders, how different the face of Indian civil aviation would have been if JRD Tata’s plea 68 years ago, to not nationalize the sector, had been heeded.Shashank Shah is the author of the national bestselling book, The Tata Group: From Torchbearers to Trailblazers.

08-10-2021||India||Virtual court can’t be the norm, says Supreme Court; explains its reservations||NEW DELHI: Virtual courts cannot become the norm as this would envisage that the building in which we sit should be closed, the Supreme Court observed on Friday, expressing its strong reservations on a petition that asked for continuation of virtual court hearings as a matter of fundamental right.“It is one thing to demand live telecast of court proceedings, and quite another to say that when Covid is receding, people need not come to courts and instead continue with virtual hearing,” the bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said.The bench, however, went ahead to issue notice to the Union government, pointing out that the court will take up the petition after four weeks along with a similar plea filed earlier by a group of lawyers.The court on Friday was hearing a petition by National Federation of Societies for Fast Justice, an advocacy NGO that campaigns for judicial reforms, along with former Central Information Commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi and former Mumbai Police Commissioner Julio Ribeiro.The petition, drafted by lawyer Siddharth R Gupta, also wants the top court to bar high courts from discontinuing virtual court hearings without the Supreme Court’s approval, pointing out that high courts of Uttarakhand and Gujarat have already issued orders to this effect on August 10 and 16, respectively.“For more than 70 years, we all understood courts to function physically. It was in view of Covid-19 pandemic that we thought that courts should continue to function and developed this new system of virtual hearing of cases. But virtual courts cannot become a norm as courts have to function physically when normalcy gets restored. The result of seeking virtual hearing as a norm is to envisage that the building where we sit should be closed down.”Senior lawyer Manoj Swarup, appearing for the petitioners, said virtual courts allowed litigants to address the courts and get justice at a very cheap cost. “They also have the advantage of engaging a lawyer of their choice and all this promotes access to justice which no system of governance can ignore,” Swarup said, urging the bench to allow the option of virtual courts to continue.The bench wondered what would happen to the provisions in Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) which talk about open courts and open justice, referring to the 18th century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham who advocated for courts to be open for the public to enhance public confidence in the justice delivery system.In contrast to in-person hearings, virtual hearings can be accessed by a limited number of people and often, due to technical glitches and connectivity issues, the hearings get interrupted, sometimes making it difficult for judges to appreciate arguments advanced by the litigants or lawyers.“When you make submissions looking into our eyes, it is more effective than we are looking into the screen while you are addressing,” the bench said.The top court also countered a suggestion that physical court hearings put people living in remote areas at a disadvantage since they have to travel all the way to Delhi for hearings.“Nobody in remote areas is being denied access to justice. There is only a small percentage of cases that reach the Supreme Court from trial courts. Litigants already have the facility to approach those courts. If we allow virtual courts that will be sounding the death knell for physical functioning of courts,” the bench remarked, and asked Swarup if there was any study to back up its argument.The petition referred to findings of the Supreme Court E-Committee which propagated virtual courts as the most accessible, affordable, transparent, and cheap mode of justice available to litigants of the country, especially those coming from the marginalized sections.The bench referred to the standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the Supreme Court on Thursday, by which virtual hearing of cases would be discontinued on two days in a week beginning October 20. “So, you want us to set aside that SOP also,” the bench told Swarup, stating that it is a huge challenge the top court is facing to resume physical functioning.“You ponder over how physical courts have to resume after normalcy returns. We started a hybrid hearing in the Supreme Court, but lawyers are not coming to court. What norms can be laid down; we can think over it at the next date of hearing.”At one point, the bench questioned whether this petition was driven by the interest of lawyers. “You want this happy option to remain so that lawyers can argue from Mussoorie, Shimla or London,” the bench remarked, to which Swarup responded saying this petition is by citizens who genuinely feel that keeping the option of videoconferencing open is in the interest of access to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virtual-court-can-t-be-the-norm-says-supreme-court-explains-its-reservations-101633705643551.html
08-10-2021||India||Arunachal Pradesh formally devolves power to panchayat bodies||The Arunachal Pradesh government on Friday announced formal devolution of powers to Panchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) in the state. The development comes 52 years after the first panchayat elections were held in 1969 in the North East Frontier Province (NEFA) (the name of the region till Arunachal Pradesh became a Union Territory in 1972). Making the announcement in Itanagar, Chief Minister Pema Khandu called the development a significant step in the history of grassroots democracy in the north-eastern state. On September 30, the state cabinet had decided to devolve powers to PRIs as per the 73rd amendment to the Constitution and 11th schedule of the Constitution in 29 subjects. Khandu informed that the devolution of powers was based on SPICE (sustainable, participatory, inclusive, comprehensive and empowerment) formula devised by the panchayat department. “It was my commitment to empower grassroot functionaries, which dates back to the first election in 1969 in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, but do not enjoy the absolute power they are entitled to,” Khandu said in his address. The CM informed that 10% of the state’s own resources would be devolved to PRIs from the next financial year. This will be in addition to finance commission grants which will be based on the criteria of population and area based on the ratio of 50:50. While 70% will be basic grants, 30% will be performance-based. This will be in addition to the 14th finance commission grants, stated a release issued by Khandu’s office. The CM urged PRIs to plan projects and measures based on 15 of the 17 sustainable development goals recommended by United Nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-pradesh-formally-devolves-power-to-panchayat-bodies-101633704923743.html
08-10-2021||India||India, US to hold slew of meetings; counter-terrorism, Afghan situation on agenda||India and the United States are set to hold a series of meetings in the coming weeks that will take forward cooperation in key areas such as counter-terrorism, defence and the Indo-Pacific and help shape the response to the situation in Afghanistan.These meetings, including the 2+2 ministerial dialogue, are being scheduled against the backdrop of US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman’s remarks that the US does not see itself “building a broad relationship” with Pakistan.Defence secretary Ajay Kumar is expected to travel to the US this week for a meeting of the bilateral Defence Policy Group (DPG), people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The DPG is the highest body that oversees cooperation in areas such as exercises, defence technology, joint research and development and production, and military exchanges.The India-US joint working group on counter-terrorism is set to meet during October 26-28, and the two sides will also hold the bilateral homeland security dialogue and talks on designation of terrorist individuals and entities in the coming weeks, the people said.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is also expected to visit the US, and a meeting of the Trade Policy Forum, which is co-chaired by the US trade representative and India’s commerce minister, is on the cards, the people said.The 2+2 defence and foreign ministers’ dialogue is expected to be held in November though the dates are yet to be locked in, the people added.India will also participate in the Summit for Democracies to be hosted by the US during December 9-10.Speaking at a virtual event organised by the Ananta Centre on Thursday, Sherman highlighted the importance of the relationship with India for the US.“With so much that unites us, I truly believe that there is no challenge so great that the US and India cannot overcome it by working together,” she said.At the same time, she said she was travelling from India to Pakistan on the last leg of a four-nation for a “very specific and narrow purpose”.Sherman said: “We don’t see ourselves building a broad relationship with Pakistan and we have no interest in returning to the days of a hyphenated India-Pakistan. That’s not where we are, that’s not where we are going to be.”She indicated her visit to Pakistan was largely focused on the situation in Afghanistan, and the need to get the Taliban to deliver on their commitments.“But we all need to know what’s going on in Afghanistan; we all need to be of one mind in the approach to the Taliban. We all need to make sure that we have the capabilities that we need to ensure everybody’s security, including India’s of course,” she said.The frostiness in US-Pakistan relations was on display when Sherman was received by a mid-ranking official on her arrival at the Foreign Office in Islamabad. In marked contrast, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had personally received Taliban leaders during recent visits.US state department spokesperson Ned Price said Sherman and Qureshi had “discussed areas of bilateral cooperation, the importance of the US-Pakistan relationship and the way forward in Afghanistan” during their meeting. Sherman also “emphasised the importance of a coordinated approach to Afghanistan and other issues vital to regional stability”, Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaus-to-hold-slew-of-meetings-counter-terrorism-afghan-situation-on-agenda-101633703663685.html
08-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri incident: SC slams UP government over delay in arrest of Ashish Mishra||The Supreme Court on Friday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for not immediately arresting Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, commenting that the state police do not appear to be “really serious” even as the “brutal” episode left eight people dead five days ago. Mishra has been named as an accused in a murder FIR lodged Monday. The court was exceptionally harsh while commenting on the police’s lenient handling of Mishra, although it didn’t name him. “This is an offence registered under Section 302 (murder charge under the Indian Penal Code). Do you treat everyone in the same manner? Issue notice and then wait for them to appear? Will an accused in every part of the country be treated in the same way like the present case? Giving them an invitation that you please come? We want to question you so you kindly come?” the bench asked lawyer Harish Salve who was representing the UP government in the case registered by the top court on its own (suo motu) as a public interest litigation. Mishra dodged a summons to appear before the police (as a witness, not an accused) on Friday. Although he made an appearance on some TV channels to proclaim his innocence, he has not been seen since Thursday. The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana held that the apex court is “not satisfied” with the investigation conducted so far in the case. It added that the special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the state government does not inspire any confidence, and asked the state to have an “alternative agency” with independent investigators take over the probe. “What is the message you are sending? If a case is lodged under Section 302 (murder charge under the Indian Penal Code), the police will normally go and arrest the accused. After all, this is a case involving the brutal death of eight people. The law should have taken its course and all accused should have been arrested in a case like this,” the bench, which also comprised Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli told Salve. The bench expressed its anguish that instead of arresting him, the UP police issued a notice as a witness to Ashish Mishra despite his name being in the murder FIR lodged on Monday. The UP police on Thursday arrested two men, both believed to be associates of Mishra. The arrests happened hours after the Supreme Court hearing on Thursday when the bench termed the Lakhimpur Kheri incident “very unfortunate”. Mishra, however, was sent a notice under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code as a witness of the October 3 incident, for presenting himself before the investigators on Friday. Salve said that the police have issued a notice to Mishra and he has sought time till 11 am on Saturday. “If he does not come, the rigours of law will follow. I was told that the post mortem did not show any bullet wounds that is why a notice has been sent. But there is strong evidence to show prima facie that this is a murder case...the case is extremely serious,” added Salve. Unmoved by his submissions, the court retorted: “This is the opinion of the bench. We expect you to act as a responsible government and as a responsible police force. When there is a serious allegation of death or gun-shot injury, will you treat the accused like this? You say this is an extremely serious case but the way you are proceeding, you are not really serious. It is only in your words and not in action.” The court also expressed its amusement at the composition of the SIT set up by the state government to carry out the probe after noticing that the team comprised a deputy inspector general, superintendent of police and all other police officials from the UP police only. “Look at the composition of the SIT. It has all your officers. This is what happens when you have all local people in the SIT...We don’t know if a good probe is conducted in this case because of the officers involved. Please, ask the DGP (director general of police) to ensure that all evidence is protected and not destroyed in the interim by the time another agency takes over,” said the bench, asking Salve to inform the court on October 20 about some other suitable agency that can take over the probe. It also inquired from Salve if the state has made any request to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to step in. While Salve said the court could pass such orders on the next date after giving the state an opportunity to show the progress in the investigation, the bench itself remarked that the CBI may not be a solution here “because of the persons involved”. “We hope that the state will take necessary steps. Because of the sensitivity of the issue, the state should understand that we are not saying anything more... We will take it up after the Dussehra break but that should not mean that the state holds its hands. Take immediate steps. You have to act to inspire confidence,” it told Salve. Salve, on his part, conceded that what needed to be done has not been done and that he is giving his personal assurance that the state would be in a position to satisfy the court by the next date of hearing. The court then recorded in its order that it is not satisfied with the steps taken so far by the state government and that Salve has assured it that an alternative agency would be explored for further probe in the matter. The bench has also noted that the evidence collected so far shall be preserved properly. On Wednesday, the court registered the suo motu case as “In Re Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) leading to loss of life” after receiving a letter from advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda. The matter was registered as a criminal writ petition, pertaining to investigation and prosecution. The development came on a day Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, his Punjab counterpart Charanjit Singh Channi, and other senior leaders reached the village, roughly 10km from the India-Nepal border. Since news of the violence broke on Sunday, opposition leaders have made a beeline for the village amid rising political tensions over the incident.Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same. The minister and his son deny the charge and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led to the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed. The Mishras claim Ashish Mishra was not at the site.  On Wednesday, a new, clearer 45-second video of the incident showed the Thar ploughing through the farmers at high speed, with two vehicles in tow. The identities of individuals in the vehicles were not clear and HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-sc-slams-up-government-over-delay-in-arrest-of-ashish-mishra-101633701867459.html

Kishida was elected to the post after his predecessor Yoshihide Suga quit last month following criticism of his handling of the Covid-19 crisis.Modi and Kishida expressed satisfaction at progress in the bilateral special strategic and global partnership and agreed to enhance cooperation in areas such as high-technology and futuristic sectors. Modi invited Japanese companies to benefit from India’s economic reforms through greater investment, the external affairs ministry said.The leaders discussed the “increasing alignment of perspectives and robust cooperation between India and Japan in the Indo-Pacific region”, and reviewed cooperation under the Quad framework, the ministry said.A readout from the Japanese side said the two leaders, while looking ahead to the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations next year, decided to elevate the bilateral partnership to greater heights by promoting cooperation in political and security issues, economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges.Both leaders confirmed that the two sides will coordinate to hold the next round of 2+2 foreign and defence ministers’ meeting at an early date, and promote cooperation in green technology, digital, healthcare, connectivity and personnel exchanges under the “Specified Skilled Worker” programme, the readout said.Modi and Kishida also agreed to advance the construction of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed Rail, a Japan-India flagship project, the readout added.The two leaders said they will work for a free and open Indo-Pacific through bilateral and quadrilateral cooperation involving Australia and the US.“In this connection, both leaders shared their strong opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force and to economic coercion, while confirming that the two countries would deepen cooperation on economic security such as through resilience of supply chains,” the Japanese readout said.North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile issues also figured in the 25-minute phone conversation and Kishida requested “understanding and support towards the early resolution of the abductions” of Japanese citizens by North Korea.Modi invited Kishida to visit India at his earliest convenience for a bilateral summit.The two sides have not been able to hold their annual summit since 2019 because of scheduling issues and the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-dials-japan-s-fumio-kishida-promises-to-work-for-free-and-open-indopacific-101633701683167.html

It was tranquilised. It is doing fine. But, as we had to tranquilise it, two veterinarians are monitoring it. It will be returned to its cage soon,” said Debal Ray, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal. There are two adult leopards and two cubs in the Junglemahal Zoological Park, located around 180 km west of Kolkata. There was panic in Jhargram town after officials of the mini zoo found on Thursday evening that the female leopard had managed to escape. The zoo is located around two kilometres away from the town. Featuring forests and hilly terrains, Jhargram district is part of the Junglemahal area covering the western parts of Bengal and the state of Jharkhand. These terrains were a haven for Maoist guerrillas operating in Bengal till 2011. After a night long search operation, forest officials spotted pugmarks of the leopard close to the zoo. Cages to trap the animal were also set up in the area. Four teams were deployed and senior officials rushed to the spot. By late morning on Friday, the officials became certain that the leopard was hiding in the wooded area inside the zoo premises. The area was cordoned off and by around 1:30 pm the animal was tranquilised. The zoo remains closed on Thursdays. Zoo employees found the cage empty at about 6 pm. The district forest officials started alerting the local people while making announcements on loudspeakers. Civic volunteers in the area were alerted on Whatsapp messages, who in turn helped to alert the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-which-escaped-from-its-cage-in-a-zoo-in-bengal-tranquilised-after-18-hours-101633699703010.html

In a heartfelt note he posted on Twitter, Subramanian said it was an absolute privilege to serve the nation every day. He said he had the privilege to witness PM Modi's intuitive understanding of economic policy coupled with an unmistakable determination. In his note, he remembered finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman as a "scholar at heart". The social media note bears the style of his Economic Survey as he manages to bring in Sourav Ganguly, Dhoni and Rahul Dravid in his farewell message. Subramanian has worked with several financial institutions and is currently a professor at the Indian School of Business. He is also associated with Emory University in the United States. I have decided to return back to academia following the completion of my 3-year fulfilling tenure. Serving The Nation has been an absolute privilege 🙏and I have wonderful support and encouragement🙏. My statement: @PMOIndia @narendramodi @FinMinIndia @nsitharamanoffc @PIB_India pic.twitter.com/NW5Y64kxJ6"In close to three decades of my professional life, I am yet to encounter a more inspiring leader than the honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji. His intuitive understanding of economic policy combined with an unmistakable determination to use to same to elevate the lives of common citizens. In my close interactions, I had the privilege t witness the combination in action -- be it in taking the tough decisions that do not fall prey to optimal populism but tangibly improve citizen's lives, or in the courage of conviction to think out of the box and enact path-breaking reforms amid a once-in-a-century crisis when the rest of the world was merely content on tiding through the pandemic," the CEA said heaping praises on PM Modi.Later, PM Modi acknowledged Subramanian's tweet and said the Subramanian is a man of academic brilliance, unique perspective and reformist zeal. Its been a delight to work with @SubramanianKri. His academic brilliance, unique perspectives on key economic as well as policy matters and reformist zeal are noteworthy. Wishing him the very best for his coming endeavours. https://t.co/jZjrqWaJU7"Nirmala Sitharaman who is a scholar at heart has been instrumental in the Economic Surveys carrying their free spirit.. Madam's sense of humour and easy manner play a critical role in enabling a healthy debate that is so essential amidst epochal change," Subramanian wrote adding that the finance minister once took the draft chapters of Economic Surveys to read on a flight."This process (of Economic Survey) has taught me to carefully pick a team of talented and motivated professionals in a way that Sourav Ganguly exemplified, remaining calm while continually paddling underneath as Dhoni epitomised, and always putting the nation first in a way that Rahul Gandhi demonstrated," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/absolute-privilege-chief-economic-advisor-to-return-to-academia-as-term-ends-101633699266188.html

However, the minister postponed the date of the revelation and claimed that during the same raid, the NCB let off two people from the cruise. One is the brother-in-law of a BJP leader. The Maharashtra minister said in a press conference on Saturday, he will reveal the name of the BJP leader, who he claimed is a high-profile leader."After the raid, NCB officer Sameer Wankhede said 8-10 people were held. How can an official who conducts an entire operation give an indefinite answer? If 10 people were held then why were two people let off? And of the two, one was the brother-in-law of a high-profile BJP leader," Nawab Malik said.The Aryan Khan case has brought the Maharashtra government and the NCB to loggerheads. Though Shiv Sena has not commented on Aryan Khan's arrest, in particular, the NCP and the Congress in Maharashtra have termed the arrest as a forgery. Nawab Malik has released videos of KV Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali -- two outsiders-- visiting the NCB office in connection with the case. KV Gosavi is the person with whom Aryan Khan's photo went viral and the NCB claimed that the person in the photo has no link with the agency.While the NCP is upping the ante against the NCB, the I-T department is conducting raids on the premises of commercial entities linked to NCP leader and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.Linking Aryan Khan's arrest with that of Rhea Chakraborty, Nawab Malik said both were for publicity. Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested by the NCB in January this year in connection with a drugs case. On the allegation of NCB letting off two people during the cruise raid and one of them being related to a BJP leader, Maharashtra BJP leader Pravin Darekar said, “Malik is making only political statements. The claims made by Malik are baseless. If he has any proof then he should give inputs to the investigating agency. I don't want to talk about his son-in-law. Whenever he (Malik) gets a chance, he tries to vent out his anger against the NCB. The NCB has very clearly clarified its stand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-says-bjp-leader-s-relative-was-let-off-by-ncb-in-aryan-khan-case-threatens-to-release-name-101633698156073.html

Mehboob Mufti met the family members of Supinder Kour, a Sikh woman school principal who was killed along with a Hindu teacher by terrorists on Thursday.After meeting Kour’s family members, Mufti said the police stopped PDP from taking out a unity march in view of the targeted killings. In a series of tweets, the PDP leader said the police stopping the attempts to take out the unity march was ironic since the Central government “spreads canards that Kashmiri Muslims don’t stand up for minorities” in the Union territory.“Truth is that this vicious hateful propaganda suits BJPs electoral narrative & prospects,” she tweeted.The Resistance Force (TRF), an offshoot of Pakistan terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba, have claimed responsibility for the recent killings in the Valley, including the murder of a prominent pharmacist Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit. Bindroo was among the few Kashmiri Pandit who didn’t migrate out during the peak of militancy in 1990.Mufti said that the security agencies had prior information about the terror attacks and yet they failed to protect innocent lives. She accused the security grid of being busy organising “normalcy picnic tours” and horse riding for visiting ministers. “Perhaps these attacks could have been averted if their sole focus wasn’t these ministerial visits & normalcy acrobatics,” she wrote.Demanding accountability for the repeated security lapses, the PDP leader said that “heads must roll” as everyone in Kashmir is living in an atmosphere of suppression and fear.“Its been established that security agencies had prior information about such attacks. Yet they failed to protect these innocent lives. Is it because they are too busy devoting all their energies to firing government employees & impounding passports of common Kashmiris?” Mehbooba Mufti tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-have-been-averted-if-mehbooba-mufti-slams-centre-over-targeted-killings-101633692902634.html
08-10-2021||India||Drugs case: Aryan Khan's bail plea rejected, Mumbai court says not maintainable||A court in Mumbai rejected the bail application of Aryan Khan, Arbaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha in connection with a drugs case. They were arrested after the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) raided a cruise ship and seized drugs last week.Metropolitan Magistrate RM Nerlikar rejected the application saying it is not maintainable, which means the forum chosen to seek bail was incorrect.While pleading his Khan's bail, his lawyer Satish Maneshinde told the court that his client is from a respectable family, has roots in the society and won't run away. Maneshinde also presented a number of past judgements while making a case for Aryan Khan's bail.He also contended the NCB's suspicion that Aryan can tamper the evidence if released on bail. "Just because a person belongs to an affluent family, you can't say he is likely to tamper evidence. There are people roaming streets with much more serious offences," said Maneshinde. "I have never used my influence," he added on behalf of Aryan Khan.He also said that no drug was found from Aryan and that he was arrested just on the basis of WhatsApp chats.Khan and others were sent to 14-day judicial custody by a Mumbai court on Thursday despite a plea from the NCB for a remand, which it said was needed to confront him with those being arrested in the case. They have been lodged in Mumbai Arthur Road Jail.Also Read: Why NCB was denied custody?The 23-year-old was arrested along with Merchant, Dhamecha and others after an NCB raid on a cruise ship on October 2 from where the agency recovered drugs. They were detained after the raid last Saturday, and then arrested the next day.Khan and others had filed bail applications immediately after a court verdict on Thursday, but on the request of additional solicitor general Anil Singh, to grant the agency time to react to the bail applications, the court posted the pleas for hearing on Friday.All of them have been booked under section 8C, 20B, 27 read with 35 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, after officers seized 13 gm of cocaine, 21 gm of charas (hasish), 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), 5 gm MD and cash worth ₹1.33 lakh from the cruise ship.8C of NDPS Act refers to prohibition to produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import inter-State, export inter-State, import into India, export from India or tranship any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance while Section 20B deals with punishment for producing, manufacturing, possessing, selling, purchasing, transportation, imports inter-State, exports inter-State or use of cannabis.Meanwhile, NCB Mumbai Director Sameer Wankhede on Thursday said that a total of 18 people, including a Nigerian national, have been arrested in the case. The Nigerian national has been arrested with 40 tablets of Ecstasy, he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-rejected-mumbai-court-says-not-maintainable-101633693102459.html
08-10-2021||India||Plan to induct strategist Prashant Kishor into Congress hits roadblock||Has the proposal to induct election strategist Prashant Kishor into the Congress hit a major roadblock? After a series of meetings that started in the spring of 2020 when Kishor first met party president Sonia Gandhi, and meetings with regional leaders across the country, the plan has now been “put off”, two leaders familiar with the details said. Why? “A trust deficit,” they added on condition of anonymity.This came to the fore in late September, when Congress’ Luizinho Falerio, a former chief minister of Goa, left the party for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and said he met and discussed his options with Kishor, although he added that the political strategist did not ask him to join the TMC.After Kishor’s last meeting with the Congress top brass at least a month ago, the party thought he had “too many demands”, one of the two leaders said.Then, on Friday, Kishor put out a cryptic statement about the party’s recent response to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh where violence erupted after a convoy, including a car belonging to the junior Union minister for home, rammed into a group of farmers, following which irate farmers lynched some of the occupants. Eight people, including four farmers, died in the violence.In an apparent takedown of sections of the party celebrating what they thought was a political win in Lakhimpur Kheri, Kishor said: “People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP- led opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting themselves up for a big disappointment. Unfortunately, there are no quick fix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of GOP,’’ tweeted Kishor.GOP stands for grand old party, a term sometimes used for the Congress.Kishor is credited with helping the TMC win the West Bengal and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham Tamil Nadu elections this year, as well as the Aam Aadmi Party the Delhi polls last year.Also read: Bhupesh Baghel replies to Prashant Kishor, explains what doesn’t have ‘quick-fix’ solutionPeople close to Kishor denied his comments had any bearing on his prospects of joining the Congress, but some in the party reacted sharply. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera responded soon after Kishor tweeted, saying: “There is a difference between tacticians and strategists.’’ Officially, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said that he “didn’t want to comment on the comments of a consultant’’. However, Khera and other Congress leaders were in no mood to entertain Kishor’s explanation that his tweet was a word of caution for those that sought to pitch the Lakhimpur Kheri episode, where Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was detained for two days before achieving her goal of meeting with victims’ families, as a kind of win. According to Team Kishor, he would continue to do this kind of plain-speak even as a Congressman.Still, the tweet comes against the backdrop of Kishor’s meetings with the Congress that do not seem to have made much headway.HT learns that in internal meetings, some Congress leaders have articulated fears about Kishor being a Trojan Horse who would join them, but maybe help his older clients such as the TMC and even the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Others have pointed out that it was strange that while Kishor was meeting the Congress leadership, he was also having extended meetings with NCP founder Sharad Pawar. Kishor was also believed to be involved in talks with Congress leaders in Meghalaya who were considering leaving the party before the high command stepped in to stop them.A Congress leader said that Kishor’s entry looked tough even by the end of August. In the last meeting that took place between him and the leadership, he asked for organisational changes to be made before he joined the party, the first leader familiar with the matter said.“He also asked who he will report to?” added this person. All of this led to many concluding that Kishor was “too difficult’’ and was “imposing too many conditions.’’Kishor did not respond to HT’s queries seeking comment. HT had earlier reported a key meeting on July 22 chaired by Rahul Gandhi, where the consensus was to induct Kishor in a senior role in the Congress. Since then, the tide seems to have turned against Kishor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-induct-strategist-prashant-kishor-into-congress-hits-roadblock-101633693040007.html

His father and Union minister Ajay Mishra 'Teni' said that happened due to the health reasons, according to news agency ANI. "He got a notice on Thursday but he said he was not well. He will appear before the police tomorrow," the Union minister of state for home affairs further added.This comes as the Crime Branch of Uttar Pradesh Police pasted fresh notice at the house of the minister, asking his son to appear for questioning at 11am tomorrow. Ashish has been summoned for his alleged involvement in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people were killed after an SUV ran over farmers on October 3. He was supposed to record his statement on Friday morning, but missed the deadline.According to the latest notice by police, legal action will be initiated against Ashish Mishra if he fails to appear before the investigators on Saturday.According to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of various farmers unions, Ashish Mishra was sitting in the car that drove over farmers, while they were coming out of a protest. They were protesting against the Centre's three agricultural laws that were enacted in September last year.However, the Union minister has refuted allegations and said he was not present at the spot at the time of the incident. Earlier in the day as well, Ajay Mishra reiterated that his son is "innocent.""There is no video. We have issued numbers, and if anyone has evidence, they can upload it. All will be crystal clear," the minister also said, adding, "there will be no injustice with anyone. No one will be allowed to take the law in their hand."Responding to the Opposition's relentless attack on him and demand for his resignation, the minister said, "they can demand anything." "This is a BJP government that works in an unbiased manner. Action will be taken against those found guilty," he said at the Lucknow airport, according to news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-son-is-innocent-reiterates-union-minister-ajay-mishra-amid-row-over-lakhimpur-violence-101633691041421.html

A former court staff, Dinesh Chand Sharma, was also convicted in the case.Chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma had reserved the order on Thursday after the conclusion of final arguments in the matter.The case is related to tampering with the evidence of the fire tragedy in which 59 lives were lost. The Ansals were convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by the Supreme Court.The apex court had, however, released them on the period already undergone in the jail on the condition that they paid ₹30 crore fine each to be used for building a trauma centre in the national capital.The Ansal brothers along with Sharma, and other individuals -- PP Batra, Har Swaroop Panwar, Anoop Singh, and Dharamvir Malhotra -- were booked in the present case.Panwar and Malhotra died during the course of the trial.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for the complainant Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT), told the court on Thursday that Ansals and HS Panwar had hatched a criminal conspiracy of the destruction of the most vital piece of evidence collected by the CBI against them in the main Uphaar case.“The documents were handpicked and were tampered with, mutilated, torn and some also went missing,” he told the court.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uphaar-fire-tragedy-delhi-court-convicts-ansal-brothers-for-tampering-evidence-101633690979713.html

Congress leader and Chhattishgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel replied to that advice and said the thing which actually does not have a quick-fix solution is the attempt to "become a national alternative". His tweet was aimed at Prashant Kishor and also Trinamool Congress and its chief Mamata Banerjee."People looking for a 'national' alternative based on poaching INC functionaries who can’t win even their own seats is in for a big disappointment. Unfortunately, to become a national alternative deep-rooted and concerted efforts are needed and there are no quick-fix solutions," the Chhattisgarh chief minister said. People looking for a “national” alternative based on poaching INC functionaries who can’t win even their own seats is in for a big disappointment.Unfortunately, to become a national alternative deep-rooted and concerted efforts are needed and there are no quick- fix solutions.Prashant Kishor was speculated to join the Congress after he met Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi in July. Then there were rumours that a section of Congress leaders was not in agreement with Prashant Kishor's induction in the party.

He also urged the Elon Musk-headed company to export its cars manufactured in India."I have told Tesla that don't sell electric cars in India which your company has manufactured in China. You should manufacture electric cars in India, and also export cars from India," he said, adding Tesla had been assured of all necessary support from the Indian government.Tesla has been asking for a reduction in import duties in India. Musk, its CEO, had earlier taken to Twitter to state that Tesla’s plans to bring EVs to India were hampered by high import duties charged in the country."We want to do so, but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country!" Musk had written.The Indian government levies a 100 per cent import duty on cars as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60-100 per cent, depending on engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above $40,000. The duties are aimed at protecting domestic manufacturers, and so far, the government’s stance has remained unchanged despite Musk’s open appeal. "I'm told import duties are extremely high (up to 100 per cent), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable," he had earlier tweeted in 2019.The pioneer carmaker had also written to the Union road ministry that the effective import tariff of 110 percent on vehicles with customs value above $40,000 was "prohibitive" to zero-emission vehicles. Musk had also said India treated clean energy vehicles the same way as it did with diesel or petrol cars, “which does not seem entirely consistent with the climate goals of India.”The company had asked the government to standardise tariffs on EVs and withdraw the social welfare surcharge levied on them, insisting that it would benefit the EV ecosystem in the country without damaging domestic interest.Gadkari said he was holding dialogues with Tesla officials regarding the company's demand related to tax concessions. Last month, the Union minister had asked Tesla to start manufacturing in India before any tax concessions can be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-sell-china-made-evs-in-india-nitin-gadkari-tells-elon-musk-s-tesla-101633686831688.html

When interrogated, Thakkar told DRI sleuths that he has given his firm’s Import Export Code to another businessman, Jayesh Sanghvi, from Navi Mumbai who offered to give him 10,000 Rials on every import order from Iran.Thakkar claimed that he has been doing business with Sanghvi for over a decade, hence he trusted him and claimed that he did not have any idea that the container had a narcotics consignment.On the basis of information provided by Thakkar, DRI officials arrested Sanghvi from Navi Mumbai on Wednesday. He has been booked under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, and was remanded to DRI custody till October 11 by a local court.People at the DRI said that Sanghvi could be part of a larger syndicate and was entrusted with the responsibility of smuggling the drugs in India via sea route.

Citing sources, news agency ANI said the order will be issued soon.The UK government took time to consider Indians double-vaccinated with Covishield as fully vaccinated people. In its new travel rules that came into effect from October 4 onwards, it said it recognises Covishield but not the vaccine certificate given in India. Hence, people vaccinated with Covishield arriving in the UK after October 4 had to undergo 10-day mandatory quarantine.Will accept India’s vaccine certificate, says UK days after Delhi’s tit-for-tatIndia took a likewise measure and made quarantine mandatory for passengers coming to India from the UK, while both countries remained engaged in talks over easing the travel restrictions. On Thursday, British high commissioner in India Alex Ellis said the UK government has revised the travel rules and from October 11, Indians vaccinated with two doses of Covishield will no longer be required to quarantine. India is likely to announce similar measures before October 11.The UK-India travel tussle has been going on for the past few weeks after the UK government's new travel rules, which drew flak from India. India termed the rules as discriminatory as Covishield, manufactured by Pune's Serum Institute of India, is just a formulation of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine. India had also exported Covishield to the UK, the government said. When the UK side said that it does not have any problem with the vaccine, but with the vaccine certificates, India said its vaccine certificates generated by Co-WIN maintains international standards.India's restriction on UK travellers was a retaliatory move as the government had earlier warned foreign nations. India has so far not imposed any restriction on vaccinated people coming from any other country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-relax-quarantine-rules-for-uk-travellers-after-covishield-move-report-101633684256309.html

Suresh’s mother moved the court in July arguing such charges can only be invoked against habitual offenders and not someone facing the first such case.A division bench of Justices A K Jayashankaran Nambiar and C P Mohammad Nias quashed the charges, but Suresh will remain in judicial custody as other cases are pending against her.The petition filed through counsel Sooraj T E challenged Suresh’s custody and said it was “illegal, arbitrary and vitiated by improper application of mind”. It added usually habitual offenders will come under its ambit and Suresh was wrongly included on the list. The court overruled the customs department’s objections while quashing the charges. The charges have also been invoked against Sandeep Nair, the other accused in the case.Suresh and Nair were booked when 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings was seized from a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage for the United Arab Emirates Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency, which arrested Suresh and Nair.A multi-agency team is now probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far. One of the alleged accused, Rabins Hameed, was extradited from the UAE. Another suspect Faizal Fareed is still at large.Kerala chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar was arrested in the case. Sivasankar, who was later suspended, has since been granted bail.Four central agencies have failed to make much headway in the case other than initial arrests. The main beneficiaries and dispatchers are at large. The union and state governments were involved in a tussle over the matter. The state government even constituted a judicial commission against the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a first of its sort, saying there was an alleged attempt to implicate chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The high court quashed the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-quashes-charges-slapped-on-kerala-s-gold-smuggling-accused-101633683669580.html

The chats that the Narcotics Control Bureau has been referring to took place when Aryan Khan was abroad."I am a 23-year-old with no prior antecedents. I happen to be from Bollywood. I went on an invitation, refused when asked if I have drugs. They were honest not to accuse me of anything else.

I have an Indian passport and I am not going to abscond. There is no question of tampering," lawyer Satish Maneshinde said."Search and seizure can not be cited just to lock me up in the jail.

08-10-2021||India||Govt develops application ecosystem to expedite procurement of farmers’ produce||The Department of Food and Public Distribution’s recently developed application ecosystem will allow the integration of all state governments procurement portals having Minimum Threshold Parameters (MTPs) for monitoring and strategic decision making, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution said in a statement on Thursday. The ministry said, “This process began with the onset of KMS 2021-22 in October 2021. The introduction of Minimum Threshold Parameters (MTPs) in procurement operations are necessitated to avoid middlemen in procurement and ensure that farmers get the best value for their produce.”The move is expected to expedite the reconciliation of procurement figures with states and the release of funds by the central government to the states.The application ecosystem will particularly benefit the farmers and procuring agencies, the ministry said. Farmers will be able to sell their produce at suitable prices and avoid “distress sale”. With better management of procurement operations, the state agencies and FCI will be able to procure efficiently despite limited resources. In addition, the automation and standardization of procurement operations will provide “an integrated view of procurement of foodgrains and its storage in godowns.”There are several Minimum Threshold Parameters that must be captured in all the procurement portals to ensure uniformity. These include online registration of farmers and sharecroppers with all relevant details, integration of registered farmers’ data with states’ land record portal, and online payment through Expenditure Advance Transfer (EAT) module of PFMS which will ensure direct and speedy transfer of MSP to farmers. Due to context-specific variations in the procurement systems across different states, there were systemic and implementation challenges for enforcing the schemes of the Central Government. The ministry said that reconciliation of the procurement operations with various states is sometimes a long-drawn exercise, causing avoidable delays in the release of funds to the states. Non-standard procurement operations add to the avoidable inefficiencies, which the ministry noted, “manifest in the form of middlemen in the procurement operations.”“Standardization of the operations are essential in helping the country achieve greater levels of transparency and efficiency in procurement operations, which ultimately lead to ensuring food security for the people of the country,” the ministry said.The ministry also highlighted that the government has sensitized state governments and other public procuring agencies over multiple forums on the need for MTP compliance for procurement operations The ministry also highlighted that the government has sensitized state governments and other public procuring agencies over multiple forums on the need for MTP compliance for procurement operations and its integration with the central portal, namely Central Food Grains Procurement Portal (CFPP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-develops-application-ecosystem-to-expedite-procurement-of-farmers-produce-101633681630147.html

"A young man (Ashish Mishra) who is being targeted has been given notice and he will appear tomorrow at 11am," Advocate Harish Salve, who was arguing from the state government's side, told the top court.A countrywide outrage erupted after eight people were killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri district, while farmers were staging a protest against the Centre's three laws. The deceased in the case include four farmers and a journalist. The incident led to massive backlash for the UP government which is led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Yogi Adityanath.During the hearing, the court also expressed its dissatisfaction over the investigation conducted by the state government in the case, so far. It then ordered the UP government to apprise the top court of an alternative agency that can conduct the probe.A bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana also asked the UP government to direct its state police chief to ensure that the evidence in the case is protected till the time another agency takes over.The top court also questioned the state government over not arresting the accused against whom FIR has been lodged. It then asked whether it treats "accused the same way in other murder cases in the country." "What is the message you are sending," asked the bench, which also comprises Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The Supreme court has posted the matter for hearing on October 20.On October 3, a group of farmers was coming back after holding a protest against the Centre's three farm laws when a SUV ran over them. Farmers allege that the Union minister's son Ashish was sitting in the car when it ran over protesters. But, Ajay Mishra has denied the allegations, claiming that his son was not present at the spot when the incident took place. Some miscreants mingled with protesting farmers and pelted the stones at the car which led to the 'unfortunate incident,' Ajay Mishra has claimed.Police are investigating the case and a First Information Report (FIR) under section 302 of the IPC has been registered against Ashish Mishra and others in Tikonia police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-satisfied-with-up-govt-probe-in-lakhimpur-kheri-case-supreme-court-101633680591946.html

They have challenged a lower court’s order handing over Amitesh Harmukh, 29, to the IAF.Harmukh was arrested after his 28-year-old colleague filed a First Information Report (FIR) on September 20 saying she was unhappy with the manner in which her case was handled. A women police station carried out preliminary inquiries and arrested Harmukh on September 25. Harmukh challenged his arrest and the IAF too argued the local police have no jurisdiction in the case. The IAF maintained the complainant and the accused belong to the armed forces and therefore were subject to the Air Force Act. The lower court on September 30 allowed the IAF to take Harmukh’s custody for a court-martial.“The investigation on the woman’s complaint is still with us. The case was not handed over,” said a police officer. The investigation officer in the case on Thursday filed a revision petition in the Court of Principal District and Sessions Judge against the order of a magistrate handing over Harmukh to the IAF. “The revision application is to set aside the order of the magistrate and to keep the accused in judicial custody. And subsequently to direct the judicial magistrate to pass orders on the police custody application,” the officer said.The 28-year-old has accused the IAF doctors of subjecting her to the banned two-finger test. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari on October 5 denied the test was conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coimbatore-police-challenge-iaf-custody-of-officer-accused-of-rape-101633679530061.html

08-10-2021||India||Passengers miss flights due to overcrowding at Mumbai airport’s terminal 2||Many passengers missed their flights due to overcrowding at terminal 2 (T2) of Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Friday. There has been an increased footfall at the terminal as the Covid cases have begun decreasing. The airport management said the number of passengers at the airport increased by over 269% in August compared to May.An airport official said it has become difficult to manage the passenger load from 6 am to 11 am daily. “This only gets worse over weekends and today’s situation is just one of the examples,” said the official.Spandan Sharma, a Mumbai resident who was to depart for Hyderabad at 7.20 am said, “I checked in at 6 am for my departure but missed my flight as I took over 50 minutes to clear the security. The airline refused to take me on board as I reached the gate 10 minutes before the departure.” Sharma, who had a connecting flight, said he had to undergo the same process again to take another flight for urgent work.“I was not alone. Another group of people also missed the same flight. There were passengers for other flights too, who missed them due to poor management and then lack of coordination between the airlines and the airport.”A CSMIA spokesperson said, “With the onset of the festive season, there has been a surge in passenger traffic and a sudden spike witnessed at CSMIA this morning. Similar experiences have also been witnessed in other city airports of the country. Further owing to recent intelligence reports received by stakeholders and threat at another airport in the state, security measures have been further enhanced at CSMIA. The security and safety of our passengers are of utmost priority and our endeavour is to continue to not compromise on these critical aspects.” “CSMIA airport has deployed additional staff for a quicker turnaround at all the security checkpoints for a smoother passenger experience. Additionally, CSMIA is following all the COVID protocols laid down by the government to ensure a smoother transition. CSMIA regrets the inconvenience caused to any passengers and is offering them all the support required. In addition, in keeping with the growing increase of passenger traffic and to ensure a seamless service experience, CSMIA has planned to open Terminal 1 operations from 20th October, 2021,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rush-at-mumbai-airport-passengers-miss-flights-101633677489790.html

Ali died on the spot.“Yasir Ali killed by security forces at a check point in South Kashmir last night. A heightened state of alert cannot be a reason to open fire like this. Senior officers of the security forces need to ensure calmer heads prevail & nothing happens to worsen the situation,” said Omar Abdullah. Police said that the CRPF fired in self-defence. The civilian killed hasn’t been identified yet. The incident took place at Monghal Bridge in Anantnag when troopers of 40 battalion CRPF fired on a Scorpio vehicle that didn’t stop at a checking point.“A Naka (check point) was established by 40Bn CRPF at Monghal Bridge. A suspected vehicle without a number was signalled to stop by the Naka party, however, it rushed towards the Naka party. It was then challenged by the on-duty troops,” Police spokesman said in a statement. “Troops fired upon in self-defence in which one person died. But the driver of the vehicle managed to escape from the spot. Identification and credentials of the deceased person are being verified. An investigation is going on,” the spokesman added.“This appears to be the start of a knee jerk reaction to what has transpired during last two days. Disproportionate force has been used by CRPF which has resulted in this innocent civilian’s death. Will there be any action against the trigger happy personnel?” Mufti tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-be-a-reason-omar-abdullah-condemns-killing-of-youth-by-crpf-101633676949003.html

A police officer said Mishra is still untraceable.The Lakhimpur Kheri police on Thursday pasted a notice at the minister’s residence asking his son to appear at the crime branch office, Lakhimpur Kheri, at 10 am on Friday. The notice said Mishra must appear in person.A second police officer said so far there has been no communication from Mishra in connection with the summon issued to him for cooperation in the investigation. “The seven-member investigation committee, headed by deputy inspector general...Upendra Agarwal, is discussing the further course of action,” he said.Also read: On Lakhimpur Kheri incident, ex-ally Harsimrat Badal’s warning to BJPTwo people, identified as Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, were arrested in connection with the violence on Thursday.

08-10-2021||India||Reserve Bank of India keeps interest rates unchanged at record low—4%||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday announced the October bi-monthly monetary policy of the central bank, keeping the repo rate unchanged at 4% for the eighth straight meeting.The six-member monetary policy committee of the bank voted 5-1 to maintain an accommodative stance to push and sustain nascent growth recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy.The benchmark repo rate was unchanged at 4%, while the reverse repo rate too stood unchanged at 3.35%. The central bank governor said the panel expected inflation to remain within the target of 6% as the upper limit.“The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,” the bank latest monetary policy resolution said.The repo rate refers to the rate at which commercial banks borrow money by selling their securities to Reserve Bank, while the reverse repo rate is the rate at which the central bank borrows money.These lending rates are key to boosting credit and investments by businesses in the economy as India pushes its nascent economic recovery following the pandemic.“We don’t want to rock the boat when the shore is near as there is a journey beyond the shores,” Das said. “To lose patience is to lose the battle.”Food inflation is expected to remain muted in the coming month on the back of record production of foodgrains, the RBI Governor said.The RBI has cut the repo rate by 115 basis points (bps) since March 2020 to cushion the blow of the pandemic. This followed a 135-bps worth of rate cuts since the beginning of 2019.A widely watched forecast by 30 economists for Bloomberg on Wednesday expected the six-member monetary policy committee to leave the repurchase rate at 4%.The RBI has maintained its FY2021-22 GDP growth forecast at 9.5%, including 7.9% in the second quarter, 6.8% in the third quarter, and 6.1% in quarter four. For the first quarter of 2021-22, GDP growth has been pegged at 17.2%.Price rise is a key determinant of monetary policies. Moderate inflation helps the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low to spur economic activity, which has been hit by the pandemic.Retail prices have been trending lower in the past two months. The central bank also projected a consumer price inflation of 5.3% for the current fiscal year. In Q2, it is seen at 5.1%, 4.5% in Q3, and 5.8% in Q4.The accommodative stance is jargon that refers to the central bank’s decision to either not increasing lending rates or keeping them low. Moderate inflation is necessary to keeping lending rates cheap, which helps boost a pandemic-ravaged economy.On inflation, the governor said inflation had been below the RBI’s projections. He said core inflation (which excludes the volatile components of food and fuel) however “remains sticky”, meaning they aren’t budging much from their usual levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reserve-bank-keeps-key-rates-unchanged-at-4-101633675809679.html

08-10-2021||India||Three IAF units get Air chief’s citation for Ladakh role||Three units of the Indian Air Force were on Friday awarded the Chief of Air Staff’s ‘unit citation’ for their role in strengthening India’s military posture in eastern Ladakh after a border row erupted with China last year, officials familiar with the development said on Friday. These units are No. 47 Squadron equipped with upgraded MiG-29 fighters, the 116 Helicopter Unit consisting of advanced light helicopter Mark IV (ALH Mk IV) Rudra and 2255 Squadron Det which operates the OSA-AK-M surface-to-air weapon, the officials said. It is customary for the IAF to announce ‘unit citations’ on IAF Day (October 8). India and China have been locked in a border standoff for 17 months and both sides are carrying out negotiations to reduce tensions. “In May 2020, the No. 47 Squadron was deployed for air defence as well as air-to-ground operations in the northern sector, and carried out extensive operations at high altitude,” said one of the citations. After the February 2019 Balakot airstrikes by the IAF, the MiG-29 squadron was deployed in an air defence role and flew extensively to ensure that there was no misadventure by Pakistan. After the Galwan Valley skirmish in June 2020, the 116 Helicopter Unit was deployed for offensive operations at a high-altitude airfield in the Ladakh area. “The unit quickly established the first-ever high-altitude attack helicopter detachment in the region and executed day and night operations, including air-to-ground weapons delivery at high altitude,” said another citation. Also read: No Chinese soldier detained, no structural damage - Govt on Tawang standoffA trust deficit persists between the Indian and Chinese armies after their soldiers were involved in the brutal clash along the contested LAC. The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along LAC in more than five decades, and it pushed the bilateral relationship to a breaking point - it left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead. The 2255 Squadron Det was mobilised for air defence activation in Ladakh following the Galwan Valley skirmish. “Since then, the squadron has undertaken various innovations to sustain serviceability and reliability of its equipment. This has enabled it to maintain its operational readiness in harsh climatic conditions,” said a third citation. The IAF played a critical role when border tensions with China peaked last year. It projected its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the sensitive sector, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers. IAF also deployed its new Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region. The air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms that have operated in the Ladakh sector. IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft were used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the sector, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft have undertaken sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector to support the military’s forward deployments. The IAF also flew the army’s K9 Vajra-T self-propelled artillery guns to Ladakh earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-iaf-units-get-air-chief-s-citation-for-ladakh-role-101633674487857.html

The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Haryana's Panchkula also convicted four others in the case and said that the quantum of sentence will be pronounced on October 12, i.e. next Tuesday.Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra. As per the CBI, he was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter highlighting the sexual exploitation of female disciples on the Dera premises.Also Read | Ranjit Singh murder case: HC dismisses plea for transfer of trial; says allegations imaginaryRam Rahim was sentenced in August 2017 to 20 years of imprisonment in connection with raping two of his women followers and the murder of a journalist. He is currently lodged in Rohtak’s Sunaria jail serving a life term.There are mainly three cases of the period 2002-03 registered against the Sirsa-based Dera chief. In two cases, one related to sexual exploitation of female disciples and the second of the murder of a journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, Ram Rahim has been convicted. The third case is of Ranjit Singh’s murder. Earlier this month, the Punjab and Haryana high court dismissed a plea seeking transfer of trial in the Ranjit Singh murder case terming the allegations imaginary and based on surmises and conjectures.The high court bench observed that on mere apprehension trial cannot be transferred and that apprehension must be reasonable and not imaginary. The power of transfer is to be sparingly exercised. Thus, the trial court was granted the power to pronounce judgment, which it exercised on Friday convicting Ram Rahim and four others in the Rajit Singh murder case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-court-holds-dera-chief-gurmeet-ram-rahim-guilty-in-ranjit-singh-murder-case-101633666996770.html

They had to write to the authorities to provide them security. But they were told to stay put in the Kheer Bhawani (Temple) complex,” the employee said.Panun Kashmir, an organisation of the displaced people that seeks a separate homeland for them in Kashmir, held a protest in Jammu on Thursday demanding action against the targeted killings.Ajay Chrungoo, Chairman of Panun Kashmir, blamed the killings on the government’s “failure to recognise these attacks as genocide”.“The government of India has failed to admit that there is a genocide in Kashmir. They have normalised the killings. They need to take immediate steps to bring a law against genocide and pave the way for its reversal,” he said.Over the last year, terrorists have also gunned down Ajay Bharti Pandita, a sarpanch, Akash Mehra, whose family ran Krishna Dhabha in Srinagar, Satpal Nischal, a jeweller, Shanker Chowdhary, a labourer, Rakesh Pandita, the chairman of the Tral Municipal Council.“There has also been desecration of temples and places of worship. Recently, there were pictures of how the Barghshikha Temple at Mattan (in Anantnag) was desecrated; all this was done to create fear,” said the Anantnag resident quoted above.A resident of Srinagar said the government failed to take note of the vituperative posts on social media that explicitly called for not allowing non-locals to work and reside in the Valley. “These posts are all over social media platforms. They contribute to the atmosphere of fear. I know families that have been staying outside Srinagar for decades but are now packing their bags to leave,” the resident said.A government official, not wishing to be named, said the security agencies had been on the watch and will take all precautions to address the concerns of the minority communities.Following reports that Hindu and Sikh families in the Valley have begun migrating, the administration said it has taken steps to reach out to the families, assuring them of protection.“Directions have been given to all the district commissioners to ensure that security is provided to all those who are asking for it. Some people in places such as Vessu in Anantnag district and in Kulgam district asked to be moved to safer locations such as government guest houses. We are making arrangements for moving them too,” said a second official on condition of anonymity.The official added contrary to reports not many families are moving out. “In Mattan, there are about 180 families, and the deputy commissioner has been in touch with them,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/administration-didn-t-take-measures-to-ensure-their-safety-kashmiri-pandit-organisations-101633672088658.html

08-10-2021||India||Bharat Biotech to produce world’s first malaria vaccine||India’s Bharat Biotech will be producing part of the world’s only malaria vaccine that has been developed by Pharma major GSK, and was recently approved by WHO (World Health Organisation). However, it may take a couple of years before the vaccine is launched in the market for use.In January, this year, Hyderabad-based vaccine major announced that it entered a product transfer partnership with the pharma major GSK for its malaria vaccine, RTS, S/AS01E1. As part of this partnership, GSK would transfer RTS manufacturing technology to Bharat Biotech to produce the S antigen component of the malaria vaccine, and the license on all rights pertaining to it.GSK will retain the production of the adjuvant of the vaccine (AS01E) and will supply it to Bharat Biotech.“The agreement recognises the track record and expertise of BBIL in developing and supplying vaccines against infectious diseases, including as an established supplier of global health vaccines to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and to UNICEF. BBIL was selected through a comprehensive, competitive process undertaken by GSK and PATH, working in consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO),” read a joint statement issued by both the partners in January.The RTS, S/AS01E malaria vaccine, developed by GSK for more than 30 years, and in partnership with PATH since 2001, has been piloted in regions of Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi under the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).“This agreement with BBIL is the result of efforts by GSK, PATH, and WHO to help ensure long-term sustainable vaccine supply, in the event of a WHO policy recommendation for broader use and a commitment of sustained funding,” the statement further read.On Wednesday, WHO recommended widespread use of the malaria vaccine among children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The recommendation is based on results from the ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has reached more than 800 000 children since 2019.According to the joint statement issued earlier, GSK committed to donate up to 10 million RTS, S/AS01E doses for use in the pilot, and to supply up to 15 million doses annually until 2028 if the product was recommended for wider use by WHO.

Peace and tranquillity in these areas of differing perceptions has been possible by adherence to existing agreements and protocols between the two countries," one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.Another official further said that both the sides have been undertaking patrolling activities upto their line of perception, adding that whenever patrols of both sides physically meet, the situation is managed according to established protocols and mechanisms agreed by both sides.Physical engagement can last for a few hours prior to disengaging as per mutual understanding, said the officials, asking not to be named.The latest incident comes days ahead of the next round of military talks with the PLA, which is scheduled to take place on October 12. These talks are being held to reduce tensions along LAC, where both the countries have been engaged in the stand-off for the last 17 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-chinese-soldier-detained-no-structural-damage-govt-on-tawang-standoff-101633669894869.html
08-10-2021||India||Ahead of LAC talks, Indian and Chinese soldiers face-off in Arunachal Pradesh||Scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh’s sensitive Tawang sector last week, officials familiar with the development said on Friday. The latest confrontation comes at a time when both sides are planning to hold the next round of military talks to cool tensions in the Ladakh sector. The face-off took place when rival patrols came face-to-face in a contested area near Yangtse, with the soldiers asking each other to retreat to their respective sides, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named. “The face-off lasted a few hours before the matter was resolved at the level of local commanders,” said a second official. “Both sides undertake patrolling activities up to their perception of the border. Whenever patrols of both sides physically meet, the situation is managed according to established protocols and mechanisms. Physical engagement can last for a few hours prior to disengaging as per mutual understanding. This is routine business,” he said. The latest incident came weeks after Chinese patrols consisting of around 100 soldiers crossed LAC in the central sector in Uttarakhand on August 30 and damaged a footbridge before they went back to the other side. The area in which the intrusion took place is manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. “PLA plans to keep the entire border active so that they can keep reinforcing their claims. It can also be an act of creeping assertiveness to subsequently lay a claim to these areas,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). Last week, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that the next round of military talks with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to reduce tensions along LAC in eastern Ladakh could take place in the second week of October. He said the situation on the LAC was under control and outstanding problems with PLA could be resolved through talks. The two armies have been locked in a border standoff for almost 17 months and both sides are carrying out negotiations to reduce tensions. Outstanding problems at Hot Springs, or Patrolling Point-15, which is one of the friction points on the LAC, could be taken up during the 13th round of talks, as previously reported by HT. The rival armies carried out the second round of disengagement in early August when both sides pulled back their forward-deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrolling Point-17A, with the breakthrough coming after the 12th round of military talks. Earlier, India and China wrapped up the disengagement process in Pangong Tso area in mid-February, with their armies pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the LAC after 45 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-soldiers-face-off-in-arunachal-pradesh-ahead-of-lac-talks-101633669508576.html
08-10-2021||India||Air India pilots seek full layover allowance and on time||Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), the Boeing pilots’ union of Air India, on Thursday wrote to the airline’s operations head seeking reinstatement of the layover allowance cut by around 70% at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The allowance is over and above the salary that pilots get during a layover to cover the expenses. The pilots have not even been paid the deducted amount from five months even as they have also faced pay cuts. They added the last layover sustenance allowance was paid in May 2021.“As we commence the month of October and as pilots proceed on assigned international layovers, our members who man the widebody fleet are most affected and are now forced to fend for themselves abroad with no financial support whatsoever from the company. We are over four months delayed on the layover sustenance allowance (LSA) and for some time now, we have been forced to spend from our savings to sustain our stay abroad,” the IPG said in its letter.It added they will continue to cooperate with the company in its difficult phase and hence request that the matter be urgently taken up at the earliest. Air India pilots have earlier raised the issue of pay cuts and highlighted the mental stress it was causing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilots-seek-full-layover-allowance-101633668488127.html

It, however, stressed that this does not imply that such a high number of infections will be reported in the future."The dynamics of the virus after vaccination and infection which can lead to herd immunity...we do not have a straight formula for that. As one can see, despite the administration of vaccines, cases are being reported and we are still learning. The preparation will be of the level to make us safe. We move with preparation of 4.5 to 5 lakh cases per day surge but it does not mean that it will happen, should happen or may happen," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said at a press conference on Thursday.Paul further said there is no issue of Covid-19 vaccine availability in the country now and urged people to come forward to take the second dose to be fully vaccinated.Speaking about the different strains of Covid-19, Paul said that there is no new variant of concern as per the data available at present.Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said the government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure full preparedness to tackle any surge, adding that three months are very crucial in the country's fight against Covid-19."Please watch your October, November, December," Agarwal said, warning people about the threat of Covid-19 resurgence during the coming festivals such as Dussehra, Diwali, Durga Puja, Milan-un-Id and Christmas and wedding season.He asserted repeatedly that the second wave of the pandemic is not over, highlighting that the country is still reporting as high as 20,000-odd new infections every day.While overall Covid-19 positivity across the country gives comfort, Agarwal pointed out that there are still a large number of districts reporting high case positivity.He said five states - Mizoram, Kerala, Sikkim, Manipur and Meghalaya - are reporting a weekly positivity rate of more than five per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prepared-to-handle-surge-of-5-lakh-covid-19-cases-a-day-govt-101633667748149.html

In July, 10.5 lakh tourists came to Jammu and Kashmir. The figure was 11.28 lakhs in August, and in September, the numbers crossed 12 lakhs.

08-10-2021||India||Indian Railways: Ticket rates go up at select stations in Mumbai; check new fare||The Indian Railways announced that it has increased the fare price of platform tickets at select major railway stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The decision, taken by the Central Railways (CR) zone of Indian Railways, was made in order to avoid overcrowding with the onset of the festive season amid the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.A platform ticket that used to cost ₹10 will now be sold at ₹50 at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Dadar and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Mumbai, as well as at railway stations in neighbouring Thane, Kalyan, and Panvel of the Mumbai division, an official said on Thursday.The new ticket fare came into effect this morning at the aforementioned railway stations. Meanwhile, the Western Railway is yet to take a decision on the same for stations under its jurisdiction.“This has been done to curb the excessive rush at platforms and railway stations and also concourses and terminus during the festive season," an official statement of the Central Railway zone read.The railways, however, clarified that this is a “temporary” measure towards a "short-term crowd control" for stations that usually witness heavy rush to prevent a surge in coronavirus cases in the region. The statement added that this has been in practice for years and that “there is nothing new about it”.Mumbai city reported 453 fresh Covid-19 cases and five deaths in the last 24 hours. In total, 7,47,156 cases and 16,141 deaths have been recorded in the metropolis. At the same time, the MMR division, which comprises Mumbai and its satellite townships, logged 995 cases and seven deaths in the past one day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-ticket-rates-go-up-at-select-stations-in-mumbai-check-new-fare-101633661911202.html

While asking the security agencies to dispatch their CT experts to Kashmir, Shah gave firm instructions to bring the perpetrators to book.Intelligence Bureau’s head of CT operations Tapan Deka is going to the Valley today to personally supervise the fight against terrorists while CT teams of other national security agencies have already reached Kashmir to act as force multipliers to Jammu and Kashmir police.The attacks come at a time when tourists from Indian hinterland are thronging the Valley with all the hotels showing 100 per cent occupancy and Srinagar humming with economic activity.According to security agencies, the recent spurt of violence is a manifestation of confidence of Pakistan based groups following the capture of Kabul by ultra conservative Taliban and the appointment of new ISI chief in Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum. With Afghanistan under Rawalpindi’s thumb, the new focus is Kashmir with the mission not to allow minorities to return to the Valley by targeting those who have the audacity to return to Kashmir.Top security officials say that the weapons used in recent killings are pistols, which may have been dropped in the upper reaches of the Valley through drones from across the border. “The bigger worry is when US sniper rifles and area weapons will be brought into the Valley by the Pakistani jihadists in the coming days from Afghanistan,” said a senior police official.While the present terror module may be neutralised in the coming days, it is quite evident that Pakistan will ratchet up pressure on Kashmir with the intention of pushing the Modi government towards the restoration of articles 370 and 35A and roll-back the August 5, 2019 creation of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The latter is also the demand of Valley based political parties, who are also advocates of India talking to Pakistan for peace in Kashmir.However, the Modi government is in no mood to bow down before the Pakistan based terror groups with home minister Shah asking the security agencies and para-military forces to take on the attackers without any delay and bring normalcy to the Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-firm-on-valley-violence-sends-experts-to-neutralise-terrorists-101633663652735.html

He even spoofed (falsified his caller ID) calls he made to the teachers, pretending to be different students, using voice changing apps. Police say he also created fake profiles of the minors on Instagram, and that the number of minors and teachers harassed by him number around 50.Sagar Singh Kalsi, DCP (north) said that the man, identified as Mahavir Kumar, has been cyber-stalking women and girls in the school since 2019 , although his activities intensified after classes went online.Kalsi added that on August 6, police received a complaint from the principal of a prominent private school in north Delhi over the cyber-stalking of students.It emerged during the investigation that Kumar befriended one student of the school in 2019 and then, over time, several more. When classes went online, some of the girls themselves sent him links. Meanwhile, he also started harassing and threatening the girls. The girls then complained to the school.A police officer said that when the school authorities confronted the man, he showed them screen grabs of his chat with the girls, wherein the girls themselves had given him the links to their classes. The girls were then suspended but the young man kept hacking into the online classes, which is when finally the school authorities reached out to police.“The man was stalking minor girls and also called teachers from different international numbers. The stalker was also spoofing numbers and calling teachers from the number of the students. The stalker entered WhatsApp groups without permission of the admin and changed icons. He also posted morphed photographs of many students on different social media platforms,” said DCP Kalsi.Delhi Police registered a case on Wednesday. During their investigation they found that stalker used at least 33 different virtual WhatsApp numbers to harass the students and teachers.“We analysed the details of the IP logs of WhatsApp, Instagram and the email ids used to create the accounts. Through technical surveillance, we traced the suspect and arrested him from his house in Patna, Bihar,” added DCP Kalsi.Police said they have started questioning Kumar, who has been brought to Delhi.Kumar comes from a middle-class family of four, and his parents and elder sister had no clue he was up to something like this, police said. “He used to stay at home as his on-campus classes had not started yet. He was a second year B.Tech student,” said one police officer.Spokespersons from IIT-Kharagpur did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iitk-student-stalked-minors-teachers-in-north-delhi-school-101633641164483.html

08-10-2021||India||Sabyasachi Dutta back in TMC: Party MP says workers aggrieved by return of those who insulted Mamata||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday saw rumblings after Sabyasachi Dutta, former legislator from Rajarhat-New Town constituency, returned to the party fold after spending over two years in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Our workers feel aggrieved when people who insulted Mamata Banerjee in the recent assembly polls make a comeback. Isn’t it natural that sincere party workers will feel disappointed to see people returning to become leaders again after opposing us till the other day,” TMC’s senior Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said without naming anyone.Dutta, who was one of the state secretaries of the BJP, rejoined the TMC at parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee’s chamber in the state assembly, shortly after West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar administered the oath of office to party chief Mamata Banerjee and two others -- Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam -- as legislators. They won the polls held on September 30.“I took an emotional decision and joined the BJP after some misunderstanding with my colleagues. I will earnestly serve the TMC in whatever role it gives me,” Dutta said after joining the TMC. Transport minister Firhad Hakim was also present on the occasion.“This is homecoming for Sabyasachi,” said Chatterjee.Meanwhile, without taking Dutta’s name, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh took a dig at the BJP. “Let the BJP realise the effect of welcoming someone amid great hype and making him a state committee secretary. Did BJP think that it could win polls in Salt Lake? People who have realised that they have no existence outside the TMC and cannot survive without Mamata Banerjee’s shelter are coming back. This will make everyone understand that TMC is the only force to reckon with. It has no alternative,” said Ghosh.Dutta, who joined the BJP soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, had been maintaining distance from the party since the March-April assembly elections, in which the TMC won 213 seats while the BJP had to settle for only 77 seats.On Wednesday, Dutta stoked speculations of switching sides when he criticised BJP’s former state president Dilip Ghosh for his comment on the Lakhimpur Kheri killings. Later, BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar described Dutta as an opportunist.“Probably he came to the BJP looking for lucrative opportunities and found that our party does not allow its members to make fortunes,” said Majumdar.Dutta is the sixth leader to return to the TMC since June.On September 4, Soumen Roy, BJP legislator from Kaliaganj in north Bengal, joined the TMC. Others to return to the party fold include Tanmay Ghosh, who won the Bishnupur seat in Bankura district, Biswajit Das, MLA from Bagdah in North 24 Parganas district, and Mukul Roy, former BJP national vice-president and MLA from Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district.Krishna Kalyani, BJP legislator from Raiganj in the North Dinajpur district of north Bengal, on October 1 announced that he was quitting the party, triggering speculations of him joining the state’s ruling party.Kalyani, an industrialist, who stepped into politics by joining the BJP in January this year, has been speaking against the leadership for quite some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabyasachi-dutta-back-in-tmc-party-mp-says-workers-aggrieved-by-return-of-those-who-insulted-mamata-101633636984706.html

08-10-2021||India||Congress chalked out legal plan to corner BJP on Lakhimpur Kheri violence||New Delhi: The Congress had prepared an elaborate legal plan in response to the killing of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri, but ultimately decided to not to take up a legal battle at this point and continue to mount political attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party, according to two senior Congress functionaries. The two, who asked not to be named, said one part of the plan was to appeal to National Human Rights Commission. The second was to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored probe into the incident. So far, no major political party has demanded intervention by the National Human Rights Commission into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. The third was to challenge the imposition of section 144 in UP that empowered the UP police to detain Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi at Sitapur on Sunday evening and prevented party leaders from reaching Lakhimpur Kheri. “We even prepared the legal note,” said one of the two, but the party’s leadership, including both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi decided against seeking legal recourse, and to fight it out politically. With election in Uttar Pradesh due in less than six months, the Congress is expected to up the ante politically, although the leader said the legal options haven’t been completely ruled out, especially in terms of seeking a court-monitored probe or one by NHRC. “So far, no mainstream Opposition party has gone to NHRC to seek its intervention in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. But we had a plan. However, even within our own organization, a section was skeptical as one of the body’s recent order sparked a political debate,” said the second leader. His reference is to NHRC’s recommendations after it looked into instances of violence after the elections in West Bengal, with the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress government claiming these favour the Bharatiya Janata Party, which ended up on the losing side in the polls. The plan to go to court to seek a probe was also kept in abeyance as the party felt it was important for Congress leaders to first reach there to step up the political heat against the Yogi Adityanath government. “The state government has already ordered a probe by a retired judge. Thus, at this stage a fresh demand for a court-monitored probe was found unnecessary. But we can make a demand for a court-monitored probe at an appropriate time if we see the investigation is not progressing in right direction.,” the second leader said. In fact, when asked about the probe ordered by the government, Rahul Gandhi, in his press conference on Wednesday morning, said: “First of all I want to go there and understand the matter and what is the ground reality. The ground reality is really ground reality, no one knows yet, first of all we want to go and understand that, so we are going to Lucknow and Lakhimpur Kheri.”  A former union minister, who was in touch with Priyanka Gandhi, communicated to the leaders involved that she too, wants to continue the political fight. “Anyways, a sub judice matter can take way the political sheen,” said the second leader. The Congress leaders had also planned to challenge the administrative order of imposition of section 144 of the CrPC. “In 2020, a Supreme Court order stated that section 144 can’t be applied to restrict citizens to assemble peacefully and it can’t be a tool to prevent legitimate expression of grievance or exercise of any democratic rights,” said the first leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-chalked-out-legal-plan-to-corner-bjp-on-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-101633634946276.html
08-10-2021||India||The biggest perpetrator and supporter of terrorism masquerading as its victim: India slams Pakistan at UN||United Nations: Pakistan is the biggest perpetrator and supporter of terrorism and masquerades as its victim and should stop cleansing its own minorities including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and Buddhists, India has said in a strong response slamming Islamabad for again raking up the Kashmir issue at the UN.Emphasising that the fight against terrorism has to be unrelenting and across all fronts, Counsellor/Legal Adviser at India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Dr Kajal Bhat said that all member states must fulfil their obligations enshrined in international counter-terrorism instruments and conventions.“…let me express my dismay that Pakistan has once again misused this august forum to repeat at adnauseam their litany of lies,” Bhat said at the General Assembly 6th committee (Legal) meeting on ‘Measures to eliminate international terrorism’.“Here is the biggest perpetrator and supporter of terrorism masquerading as its victim. We condemn their Pavlovian response wherever the name of India is mentioned and reject all their allegations and insinuations,” she said on Wednesday.India’s strong response came after Pakistan’s UN envoy Munir Akram again raked up the issue of Kashmir at the Sixth Committee meeting and made baseless allegations against India in his remarks.“Jammu and Kashmir is, and will always be a part of India,” she said.“We call on Pakistan to stop cleansing their own minorities including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and others,” Bhat said.While some states lack the legal-operational frameworks and necessary Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) capacities, others are “clearly guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism by providing financial assistance and safe havens to terrorists,” Bhat said, in a veiled reference to Pakistan.“We must enhance capacities of the former, but must collectively call out the latter and hold them accountable,” she said.Bhat said terrorism continues to persist globally, spreading into new areas, with terrorists having significantly enhanced their capabilities by gaining access to new and emerging technologies like drones, virtual currencies and encrypted communications for furthering their objectives and accomplishing their evil acts.“COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated the situation. Isolation due to lockdown, distress and economic uncertainty has made the world more susceptible to radicalizing narratives and violent extremist propaganda,” she said.Asserting that terrorists at one place are a “threat” to the whole world, Bhat said fighting terrorism collectively requires “action from all of us, without any exception.” She underscored India’s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and firm belief that there cannot be any exception or justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivations behind such acts, and wherever, whenever and by whomsoever, they are committed.“There cannot be bad terrorists or good terrorists based on their intensions or objectives.” A member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), India is already in the process of upgrading its Financial Intelligence Network to ensure quicker referral of terror-financing cases to law enforcement agencies, she said.India reiterated the need for early finalisation of the Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, saying the UN needs to do more in this direction.“We believe that when right action is not taken at the right time, then it is time itself that causes the action to fail,” Bhat said, strongly calling on states to unite in efforts and end the stalemate preventing the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT).“We all need CCIT as a law enforcement instrument that should strengthen the existing framework of global anti-terrorism conventions,” she said.India expressed hope that the UNGA Resolution of December 2020 that recommends to Sixth Committee to establish the “Working Group” with a view to finalising the process on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism will “bring finality to the most important task in hand before the international community.” Welcoming the adoption of the 7th review resolution of the Global Counter Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) by the General Assembly by consensus in June 2021, Bhat expressed hope that the member states will “walk the talk” and implement the strategy by taking effective measures.India had contributed constructively to the GCTS negotiations, especially to strengthen the language on countering the financing of terrorism, prevention of misuse of emerging technologies, strengthen the rights of victims of terrorism, providing greater financial resources to the UN counter-terrorism architecture and obligations of member states to take effective measures to prevent terrorist activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-biggest-perpetrator-and-supporter-of-terrorism-masquerading-as-its-victim-india-slams-pakistan-at-un-101633633516795.html
08-10-2021||India||School principal, teacher killed in Jammu and Kashmir: Anger, grief shroud kin||The killing of a government school teacher and its principal by terrorists in Eidgah area of Srinagar on Thursday left families and school staff in shock, as they raised security concerns for members of minority communities amid a spate of attacks in and around Jammu and Kashmir’s capital. At 11.15 am, Satinder Kour (50), principal of Government Boys Higher Secondary school in Eidgah, and a teacher at the school, Deepak Chand, were shot dead inside the school premises by terrorists. The Resistance Front (TRF), which police say is the front for terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack and said the teachers were killed for their role in getting students to participate in a “function at school on August 15”, India’s independence day. As news of the killings spread, several relatives and neighbours reached Kour’s residence in Tulsibagh, in uptown Srinagar, to console her family. “She left for school feeling very happy this morning. Hours later, her lifeless body has reached home. Why didn’t the gunmen kill me? I am an old woman. Why did they cut her life short?” Kour’s 75-year-old mother said. A 52-year-old teacher of a government high school in Chanpora said: “This lady would help several orphan Muslim students. She was very humble and ready to help everyone.” Kour is survived by her husband and two children. A pall of gloom also descended on Pandoka Colony in Paloura area where Deepak Chandlived with his parents, wife and a three-year-old daughter.“What can I say… whatever has happened is due to system failure. The system is in deep slumber, they cannot do anything. Tomorrow again someone will be killed and there shall be mourning in that house. The entire family tends to die with that person,” Chand’s cousin Vicky Mehra said. “See his (Chand’s) wife and mother. How will they live now? He had a three-year-old daughter. Can’t they (government) stop all this... We have been targeted for the last 30 years and are still receiving threat calls,” he added. Another cousin of the deceased teacher, Ajay Kumar, said: “I spoke to him on Wednesday evening. The news of his killing this morning shook me from inside. I saw his photos on the internet and called his number but the line was busy.” “When another family member called on his number, the receiver said we may meet the same fate if we dared to visit Kashmir,” he added.Even the faculty and employees in school, which comprises around 120 students, expressed shock over the incident. “I was having tea when the attack took place. I did not witness the attack. I am a heart patient and I found the incident to be very scary,” school employee Farooq Ahmad said. A teacher claimed she heard sounds of gunshots and the attackers say “now raise flags”. “It was the most painful moment of our lives,”the teacher added.Eyewitnesses claimed that at least two to three terrorists entered the school premises and fired at the principal and teacher from point blank range before fleeing from the spot. The incident was also condemned by JK Employees joint Action Committee chairman Mohd Rafique Rather who himself is a lecturer. “These innocent killings remind us of the tragic reality of the vicious cycle of violence which is pushing our society to darkness,” he said.Chamber of Commerce and Industries Jammu president Arun Gupta said attempts are being made by terrorists to create a sense of fear among members of the minority community, including the Kashmiri Pandits and Sikhs. Asserting that members of these communities are soft targets for the terrorists, he urged the Centre to take serious note of such unabated killings and called for stringent action against the culprits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-principal-teacher-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-anger-grief-shroud-kin-101633632785670.html

Relations between the two countries continue to be strained despite their fresh commitment to a ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir in February following several months of back-channelacontacts between senior intelligence officials.‘Kabul gurdwara vandalism concern for India & world’Meanwhile, the MEA spokesperson on Thursday said that vandalism at a gurdwara in Kabul by armed men was a matter of concern and the world community must insist on the protection of the human rights of all segments of Afghan society.Suspected Taliban fighters entered the Gurdwara Karte Parwan on October 5, tied up guards and destroyed CCTV cameras. The men also briefly occupied the building, smashed several locks and conducted a search, triggering concerns within the Sikh minority.“The reports of vandalism and intolerance raise concerns not just for us, but across the world,” said Bagchi.“It is important that the international community continues to insist on the fulfilment of goals outlined in the UN Security Council resolution 2593,” he added.Bagchi was referring to a Security Council resolution adopted on August 30, when India held the rotational presidency of the UN body.He said the resolution guides the world community’s collective approach towards Afghanistan, and states that all countries should ensure that Afghan territory isn’t used for terrorism and that the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities, are protected.The resolution also encourages all parties to seek an inclusive and negotiated settlement in Afghanistan, he said.Bagchi added that the regional security situation, including Afghanistan, had figured in US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman’s talks with her Indian interlocutors on Wednesday.“We highlighted our perspective on the role of Pakistan and what our concerns are regarding that,” he said.In response to several questions, Bagchi said the issue of resumption of commercial flights to Afghanistan for the evacuation of Indian nationals and return of Afghan citizens was a sensitive issue. The visas of Afghan citizens who are stuck in India and facing problems for their return are being automatically extended, he said.The MEA spokesperson further said India is yet to decide on the level of its participation in a meeting on Afghanistan convened by the G20 on October 12. He added that there was no information about India being extended any invitation for a meeting on Afghanistan being organised by Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mea-condemns-targeted-killing-of-civilians-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101633632124395.html
08-10-2021||India||Govt plans quarterly data on jobs from next financial year||Starting from the April-June quarter of 2022, the first of financial year 2022-23, the labour ministry will release official quarterly estimates of the number of jobs created in the country, a government official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.India lacks an official periodic, high-frequency jobs survey and two quarterly employment surveys are meant to fill this critical gap.Economists and policymakers usually depend on the longer-term Periodic Labour Force Survey of the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation or the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a private data firm, for trends in the labour market and employment/unemployment data.The quarterly estimates will be available via the All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey or AQEES, currently under way. AQEES has two components. One is the quarterly employment survey (QES), which deals with the formal sector. Results of the first round of this survey were released last week, showing a 29% increase in employment in nine sectors during the peak Covid-19 months of April-June 2021 over a base of 2013-14.This means employment grew an average annual 3.42% since 2014, led by jobs in the technology sector, aside from those in nine key sectors including manufacturing and financial services.The second component, launched this past Sunday, will capture job-creation estimates in the unorganized sector through a sample survey. It is being called the Area Frame Establishment Survey (AFES) and will cover businesses employing less than 10 workers.The two components will eventually be merged to provide official quarterly employment estimates in the country for the first time from the first quarter of FY2022-23, the official said. “By FY2022-23, the government plans to combine these and put outcomprehensive quarterly job creation estimates.”“The government’s move to survey the labour market quarterly and release more employment data should be wholeheartedly welcomed. It will help bridge the data gap and without data, we are blind,” Mahesh Vyas of CMIE said. The second wave of Covid-19 is estimated to have wiped out at least 23 million jobs, according to CMIE.A nascent recovery has however started, adding jobs and the country’s unemployment rate dropped sharply to 6.26% in September , compared to 8.32% in August, according to CMIE, which tracks the labour market with proprietary tools.In any jobs survey, people with jobs are categorised as employed. People without jobs, but actively looking for one, are considered unemployed. The labour force participation rate is equal to people who are employed plus those who are not. The unemployment rate therefore is the number of unemployed divided by the labour force times 100.In all, the quarterly surveys will capture data from the job markets in nine sectors, including manufacturing, hospitality, trade, transport and education in both formal and informal sectors of Asia’s third largest economy.Releasing the first-round results of the job survey in the formal sector last week, the labour bureau’s report said: “It is obvious that employment figures from establishment-based surveys like the present QES (as the initial first component of the All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey AQEES) can provide an idea -- though incomplete -- about ‘gainful’ employment in different sectors of the economy.”“The growth rate (in jobs of 29% in the formal sector) reported by the government constitutes simple growth between two data points and hence we get fantastic growth rates like 29%. However, for assessing employment scenario, the reliable growth rate statistic would be the compounded average growth rate,” said KR Shyam Sundar of the Xaviers Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-quarterly-data-on-jobs-from-next-financial-year-101633631944308.html
08-10-2021||India||Unpacking the diverse, emotive world of emojis||There is an emoji that has baffled me for a while. Guides online said that it was a “person raising both hands in celebration.” That didn’t seem quite right. It looked like a cross between a peace sign and a clapping sound. I discovered the truth while walking around my building. “Arya, what does an emoji like this mean?” I asked earnestly, raising both my hands to imitate the emoji.“Oh, aunty, that’s a high-ten. Or a high-five,” the ten-year-old said immediately.Wow, I thought, staring at the curly-locked kid with a cricket bat. “Arya, will you be my emoji guru?” I asked.Flabbergasted about the prospect of him being the guru to anyone,, let alone an adult, the kid’s jaw dropped. I rushed on. “There are so many hand gestures. I want to be appropriate, you know. Be cool….” There is one thing more pathetic than an auntie who is not cool, and that is an auntie who ‘wants’ to be cool. So I cleared my throat, opened my phone, and pointed to a raised fist emoji in my phone. “Like what does this mean?” I asked.“What do you think it means?” Arya asked in reply, looking like Miss Pushpa, my high school teacher. “Well,” I said. “I think it means, ‘I am going to punch you,’ or something like that.”Arya laughed. He called out to the other Lilliputs with their balls, bats and stumps. “Hey, look, da. Aunty thinks the raised fist means punching,” he said.Suddenly, a crowd of kids were gazing at me, like I was a Harappan civilization relic. One kindly kid with glasses and a football glove said, “The closed fist means, ‘I am with you.’ Like you know. ‘We are in this fight together.’ It is the opposite of punching.”Solidarity. That’s what it meant. I sighed. Clearly, I had a long way to go. “What about smiley faces? There are so many versions,” I said. “I don’t know when to use the one with tears, one with the tongue sticking out, one with the wink….”“When all else fails, just put the vomiting one,” said little Naomi. “That’s the one I use the most.”“And I use the namaste one all the time,” I said.I was immediately pronounced ‘lame,’ even though there is no ‘lame’ emoji.Emojis were invented for the smartphone. They are a way to express emotions without having to use your face. A lazy way to reply in my view, like you cannot even be bothered to type in the words, “Thank you,” or say “That’s wonderful,” when a friend says she got promoted. Instead you send a thumbs up emoji. That said, emojis are versatile and this is the reason I use the ‘namaste’ emoji. In a school class WhatsApp group, what do you do when a school mom sends information about some charity that she supports? You cannot call her a show-off, or tell her not to hijack the group with her posts, or that you don’t care about her constant charity efforts. So you send a namaste. Katham: finished. Emojis alleviate what can come across as rude. When you want to be curt or assertive, a smiley face at the end helps. “This strategy is totally wrong for the market,” you can text your boss and then put a smiling face. Or a rueful face. Just like that, you have just sent a mixed message, much like we spouses do in our marriages. “Babe, I love your friends but they are such bores (smiling face).”Like many things in today’s India, we can claim that we invented the emoji thousands of years ago. How, you ask. Think about our Indian mudras in dance.“Aren’t dance mudras like emojis?” I asked my dancer friend, Madhu Natraj. “After all, they convey emotions through gestures, right?”“Well, dance does that and more,” she replied. “But yes, mudras or hasthas depict objects, express emotions, create situations and limitless other possibilities.”And in front of my delighted eyes, I witnessed a dancer’s mobile face convey the nava-rasas-- the nine emotions. The emoji inventors no doubt did a freeze-frame of such dancers and came up with illustrations that convey emotions. Indian dance emotes and so there are emojis, right? Or too much?The place where I use emojis a lot is Facebook. There is a wonderful line in Jane Austen’s, Pride and Prejudice where Mr. Bennett, the father, says, “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”Facebook for many of us is exactly that. Admit it, how many of you spend time scrolling through Facebook so you can scoff at your “friends,” laugh at the self-consciously stylish photos they post, the model-like poses they strike? Like the father said, we live to make fun of our friends.What do you do when an acquaintance who is a friend on Facebook posts a photo of her in some random cocktail party? You think she looks horrific in that ill-fitting dress? But tell her that would be honest and social media is all about hypocrisy. So what do you do? Simple: send a kiss-kiss emoji.What about that male colleague of yours who posts a photo of him wearing sunglasses on a beach? You burst out laughing at his pretensions. Guy thinks he is James Bond, you mutter. Look at him trying desperately to tuck in his beer-belly. But you cannot say that. So you send a biceps emoji. Or maybe it is the raised-fist, “I am with you in solidarity” one. Let me check with my cricket-playing gurus in the playground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unpacking-the-diverse-emotive-world-of-emojis-101633631824398.html

Zoo employees found the cage empty at about 6 pm. The forest department was immediately informed and mobile teams of the district police started alerting people using public address systems, said an officer from Jhargram police station. The leopard, which was brought to the zoo in 2018, could not be spotted till 10 pm. Featuring forests and hilly terrains, Jhargram district is part of the Jangalmahal area covering the western parts of Bengal and the state of Jharkhand. These terrains were a haven for Maoist guerillas operating in Bengal till 2011. The zoological park was set up by the state forest department in 1980. It houses various types of deer, snakes, wolves, bears, monkeys and birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-escapes-from-zoo-near-bengal-s-jhargram-town-101633631764443.html
08-10-2021||India||Terror attacks revive memories of 1990s exodus; Shah reviews security in J&K||Terror attacks targeting minorities and non-locals in the Kashmir Valley have revived memories of the mass exodus of minority communities that took place in the early 1990s when targeted killings of civilians were carried out with the onset of terrorism in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir -- prompting security agencies and the Union home ministry to take note.On Thursday after terrorists shot dead two school teachers Satinder Kour and Deepak Chand in the Valley, at least two zonal education offices put out notices asking Kashmiri Pandit teachers who were offered jobs under a Union government scheme to stay in the transit camp in Kheer Bhawani Temple in Ganderbal district. HT has reviewed the notice issued by the Ganderbal district office; it specifies that these teachers, who sought security following Thursday’s killings, should stay in the temple complex till further orders.“We are scared; government or security authorities have not reached out to us. Most of the people who live in transit camps or rented accommodation have no security and therefore, we have decided to leave for Jammu,” said a Kashmiri Pandit government employee in Anantnag. There are approximately 1,500 employees from Sikh and Pandit communities who were given jobs under the package in Anantnag alone.A second Pandit family also confirmed that they had sought leave of absence from work and were planning to leave the Valley. “For the past 12 years the government has not even made arrangements for proper housing for the employees who were given jobs under the package; we live in rented accommodation and are sitting ducks,” one member of this family said.Tuesday’s killing of ML Bindroo, a prominent member of the KP community who ran a pharmacy in the valley has exacerbated fear among the minority community. A street vendor from Bihar, Virendra Paswan and a local resident of Bandipora, Mohammad Shafi Lone, who was the president of the Taxi Association were also killed on Tuesday.“The pattern is the same, just as minority community leaders were accused of being informers in the 1990s, they are again being accused of working for the agencies. Since, no security arrangements have been made, I believe about 100 odd families will move out of the Valley by tomorrow,” said Sanjay Tickoo of the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti.Following the killings, security agencies have gone into a huddle and a series of meetings have taken place in Delhi and the newly created Union territory.Union home minister Amit Shah is learnt to have deliberated upon the issue on Thursday at North Block during a regular security review meeting with National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Intelligence Bureau chief Aravind Kumar, and Kuldiep Singh and Pankaj Kumar Singh , director generals of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Border Security Force (BSF) respectively.A senior government officer said on condition of anonymity that intelligence and security agencies responsible for Jammu and Kashmir have been asked to ensure that civilians are not targeted and persons responsible for these attacks are traced and punished.Later, the IB chief had separate meetings with senior officials in Kashmir, a second officer told HT.The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, has taken responsibility of the attacks and intelligence agencies believe there could be more such attacks with Pakistan-backed groups wanting to create disturbance in the valley.J&K director general of police Dilbag Singh said that “the recent incidents of targeting civilians are to create an atmosphere of fear and communal disharmony here. There is a conspiracy to target the local ethos and values and defame local Kashmiri Muslims. This is being done on the instructions from agencies in Pakistan. I am sure we will find those behind these incidents very soon”.Security agencies say there have been close over 20 civilian killings in the Valley this year and about 37 the previous year.Security agencies also claim that there has been a massive crackdown on terror groups. According to them, there were 52 terrorists of local origin active in J&K from January 2021 of which 20 were killed and 13 were arrested within a month of their joining. “Thirteen were killed within two months of joining and 9 got arrested. In the third month of their joining, three were killed in an encounter and 1 was arrested…Their count is decreasing day by day; the life span of those joining terror groups is just about a month or two,” said an officer at a security agency who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-attacks-again-revive-memories-of-1990s-exodus-amit-shah-reviews-security-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101633631706395.html
08-10-2021||India||NGT can take up environment issues on its own: Supreme Court||In a landmark judgement that comes as a shot in the arm for legitimate environmental causes, the Supreme Court said the National Green Tribunal does have suo moto powers and can take up environmental issues on its own. The order came even as the Union government said NGT does not have such powers. “The National Green Tribunal cannot afford to remain a mute spectator when no one knocks on its door,” the court said on Thursday while passing an order that vests suo moto powers to the body created under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 for protection of environment.Holding that any other interpretation would go against public good and render the environmental watchdog “toothless” and “ineffective”, a three-judge bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar said, “It is vital for the well being of the nation and its people, to have a flexible mechanism to address all issues pertaining to environmental damage and resultant climate change so that we can leave behind a better environmental legacy for our children, and the generations thereafter.”The court was considering a batch of appeals on the question whether NGT has the power to take notice of press reports or even seek response from the government (or government bodies) on preventing and protecting damage to the environment without any application being filed before it. The issue was raised by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) which was slapped with a fine of ₹5 crore by NGT for not setting up sewage treatment plants. The NGT order of October 2018 came on the basis of a news report. Subsequently, similar exercise of suo moto power by NGT was challenged by the Kerala government in a case relating to shifting of stone quarries from residential areas.The bench declared, “It is accordingly declared that the NGT is vested with suo motu power in discharge of its functions under the NGT Act.” Adding a rider, the bench added, “The exercise of suo motu jurisdiction does not mean eschewing principles of natural justice and fair play. In other words, the party likely to be affected should be afforded due opportunity to present their side, before suffering adverse orders.”In its 77-page judgment, the Court said that given the fallout of the climate crisis, “where adverse environmental impact may be egregious, but the community affected is unable to effectively get the machinery into action, a forum created specifically to address such concerns should surely be expected to move with expediency, and of its own accord.”The NGT Act provided a specialized role to the tribunal to act on issues where a dispute arose under seven specified laws: The Water Act, The Water Cess Act, The Forest Conservation Act, Air Act, Environment Protection Act, Public Liability Insurance Act and the Biological Diversity Act.  The issue before the court was whether an application by a person, as stated in Section 18 of the Act, alone can trigger action by the Tribunal. The Centre represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) took the view that NGT can act on a letter or representation but cannot assume suo moto powers to act independently on any issue. This view was also supported by the court-appointed amicus curiae senior advocate Anand Grover.Justice Hrishikesh Roy, writing the judgment for the bench, said, “The functional capacity of the NGT was intended to leverage wide powers to do full justice in its environmental mandate.” There were also concerns expressed by lawyers that suo moto powers could be abused. To counter this, the bench said, “As long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude.”The court said it is was conscious of the fact that often citizens may not approach the tribunal. This could be on account of illiteracy, lack of mobility, technical knowledge, or when powerful entities with adequate wherewithal skirt regulations. The bench said, “The duty to safeguard Article 21 rights cannot stand on a narrow compass of interpretation….It may not always be feasible for individuals to knock on the doors of the Tribunal, and NGT in such exigencies must not be made dysfunctional. Procedural provisions must be allowed to fall in step with the substantive rights that are invoked in the environmental domain, in larger public interest.” Article 21 of the constitution protects the right to life and personal liberty. Further, the bench noted that addressing evolving environmental concerns will require a flexible institutional mechanism. “An affirmative role, beyond mere adjudication at the instance of applicant, is certainly required for serving the ends of environmental justice, as the statute itself requires of the NGT.”“The hands-off mode for the NGT, when faced with exigencies requiring immediate and effective response, would debilitate the forum from discharging its responsibility and this must be ruled out in the interest of justice… We cannot validate an argument which furthers uncertainty to justify the role of a spectator, if not inaction, and would most assuredly result in injustice,” the court said.Senior advocate Raj Panjwani, a leading lawyer on environmental issues said, “The judgment by the top court will strengthen the functioning of the NGT as there was always a lurking doubt over its power to take up suo moto cases. Since this tribunal was created under a statute, every attempt was made to restrict the Tribunal’s suo moto powers. This decision clears those doubts and paves way for NGT to be assertive on serious environmental issues that may necessarily not be agitated by any private individual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-can-take-up-environment-issues-on-its-own-supreme-court-101633631587237.html
08-10-2021||India||Gauhati HC seeks affidavit from govt on Assam eviction drive violence||“Khoon zameen pe gir gaya (blood has been spilt),” rued the Gauhati high court on Thursday as it directed the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit on last month’s clashes during an eviction drive at Sipajhar in Darrang district which claimed two lives and injured nearly 20 others, including 11 policemen.A bench of Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Soumitra Saikia asked the state government to file a detailed affidavit in three weeks, explaining the circumstances leading up to the incident.“It was an unfortunate incident...a big tragedy. We will ask for a detailed affidavit from the state. The issue is (that) three lives (were) lost. Khoon zameen pe gir gaya,” observed the bench, as it admitted a petition filed by Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia and another suo motu (registered on its own) petition.“This is a big tragedy...very unfortunate. Those who are guilty, if at all, must be punished...no doubt about that. Not just in this but in one or two other incidents as well,” added the bench, asking the Assam government to make its stand clear on the 2007 National Relief and Rehabilitation Policy.The Assam government ordered a judicial inquiry on the violent eviction drive at Dholpur 3 village on September 23 where clashes erupted while police were trying to forcibly remove settlers from government land. The deceased included a 12-year-old boy and a 33-year-old man.A photographer, who was engaged by the district administration and was seen stomping on an injured villager in a viral video, has been arrested. Three residents of the area have also been arrested for instigating violence during the drive.During the court hearing on Thursday, state’s advocate general Debojit Saikia claimed that there was an “unprovoked attack on the police” resulting in clashes between the security forces and occupants during an eviction drive in villages at Sipajhar on September 23. He said that the plan was to evict 125 families, but nearly 20,000 people, including outsiders with doubtful credentials, gathered at the site and attacked the policemen, which in turn led to retaliatory action.The advocate general also said that the petitioner in the case, being the leader of opposition in the state assembly, has a different agenda and should rather fight political fights at political fora, outside the courts.The court, however, told the law officer that it cannot stop an individual from approaching the court just because he or she happens to be a political person. It added that Debabrata Saikia has also disclosed his identity in his petition and did not conceal anything.Appearing for the Congress leader, senior advocate Chander Uday Singh submitted that the state is liable to pay compensation for the “ex facie illegal actions of the police” and requested the bench to direct the criminal investigation department to conduct an independent investigation into the matter as well.Assisted by advocate Talha Abdul Rehman, Singh also adduced several policies of the Centre and state government to ensure resettlement and rehabilitation of those affected by floods in the state, contending that the cabinet decision regarding the eviction drive must also be put in the public domain.The next date of hearing on the petitions is November 3.“The court took the matter seriously and directed the state government to respond on its policy regarding evictions and rehabilitation. The court rejected the advocate general’s contention that the petition was politically motivated since I am the leader of opposition in assembly,” petitioner Saikia said later.In his PIL, Saikia had sought court’s intervention on conducting mandatory social impact assessment and ensure that the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, is followed in the state.The petition mentioned that those who were being evicted at Dholpur were from marginalised and socio-economically disadvantaged sections who were forced to migrate due to floods and erosions.The eviction drive at Dholpur was carried out following a state government plan to start an ambitious agricultural project on nearly 77,000 ‘bighas’ of government land.The petition, however, challenged the eviction stating that it was “arbitrary, violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, violative of parts IX and IXA of the Constitution which requires democratization of economic and social planning, in contravention of Panchayat Act, 1994”.It added that on September 23 there was use of “excessive, illegal and disproportionate force and firearms by police officials, allegedly in response to the protests against the eviction drive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-seeks-affidavit-from-govt-on-assam-eviction-drive-violence-101633631585172.html
08-10-2021||India||LUH military variant to make maiden test flight next August||After wrapping up a rigorous flight testing of prototype helicopters in challenging conditions, state-run plane makers Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) set August 2022 as the deadline for carrying out the maiden test flight of the first chopper in the indigenous light utility helicopter (LUH) limited series production, senior officials familiar with the development said on Thursday. LUH’s first test flight will be carried out from the new Tumakuru facility in Karnataka, another official said.LUH will replace the army and the Indian Air Force’s ageing fleets of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, whose safety record has been blemished by a string of crashes --- two army pilots were killed last month in the latest Cheetah crash near Patnitop in Jammu and Kashmir. Around 15 Cheetah and Chetak helicopters have crashed during the last 10 years, killing several pilots. Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat (then a lieutenant general) survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur on February 3, 2015. “The first test flight of the LUH in the limited series production (LSP) will be carried out next August. HAL is on the verge of getting an order for 12 LUHs – six each for the army and IAF,” said one of the officials cited above. At his annual press conference on October 5, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari said the air force would soon place an order for six LUHs. The design of the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters is more than 50 years old, and their airworthiness was questioned once again after the Patnitop crash. HAL expects the army and IAF to place combined orders for at least 187 light helicopters in the coming years (126 for the army and 61 for IAF). “All trials on the four LUH prototypes are over. The last set of trials to establish LUH’s extra manoeuvrability concluded in Ladakh this week. The army and IAF wanted some changes and LUH performed better than expected,” said a second official. HAL is expected to deliver the first set of LUHs to the services in two to three years of the signing of the contract. Subsequent orders will be executed at a faster pace as LUH production will also begin at HAL’s new helicopter factory in Tumakuru, Karnataka. The Bengaluru and Tumakuru facilities will be capable of rolling out 100 light helicopters every year, the second official added. “The Cheetah and Chetak replacement has been long overdue. They were designed in the 1960s. LUH has proved its capabilities in multiple rounds of trials in extreme conditions in the northern sector. It’s quite an achievement in indigenous helicopter manufacturing,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director-general, Centre for Air Power Studies. Currently, the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters are a critical lifeline for troops in high-altitude areas, including the Siachen glacier. HAL has licence-produced 625 Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. It no longer builds them but is responsible for their maintenance and repair. The Army Aviation director-general Lieutenant General AK Suri on Thursday visited aviation squadrons in forwarding areas, including Leh, and flew a test sortie in LUH whose trials have been completed, the Udhampur-based Northern Command said. India is also looking at jointly building with Russia the Kamov-226T light helicopters in the country. The Kamovs are also expected to replace the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. However, the $1-billion programme, under which Russia will supply 60 helicopters in flyaway condition and the remaining 140 will be manufactured in India, is yet to kick off. The army, IAF and navy together need around 500 light helicopters. HAL is also awaiting a contract from the defence ministry for 15 light combat helicopters (LCHs) and expects follow-on orders as the army and IAF have a combined projected requirement of 160 LCHs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/luh-military-variant-to-make-maiden-test-flight-next-august-101633631284774.html
08-10-2021||India||MoS Ajay Mishra attends BPRD event amid row||Union minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Kumar Mishra, on Thursday attended a scheduled Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) event at Mahipalpur. The development comes despite pressure by the opposition parties demanding that the central government sack the minister.Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra has been booked along with others by the Uttar Pradesh police for allegedly running over farmers in Lakhmipur Kheri on Sunday.The minister addressed the police and prison officers from across the country as part of BPRD’s 7th conference of heads of prisons of all states and Union territories, with a theme of “preparing a decadal road map for the prisons and correctional services”.However, the media was blocked from covering the event.According to a statement issued by the BPRD, Mishra emphasised during his inaugural address that the gathering in the conference i.e. 75 senior prison officers from 25 States and four Union territories, is the right platform to deliberate on the issues and frame a policy which will have a wider perspective and wider acceptability.Mishra said the “main challenge for reintegrating inmates into the mainstream of society is providing a safe environment to them. Jail systems must have provisions for providing training and skill development for people living inside prisons and aftercare programmes.”He further added that the “concept of e-prisons saves time and makes the process easier for further associating with the courts. Another important aspect of e-prisons is e-mulakaat, which has made the process easy for inmates to contact their families.”Earlier, on Wednesday, the BPRD hinted that the event was put on hold.Eight people, including four farmers and a local journalist Raman Kashyap, died on Sunday in violence that broke out when at least one car, allegedly driven by the minister’s son, hit protesting farmers, prompting an angry crowd to burn two vehicles and lynch the occupants of one of the vehicles. Farmers have sought the arrest of the minister and his son.

To keep 1.5 degree C within reach, we need to take dramatic actions now on global emission reductions and to achieve net zero emissions by mid century or before,” he said, adding that “India is a critical partner in this effort”. “India has already made a bold statement by setting out a target of 450 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. We are committed to helping India to be able to achieve that goal every and in any way that we can,” he said. Kerry also said that India and the US will work together on increasing technical exchanges to expand trade and foreign direct investment.“The partnership underscores our joint commitment to taking decisive climate action during this critical decade. That’s what scientists tell us we must do,” he said.Last month, Kerry and Environment Minister Yadav launched the Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue that aims to attract investment and technology in clean energy projects.The dialogue is one of the tracks to finance projects for climate change mitigation under the India-US climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030.The International Energy Agency forecasts nearly half of the emissions reductions needed will have to come from emerging technologies not yet ready for commercial markets. “India and US clean hydrogen partnership will advance this. That’s why we are excited to have launched the US India hydrogen task force,” he added.Meanwhile, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who was also a part of the summit, said the need of the hour is global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to help developing countries scale up their efforts to protect nature.“Our climate actions and obligations are guided by the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity (CBDR-RC),” he said.“In addressing the contemporary challenges, it is important to focus on solutions that can help us reach our goals with justice. The need of the hour is a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to help developing countries in scaling up their efforts to protect nature,” he added. A senior environment ministry official, on the condition of anonymity, said: “India may announce an enhanced nationally determined contribution (NDC) but the decision is taken at the highest level. We do not have enough information immediately. They are still being discussed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-expects-defined-climate-ambition-from-india-at-cop26kerry-101633630866341.html
08-10-2021||India||Centre begins training for use of Zydus vaccine||The government has begun training vaccinators around the country on how to deliver the coronavirus vaccine developed by Zydus Cadila, an exercise that officials said is crucial since the dose is not given through conventional syringes.Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D has been granted emergency use authorisation by India’s drugs regulators, and it could become the first vaccine to be approved in children since its phase 3 trials included volunteers of ages 12 and above.“Preparation for the roll-out of Zydus vaccine is currently on; training is being imparted to those involved in giving the shot at various levels. This vaccine is not administered conventionally using a syringe and a needle but through an applicator that is being used in the country for the first time. Staff is being trained at the ground level, which is a task in itself. People were divided in various groups—master trainers, state trainers etc., to provide the requisite training,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog. The vaccine was approved on August 20 but it is yet to be included in the Covid-19 vaccination drive.“Apart from this all other logistical issues are also being solved, and very soon this vaccine will also be a part and parcel of our Covid-19 vaccination programme. In coming days we have to complete the task of vaccinating all adults, as vaccine availability is no longer an issue,” added Paul during the weekly media briefing on Covid-19 on Thursday. As per government data, 71% of India’s adult population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 27% has been fully vaccinated. The government is also making preparations to deal with any surge in cases that may occur due to the upcoming festive season, the officials said. Paul said that 836,000 hospital beds are currently available in the country for Covid-19 patients, in addition to nearly one million isolation beds in dedicated care centres. Nearly 486,000 oxygen-supported beds and 135,000 intensive care unit beds are also available. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday dedicated 35 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants established under PM Cares across 35 states and Union Territories at AIIMS Rishikesh. A total of 1,224 PSA oxygen plants have been funded under PM Cares so far in the country, of which at least 1,100 plants have been commissioned, providing a daily output of at least 1,750 metric tonnes oxygen. “It is good to remain prepared; as we have seen an upswing in cases in the past around festivities. People tend to drop their guard, which is not advisable at this stage of pandemic,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology and sleep medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. But officials stressed on the need for people to be careful. “We cannot afford to take the current stable situation for granted. We have to be mindful of the fact that the pandemic is still going on and can take an untoward turn if we are not careful. People need to avoid crowded places and unnecessary travel; stay home as far as possible and celebrate festivals virtually with shopping online,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, during the press briefing on Thursday.At present, Kerala is one of the worst-affected states, recording at least 50% of the total Covid-19 cases in the country past week, and the south Indian state is currently having at least 100,000 active cases. Four other states have reported between 10,000 and 50,000 new cases, as per the government data. Thirty-four districts across nine States and Union Territories are also reporting a weekly positivity rate of at least 10%, and 28 districts across 12 states and UTs are reporting a weekly positivity rate between 5 and 10%. Five states— Mizoram, Kerala, Sikkim, Manipur and Meghalaya— are reporting a weekly positivity rate of at least 5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-begins-training-for-use-of-zydus-vaccine-101633630685533.html

Gadhia has so far raised more than £3,000 for the UK-based non-profit ‘Cool Earth’, which works with rainforest communities to cease deforestation and lobbies businesses to generate more sustainable practices.“I feel really excited and happy to have won the award. I am really grateful and honoured to have Prime Minister Boris Johnson to award and write a letter to me. I never thought I would receive such an award,” Gadhia said, according to an official release from the Prime Minister Johnson's Office.The young girl, who hails from West Bridgford in Nottinghamshire, central England, has also established a climate change club at her school.Ruth Edwards, Conservative MP for Rushcliffe, said that she is “absolutely delighted” to hear that Gadhia has been “recognised” for her “amazing work” to safeguard rainforests and raise climate change awareness.“I think she is setting a great example of what we can all do to help our environment. This award is truly well-deserved, and I can’t wait to see what’s next for Aleesha and her campaign,” Edwards was quoted as saying by the release.The minor awardee was also recognised for sending out hundreds of letters and emails to top firms in Great Britain and other influential people in the business, encouraging them to take climate action as well.On winning the award, Gadhia thanked her teachers and also Cool Earth for making her their first youth ambassador.The child climate activist’s parents Kiran and Pooja said they are “so proud” of their daughter for what she has done over the previous year for “someone so young.”This is nolt the first time that Gadhia has been in the spotlight. Earlier this year, the six-year-old took up a challenge and rode 80km on her scooter to raise money for ‘Cool Earth’ for which she received the backing of Queen Elizabeth II and environmentalist Sir David Attenborough.“All the money raised will go towards making this a greener planet,” she had said following the scooter challenge.Gadhia has become the 1,755th person to receive the Prime Minister’s Points of Light award after it was launched in 2014 to honour people making a difference in their communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-aleesha-the-6-yr-old-indian-origin-climate-activist-who-won-uk-pm-award-101633629834171.html
08-10-2021||India||Karo Sambhav founder conferred Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award||Pranshu Singhal was on Thursday announced as the winner of the 12th Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award for having founded Karo Sambhav, an organisation that works on improving recycling and waste management by helping a mostly informal workforce engaged in it have access to more formal mechanisms. Awarded by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, the sister organisation of the World Economic Forum, and the Jubilant Bhartia Foundation, a nonprofit of the Jubilant Bhartia Group, the Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award recognises promising and successful entrepreneurs who can drive inclusive growth and excel in large-scale, high-impact models.The principal scientific advisor to the Union government, professor K VijayRaghavan, was the chief guest at the event and spoke on the challenges and opportunities in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. “At the beginning of the pandemic, India was known as a vaccine producer but not a developer. But our academia and industry developed vaccines for Covid-19. The second wave of the pandemic was unprecedented, which required our facilities to be ramped up several folds. This was a big challenge but the government, NGOs, and research institutes all came together and worked towards all that was needed,” he said.Social entrepreneurs, he added, “play an important role in connecting the grass root level to their needs”. The view was echoed by Shyam S Bhartia, director of Jubilant Bhartia Foundation and chairman and founder of Jubilant Bhartia Group, who said the pandemic brought to the fore the role of social entrepreneurs as frontline workers. “They acted as implementation partners during this time,” he said. Singhal said the recognition will help raise awareness and the organisation’s work on waste management. “We have solutions to create products, but no systems to take it back to their elemental form. Very little money is going into these systems. This award will really help us be a catalyst in this space. We are reaching the point of no return, we are today in the decade of action and change is unlikely if we act without collective push. We need a movement where organisations, enterprises, governments collaborate and co-create solutions,” he said after receiving the award in a virtual ceremony. Singhal said that one of the other four finalists, Dr Shuchin Bajaj -- who took affordable and quality health care to tier 2 and tier 3 cities in North India -- was his inspiration to quit his job and become a social entrepreneur. Among the finalists was Dr Aparna Hegde, a urogynecologist by training and the founder of Armman, which uses technology to help government health workers and NGOs provide pregnant women and mothers with critical information for their health. Another finalist was Seema Prem, CEO and co-founder of fintech company FIA Global, which serves 45 million customers through 30,000 outlets in inaccessible parts of the country.Dr Shuchin Bajaj, the fourth finalist and founder of Ujala Cygnus Healthcare, has helped address the tertiary healthcare needs of the poorest families in India’s tier-2 and-3 cities. Hilde Shwab, co-founder and chairperson of Schwab foundation of social entrepreneurship, said that even though all participants could not win, they could tap into the networks of the World Economic Forum. While concluding the session, Hari S Bhartia, the founder and co-chairman of Jubilant Bhartia Group, recounted how the Jubilant Group was able to start marketing Remdesivir in just three months after a conversation with the principal scientific adviser on how India needed to manufacture the anti-viral drug then thought to reduce hospitalisation in Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karo-sambhav-founder-pranshu-singhal-conferred-social-entrepreneur-of-the-year-award-101633630504744.html
08-10-2021||India||11-yr-old brutally killed in Bihar, rape suspected: Police||An 11-year-old schoolgirl was allegedly gang raped, brutalised and killed at a village in Bihar’s Kaimur district, police said on Thursday. According to the police, the semi-naked body of the minor girl was found lying on the campus of a residential school for Scheduled Tribes community under Adhaura police station limits of the Maoist-affected Kaimur hills, about 300 km from Patna. Police said there were signs of brutality on the body, suspecting that the assailants inserted hot iron rods in the mouth of the minor. Superintendent of police, Kaimur , Rakesh Kumar, confirmed the murder and use of iron rods in killing. He said two suspects have been taken into custody and their interrogations were on. “The body has been sent for post-mortem examination to ascertain whether she was raped or not. Sub-divisional police officer, Bhabua, Sunita Kumari is investigating the case,” Kumar said. Police said the deceased was a class 5 student at a primary school and had disappeared around 6pm on Wednesday. After she did not return home, her family and villagers launched a search to trace the girl in the night, police said, adding that a villager saw the body lying in semi-naked condition on the high school campus on Thursday morning after which police were informed. “The girl was murdered with iron rods. As far as rape is concerned, it will be only confirmed once we get the post-mortem report,” said the SP. Police said based on the complaint by the father of the girl, a case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Police said, in his complaint, the girl’s father, who runs a tea shop, has alleged that three workers from West Bengal, who were employed at an under-construction building of the residential school, raped the girl. “Prima facie, it is clear after seeing the body that she was raped and then murdered. There were holes made in the mouth with hot iron rod,” said Adhaura block pramukh Vipin Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11yrold-brutally-killed-in-bihar-rape-suspected-police-101633630444158.html
08-10-2021||India||2 arrested in Lakhimpur violence case, summons sent to Mishra’s son: UP Police||Lucknow: Two people were arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh while summons were sent to the main accused, Ashish Mishra, son of the Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni, for questioning, senior police officials said on Thursday. Additional Director General (ADG), Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said that two people , identified as Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, were arrested. Kumar said so far names of total six accused have surfaced during the course of investigation, adding that three of them are dead now..Inspector General of Police Laxmi Singh, however, did not disclose names of the three deceased accounted for in connection with the incident.The Lakhimpur police late on Thursday evening pasted a notice at the Union minister’s residence in Shahpura Kothi locality in Lakhimpur city, asking his son Ashish Mishra alias Monu to appear at the crime branch office in reserve police lines, Lakhimpur Kheri, at 10 am on Friday. The notice read that Ashish Mishra must appear in person and present evidences that he is aware of about the incident.“If Ashish Mishra does not abide by the summons, legal procedure will be adopted,” IG Singh said, adding that there was no time limit in the summons sent to Mishra. Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey were claimed to be close aides of Ashish Mishra and more raids were going on, people aware of the matter said. The arrests came only a few hours after the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to submit a report within a day on how many arrests have been made so far in connection with the case. ADG Kumar said the forensic team have found two cartridges and is examining one of the vehicles involved in the incident.The IG added that the incidents of firing or any fire arm injuries were not confirmed in the post-mortem report of the eight deceased. She said the police will proceed with evidences that are coming up during the investigation. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws started last year. The farmers were allegedly knocked down by a convoy of vehicles, one of which belonged to Mishra. Two BJP workers -- Shubham Mishra and Shyam Sunder -- and a driver -- Hari Om Mishra -- were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by angry protesters. A journalist working for a private TV channel, Raman Kashyap, also died in the violence. The farmers allege that Mishra’s son was in the convoy. The Lakhimpur Kheri violence has triggered a major political storm with the opposition leaders demanding the removal of Union minister Ajay Mishra, who on Wednesday met Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. He has claimed that his son was not in the car that ploughed through the protesters. He claimed the driver lost balance after being attacked by stone-pelters and then some protesters came under the car. Later, the driver was lynched and the car was set on fire, the minister has claimed. However, the police FIR states that Ashish Mishra was driving the car that ran over the protesters.

08-10-2021||India||SC questions ₹8L annual income limit for EWS quota||The Supreme Court on Thursday questioned the methodology adopted by the Union government in fixing ₹8 lakh as the annual income limit to identify the economically weaker section (EWS) for providing 10% quota in public jobs and educational institutions. Seeking relevant points that led to determination, a bench, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud launched a probe into government’s fixation of income criteria while hearing a clutch of petitions that challenged the 10% quota for EWS within All-India Quota (AIQ) seats in medical admissions. The 10% EWS quota was introduced under the 103rd Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2019 which is under challenge before a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court. As the Act has not been stayed, the government issued a notification on July 29 introducing 10% EWS quota along with 27% quota for other backward classes (OBC) within the All-India Quota (AIQ) seats for postgraduate medical courses from this academic year. By this decision, 2,500 PG seats in government medical colleges would go to OBCs and 1,000 to EWS. This decision was challenged in a clutch of petitions that came up for hearing on Thursday.The bench said, “We have to probe you (government) on what exercise you did before arriving at this decision or you simply lifted creamy layer criteria applicable to other backward classes (OBC) and applied it to EWS.”The income criterion of ₹8 lakh fixed by the Centre was one of the grounds taken by the petitioners to question the July 29 decision. Senior advocate Arvind Datar arguing the petitions said, “Statistics show that the per capita income in states differs widely - Goa is the state having the highest per capita income of almost ₹4 lakh whereas Bihar is at the bottom with ₹40,000. Therefore, determining EWS for all-India level requires careful study by an expert committee, so that the ends of social justice are attained. They have not shown whether any such exercise was done and if so, by whom.”Datar argued that for this year, EWS reservation should not be given effect in the absence of any criteria explaining the reservation. He referred to a government order of January 17, 2019 which said income from all sources will be counted for EWS reservation. However, in August 2021, another government communication referred to the Commission for Economically Backward Classes headed by retired Major General SR Sinho that formed the basis for providing EWS reservation by fixing ₹8 lakh as the income limit.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj appearing for the Centre told the court that the criteria adopted can be explained only by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), which has not been represented by the petitioners. He was appearing for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. On instructions, he stated that the figure of ₹8 lakh was a policy decision of the government based on the National Cost of Living Index. He said the creamy layer fixed for exclusion of the advanced among the OBCs was also ₹8 lakh as per last revision in 2017.The bench said, “You cannot apply the criteria for OBC and apply it to EWS. The OBCs will get reservation if they earn below ₹8 lakh and are socially and educationally backward, so they have to fulfil twin criteria. But with EWS, we are purely dealing with economic backwardness of persons who are forward communities.”The court allowed the ministry of social justice and empowerment and the DoPT to be joined as parties to petition and sought detailed response by Oct 21, the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scquestions-8l-annual-income-limit-for-ews-quota-101633630265500.html
08-10-2021||India||Tourist visas to be issued from October 15: MHA||The Indian government will be issuing tourist visas once again from October 15, eighteen months after suspending them because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement on Thursday. Initially, for a month, the tourists will be issued visas only for travel in chartered flights. From November 15, tourists could travel via non-chartered flights, particularly those run as part of Vande Bharat Mission or under ‘air bubble’ arrangements with different countries, MHA said. “Once the demand for tourist visas picks up, regular commercial flights will also start operating,” said a senior ministry official not wishing to be named. MHA said in a statement that it had received a lot of requests from various state governments as well as stakeholders in the tourism sector to allow foreign tourists to come again. The ministry then consulted the ministries of health, external affairs, civil aviation, tourism, and the state governments.“After consulting various inputs, the MHA has decided to begin granting fresh tourist visas for foreigners coming to India through chartered flights with effect from October 15. Foreign tourists entering into India by flights other than chartered aircraft would be able to do so from November 15 on fresh tourist visas,” the statement read. The government added that the visiting tourists, carriers bringing them to India, and all other stakeholders at landing stations will have to adhere to the ever-evolving Covid-19 guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare. Following the first wave of infections in March last year, the issue of tourist visas to foreigners was stopped. But later (when), foreign travellers were allowed to enter India on visas other than the tourist visa. Now, with Covid-19 cases plateauing, and 64.5% of the eligible population being inoculated with both doses of the vaccine, the international tourism industry in India can resume. Last month, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant wrote to MHA and MEA to grant special permission to allow chartered flights into the state. “Goa is ready to start tourism and is open to welcome tourists. I think ours is the first state to welcome tourists during the pandemic,” Sawant said. Goa, Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Sikkim have inoculated 100% of their populations with the first dose, said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the health ministry. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an interaction with Goa’s political leaders and health workers last month, had said the Centre has decided to give 500,000 tourists free visas. “Travel and tourism stakeholders will be given loans of up to ₹10 lakh with a 100% guarantee by the government. Tourist guides are being given the facility of taking a loan of up to ₹1 lakh,” Modi had said. Prior to the pandemic, Goa witnessed close to 90 lakh tourists, including around 9 lakh foreigners, directly contributing 16.43% towards the state’s gross domestic product, and employing nearly 35% of the state’s population, according to official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourist-visas-to-be-issued-from-october-15-mha-101633630264252.html
08-10-2021||India||Court refuses to extend Aryan’s custody, to hear bail plea today||A metropolitan magistrate court on Thursday rejected a plea by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for a four-day extension of the custody of Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan, and seven others arrested with him in the cruise ship rave party case.Immediately after the court rejected NCB’s plea, Aryan and others filed bail applications, but on the request of additional solicitor general Anil Singh, to grant the agency time to react to the bail applications, the court posted the pleas for hearing on Friday.Aryan and the others were, however, not sent to jail, as prison authorities require fresh RT-PCR test reports before admitting any new inmate. The group would spend the night at the NCB office.NCB on Saturday (October 2) night raided a cruise ship at the international cruise terminal in Mumbai and apprehended Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, and five other persons.All of them were booked under section 8C, 20B, 27 read with 35 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, after officers seized 13 gm of cocaine, 21 gm of charas (hasish), 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), 5 gm MD and cash worth ₹1.33 lakh from the cruise ship and were placed under arrest on October 3.All the eight were produced before the metropolitan magistrate court on Thursday afternoon,as their earlier NCB remand ended.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh urged the magistrate court to extend their NCB custody for four more days, contending that based on the information provided by Aryan Khan and Arbaaz, one more person, said Aachit Kumar, a drug supplier has been arrested and 2.6 gm marijuana has been seized from his house in Powai.Singh claimed that Aachit was part of the drug trafficking network in the city and Aryan and Arbaaz were connected with him. He added that one foreign national has also been arrested in the case and contraband material in commercial quantity seized from him.Aryan’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde strenuously opposed the contention. He submitted that Aryan has cooperated with investigators and has not been interrogated for the past two days. “Now, they want to confront me with Aachit Kumar, which they could have done earlier,” he said.Lawyers for the other accused persons also opposed the prayer for extension of their NCB remand.Advocate Taraq Sayed, who represented Arbaaz, submitted that Aryan and Arbaaz know each other, but they can’t be connected with the others.The agency has failed to establish their connection with any other accused.Metropolitan magistrate RM Nerlikar accepted their contentions and rejected the NCB plea, terming it vague. “As per the submissions made by the prosecution they want to confront Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant with Aachit Kumar who was arrested recently,” said the court.“Aachit was arrested after their statements. I do not want to go in that aspect and discuss the fact that why despite the statement given on the first day itself, they (NCB) arrested Aachit now,” the court added.“We cannot discuss what took the agency so much time to arrest the accused Aachit.”The magistrate said for police custody every detail needs to be pointed out and the same is need to be reflected in the remand application.“The remand report is vague,” said the court, adding, “No doubt it is the right of the agency to demand custody. But, police custody without cogent reason would amount to violation of the fundamental rights of the accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-refuses-to-extend-aryan-s-custody-to-hear-bail-plea-today-101633630084617.html

08-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur violence: Opposition leaders attack govt, meet families of victims||Opposition politicians made a beeline for Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on Thursday, visiting the families of some of the people who died in violence three days ago and attacking the government for not arresting the accused.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav told the victims’ kin that if his party forms the government in next year’s assembly elections, it will give ₹2 crore ex gratia each to the families of the four farmers who died. “People from all political parties are here so that the families get justice. The son of a minister will not be arrested as there is a BJP government both in UP and at the Centre,” said Yadav, assuring the grieving families of support. Farm groups say a car owned by Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon.The minister and his son, Ashish Mishra, deny the charge and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed.Yadav, who was detained in Lucknow when he attempted to visit the village on Monday, met the families of farmers and the journalist. “To keep people’s faith in the government and in the Constitution, the minister must resign and the accused must be sent to jail,” he told reporters. A Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) delegation led by party general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra met the victims’ kin and accused the ruling party and police of trying to save the accused, Ashish Mishra, who has been booked for murder.“The hearing started by the Supreme Court in the Lakhimpur incident gave hope to the people for relief and proper justice, as the attitude of the BJP government in this matter appeared mostly biased,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who spent around 55 hours in detention after being held on Monday while trying to go to Tikunia, met the families of two farmers in Bahraich.“If the minister of state for home does not resign nor is he sacked, then it means that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving a message to the public that if someone is in power, if he is a minister, he can do anything,” she told reporters in Moharnia, where she met the family members of Gurvinder Singh, one of the four farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.“Justice will be done in Lakhimpur case. Yogi Adityanath ji has led from the front and defused tension. An inquiry will unravel all aspects of the case, including those who fanned the fire,” said UP minister Suresh Rana||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-violence-opposition-leaders-attack-govt-meet-families-of-victims-101633630026221.html
08-10-2021||India||Free education, monthly stipend for children who lost parents to Covid-19||Free school education, assistance in getting loans for higher studies, health coverage under Ayushman Bharat scheme and a monthly stipend after attaining the age of 18 — these were among a slew of measures announced by the Centre on Thursday for children who lost both their parents to Covid-19, under the ‘PM CARES for Children’ scheme.On May 29, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the Union government will provide support to children who lost both their parents due to the infection. In a set of guidelines to ensure comprehensive care and protection of such children, the ministry of women and child development said the scheme will be applicable to children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian/adoptive parent(s) in the pandemic between March 11, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Besides, the beneficiaries should be less than 18-years of age as on the death of their parents to avail the benefits. The scheme is expected to continue till the year when every identified beneficiary shall turn 23 years of age, the guidelines said.The guidelines fixed the responsibilities at different levels with the ministry working as the nodal point for execution at the central level. According to the guidelines, the district magistrates (DMs) will be the nodal authority at the district level for execution of the scheme. The DMs, with assistance of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), will first try to rehabilitate the child within her/his extended family, relatives, kith or kin. In case that is not an option, the child, aged between 4 to 10, should be placed in foster care after due diligence as prescribed under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.“If the foster family is not available/not willing/not found fit by CWC, or the child (aged 4 -10 years or above) is not willing to live with them, the child is considered eligible beneficiaries under the PM CARES for Children Scheme and should be placed in age appropriate and gender appropriate Child Care Institution (CCI),” the guidelines said. For children below 6 years of age, identified beneficiaries will receive support and assistance from the Anganwadi services for supplementary nutrition, pre-school education/ ECCE (early childhood children education), immunization, health referrals, and health check-up.Besides, children above 10 years of age, who are not willing to live in child care institutions, may be enrolled in central government-run-residential schools such as Netaji Subhash Chand Bose Awasiya Vidyalaya, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, Eklavya Model Schools, Sainik Schools, Navodaya Vidyalaya, or any other residential school by the DM. For non-institutional care, financial support will be provided to children (in account of the guardian) and for children in institutional care, a maintenance grant will be given to the CCIs, the guidelines stated. Under the scheme, the DMs will ensure that the beneficiaries are provided admissions in any nearest school as a day scholar. “In government schools, two sets of free uniform and textbooks shall be provided, under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, as per the scheme guidelines. In private schools, tuition fees shall be exempted under section 12(1)(c) of Right to Education (RTE) Act. Under circumstances where a child is unable to receive above benefits, the fees, as per the RTE norms, will be given from the PM CARES for children scheme. The scheme will also pay for expenditure on uniforms, textbooks, and notebooks,” the guidelines said. For higher or professional education, beneficiaries will be assisted with obtaining an education loan and interest will be paid from PM CARES for Children Scheme in case they are unable to clear them. Besides, several scholarships will also be provided to the beneficiaries.According to the guidelines, a lump sum amount from PM CARES will be transferred directly in the post office account of beneficiaries upon opening and validation of their account. A pro-rata amount will be credited upfront in the account of each identified beneficiary such that the corpus for each beneficiary becomes ₹10 lakh at the time of attaining 18 years of age. “Children will receive a monthly stipend once they attain 18 years of age, by investing the corpus of ₹10 lakh. The beneficiary will receive stipend till they attain 23 years of age. They will receive an amount of ₹10 lakh on attaining 23 years of age,” it added. Meanwhile, the beneficiaries will also be covered under Ayushman Bharat Scheme (PM-JAY) with a health insurance cover of ₹5 lakhs, till 18 years of age, and the premium will be paid by the PM CARES.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-pm-cares-free-education-monthly-stipend-for-children-who-lost-parents-to-covid19-101633630024114.html
08-10-2021||India||A trafficking racket that fed on desperation across borders||In 2013, when she was 17, both her parents -- daily wage labourers in a village in Khulna, Bangladesh -- died of an illness. With no other source of income, she turned to begging on the streets, trying to battle for survival. One day, two people who were known in the locality, arrived at her door with a proposition. Come with us, they said, and we will give you a better life across the border in India. Eight years later, the 25-year-old lives in a government shelter home in Indore, after years of substance and sexual abuse at the hands of an organised trafficking ring that crosses international boundaries, and state boundaries within India. Their names were Bakhtiyar and Shabana, she remembers. There was nothing left for her in Bangladesh, so she willingly left with them.They took her to Jessore, and then later to Rajshahi in Bangladesh. In the dark of the night, they crossed a porous river boundary, across the Padma, into Murshidabad in West Bengal. “We walked for an entire night and reached the home of an agent. I don’t remember his name but he took me on a bus to Kolkata the next day,” she said. In Kolkata, the 17-year-old found herself in a room with 10 other girls, with nobody allowed to leave the apartment. “A man used to come to teach us etiquette, table manners, and English. They made us practice wearing fashionable clothes and high heels. At this point, we thought we were being trained for formal work,” she said. In a matter of weeks, she was moved to Mumbai, along with the others. “Two men and a woman received us at a railway station. They took us to a flat where they wanted to train us in prostitution. I refused. But two agents began forcing us to consume MDMA and ecstasy on a daily basis. There were no options before us,” she said. In the years that followed, she found herself in a massage parlour in Surat, reporting to the king pin of the operation, named Munirul, and then in a lodge at Mahalakshmi Nagar in Indore, where she and 21 others were housed, constantly “being supplied” to parties as prostitutes and drug mules. Until September 2020, when the Indore Police broke through the front door and rescued the women, and began the unraveling of an international trafficking, prostitution and drug ring, that is emblematic of the dark underbelly of India’s cities, and the impunity with which these networks operate across borders. The police investigation that began last year has now seen the rescue of 21 women, the arrest of at least 30 people, and finally on October 2, the arrest of Munirul, the 28-year-old man at the centre of the trafficking ring. Cases have been registered, and arrests are being made under section 370 (trafficking) of Indian Penal Code and the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at Vijay Nagar and MIG police stations. Indore (east) superintendent of police Ashutosh Bagri said, “Surat has emerged as a big centre for supplying Bangladeshi women across India. We have unraveled the trafficking network and are now looking to discovering the networks of customers for the ring.” National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows a total of 6,242 cases filed under section 370 (human trafficking) between 2018 and 2020. Of the 1,714 cases of human trafficking registered in 2020, the latest NCRB Crime in India report says that there were 1,912 men and 2,797 women affected. Of the 48 cases of international human trafficking, 24 people were from Bangladesh, the highest, followed by 20 from Nepal. Madhya Pradesh based woman rights activists Rolly Shivhare said, “Trafficking is a serious problem that needs to be addressed socially and by implementing the law stringently. In MP, though people know that women from Bangladesh and Nepal are being brought, but police raids are intermittent. Similarly, women from Odisha and tribal areas have been trafficked for years to Bundelkhand and Chambal on the pretext of marriage as the sex ratio is very low at these places. The government must develop a stronger information network to tackle the crisis.”How the racket was busted On September 21, 2020, two women, who said they were from Mumbai, walked into the Vijay Nagar police station in Indore, and registered a complaint. They said that they were brought to the city on the pretext of a modelling event, but were being forced into prostitution, and kept hostage in a flat. Vijay Nagar station incharge Tehzeeb Qazi said, “These women somehow managed to flee the flat. We raided the flat the same day and rescued 15 women. The police arrested five people, who were working as local agents, and they informed us that six more women had also been kept hostage in a guest house in Lasudiya. Out of these, 12 were from Bangladesh while the others were from West Bengal and Bihar. The locals have been handed over to their family members.” The then deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Indore, HN Mishra, formed a special investigation team (SIT) of four police officers led by additional superintendent of police Rajesh Raghuvanshi to probe the matter. But there was one major roadblock -- afraid of the ramifications of being implicated in the case, none of the 15 victims were amenable to speaking.The break came when, a few days later, a 29-year-old woman came to the police station, and said she was ready to tell all. “She was also a resident of Khulna, and was raped by a villager. Instead of complaining to the police, her family abandoned her. Like the others, she was brought to India by Bakhtiyar and Shabana. She went through the same training process in Kolkata, and was sold to an agent in Mumbai, where she began working with Munirul. She was sent to Indore, where she shared her ordeal with a man who decided to marry her. Despite her leaving the network, Munirul and another accused, Indore-based Sagar Jain, continued to blackmail her. She told us she was often raped by the two men. When the raids took place, and she found out, she came forward to file a separate FIR,” said Qazi.Based on the information they gathered, the SIT arrested Aruz Syed, 32, and Titu Gazi Bengali, 34, from Surat on October 10,2020. It was Aruz and Titu who held training sessions in Mumbai, coaching the trafficked girls on how to “behave with customers” and dodge the police. In the same month, more arrests were made. Deepak Vaishnav and Govardhan Purohit were arrested from Indore, for allegedly developing fake Aadhar cards for the women. “There were 20 other agents that were nabbed as well, for supplying women,” police officers said. Then, two months later, the SIT made another significant arrest in December, of Sagar Jain, a crucial link in the chain. He served two purposes for the gang in Indore. One was the supply of drugs, and sending the girls into parties essentially as drug peddlers. The second was working to fix deals with agents to set up encounters with customers for the women, who often were sent to different places for prostitution for several days. Jain, the police discovered, was arrested once before in 2017, on the charge of “supplying Russian women” to different parties in Indore, but was released on bail in 2019. Soon after his release, he turned his attention to woman from Bangladeshi women since the police was on the lookout for Russian women. How the operation worked From identifying girls from underprivileged families in Bangladesh to imparting training and providing fake documents in India, every person in the operation had a defined role, police officials said. Rajesh Raghuvanshi, assistant superintendent of police and head of the SIT, said, “Bakhtiyar and Shabana, from Khulna and Jessore, would identify the victims, all from poor or marginalised families saying they would give them a good life in India, perhaps marry them off in a rich family, or find good work.” Initially, when their networks weren’t fully established, Munirul would marry the women crossing the border, to cement their identities as Indians by using false documentation. “Munirul has told us that he married at least 25 women between 2012 and 2019. He used to present the agents as family members before the Qazi for Nikaah. These marriages took place in West Bengal, Surat and Mumbai,” Raghuvanshi said. Back in their homes in Bangladesh, Bakhtiyar and Shabana would pay the guardians or the girls’ families about ₹30,000 a month for a few months. The money flow would soon stop, but by that time, the girls were trapped, either addicted to the drugs, or worried that their illegal entries into the country would be exposed. Munirul would the “supply of the women.” Agents would “select” women through video calls. The repetitive rejection of a woman would lead to her use only to supply drugs, police officers said. Most were made to interact with prospective customers through video calls on WhatsApp. “The agents also used to send a short video of them. The prospective clients were members of WhatsApp groups in cities like Mumbai, Indore, and Surat. Later, Munirul used to charge up to ₹5 lakh from local agents for sending the woman for a week or fortnight to any city. To make up the money, local agents like Sagar Jain used to fix up to five customers for a woman in a day,” said Raghuvanshi. Interrogations have revealed that Munirul supplied over 200 women over the past five years. “He has high-profile contacts but is not revealing them at this time. We are investigating his call detail records,” said Jyoti Sharma, incharge of women’s police station in Indore. The king pinMuch like the origin story of the victims themselves, Munirul, alias Gazi, came to India at the age of seven, crossing the border illegally sitting atop a steamer in an attempt to escape domestic abuse, police said. While the details of his life are still sketchy, in the next decade he found himself in Surat, working at a clothes and jewellery market. “It was here, at the age of 19, that he told someone, who is yet to be identified or arrested, about his roots in Bangladesh. He was told that it was getting difficult to bring Russian and Thai girls into India. So he began exploring the idea, and his contacts back home,” a police officer said. Over the past eight years, Munirul accumulated wealth, buying a lavish home in Gulmohar in Surat. When the police raided his house, it had multiple security guards, and more than a dozen servants. On the walls were photographs of Munirul with some of the women he was trafficking. In the year since the investigation began though, Munirul was changing locations and sim cards every month, even evading a police raid in Surat once. In late September, the police were informed that he was hiding in a slum near Zorba Pati, from where he was eventually arrested. He was sent to Indore Central Jail on Sunday, after being produced before court. Yet, even as Munirul is now in jail, the investigation has been stymied by a security breach in the government shelter home the 12 Bangladeshi victims were lodged in. Between March and July 2021, 10 of them went missing, and thus far, the police have been able to recover only one woman, who was one of those married to Munirul. Qazi, the police station incharge, said that the police wrote to the district administration for the serious lapses in security -- but no action has been taken so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-trafficking-racket-that-fed-on-desperation-across-borders-101633629903672.html
08-10-2021||India||UK lifts its quarantine rule for Indian flyers||The UK said on Thursday it will begin accepting India’s vaccine certificates from October 11, ending a row that had resulted in British nationals facing a 10-day mandatory quarantine on arrival even if they are fully vaccinated. New British guidelines on approved Covid-19 vaccines and the requisite proof of vaccination said India would be added to a “list of countries and territories with approved proof of vaccination [from] 4 am [on] Monday 11 October”. British high commissioner Alex Ellis tweeted there would be “no quarantine” for Indian travellers who were fully vaccinated with Covishield or any other UK-approved vaccine, and thanked the Indian government for its close cooperation on the issue over the past month. “From Monday... a traveller from India to the UK, double jabbed with Covishield or another vaccine recognised by the UK regulator, does not have to quarantine. It will be easier and cheaper to enter the UK. This is great news,” Ellis said in a video statement. The move was in line with the comprehensive strategic partnership agreed to by the prime ministers of the two countries in May, he said. Britain has issued thousands of visas to students, business travellers and tourists in recent months, Ellis added, while calling for further opening up of travel between the two sides. “Some of the noise about this issue over the last few weeks just shows how keen people are to travel to the UK and I’m delighted by that. So, let’s now go further. Let’s open up more flights between the two countries, let’s get British tourists able to come in to India... let’s facilitate business travellers who are trying to come in to India with e-visas,” Ellis said.Indians arriving in the UK before October 11 must follow the “rules for people who are not fully vaccinated”, according to the new guidelines. “If you arrive after that, you can use a vaccine certificate to prove your vaccination status,” a government notification said. Earlier in the day, India had said it was hopeful of finding a solution to the vaccine certification row. “Discussions are ongoing and we remain hopeful that some solution may emerge,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. He described Britain’s travel restrictions on Indian nationals with valid vaccine certificates as “clearly discriminatory” and said measures imposed by the UK from October 4 were “not right”. He added, “We took up the issue with the UK at various levels but without success.” Once the British travel rules came into force on October 4, India imposed “reciprocal measures” that apply only to UK nationals arriving in India from Britain. The measures kicked in as the UK government didn’t make a call on accepting India’s vaccine certification more than 10 days after the conclusion of technical discussions between the two sides. The row erupted because Indians travelling to the UK had to undergo 10-day home quarantine under new rules. The British government’s failure to recognise Covishield, an Indian version of the Britain’s AstraZeneca jab, had also given rise to allegations of vaccine racism. The UK subsequently included Covishield in its list of approved vaccines. As part of an update of its travel rules, the UK also removed 47 countries and territories from its “red list”. From October 11, the red list will be reduced to seven countries, and proof of vaccination will be recognised from 37 new countries and territories, including India, Brazil, Ghana, Hong Kong, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey. Eligible travellers vaccinated in these 37 countries and territories will “be treated the same as returning fully vaccinated UK residents, so long as they have not visited a red list country or territory in the 10 days before arriving in England”, an official statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-lifts-its-quarantine-rule-for-indian-flyers-101633629783650.html
08-10-2021||India||On SC prod, minister’s son called by UP police||Hours after the Supreme Court termed the Lakhimpur Kheri incident “very unfortunate” and gave the Uttar Pradesh government 24 hours to report back whether it has arrested all the accused booked for the violence that killed eight people, the UP Police arrested two people on Thursday.However, Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, was neither detained nor arrested. Ashish Mishra, who was named in the murder FIR registered on Monday and who has been interviewed by some TV channels, has repeatedly denied the charges.UP Police summoned him for questioning at 10am on Friday, and pasted a notice outside Ajay Mishra’s house in Lakhimpur. The notice said Ashish Mishra must appear in person. “If Ashish Mishra does not abide by the summons, legal procedure will be adopted,” said Lucknow inspector general Lakshmi Singh.The two arrested individuals were identified as Luvkush Rana and Ashish Pandey, both believed to be associates of Ashish Mishra, said additional director general, law and order, Prashant Kumar. He said the police identified six people as accused — three of them dead in the violence, the two accused, and Ashish Mishra. Another accused was unidentified. Kumar added that the forensic team had located two bullet cartridges from the spot and was examining one of the vehicles involved. Farmers allege that Ashish Mishra fired shots during the violence, a charge denied by him.“This is a very unfortunate incident. You tell us how many accused are there and whether they have been arrested or not. You give us a status report tomorrow,” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, told senior advocate Garima Parshad, who appeared for the state government in the case registered by the top court on its own (suo motu) as a public interest litigation. The bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, said that the state government’s report should also give details of the persons who lost their lives in the fateful incident and all the steps taken by the authorities ever since.When Parshad described the incident as unfortunate, the bench retorted: “We also feel the same way. Eight people have lost their lives...the allegation is that you are not investigating properly.”Parshad said that she needs some time to place on record the steps taken by the Uttar Pradesh government, which, she said, has also set up a judicial inquiry under a former judge of the Allahabad high court apart from registration of a first information report in the case. At this, the bench said that Parshad should put on record her report by Friday, giving details of the deceased, status of accused as regards to their arrest and the judicial inquiry. Parshad has also been asked to gather status of a petition filed before the Allahabad high court on the same issue.The bench also asked the UP government to ensure proper medical facilities to mother of Lovepreet Singh, who lost his life in the incident on October 3. “We have received a communication from a lawyer, Amanpreet Singh Khalsa, that mother of deceased Lovepreet Singh is very unwell... she is critical but is not getting proper medical care. You make sure she gets proper treatment immediately. Shift her to a nearby hospital,” the court told the senior lawyer. Advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, one of the two lawyers whose letter to the CJI formed the basis of the court taking up the case suo motu, submitted that the interference of the apex court is imperative in view of the involvement of politicians in the ghastly incident. Tripathi said that mere registration of the FIR is not enough and that the apex court should monitor the investigation to ensure a free and fair probe against all the accused. Since news of the violence broke on Sunday, Opposition leaders have made a beeline for the village amid rising political tensions over the incident. On Thursday, the day the state police formed a revamped nine-member team to probe the incident, former CM and chief of the Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav visited the families of the deceased.On Wednesday, the court registered the suo motu case as “In Re Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) leading to loss of life” after receiving a letter from Tripathi and CS Panda. The matter was registered as a criminal writ petition, pertaining to investigation and prosecution.The development came on a day Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, along with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, his Punjab counterpart Charanjit Singh Channi, and other senior leaders reached the village, roughly 10km from the India-Nepal border. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon.The minister and his son deny the charge and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed. The Mishras claim Ashish Mishra was not at the site. Some unverified videos of the incident show the Thar knocking down protesters from behind. On Wednesday, a new, clearer 45-second video of the incident showed the Thar ploughing through the farmers at high speed, with two vehicles in tow. The identities of individuals was not clear and HT couldn’t independently verify the authenticity of the clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-sc-prod-minister-s-son-called-by-up-police-101633629725695.html
08-10-2021||India||What does the fire in global energy markets entail for India?||On April 20, 2020, exactly 40 days after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 as a pandemic, WTI Crude -- the US benchmark for crude oil prices -- fell into negative territory. As of October 6, WTI was trading at $76.94 per barrel. This underlines the sharp turnaround in global energy markets. With energy prices on the upswing and the world bracing itself for Brent crude (the global benchmark for petroleum prices) hitting the $90 mark, what are the likely consequences for India?Broad based spike in energy markets and OPEC playing hardball will keep oil prices highWhile crude price has been on an upward trajectory since the end of September, the prices of other energy resources, including natural gas and coal have risen to multi year highs across the globe as demand for energy soars against the backdrop of a massive shortage. IMF data on global commodity prices (till August ) shows that price of natural gas and coal (represented by their indices) are the highest since the financial crisis in late 2008.Coal prices have increased across the world, a trend which started from the coal shortage in China. The price of natural gas has also increased due to lower supplies amid rising demand across developed economies. Bloomberg reported (on September 24) that the surge in natural gas prices is expected to force some consumers in the US to switch to oil.This, when read with the fact that OPEC+, the cartel of oil producing countries, is refusing to increase crude production to pre-pandemic levels, means that oil prices will continue to face tailwinds.Rising oil and falling rupee mean higher domestic prices for petroleum productsIndia imports 81% of crude petroleum and the price it pays is captured by the price of India’s Crude Oil Basket (COB). Although not identical to Brent crude prices, the two move in sync. Another factor which matters for India’s petroleum import bill is the value of the rupee. For the same dollar rates, the import cost for the domestic economy can vary a lot with exchange rate changes.Petroleum ministry data shows that India’s COB was priced at $80.49 per barrel on October 5. At the exchange rate of ₹74.53 to a dollar, the rupee price came to ₹5999 per barrel. Crude oil prices have been significantly higher in the past. India’s COB price was above the $100 per barrel mark between February 2011 and August 2014, but the exchange rate was more favourable then. This means that the current rupee price is much higher, despite the dollar prices not being as high. With oil prices rising and the rupee falling, domestic prices could increase further.What does it mean for petrol-diesel and general prices?This depends on two factors in addition to crude prices: exchange rate and taxes. A September 29 note by Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at CARE Ratings expects the exchange rate to be in the range of ₹75-75.5 per dollar “before clarity descends on OPEC+ action”. The tax impact is a bit more complicated because state and central taxes differ in nature. While bulk of central taxes are fixed and do not change with prices, state Value Added Taxes (VAT) are ad-valorem in nature and the tax burden can increase when base prices rise. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman flagged this issue in an HT interview on September 21.“The only very strong case for me to put forward – excise levied by the Centre is not value added; it is fixed. If it were value added, each time the price increases, it goes up. And prices are going up. So, I have to balance this with what’s happening in the states. It’s also a question of time. I won’t be able to comment on it beyond that”, Sitharaman said then in response to a question on high oil prices.Higher energy prices are likely to generate tailwinds for inflation as well. A research note dated October 5 by Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited points that India is amongst the few countries in the region where energy prices have a high correlation with the core Consumer Price Index.The effect on India’s trade balanceIndia’s oil imports reached an all-time high of $17.42 billion in the month of September. This is likely to increase as prices rise further. Sabnavis’s note gives some projections on this count.“India imports around 4.5-5 million barrels per day which for the second half of the year would be 820-910 million barrels. Intuitively $ 10/barrel will mean an increase in the import bill by $ 8.2- $ 9.1 billion for this period. In FY20 the oil bill was $ 130 billion and in FY21 $ 82.4 billion. In the first 6 months of FY22, oil imports were $ 70.5 billion and hence assuming a similar quantum would be imported in the second quarter there would be an increase in the half yearly bill by 11.6% to 12.9%. This will tend to impact the trade deficit too. The trade deficit for the first half was around $ 75.7 billion”, the note says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-the-fire-in-global-energy-markets-entail-for-india-101633629607024.html
08-10-2021||India||Modi lauds India’s fight against Covid, inaugurates 35 oxygen plants||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said 1,150 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have started functioning in the last few months and now every district has them under the PM Cares Fund as the government was setting up their network across the country.Speaking at an event at Rishikesh’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences for the inauguration of 35 PSA oxygen plants established under the fund across 35 states and union territories, he lauded the bravery with which India faced the biggest crisis--Covid-19 pandemic--of 100 years. He detailed how the country’s medical oxygen generation capacity and testing were ramped up while over 130,000 vaccination centres were set up.Modi said the capacity of 900 metric tonnes of medical oxygen was increased by 10 times and called it an unimaginable feat for any country. “From one testing lab, we have set up a network of 3,000 testing labs. More than 130,000 vaccination centres have been set up across the country.” He said the world’s fastest, and largest vaccination drive shows their determination, unity, and resolve to serve people. Modi said the country’s varied terrain and large population were among the challenges India faced in its fight against the pandemic.“Every person in the country should know and understand how we met this challenge in such a short time.” He added the production of oxygen is more in the country’s eastern part while there is greater demand for it in the northern and western parts. “Faced up with these logistic challenges, we worked on war footing level.
