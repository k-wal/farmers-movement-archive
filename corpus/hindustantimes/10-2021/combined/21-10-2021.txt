The move by Mayawati, who slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over the custodial death of the dalit youth, came a day after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited the victim’s family amid high drama that also included a brief detention at the police lines. “The custodial death of a sanitation worker in Agra is most saddening. A party delegation led by Gayacharan Dinkar would visit Agra, meet the victim’s kin and also interact with officials to get justice in the case,” Mayawati tweeted. Mayawati also referred to the recent killing of a Kanpur trader in Gorakhpur and said that the Gorakhpur and Agra incidents had put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the dock. “The BJP government is in the dock and BSP demands that the government must bring about necessary changes in the policing system,” she tweeted. Earlier on Wednesday, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi managed to meet the dalit victim’s family after a nearly three-hour stand-off with the police. According to SSP Agra Muniraj G, the accused dalit sanitation worker had admitted to his involvement in the theft of ₹25 lakh from the police ‘maalkhana’ (store) and his health deteriorated during recovery of a sum of ₹15 lakh from his house in Agra. The victim’s family has contradicted the police claim. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said that no one would be allowed to take law and order into their hands. The BJP is projecting Baby Rani Maurya, a Jatav dalit like Mayawati, as its own home-grown Jatav face ahead of the 2022 UP polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/custodial-death-after-priyanka-visit-mayawati-rushes-team-to-agra-101634839770065.html

They were arrested on Wednesday and ₹4.92 lakh of the money was recovered from them. Police said the money belonged to Rajeev Bansal, a businessman from northeast Delhi’s Seelampur, who has also been booked for not conducting a police verification of his employee.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said that on Monday, Wazirabad police station received information regarding a robbery near Burari flyover. The complainant, Deepak, alleged that two persons on a bike robbed him of his mobile phone and ₹5 lakh while he was riding his scooter to Bansal’s office in Seelampur. Deepak told the police that the robbers had thrown red chilli powder in his eyes.“Our team visited the spot but did not find any traces of red chilli powder. We questioned Deepak and found discrepancies in his statements. After collecting enough evidence, we confronted Deepak. He broke down and confessed to making up the robbery story. His interrogation led to the arrest of his cousin Aslam and the recovery of ₹4.92 lakh,” added DCP Kalsi.A senior police officer associated with the probe said that Deepak was working with Bansal “for the last six years”.“He was previously involved in two similar cases of breach of trust and theft. It has come to our notice that his employer had not got Deepak’s police verification done, despite verification of tenants and servants (employees) being mandatory in Delhi. We have booked the employer under Indian Penal Code’s section 188 for defying the police order,” said a senior police officer, associated with the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/34yearold-stages-robbery-to-dupe-employer-of-5-lakh-2-arrested-101634839649882.html

Currently, footfall at these parks is negligible, but with this initiative, we hope that citizens’ engagement will increase now. We have prepared a policy in this regard.”According to the policy, these parks can be booked for cultural, art and school events, but no political function or wedding ceremony will be allowed. The agency has divided the parks in two categories— open park spaces and parks with amphitheatres and boat clubs on their premises. The 25 parks are located in Hauz Khas, Asita-Yamuna riverfront, Sanjay Lake, Astha Kunj in Nehru Place, Swarn Jayanti Park in Rohini, two district parks in Dwarka, and Coronation Park in North Delhi, among others.The DDA official further said, “The idea is to allow the public to use the parks in an organised manner. Any individual, organisations, residents’ body or institution may book the park. All parks are about two to three acres in size.”Of the 25 parks, six have facilities such as an amphitheatre and are located in Malviya Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Vasant Vihar, among other areas. The capacity of amphitheatres is between 150-750, the official said.DDA already has over 100 open spaces across the city which can be booked for weddings or political events. “Cooking will not be allowed inside the park. Only ready-to-eat food will be permitted. The park can be booked for six to 12 hours and the events can be organised between 6am and 8pm during winter and 5am and 9pm in summer,” said the official.A DDA official said the aim of the policy is not to earn revenue, therefore the booking charges are nominal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-to-allow-public-events-at-25-parks-but-no-weddings-or-political-functions-101634839472604.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees a dip in morning temperature||With the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from the past two weeks and with winter approaching, mornings in Mumbai have been getting perceptibly cooler. The minimum temperature at the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) monitoring station in Santacruz on Thursday was recorded at 22.8 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. This is also down from 23.4 degrees Celsius recorded on Wednesday, 24 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and 25.8 degrees Celsius on Monday.“There are strong landward winds coming from the sea towards the evening which are bringing the temperature down. The relative humidity has also reduced sharply as there are no rains anymore. When the air is humid it can hold heat better than dry air,” said a meteorologist with IMD’s regional forecasting centre. As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai, the minimum temperature (which is recorded at 5.30am every day) is likely to hover around 23 and 24 degrees Celsius over the next week.The absence of rain has also had implications for air quality in the city. Mumbai recorded ‘moderate’ air quality on Thursday, with an air quality index (AQI) value of 106 as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index bulletin. Particulate matter (PM) 2.5, ozone and PM10 were identified as the primary pollutants in the city, with presence of ozone indicating the presence of sunlight during the day. As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), run by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and the earth sciences ministry, PM10 in Mumbai was recorded at 101ug/m3 (above the safe level of 60ug/m3), while PM2.5 was recorded at 50ug/m3, within the permissible daily average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-a-dip-in-morning-temperature-101634839471125.html

21-10-2021||Pune||Drive to target housing societies to ensure maximum Covid vaccinations in Pune||PUNE With the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) claiming 100 per cent of beneficiaries in the 18-44-year age group have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, the next focus is housing societies –big and small – to ensure the maximum beneficiaries across age groups are vaccinated with at least one dose, if not both. The PMC, therefore, has decided start vaccination drives in housing societies, an announcement for which was made by the civic body on Wednesday. “Our target is to vaccinate 100 per cent of the population in the city with both doses. To reach maximum people, we have decided to undertake vaccination drives in housing societies. Earlier, such drives were carried out in slums,” said city mayor Murlidhar Mohol. The PMC claims to have also vaccinated bed-ridden beneficiaries across age groups. According to PMC immunization officer Dr Suryakant Deokar, this week, the PMC has been able to vaccinate even more than the estimated population in 18 to 45-year age group, 103% in total, given the floating population coming in from Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural parts of the district. The Pune civic body has been able to administer 4.94 million doses, of which 3,153,205 people received a first dose and 1,788,745 have taken both doses. The central government has estimated that Pune city’s population is 4,210,592. According to the civic body, members of housing soceities can directly contact the PMC ward offices, which will make provision for vaccination within society premises. Mohol said, “PMC has published the health officers’ numbers working with each regional ward office. The housing societies can contact the health officer and carry out the drive.” A PMC officer spaking on the condition of anonymity said that many still have to take second shot of the vaccine. However, civic officials observed that a significant population is hesitant to take the second dose and are not fully vaccinated even if they qualify after gap of 84 days for Covishield, and 28 days for Covaxin.The age group above 45 years is the most hesitant to take the second shot, possibly due to side effects after the first dose and the ebbing of the second Covid wave.Covid vaccinations in the city First dose Age group 18-44: 103% Age group 45-59: 84% Age group 60 and above: 79% Second doseAge group 18-44: 41% Age group 45-59: 71% Age group 60 and above: 65%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/drive-to-target-housing-societies-to-ensure-maximum-covid-vaccinations-in-pune-101634838990172.html
21-10-2021||Gurugram||Wazirabad sports complex will now include an int’l standard cycle track||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has proposed the construction of a 4.5-kilometre cycle track as part of a proposed sports complex at Wazirabad, located near sectors 52 and 53, officials said on Thursday. According to MCG chief engineer TL Sharma, the cycle track will be of international standard so that it can be accessed both by the public as well as athletes and also be used for sports competitions.Officials said that they are exploring the possibility of constructing a section of the cycle track as a velodrome, i.e., an indoor track made of wood, grass or concrete with an arena for spectators.“The cycle track will be built around the stadium complex. This will not only help athletes promote cycling but also provide an opportunity for residents of the city to cycle there for leisure purposes,” Sharma said.The cycle track is part of a ₹200-crore sports complex planned at Wazirabad, which will also have other facilities such as a hostel for players, swimming pool, shooting range, basketball court, and kabaddi court. Along with the cycle track, the plan is to develop the swimming pool on par with Olympic standards, where district, state and national events can be held.MCG officials said that a detailed project report (DPR) is currently being examined by the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB).The ₹200-crore project is the third time that the MCG has revised the project since June 2016, when Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced the construction of a sports stadium in Wazirabad.Until April 2019, a ₹130-crore archery range and multi-purpose indoor sports complex was to be developed at the site. However, following a meeting between the then Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) chief executive officer, V Umashankar, and former MCG commissioner, Yashpal Yadav, it was decided that a ₹20-crore recreational sports complex — on the lines of Azad Maidan and Shivaji Park in Mumbai, with a multi-purpose sports ground and basic indoor sports infrastructure — was more feasible.However, this plan was changed again in August last year to the ₹200-crore project.“The directorate of ULB will be checking technical details regarding the DNIT (detailed notice inviting tender) and DPR next week in Gurugram. We are anticipating to procure the final approval for the project from ULB next month, following which tenders will be floated to finalise a contractor for constructing the project,” Sharma said.According to officials, the MCG commissioner also apprised GMDA chief executive officer Sudhir Rajpal of the cycle track plan during a residents advisory council (RAC) meeting last month, for its inputs on the project. Since October 2020, the GMDA has constructed cycle tracks at several locations, such as Netaji Subash Marg, Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road and Hamilton Court Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wazirabad-sports-complex-will-now-include-an-int-l-standard-cycle-track-101634838633600.html

All 69 sanitation workers on the MCM’s payroll had been protesting since Tuesday, seeking payment of September salaries and arrears that cumulatively amount to ₹60 lakh.The sanitation workers’ union said that it will be meeting MCM officials next Tuesday to further discuss the matter and to seek assurances, in writing, of payment by November 3, failing which they will plan a full-scale strike.Rajesh Kumar, the district president of Haryana Sanitation Workers Union, said that the monthly salary of a sanitation worker in MCM amounts to around ₹16,000, after deductions.“Since the time of enrolment, sanitation workers have been paid only a monthly income of ₹8000-9,000, around half their salaries. However, the situation worsened this month, as workers are yet to receive any payment from MCM towards their September salaries, which prompted us to launch a full-scale strike,” Kumar said.Kumar said that on Tuesday and Wednesday, sanitation workers and the union representatives gathered outside the MCM office in Sector 2 of Manesar and raised slogans against the civic body, demanding payment of salaries.“Sanitation inspectors met with us earlier today (Thursday) assuring us that the salaries, including arrears, would be paid by November 3. We have called off the strike indefinitely, and want the assurances to be given in writing along with a commitment to procure gears for the workers,” Kumar said.MCM officials could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.According to Kumar, the MCM is yet to provide brooms, uniforms, boots, monthly stock of soaps and oils, among other such items that are given to sanitation workers across Haryana upon their enrolment, and the same is being procured by sanitation workers at their own cost.All 69 sanitation workers were enrolled with the MCM in February, two months after the civic body was formed. The protest by sanitation workers marked the first strike or protest against the MCM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/manesar-sanitation-staff-calls-off-protest-after-assurances-over-salary-payments-101634838632255.html

A fourth person, the brother-in-law of the main accused, was also shot at but survived and is undergoing treatment, the police said.According to the police, the incident took place between 2am and 3am on Thursday, when the main accused, identified as Neeraj Chawla (35), is alleged to have committed the triple murder over suspicions that his wife was having an extramarital affair with the property dealer, who was a friend of his brother-in-law’s. Chawla and his aide, Lekhraj, were arrested from the NIT area in the afternoon by the DLF crime branch, the police said. The deceased were identified as Ayesha (30), Suman (50), and Rajan Sharma (35). The police said that Chawla’s wife had separated from him around a year ago. A statement released by the Faridabad police read, “In this incident, wife Ayesha, mother-in-law Suman and brother-in-law’s friend Rajan died on the spot and 26-year-old Gagan was seriously injured and is undergoing treatment. While undergoing treatment, Gagan gave his statement to the police that his brother-in-law had executed this murder by shooting with the help of others. On the basis of this statement, the police have registered a case under the Arms Act and sections of murder along with other relevant sections.”The police said that besides having problems with his wife, Chawla had loaned ₹10 lakh to Gagan, and was demanding the same, which was a source of friction between them. The police said that four shots were fired from countrymade guns in the crime. The police also rescued Chawla and Ayesha’s 12-year-old son from the scene of the crime and handed him over to his relatives.Gagan and his friend, Sharma, used to work as property dealers in Sector 56 after moving to Faridabad from Samalkha in Panipat. On Wednesday, Gagan and Sharma had returned from a temple at night, and Sharma stayed over at Gagan’s residence.Sube Singh, the spokesperson for the Faridabad police, said, “Three bodies were sent for a post-mortem examination. A motorcycle and two countrymade pistols were recovered from the site. The case is being investigated and the accused will be presented in court on Friday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-crime-man-aide-held-for-triple-murder-of-wife-relatives-101634838631051.html
21-10-2021||Gurugram||Master stormwater drain network to be revamped to prevent waterlogging||Thirty-five years since the construction of a master stormwater drain in the city, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to renovate the existing infrastructure, which spans from Rezang La Chowk to Palam Vihar, to curb waterlogging ahead of the next monsoon season, officials said on Thursday.In this project, the Leg 1 of the master stormwater drain network will be renovated. Gurugram’s stormwater master drain network is divided into Leg 1, Leg 2 and Leg 3 or the Badshahpur drain, all of which finally flow into the Najafgarh drain.The authority will also carve out 12 rainwater harvesting pits along the drain, as part of the project. The renovation work for the drain is likely to start in the second half of November, before which citizens can share their opinions and comments about the project on GMDA’s website.The master stormwater drain starts from Sikanderpur and terminates in Najafgarh drain, passing through sectors 18, 19, Old Delhi Road, sectors 22, 23A, Palam Vihar, railway culvert number 47, Bajghera village and Sector 115. This drain was constructed with brick masonry walls and was covered with a slab approximately 35 years ago on the stretch between Old Delhi Road to railway culvert number 47.“Being old and gaseous effect of flowing regular sewage, slab and wall is collapsing upon itself due to its self-load and wall mortar joints are weakening at various spots in Sector 22 and Palam Vihar. Rapid urbanisation has resulted in increase of discharge in the drain in rainy season. The width of the drain is 4.25 metres before Old Delhi Road and thereafter, on downstream side, it reduces to 2.1 metres and 3.25 metres, which results in overflowing of the drain during heavy rainfall. Due to these issues, the drain will be reconstructed as a reinforced cement concrete box drain,” the executive engineer from the infrastructure-II division of GMDA, who is handling the project, said.He said that as all rainwater does not get drained out, 12 rainwater harvesting pits have also been proposed along the drain for conservation of stormwater overflow.The project cost is estimated to cost around ₹15 crore and will be taken up in two phases. As part of the first phase, a drain will be constructed from Rezang La Chowk to railway culvert number 47, while the second phase will consist of the construction of a drain from the Old Delhi Road culvert to Rezang La Chowk, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/master-stormwater-drain-network-to-be-revamped-to-prevent-waterlogging-101634838629826.html

21-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to take up major repairs, reconstruction of 14 bridges in western suburbs||Fourteen vehicular and pedestrian bridges in the western suburbs will be taken up for major repairs and reconstruction, owing to the structural defects identified during a recent audit. These bridges are located in Malad, Goregaon and Andheri, and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has floated bids worth ₹16.88 crore for the works.According to BMC officials, these 14 bridges in western suburbs were found to be vulnerable in an audit by Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) that was undertaken following the collapse of the Himalaya Bridge near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in south Mumbai in March 2019. A BMC official from the bridges department said, “Overall, there are 50 such small bridges that are being taken up for repairs and reconstruction in phases. We will also go ahead with similar works for the Bandra skywalk in the coming days.”While six of the bridges will undergo major repairs, eight will be demolished and rebuild. Of the 14, five are vehicular bridges – Malwani bridge (Malad), Hindustan Nallah Bridge (Charkop Road in Kandivli), the bridge connecting Lokhandwala and Laxmi Nagar (Andheri West) and the one crossing Mithi River on Andheri-Kurla Road.The document tendered by BMC stated, “Vehicular traffic in the construction area shall be regulated with the help of the traffic police authority. However, pedestrian movement in the area should not be affected during the entire construction period. Hence, before starting the work, barricading, signals, warning signals etc shall be provided, in order to not affect the pedestrian movement and utilities.”Further, the demolition work for a part of the Bandra skywalk is expected to start after Diwali, for which the bids were floated in August. BMC has decided to demolish and rebuild a part of the city’s first skywalk in Bandra (East) after a third-party auditor pointed out structural defects on the structure. Owing to this, traffic on the station road leading to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) is expected to be affected. According to BMC officials, the stretch of the bridge between Bandra (East) station and Western Express Highway will be demolished and rebuilt at the cost of around ₹16.20 crore. In 2019 during monsoon, a portion of the skywalk had collapsed, injuring a woman. Apart from the Bandra skywalk, 23 remaining skywalks in the city are also due to undergo major repairs or demolition and reconstruction, as suggested by the VJTI audit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-to-take-up-major-repairs-reconstruction-of-14-bridges-in-western-suburbs-101634837849541.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||2 of 30 firecrackers found violating noise limit: MPCB test for Diwali in Mumbai||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), along with Mumbai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation, on Thursday carried out noise tests on 30 varieties of commercially available firecrackers at Chembur’s RCF Ground ahead of Diwali. Of these, crackers of two makes were found to violate the Supreme Court (SC)-recommended noise limit of 125 decibels (dB). Officials as well as members of Awaaz Foundation said an improvement was seen in the manufacturing standards of crackers, as this is the first instance where a majority of those tested complied with SC norms.However, despite this, MPCB officials have urged citizens to stay away from firecrackers during the upcoming festivities. “Even if the noise levels are complying with what SC has said, the order is quite dated and the scenario in which we test the crackers is very different from how people use them. Compliant noise levels are no indication of how much air pollution they will cause,” said a regional officer with the MPCB, who was present for the exercise.A total of 14 ‘green crackers’ – bearing the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) stamp of approval – and 16 non-green crackers were tested on Thursday. Of these, one variety of non-green cracker was found to have a noise level of 130 dB, which is more than permissible limit. A non-green cracker brand was also found to be in violation of SC norms as it touched 127dB. “The remaining ones were within 100 to 125 dB, which is compliant with SC rules,” said Dr VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB.Motghare also added that MPCB has taken samples of each variety of firecracker for a chemical analysis. “We will send them to an accredited laboratory so that we can see what ingredients are there and in how much quantity. This will give us some sense on whether the manufacturing standards have improved to make these crackers less polluting,” he said.Sumaira Abdulali, director of Awaaz Foundation, expressed concerns over the chemical composition in these firecrackers. “While the green crackers used in the exercise have declared ingredients on their covers, they do not say in what quantities. Besides, they still contain extremely toxic substances such as barium nitrate and potassium nitrate, which are extremely toxic. We need better regulations that force manufacturers to be more transparent about what is going into these fireworks,” she said.MPCB will be carrying out noise monitoring exercises in 128 locations across the state this festival season on November 4 and 6. Officials also said that they will begin carrying out air pollution monitoring using mobile air quality monitors between October 28 and November 18th, as per SC guidelines, and their reports will be submitted directly to the Apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-of-30-firecrackers-found-violating-noise-limit-mpcb-test-for-diwali-in-mumbai-101634837789717.html

The plaque bore the writing ‘Gurjar Samrat Mihir Bhoj’before it was defaced.Ravindra Bhati, national vice-president of Akhil Bhartiya Gurjar Parishad, said members of the Gurjar community installed the plaque at Lane Number 7 in Noida’s Sector 66 on October 11. “The locals found the board smeared with black paint on Thursday. The act has hurt the sentiments of the Gurjar community. Anti-social elements have done this to spread communal hatred,” he said.Bhati said that he has filed a complaint at Phase 3 police station and demanded action. “We have also called a maha panchayat at Mihir Bhoj Degree College in Dadri on October 31 to discuss the issue,” he said, adding that members of the Gurjar community will launch a campaign demanding actionif the suspects are not arrested.Some people also shared photos of the defaced board on social media, following which police launched an investigation. Virendra Singh, senior sub-inspector at Phase 3 police station, said a case has been registered against unknown persons under Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation, with intent to cause riot) of the Indian Penal Code. “The plaque has been restored to its original form. We have launched a search to arrest suspects involved in the case,” he said.Tensions have been brewing in Dadri since last month after chief minister Yogi Adityanath, on September 22, unveiled Mihir Bhoj’s statue at a college in Dadri, and some people allegedly removed the word ‘Gurjar’ from the plaque. The Gurjar community has been protesting against the removal of their caste’s name from the plaque installed below the statue. The community leaders maintain that the king belonged to the Gurjar community. The Rajput community has also claimed that the ninth-century king belonged to their caste. “They are distorting history without any basis. We cannot let it happen. We have called a panchayat on this issue to fight for justice,” said Prithivi Singh, national secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha.On September 28, some people smeared black paint over Adityanath’s name and that of other BJP leaders on the plaque as a mark of protest. Ramchandra Verma, secretary of Gurjar Vidya Sabha, a trust which manages the Dadri college, filed a complaint against unknown persons after the incident and 150 people were booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/black-paint-smeared-on-king-mihir-bhoj-s-plaque-in-noida-case-registered-101634837549555.html
21-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Man booked for killing 28-year-old interior designer, on the run||Police have booked a man for allegedly robbing and killing a 28-year-old interior designer in Paramount Golf Foreste Villas in Greater Noida’s Sector Zeta 1 on Wednesday evening, officials said on Thursday.The victim -- identified as Pinky Chauhan -- lived with her father Kalu Ram Chauhan, 55, mother Maya Devi, 52, and brother Vishal Chauhan, 25, in the Greater Noida house where the crime took place.The suspect -- Arjun (whose sister was married to the victim’s cousin last year), 30 -- allegedly slit the throat of Pinky, inflicted multiple wounds on her body, and escaped with her cellphone, ₹4 lakh cash and gold jewellery. Police have detained Arjun’s father (details not shared) in the case.According to Pappu Namberdar, Pinky’s maternal uncle, the victim’s father is in the transport business in Noida; and originally from Noida’s Chhalera village, the Chauhans had shifted to their new home in Greater Noida last year.On Wednesday afternoon, Pinky’s parents had gone out shopping, and her brother was in his office. “The family had planned a pooja and a havan on Thursday. When Pinky’s parents returned home around 9pm, the main door of the house was locked from inside and they knocked on the door several times but did not get any response from Pinky,” Namberdar said, adding that the victim’s parents thought that she was sleeping.“Her parents used another set of keys they were carrying to unlock the door, and on entering the house, found Pinky’s lying in a pool of blood, with multiple wounds on her neck and body. They immediately informed the police,” he said.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that a police team is investigating the matter. “We scanned CCTV footage from nearby areas and saw the suspect -- Arjun -- entering Pinky’s house that day. Since the door had an automatic lock, it got locked from inside after the suspect left... We conducted a search and recovered the victim’s cellphone and jewellery from Arjun’s house, and detained his father. His scooter, used in the crime, has also been recovered from his house. Prima facie, it appears that he committed the crime,” Chander said.According to the police, it seems that Arjun and Pinky were known to each other.A case has been registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder) at the Surajpur police station on Thursday.One of Pinky’s cousins, Gajendra Singh Chauhan, said that the family was not aware of Arjun and Pinky’s friendship. “Pinky has three uncles and one of her cousins got married to Arjun’s sister last year. They may have been acquaintances, but we are not aware of their friendship,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-man-booked-for-killing-28-year-old-interior-designer-on-the-run-101634837489394.html
21-10-2021||Pune||Covid: Pune reopening with caution ahead of Diwali||PUNE: Punekars are a happy lot now that everything is reopening ahead of Diwali but they must continue to take necessary precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing among other safety measures. While multiplexes and auditoriums are scheduled to reopen from Friday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has already allowed restaurants and shops to remain open till 11pm ahead of the festival of lights.So much so that since the last few days, a heavy rush can be seen at major markets across the city such as Laxmi road, Raviwar peth, Bohara Aali market, Appa Balwant chowk and Tulshibaug market. With shops open through the evening till 11’o’clock in the night, people are flocking to these marketplaces after finishing their day jobs and household chores.Nitesh Chopada, secretary, Laxmi Road Ganpati Chowk Traders’ Association, said, “We are happy that slowly and with safety measures in place, the restrictions have been eased in Pune city. Giving a boost to the economy is also important and this is a crucial period for shop-owners and traders with Diwali just round the corner. Everyone is keen on recovering the losses of the last six to eight months.”Restaurants too are seeing more footfalls as they’ve been allowed to remain open for a longer duration. Bhushan Mane, owner of a restaurant on Sinhagad road, said, “This year, we have faced huge losses due to the lockdown and it is only now that things are opening up somewhat. It is good that the timings have been extended but it is time we return to the way things were before Covid.”About Pune city reopening, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “The restrictions are being eased as per the state government guidelines and people should understand their importance. Though public places are now open, Covid safety protocol such as wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing among other measures needs to be maintained. Each person must look at fighting Covid as his/her responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-pune-reopening-with-caution-ahead-of-diwali-101634837430811.html

The development came during a meeting which was held in Lucknow, and was attended by the officials of Noida and Uttar Pradesh governments.“The finance department in Lucknow will review the project, and we will then start tendering the process to rope in an agency for the development of the project. Hopefully, the process will be completed within a month,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer (CEO) of Noida authority.After the finance department reviews the bid document and the detailed project report of the heliport project, the Uttar Pradesh government will give a nod to the Noida authority to float a tender for the same. The city authority has decided to develop this aviation hub comprising a heliport on the public-private-partnership (PPP) model.“Since it is a PPP project, the finance department needs to review the project and then clear it,” Maheshwari added.After the tender is issued, the Noida authority will select one developer who will apply for the development of the project. The process of finalising the developer may take two to three months, provided at least three developers apply for the project during the tendering.The heliport project will have one helipad and four aprons which will be large enough to park 10 helicopters at a time. One hangar and one terminal building will be established, and the car parking will have a space to house at least 50 four wheelers.The agency interested in establishing the heliport will have to invest ₹43 crore according to the estimates provided by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES). The project cost includes passenger terminal building, air traffic control tower, hangar, earthwork, pavement work, cost of equipment and other supporting services, said the officials.Popular among VIPs, corporate houses, senior executives, foreign delegates and those dealing with medical emergencies, the catchment area will be broadened to connect the popular tourist towns within a 400-km distance, they added.The Noida authority hopes that this project will attract private players because of Jewar airport in Noida and Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi; and several other big-ticket projects such as Film City, multi-modal logistics hub and international transport hub in Greater Noida are also scheduled to come up in Gautam Budh Nagar soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-may-approve-city-s-heliport-project-in-a-month-says-noida-authority-ceo-101634837429252.html
21-10-2021||Other||Farmers dismantle structure at UP Gate, say stir against agri laws to continue||Farmers protesting near the UP Gate underpass on the Ghaziabad Delhi border dismantled a temporary structure on Thursday after the Supreme Court remarked during the day that farmers had the right to protest but roads cannot be blocked indefinitely. Farmer leaders clarified that dismantling the temporary structure did not mean they have withdrawn from the protest site and reiterated that their agitation against the three farm laws will continue. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader and spokesperson from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha at the UP Gate protest site said, “We have dismantled the old tent near the UP Gate underpass to show that it is the barricades, which have been put in place by the police, that is blocking the highway. We were going to Delhi, but police put up barricades. So, we just camped there. After the tents were dismantled, there were rumours that the farmers are withdrawing from the protest site but that is not the case.” The tent referred to is one of the oldest temporary structure that was erected ever since farmers arrived at the UP Gate last November to press their demand for the rollback of the three farm laws. The structure was used as a centre to address the media and for holding farmer meetings. Farmers have also put up tents and dias on the Ghaziabad Delhi carriageway since last December, besides occupying the UP Gate underpass. “As regards the dais and tents on the carriageway, there is still enough space for commuters. There is no hindrance from our side. We will continue with our demand for a new law on the minimum support price and the rollback of the three farm laws,” said Bajwa. Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union also denied that farmers have blocked the highway. “It is not the farmers who have blocked the highway but the police, which has blocked the highway with barricades. We will go to the Parliament in Delhi.. We will sit in front of the house where the laws were made...” Tikait told reporters at UP-Gate.Following the dismantling of the temporary structure, there were speculations that the farmers were leaving the UP-Gate site. The Bharatiya Kisan Union tweeted that it is a rumour that the Ghazipur border (UP-Gate) is being vacated and it is totally baseless. “We are trying to show that it is the Delhi police which have blocked the road and not the farmers,” said the tweet. On Thursday, the Supreme Court said farmers had the right to protest, but roads cannot be blocked indefinitely.The court was hearing a petition filed by a Noida resident, urging that the protesters be removed from the roads of the National Capital Region as the agitation led to delays in daily commute.The court also granted three weeks’ time to the farmer unions to file their response and listed the next date of hearing on December 7.“Ultimately some solution has to be found. We are not averse to their right to protest even when a legal challenge is pending, but roads cannot be blocked,” the court said.Farmers have been camping along the borders of Delhi for about a year and the UP Gate was one of the important protest site. The site was heavily barricaded by the police after large scale violence broke out during the tractor parade taken out by the farmers from different borders to Delhi on the occasion of Republic Day this year. Many farmers’ leaders, including Tikait, were booked by the Delhi police and named in FIRs but the farmers maintained that it was “outsiders” who resorted to violence, not them.A response from the Delhi police in connection with Thursday’s development is awaited.“Ghaziabad police have not put up any barricades on the highway. As regards the dismantling of structure, the farmers have already tweeted about that,” said Abhay Kumar Mishra, circle officer of Indirapuram in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-dismantle-structure-at-up-gate-say-stir-against-agri-laws-to-continue-101634837369495.html
21-10-2021||Noida||G Noida: Man who shot self after killing woman who refused sexual advances dies||A 25-year-old man who had allegedly killed a 23-year-old woman after she refused his advances, and then shot himself on a busy road in Greater Noida’s Dadri on Tuesday, died in a hospital in Delhi on Wednesday night, police said on Thursday.The suspect -- identified as Bunty -- lived in Gautampuri colony, and the woman lived with her family in Railway Road colony -- both localities in Dadri.The woman’s father, a complainant in the case, said that the victim and her younger sister on Tuesday had gone to buy some medicines from a nearby market. “When they were returning home, Bunty reached there on a motorcycle and intercepted them. He then got into an argument with my elder daughter over some issue. He suddenly took out a pistol and shot her dead. He then fired another shot and injured himself,” he said.The complainant said his younger daughter raised an alarm and locals came to their rescue. A police team also reached the spot and took the injured victim and the suspect to a nearby hospital, where the woman was declared dead.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, had earlier said that the suspect and the victim were known to each other for some years. “They lived in the same colony till recently, and later they shifted to other places.”Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer (SHO), Dadri police station, said, “Bunty was later admitted to the district hospital in Noida, and then referred to a hospital in Delhi, where he died on Wednesday night.”“Primary investigation shows the woman had rejected his advances which led to the incident,” Tripathi had earlier said.A case was registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder) at the Dadri police station on Tuesday. “Since the victim and the suspect have died, the case will now be closed,” said Tripathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/g-noida-man-who-shot-self-after-killing-woman-who-refused-sexual-advances-dies-101634837251363.html

Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Lakhimpur Dr Arun Kumar Singh said, “15 other occupants of the boat were rescued.” Rescue teams and villagers rushed to the spot and rescued 15 people, however, an elderly woman dead, and two are missing. Meanwhile, the eight persons reported missing in the Taliaghat boat mishap on Wednesday evening could not be traced on Thursday. “On Thursday, a boat carrying 18 persons was crossing the Chauka River on their way to Nauvapurwa when it overturned,” SDM Singh said. According to official reports, two persons have been killed so far in boat-related accidents, one Sundar Lal (65) in Dhaurahra tehsil and an elderly woman in Lakhimpur tehsil. Kheri district magistrate Dr Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya said that three NDRF teams, one SDRF team, and two flood PAC teams with steamers and other rescue equipment have been deployed to locate and rescue the flood-hit people. DM said that the rescue teams have so far rescued 1222 people and taken them to safer places. DM said that a massive discharge of 5,33,000 cusec of water into Sharda River from the Banbasa barrage was the cause of the flood fury in several tehsils of the district. Also, the unprecedented heavy rains in October have worsened the situation. Kheri DM assured that the administration was engaged on war footing to rescue and provide relief, and hopefully, the situation would be normal soon. Meanwhile, with no fresh heavy discharge into Sharda and Ghaghra, the water level is reported to be receding. However, the river has left behind a trail of destruction. The Sharda eroded the Mailani-Bahraich railway track between Bhira-Pallia, following which north-east railways have suspended the train movement till Oct 31 on this route. In Pallia, Nighasan and Dhaurahra tehsil, several villages have been left marooned in floodwaters. Besides paddy crops being damaged by the floodwater, the villagers are also facing cattle fodder scarcity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lakhimpur-boat-mishap-leaves-one-dead-two-missing-101634837071053.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||Appoint SIT to probe allegations against Anil Deshmukh, monitor probe, state tells HC||The state government on Thursday urged the Bombay high court (HC) to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) headed by a former judge to probe the allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and into the report of IPS officer Rashmi Shukla on political interference in transfer and posting of police personnel and monitor the probe.The state government argued that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director Subodh Jaiswal was part of the Maharashtra Police force till last year and therefore an impartial and unbiased probe could not be expected, hence, an SIT should be constituted for an independent probe.The state government has filed a petition after CBI started issuing summons to chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey for inquiry in connection with the case. The state submitted that both Kunte and Pandey were top officers and could not be expected to depose against themselves.The division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal was also informed by senior counsel Darius Khambata, who represented the state government, that the investigation by the CBI in the April 21 first information report (FIR) could not be impartial due to various reasons.Referring to the summons being issued by CBI to Kunte and Pandey, Khambata said that it was surprising that the two were being called for questioning when they were not even part of the Police Establishment Board (PEB) while Singh and Jaiswal who was part of the PEB at the relevant time was not issued any summons.Khambata then referred to the scope and intent of the preliminary probe ordered by the HC on April 5 and submitted that the HC had clearly stated that for the probe to be impartial it should be done by a third party and hence directed the CBI to do so. Khambata then added that the CBI could not have done an impartial probe as the director was part of the Maharashtra police force and as he could also become part of the probe, there was no chance of him being questioned by his juniors. “Inherently and functionally there will be a bias if the head of an organisation is investigating a subject matter of probe,” said Khambata.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta opposed the petition and accused the state of trying to scuttle and delay the investigation though three previous attempts failed. “The state government has no role to play in the investigations but it is only trying to help the accused,” said Mehta, seeking a week to file a reply to the petition.Mehta added that if Pandey felt that he was a potential accused and could be affected by the probe he should file a separate petition rather than tagging himself with the petition filed by the state.However, senior advocate Navroz Seerwai for Pandey objected to the suggestion and said that Pandey and Jaiswal had a history of falling out, hence wanted to have a say in the petition filed by the state, against the CBI.The bench then permitted the CBI to file a reply within a week and posted the petition for hearing of the petition to Thursday, October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/appoint-sit-to-probe-allegations-against-anil-deshmukh-monitor-probe-state-tells-hc-101634837069276.html

21-10-2021||Noida||GB Nagar agri dept speeds up bio-decomposer distribution to curb stubble burning||The agriculture department in Gautam Budh Nagar has sped up distribution of bottles of bio-decomposers among the farmers to minimise stubble burning and curb air pollution in the district, officials said on Thursday.Officials said they have distributed 3,510 vials of bio-decomposers which can be mixed with water and spread over the stubble to decompose it.“We are planning to distribute more vials of bio-decomposers to suppress the stubble burning in the district. We are holding meetings with the farmers in different villages to encourage them to use these decomposers. Each vial of decomposer can be mixed with 200 litres of water to form a solution, which can then be sprayed over stubble covering at least one acre land. The solution turns stubble into manure within three to four weeks,” said Vinod Bhargav, deputy director (acting), agriculture department in Gautam Budh Nagar.Bhargav also said that farmers often burn stubble to meet up for a small window post-harvest, where they have to catch up for the winter crops. “Three major crops are cultivated after paddy. Of those three, mustard and potato are cut a little early, and wheat in November. Harvesting starts a little earlier in Gautam Budh Nagar because basmati rice is planted here. Due to this, most of the farmers get some time to use the decomposers,” Bhargav added.However, many farmers think otherwise and complain that often they do not get enough time to meet the “small window” between winter and summer crops as the decomposition process is slow.“Decomposers take almost one month to turn the stubble into manure. This is a very slow process, and everyone doesn’t always harvest early and cultivate late. Paddy is often harvested till late October and wheat cultivation begins around the first week of November,” said Umesh Kumar, a farmer based in Dadri.Meanwhile, the district agriculture department has imposed fine on seven farmers so far, for burning stubble in Jewar and Dadri.“Two incidents of stubble burning in Jewar and two in Dadri have been reported so far. A fine of ₹27,500 was imposed and a complaint was filed against the seven farmers,” Bhargav said.The agriculture department in Uttar Pradesh -- which is responsible for checking stubble burning across the state, and act against the violating farmers, said that a penalty of ₹2,500 is imposed against stubble burning in a farm up to two acres, ₹5,000 for four acres, and ₹15,000 for more than four acres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-agri-dept-speeds-up-bio-decomposer-distribution-to-curb-stubble-burning-101634836949378.html
21-10-2021||Other||Women must take up leadership roles, never imagined entering politics: Harsimrat||Ludhiana Calling for more women to take up leadership roles, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Bathinda MP and former Union cabinet minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal pitched strongly for the fairer sex to take up decision-making roles as well during her visit to Ludhiana on Thursday. “We ought to have more women in leadership roles where they make policy decisions. The attitude of society towards women has not changed, despite that, women have done so well taking every hurdle as a challenge,” she said, at one of the five all-women programmes she attended. First, she interacted with middle-class women from Sukhmani Sahab Sewa Society, and then met doctors, businesswomen and entrepreneurs. A mock Parliament session had her as the chief guest next, followed by attendance at a Karwa Chauth fair organised by Laxmi Ladies Club. She also met around 100 businesswomen at a FICCIFLO (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Ladies Organisation) event. In a candid mood, Harsimrat spoke her heart out and recounted how she never imagined she could become a politician until 2009 Lok Sabha Polls. “I was doing Sewa at a gurdwara when news was dropped on to me by villagers that the party has announced me as its candidate for 2009 Lok Sabha polls from Bathinda. I never thought I will come this far. It has been a challenging, yet fruitful journey,” she said, giving all credit to her family for her achievements. Having been brought up in the liberal environs of Delhi, going to Loreto Convent School and then studying textile design at South Delhi Polytechnic for Women, she said before her marriage to Sukhbir Singh Badal in 1991, the understanding was that he would not enter politics. “Within two years, he did enter politics and I wanted to stop him. Look where we both are now and it has been a beautiful journey,” she said. ‘SAFETY, PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY A CHALLENGE’Safety of women, almost negligible representation of women in industry and politics, and patriarchal society were issues that businesswomen flagged as concerns. The women added that there were no women-centric schemes. Harsimrat assured them that if voted to power, she will assure women get adequate representation and rights. She added that she herself is a classic example of men never understanding women and their power.“In 2009, I went to villages in the state and was aghast to find that there were no toilets in many of these. Until a woman comes into decision-making and policy making, the struggle will continue,” she said.

21-10-2021||Noida||Entry of heavy vehicles barred in Kaushambi township, state buses exempted||Now, heavy vehicles will not be allowed to ply in Kaushambi, barring the buses of the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC), as part of the comprehensive traffic management plan that has been chalked out for the township, keeping in line with the Supreme Court directives. In connection with the traffic plan, officials of the state transport utility have placed a request for 200 CNG buses with the headquarters. Kaushambi Apartment Residents’ Welfare Association (Karwa)--the apex body of Kaushambi RWAs--filed several petitions before the National Green Tribunal since 2015 and finally moved the Supreme Court in October 2020 for the resolution of several pollution-related issues affecting the township. The high rises in Kaushambi shelter about 20,000 residents. The township is just adjacent to Delhi’s Anand Vihar border. The ISBTs of Anand Vihar and Kaushambi are just opposite to the township; the Sahibabad Site IV Industrial area is also in the vicinity. The apex court, in its order on March 24, directed officials of both Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to take up a “unified approach” to solve pollution related issues. “Height barriers have been put up at two locations, which now bar entry of heavy vehicles on the Link Road leading from Dabur crossing to Maharajpur border (Kaushambi-Anand Vihar). We are also broadening one of our ISBT entry/exit gates, which hinders the traffic coming from Delhi. All this will help ease the traffic condition in the area,” said A K Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC. One of the height barriers has been put up at Dabur crossing while the other has been put up at the Saur Urja Marg behind the ISBT Kaushambi. “With the height barriers in place, no heavy vehicle will be able to ply from Dabur crossing. There are height barriers near the EDM Mall (another Ghaziabad-Delhi border area) and also near the ISBT Kaushambi, where vehicles from Delhi enter Ghaziabad. These height barriers will ensure Kaushambi remains out of bounds for heavy vehicles,” said V K Mittal, president of Karwa. “If heavy vehicles have to enter Ghaziabad, they can enter from UP Gate or Apsara Border (near Seemapuri). The different agencies are taking measures for construction of U-turns and even multi-level parking, which will help resolve pollution-related issues further,” said Mittal. With the height barriers in place, the state buses coming to Kaushambi are using the Saur Urja Marg for entering the ISBT Kaushambi from the rear gate. The Saur Urja Marg runs through the Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area, but several residential localities-- Kadkad Model, Jhandapur and Maharajpur--are situated adjacent to the road. “The traffic plan for Kaushambi has paved the way for movement of buses through our localities, posing a risk to residents. We will move the court with regard to this matter,” said Sushil Raghav, an environmentalist and a resident of Kadkad Model. The traffic management plan for Kaushambi details different measures, which are expected to free the township of pollution-related issues. One of the points highlighted in the plan is operation of CNG buses instead of diesel buses. Currently, the UPSRTC operates about 550 buses to different destinations from ISBT Kaushambi and another 50 buses from ISBT Anand Vihar across the border. “Of these 600 odd buses, we have about 125 buses which run on CNG. Since it is not advisable to convert diesel buses to CNG, we have placed a demand with our headquarters for 200 new CNG buses. Since it is a policy decision, it requires intervention from the state government,” said Singh. Officials familiar with the development said that funding would be a major issue in procuring the new CNG buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/entry-of-heavy-vehicles-barred-in-kaushambi-township-state-buses-exempted-101634836889407.html

The state has administered 93,978,623 doses till date, according to the data on Co-Win portal. On Thursday, the state administered 516,519 doses. Maharashtra’s public health minister Rajesh Tope said that covering the rest of the targeted population will be a challenge as they require counselling sessions to convince them for vaccination. To facilitated speedy vaccination, the state government is starting a drive to cover all college students in the age group of 18-25 by organising sessions on college campuses. The drive will be undertaken for 10 days, from October 25 to November 3.“We are proud to be a major contributor in the achievement of one-billion mark. We are lagging behind UP in overall inoculation because the northern state was provided with more doses on the basis of their population,’ the minister said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra recorded 1,573 fresh infections, pushing the count to 6,598,218 on Thursday. The tally of active cases further reduced to 24,292 as 2,968 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.It also saw 39 casualties and the total number of fatalities stood at 139,925. Pune reported the highest deaths of 12 people. Of them, five in the city and seven in the rural parts of the district.The gradual drop in the daily caseload over the past five months has enabled the state to relax Covid-19 pandemic curbs. Cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes are set to reopen in Maharashtra after six months with 50% capacity from Friday. From October 4, schools in urban areas were reopened for Class 8 to 12 and rural areas for classes 5 to 7. All religious places reopened on October 7. The state has also extended timings of all restaurants and eateries till 12am midnight and other establishments till 11 pm in the backdrop of the upcoming Diwali festival.However, there is a word of caution by the authorities, warning of a potential spike in cases after Diwali due to relaxations and festivals. “We have removed most of the curbs and now Diwali is approaching. People are coming out freely, meetings and gatherings are happening, they are also visiting religious places. In this backdrop to keep the spread under control, vaccination is the only solution,” the health minister said.He also informed that they have not found any new variant in the state as of now. “We have been sending positive samples for genome sequencing for detection of any new variant if any but no new variant has found as of now, which is a big sigh of relief for all of us. If we follow all the Covid protocols and speed up vaccination, then we will be in a situation where we can live with the virus,” he added.To cover over three million college students, the state is set to launch a drive named ‘Mission Yuva Swasth’. Under this drive, it has planned to organise vaccination sessions at most of the college campuses and cover all the students who are not vaccinated or partially vaccinated and are eligible for the second dose. The state health department has sought a list of colleges and educational institutions including private universities, autonomous institutes and medical colleges with vaccination details of the students and where vaccination sessions can be organized.Tope said that the department has assured them to provide the list in the next two-three days, based on which the entire drive will be planned and executed. “There are around 5,000 institutions, covering over 3.2 million to 3.3 million students, which come under higher and technical education department, that we are looking to cover till November 3,” he said.Mumbai reported 427 cases on Thursday, taking the tally to 753,233 It also recorded five fatalities taking the toll to 16,197.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 123,700 samples and had a positivity rate of 1.27%.

21-10-2021||Pune||Balbharati-Paud link road: Members of expert committee allege PMC has violated HC directives||PUNE The members of the expert committee constituted by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on the proposed Balbharati-Paud link road have alleged that the civic body has violated directives of the high court (HC) by deciding to go ahead with the project. PMC had in 2019 appointed experts to carry out an environmental impact and traffic-related study. The road, originally proposed 34 years ago by the PMC, has been marked in the development plan and the standing committee has given its nod for the same. However, after opposition from environmentalists, the Bombay High Court had directed, the PMC to carry out scientific traffic study and environmental impact study for the Balbharati-Paud link road project. The PMC appointed two consultants for carrying out the respective studies and preparing a report for the proposed Balbharati road to identify and evaluate the need, utility, benefits and impacts of the road with cost-benefit analysis. The consultants carried out the studies and submitted the reports to the PMC in which they have recommended that the proposed road is needed and should be built. Prashant Inamdar, along with Major Gen Sudhir Jatar (Retd), were the two external members of the expert committee for the project. Both members objected to the PMC’s move and wrote a letter to Pune municipal commissioner as well as the state government. Inamdar said, “Decision to implement the Balbharati-Paud link road project by bypassing the expert committee members’ views is the violation of Bombay High Court’s direction. I and Maj Gen (retd) SCN Jatar were the independent members on the committee which was appointed by the PMC. We had given our comments but have not received a reply. Even the PMC officials did not comment.” The 2.1-kilometre road will be built between Kelewadi junction on Paud road till Balbharati office on Senapati Bapat road. While the earlier budget for the road, which will require flattening of the hill, was ₹24 crore in 2002, the PMC officials said, the cost needs to be revised now heavily. “This road means a permanent devastating impact of the Balbharti road project on hill. This road would be useful only for a small portion of the Law College road traffic and a major portion of existing traffic on Law College road would continue to use Law College road even if the new road gets constructed,” he said. Meanwhile, the PMC has already initiated the process for appointing a project management consultant for the project for pre-tender and post-tender activities. The consultant has submitted his report and asked the PMC to go ahead. The road project, first proposed in 1987, met with opposition from environmental activists who expressed a threat to the hills. Maj Gen Jatar (redt), had previously filed the public interest litigation (PIL), which the high court, later dismissed. While disposing of our public interest litigation, the high court asked PMC to conduct an environmental impact and a traffic-related study. Commuters travelling from Senapati Bapat road towards Paud road have to pass through Law college road, which often witnesses traffic chaos during peak hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/balbharatipaud-link-road-members-of-expert-committee-allege-pmc-has-violated-hc-directives-101634835629126.html

21-10-2021||Mumbai||Illegal phone tapping case: Do you intend to arraign Rashmi Shukla as accused, HC asks Mumbai Police||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked Mumbai Police to clarify whether it intends to arraign senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla and former commissioner of the state intelligence department (SID) as accused in the illegal phone tapping case registered by it, and also submit a report on the progress of the probe. Meanwhile, the state has not extended its statement of no coercive action including arrest against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, which it had made in May.A division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing Shukla’s petition which sought quashing of the first information report (FIR) lodged against her by the cyber cell of the Mumbai Police in March under the Official Secrets Act, 1923, was informed by senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani that the FIR was based on a complaint by the SID against unidentified persons for allegedly tapping phones and leaking confidential documents. Jethmalani submitted that while the FIR did not name Shukla as an accused, the state government was using it as a means of pressurising her.While referring to the affidavit filed by the state government in response to the petition, Jethmalani stressed that though the government reiterated that Shukla was not an accused in the case, they were acting arbitrarily and with a vendetta against her. Jethmalani further submitted that the FIR was an attempt by the state to derail the investigation in the Anil Deshmukh case and avoid judicial and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or Enforcement Directorate (ED) scrutiny of the documents that had been submitted by Shukla to her superior.The alleged tapping of phones had taken place when Shukla was heading the SID which came in for sharp criticism by the current ruling coalition wherein they have alleged that Shukla had tapped phones without proper permissions from the relevant authorities.Jethmalani submitted that Shukla had maintained secrecy and only did her duty as per the mandate given to her. While seeking quashing of the FIR, Jethmalani suggested that as the CBI was already investigating the corruption case it should be allowed to investigate the alleged phone tapping case as well and sought transfer of the probe from Mumbai Police to the central agency.However, senior advocate Darius Khambata appearing for the state government said that Shukla was not named in the FIR and as the Mumbai Police probe was only pertaining to data leak and not whether the phone tapping was authorised or not, hence the petition should be dismissed.After hearing the arguments, the bench sought to know from Mumbai Police whether it intended to arraign Shukla as an accused as it was not inclined to waste judicial time in hearing the petition. The bench then granted liberty to Shukla to approach the court if she was named as an accused, to which the state government assured that it would not take any coercive action against Shukla till the next hearing on Monday, October 25.Meanwhile, the state government did not continue its May 24 assurance that no coercive action, including arrest, would be taken against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh who is seeking quashing of an FIR lodged against him by Thane Police under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/illegal-phone-tapping-case-do-you-intend-to-arraign-rashmi-shukla-as-accused-hc-asks-mumbai-police-101634833588867.html

For the past 18 months, as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the world, the holiest Sikh shrine had also seen a record dip in footfall. Golden Temple authorities claim a footfall of 1.5 lakh was seen on Thursday. Before the pandemic, 1 lakh devotees visited the holiest shrine shrine on weekdays, and 1.5 lakh on weekends and special occasions.With the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) making elaborate arrangements to mark the occasion, serpentine queues of devotees seeking darshan of sanctum sanctorum were seen. “We are seeing this great rush of devotees after a long time. As per our assessment, around 1.5 lakh devotees paid obeisance at the Sri Darbar Sahib and participated in the grand Nagar kirtan (religious procession) around the walled city with the old zeal and enthusiasm. The footfall will only increase on Friday and the weekend,” said Gurinder Singh, chief manager of Golden Temple, adding the flower decoration and lighting remained major draws that pulled in visitors. Before the pandemic struck, the average collection of offerings was around ₹23 lakh a day. Due to the lockdown in the first wave, the collection dipped to between ₹10,000 and ₹15,000 a day. However, the footfall did not see such a major dip during the second wave.The Nagar Kirtan began with ardas (prayers) from the Akal Takht amid the resonance of ‘Nagaras’, slogans of Sat Sri Akal and Narsinghas (a traditional trumpet). Punjab Police presented a guard of honour to the Sri Guru Granth Sahib at the plaza outside Sri Darbar Sahib. Flowers were also showered by an aircraft during the Nagar Kirtan. The sangat paid homage by serving langar, with the procession proceeding through the road connecting the old gates of Amritsar city, with the sangat receiving it at many places. SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur greeted the sangat of the world and encouraged them to follow the teachings of the guru. “The life of Guru Ramdas Ji is a guide to humanity in all respects and his contribution to Sikh faith is incomparable. The Sangat must take inspiration from the teachings of the fourth Guru and inculcate a sense of humility, service and remembering God,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/guru-ramdas-parkash-purb-golden-temple-sees-largest-footfall-in-18-months-101634833051640.html

The BJP will not mind celebrating these too...but this time people will celebrate in 2022 by bidding farewell to the BJP in Uttar Pradesh,” said Akhilesh in a statement issued by the party. He also said the BJP only knows politics of lies and deceit, and alleged that it had done nothing for the people, who were facing problems due to inflation and corruption.“The BJP is a strange party. Whatever may be the calamity and even in deaths, the BJP is always engrossed in festival-like celebrations. It’s a habit that even in a calamity, it finds the opportunity for celebrations,” Yadav said in a statement issued here.“The BJP celebrated record vaccinations. When people were dying due to the coronavirus, the BJP was celebrating with beating of ‘thalis’ (plates),” he said.The former UP chief minister said the Kushinagar international airport was his government’s plan, “but the BJP itself has started celebrating it by taking credit for it.”Similarly, the Purvanchal Expressway was given by the Samajwadi Party government to the state, but the BJP has no problem in “celebrating” this too, he added. “The truth is that the BJP only knows the politics of lies and deceit. In its entire tenure in Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre, it has not done anything in public interest,” alleged Akhilesh.“This time, people will celebrate in 2022 by bidding farewell to the BJP in UP.

I am happy that Nitish Kumar, the longest serving CM of Bihar since independence, took it forward. Buddha got enlightenment here. Bihar is a land of knowledge and world’s first democracy. There have always been special blessings on me in the land of Buddha, Mahavir and Guru Gobind Singh,” he said.Conveying his greetings to the people in the festive season, he said how Chhath was now being worshipped from Nawada to New Jersey and from Begusarai to Boston. “This is a proof that the industrious people associated with the culture of Bihar have made their place on the world stage,” he said.Referring to the ban on sale and consumption of liquor in Bihar since 2016, the President cited Governor S P Sinha’s address to the Legislative Assembly of 1921, when the latter said there should be a definite policy to prohibit the production and sale of intoxicating substances or liquor.“In our Constitution, the duty of the State to improve public health is clearly mentioned under the ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’. This includes prohibition of consumption of liquor and substances injurious to health. By giving this a status of law, the Bihar assembly has taken a very good step in the interest of public health and society, especially in the favour of women from weaker sections,” Kovind said.He also laid the foundation stone for Shatabdi Smriti Stambh and planted a sapling of Mahabodhi Tree in the premises of Bihar Legislative Assembly on the occasion. “The enthusiastic presence of present as well as former members of Bihar legislature is a good example of the healthy parliamentary tradition developed in our country,” he added.The President also hailed the personalities from Bihar played in the Constituent Assembly — Dr Sachchidananda Sinha, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Shri Krishna Sinha, Maharaja Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga, Shyam Nandan Sahay, Satyanarayan Sinha, Babu Jagjivan Ram, among others.Kovind also lauded the state’s resolves, cited by Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha in his address, to keep Bihar free of social problems. Earlier, Sinha thanked the President for sparing time for the function and narrated the rich legacy of the Bihar Legislature and the way it had evolved over the years. “It has been witness to landmark legislations and scholarly debates. Now it has adapted to the digital era with online questions & answers and webcasting,” the Speaker said.In his speech, CM Kumar said, “We consider the President as our very own and we are happy to find him in our midst. I want that all government employees should attend the Vipassana Centre, and the government will grant 15-day leave to them. I am confident the Speaker will also try to bring the Prime Minister to this centenary function,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-assembly-celebration-kovind-lauds-prohibition-recalls-his-ties-to-state-101634832568895.html

21-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Most cinema halls may not open on Day 1, may wait for Akshay Kumar starrer on Nov 5||Although allowed to reopen from Friday, most cinema hall owners are unlikely to open on day one, amid concerns over feasibility of business owing to crowding restrictions and fear among people. The Maharashtra government on October 13 issued guidelines to reopen cinema halls, theatres and auditoriums from October 22, by allowing them to operate at 50% of their capacity. The guidelines allow access only to people with Covid vaccination certificate or with Aarogya Setu app showing their ‘safe status’. Maharashtra has 532 multiplexes and 470 single-screen theatres. Of the 532, 259 multiplexes and 65 single-screen theatres are in Mumbai. Citing huge losses that the owners suffered during the pandemic while paying electricity charges, salary of employees and property tax, cinema owners’ associations have stated that the recovery could take time. Associations believe that complete reopening of cinemas will be possible when films with big stars are scheduled to be released. “Owners have been facing multiple challenges. They are paying a minimum electricity bill of ₹11,000 per week, salaries and property taxes. We are hopeful that the Maharashtra government will provide some relief. We are expecting cinemas to open completely on November 5 with an Akshay Kumar movie. Nearly 30% of the cinema halls are not likely to open at all due to the losses incurred,” said Nitin Datar, president, Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India. Cinema owners have to adhere to a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP). Associations, however, said sticking to the SOP would be difficult and crowding could be an issue outside the canteen area and near the booking offices. “The SOP will be difficult to follow as no food is allowed inside the cinema halls and people will have to step outside during the interval. This would result in crowding outside the canteen premises. Advance booking is difficult for single-screen theatres and can result in crowding. We should be given police protection,” added Datar. “We are ready to reopen cinema halls. A detailed discussion and a plan to implement coronavirus protocols have been devised by our managing director Arun Nahar. We have received 18 advance bookings for movies and will begin screenings from Friday. In order to ensure proper ventilation, windows in all our halls will be kept open. We will wait and watch,” said Manoj Desai, executive director, G7 Multiplex and Maratha Mandir Cinema. Mumbai also has commercial theatres which hold shows of Marathi plays. Of the 40 theatres, only four are expected to resume from tomorrow. “We are waiting for the Maharashtra government to allow viewers at 100% capacity,” said Mangesh Kadam, spokesperson, Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-most-cinema-halls-may-not-open-on-day-1-may-wait-for-akshay-kumar-starrer-on-nov-5-101634832450247.html
21-10-2021||Ranchi||BSL calls off interview as locals protest recruitment of ‘outsiders’||The management of Bokaro Steel Limited (BSL) cancelled the final interview of shortlisted candidates for the post of attendant-cum-technician trainees after locals staged protest against the recruitment exercise on Thursday. The local youth, under the banner of the Displaced Apprentices Association (VAS), blocked the main gates of BSL headquarter, Human Resource Department (HRD) and SAIL Refractories Unit headquarters, obstructing the exercise to begin. The protesters claimed that majority of the candidates had come from Rajasthan and other states on receiving call for the interview by BSL management, after their selection in written examination.“The locals have given their land for establishing these plants. We have also completed the plant training (Apprentice). For the last few years, we have been demanding jobs from BSL management who had imparted us training on the assurance of jobs. However, despite repeated requests, we are not being provided jobs. We will not allow outsiders to get these jobs,” said Ahmed Hussain of VAS. Agitators scuffled with BSL security guards when they tried to stop the eligible candidates at SRU Headquarter, Sector 4, where the interview was to be held. Senior police officials arrived at the plant and brought the situation under control. Chief of communication, BSL, Manikant Dhan, said the Thursday interview was cancelled due to the protest. “Today’s interview could not be held. The situation is being reviewed for further course of action,” he said. The development comes at a time when demand for giving priority to locals in all kinds of recruitments has been gaining ground across the state, with active support from political class. The Hemant Soren government recently made a law to reserve 75% jobs and monthly salary of up to ₹40,000 even in the private sector for locals. The state government has also tweaked the state employment policy for grade 3 and 4 jobs in the government sector, giving priority to locals. Sources said SAIL-BSL had come out with vacancies of 49 attendant-cum-technician trainees under the special recruitment drive. Over 100 candidates who were selected in the written examination had been called for an interview from October 21 to 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/bsl-calls-off-interview-as-locals-protest-recruitment-of-outsiders-101634832448873.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||The story behind the Rs100 Ambulance story during Covid times in Navi Mumbai||Four years ago, when I had to rush my mother to a hospital, we were fleeced by an ambulance service. I had decided then that the ambulance service sector required reform, even if it meant at the hyperlocal level. The Covid-19 pandemic and my own infection this April was the push I needed to turn this thought into action. Dipping into my savings, I bought an ambulance for ₹16.5 lakh. This was not enough, of course. A wheelchair, oxygen cylinders and PPE kits, among other things had to be purchased. That was an additional expense of around ₹50,000. An experienced ambulance pilot joined a few days later. At the end of June 2021, combining the power of zero experience and maximum enthusiasm, I launched the ‘100 Rupees Ambulance’ service in Navi Mumbai. The premise was simple: charge ₹100 for a one-way trip to the hospital or back. At the time of writing, the service has completed 77 trips in three months, transporting more than 30 patients across Navi Mumbai. The experience so far has been both humbling and rewarding. One patient, who had to undergo a major surgery, was picked up at Ulwe and dropped at a hospital 28km away in Kalwa. He paid just ₹100. In these 77 trips the ‘100rsambulance’ has covered more than 1,800km; an average of around 23km per trip. The city has showered us with blessings, good wishes and priceless memories. I have had the fortune of accompanying patients on many occasions and felt their pain, and when they recovered, joined their celebrations. On most occasions, the families and the patients need only a firm hand holding them through the crisis, someone who was ready to listen and offer help. I am just glad that it was me and my team. One of my fondest memories involves a 22-year-old engineering student who was detected with cancer, and had to travel 14km each way from Ulwe to Sanpada for radiation therapy. His father was offered a discounted deal of ₹7,000 for a return trip by a local ambulance service. In short, he would have had to incur ₹91,000 for the 13-day treatment. Unable to afford this, his father decided to take him in a small cargo vehicle. Just before he did that, he wrote to us. I went to their house with the ambulance and chauffeur and ensured that his son was transported to the radiation facility at Sanpada. Instead of spending ₹91,000, the family paid just ₹2,600 for the 26 trips. I will never forget how the father, with tears in his eyes, held my hands in gratitude – an experience that left me speechless.Several individuals reached out to me extending financial and other support. I have politely refused. Many people ask me how I can afford to pay upward of ₹30,000 a month to run this service. My response? I am blessed with a great family – wife, daughter, mother and sister — who support me, and a job that pays me well. We have also been helping other ambulance services in the city sharing their numbers with patients for calls we cannot attend either due to being booked or due to our inability to provide services across cities. I have two learnings to share from this incredible journey. Don’t keep contemplating. Just do what you believe in and you will see that things fall in place. And the other being, don’t wait for others to help you. Help yourself first and then see how others rush to help you.The ‘100rsambulance’ currently operates only in Navi Mumbai, Monday to Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm.

While identification of five bodies have been established, search for three others is underway,” said the DM, adding that one of the occupants, identified as Rajan Sah, survived the tragedy. “Efforts are on to send the bodies to their native villages. However, we are facing huge challenges owing to inundation in the area,” Garbiyal said. “Family members of some of the deceased have already reached Jutiya village. We are persuading them to cremate the bodies at the place of the incident as there is a risk of decomposition of bodies,” said an official who wished not to be identified. Meanwhile, Bihar’s tourism minister Narayan Prasad has written to Nainital DM, requesting to send the bodies of the deceased at the earliest. The five deceased have been identified as Dhodha Yadav (40), Sandeep Kumar (20), Ajay Kumar (19), Dhamu Mukhiya (35) and Anil Choudhary, all residents of villages in Bairiya block of West Champaran. “A sum of ₹4 lakh will be given to the next of kin of each of the deceased as compensation,” said the Nainital DM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-more-from-bihar-dead-in-nainital-landslide-101634832028731.html

The incident occurred at Ishapur locality, barely 200 metres from Phulwarisharif police station of Patna town. Footage obtained by police from a CCTV camera installed in a nearby house shows four to five persons alighting from a vehicle, a Scorpio, around 1.13 am and towing away the ATM at 1.38 am. The accused had destroyed the CCTV cameras inside the ATM, police said, adding that the machine, which worked till 11.17 pm, contained ₹20 lakh in cash. An eyewitness, Mohammad Arif, said the suspects had their faces covered with towels. He alleged that two special auxillary police jawans on a patrol car neither chased them nor opened fire. Ashok Mishra, superintendent of police (Patna West), said the bank administration did not inform the police about the incident even though the ATM security system might have raised an alarm on the bank`s internal network following tampering with the machine. Three suspects were detained for questioning, the SP said. “We have filed a complaint for theft of ₹20 lakh stolen and considerable damage to the ATM,” said Raju Kumar, regional representative of Finance Software System, which runs the kiosk.

21-10-2021||Patna||Few takers for first jab, Bihar may revise vaccination target||Bihar may have to revise its vaccination target when it got the first indication that there were few takers for the first jab during a mega vaccination camp on October 18. Second dose vaccine seekers (7,14,234) were almost double the first (3,61,987), as 10,76,221 shots were administered to beneficiaries at the mega camp on Monday. This was the first time that the trend of vaccination at a mega camp had reversed, with beneficiaries for the second dose far outnumbering the first, when 35% of the state’s target population is yet to take their first jab, said an official of the state health department. It is clearly an indication that either its estimated 73.44 million adult population is inflated, or a sizeable chunk has migrated outside the state. The state health department had initiated a door-to-door survey of households Tuesday to get an exact count of the vaccination target population in Bihar. The government hopes to collate the survey data by next week, he added. Interestingly, only 10% vaccines available in the state were used at Monday’s mega camp, as against an average 70%-80% utilisation at mega vaccination camps earlier. The state had administered the country’s highest 33,39,879 doses on September 17 and 30,40,836 doses on October 2, the officer quoted above said. “The high coverage of second dose as compared to the first, and low utilisation of vaccines at the mega camp are pointers to the fact that there are few takers for the first dose now, despite an estimated 35% adult population being completely unvaccinated,” said the officer. This, the officer said, pointed to two possibilities. “Either our adult target population of 73.44 million, derived by estimating the population based on Census 2011, is exaggerated, or there has been heavy outmigration from Bihar. In either case, we will have to revise our vaccination target. However, we want to be doubly sure before we do that,” the officer quoted above said. State’s nodal officer for vaccination and executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Sanjay Kumar Singh, said the department would wait for the findings of the mega survey, before arriving at any decision. “We are getting a household survey done based on voter list of ongoing panchayat elections in the state, to trace and persuade the eligible adult population take their Covid-19 jab. This will give us a count of the adult people unvaccinated in the state,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, and also the state’s nodal officer for vaccination. “We will leave no stone unturned to reach out to the last unvaccinated adult person to facilitate the jab. We are even sending our vaccinators and vaccination mobilisers to clusters where people are either hesitant or not fully unvaccinated, to convince them to take the shot,” added Singh. The state has no credible data on migration, making it difficult to estimate the exact number of Bihari migrants across India. There are, however, some estimates which show that nearly 50% of Bihari households are affected by migration. As per rough estimates, around 40 lakh migrants returned to Bihar in the midst of the national lockdown last year arising out of the pandemic and are expected to have gone back to work outside the state. Of these, 18 lakh benefitted directly as the state government transferred ₹1,000 as humanitarian relief into the bank account of every migrant who returned to the state or was stranded outside last year, said another officer who did not wished to be named. Bihar had done an audit of its Covid-19 deaths and revised it on June 9, adding 3,951 uncounted deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic in the state in March last year. The cumulative fatalities had then gone up to 9,375. The state’s Covid-19 toll was 9,661 as on Tuesday. India Thursday achieved a milestone, having administered 1 billion vaccination doses to beneficiaries. Bihar had administered 63.87 million doses, as of Thursday (7pm). The state’s second dose vaccination coverage is 15,655,172 as against 48,216,521 first dose achievement, as per the CoWIN portal. The state has set a target to vaccinate most of its target population by December 31. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/few-takers-for-first-jab-bihar-may-revise-vaccination-target-101634831790424.html
21-10-2021||Other||Bihar panchayat polls: Lack of power, infra hit biometric verification||PATNAThe biometric system introduced in the ongoing panchayat polls in Bihar for verification of voters has been hit by lack of power and electricity infrastructure at polling stations, creating obstructions in checking voters’ details electronically, say officials of the State Election Commission (SEC).On Wednesday, when the fourth phase of polls were held, the state poll panel directed district magistrates and other officials concerned to ensure that all polling stations have sockets and charging points fully functional so that polling staff do not face problems in charging their tabs for verifying voters, officials said.The issue, along with law and order incidents, was discussed by state election commissioner Dr Deepak Prasad at a recent review meeting DMs and senior police officers.“There have been complaints by polling officials about tabs getting discharged after six to seven hours on the polling day due to absence of charging points at many polling stations. This is causing problems for running the MIS (management information system). So, all DMs have been directed to coordinate with power department officials and put sockets and ensure power supply at all polling stations,” said a senior SEC official. SEC secretary Mukesh Kumar Sinha said DMs have been instructed to take necessary steps to address the issue. Sources said Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited ( BECIL), a public sector undertaking which is implementing the biometric system of voters’ verification, provides tabs to polling officials based on the number of polling stations in each phase. Like, in the fourth phase, there were 11,318 polling stations for which equal number of tabs were made available, officials said. “Tabs are given fully charged but due to heavy use of data, the battery gets drained and needs recharging,” said another SEC official. Total number of polling stations for the 11-phase panchayat polls is 1,13,891 while the total number polling station buildings is 73,736.‘No victory processions’The SEC has also directed DMs and senior police officers to put a blanket ban on victory processions by candidates after results for the fourth phase, which concluded yesterday, are announced. The directive says all winning candidates will have to give an undertaking that they would not organise any victory rally and in case of any incident, the candidate would be entirely responsible.

21-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai airport’s T1 sees 94,000 passengers in a week; to shift operations of a few IndiGo domestic flights from T2 to T1||A week after Mumbai airport officials were forced to prepone the resumption of flight operations from the city’s Terminal 1 (T1) due to excessive footfalls at Terminal 2 (T2), it saw the movement of 94,716 passengers in seven days.In the first week of operations at T1, 46,187 passengers arrived and 48,529 passengers departed between October 13 and October 20. The terminal, which has four low-cost airlines operating, saw 730 flights being operated during the same week.Mumbai airport’s T1 had resumed operations from March 10, 2021, after remaining shut for nearly a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, owing to the continuous decline in air travel, Covid-19 norms and dip in passenger footfall due to the second wave of the pandemic, CSMIA had reconsolidated all domestic passenger flights operating via terminal 2 (T2). However, due to increased travel demand and footfall of passengers at T2, airport officials re-commenced operations for GoAir, Air Asia, TruJet and Star Air from T1.Moreover, with the steady rise in the number of passengers choosing to travel by air and with the festive season around the corner, IndiGo flights too will start operating out of T1 from October 31. To further smoothen passenger transit, all IndiGo flights with subset series 6E 5200 to 6E 5399 will operate from T1.“The first week of T1 resuming operations saw passenger traffic with 57,382 passengers on weekdays and 37,334 weekends,” said the airport spokesperson.Airport officials said that New Delhi, Goa and Bengaluru destinations contributed to the highest passenger traffic of which 19%, 29% and 20% respectively (from T1) during the week.“CSMIA will be seeing an upward trajectory of IndiGo flights operating out of T1 from October 31st with subset series 6E 5200 to 6E 5399 (as on date), to further smoothen passenger transit,” the spokesperson added.CSMIA, the world’s busiest single crossover runway airport, saw 91,904 travellers transiting through the airport in a single day (October 17), a record since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world.On the same day, over 15,960 passengers travelled through T1 with 7,690 departing passengers and 8,270 passengers arriving. “On this day, CSMIA’s Terminal 1 catered to a total of 114 domestic flights whereas T2 catered to a total of 494 flights of which 415 were domestic and 79 flights on international routes,” CSMIA spokesperson added.The last (pre-Covid) per day passenger record was seen in January 2020 when CSMIA handled a total of 138,999 passengers (domestic as well as international). Mumbai airport handled a total of 2,144,125 passengers and 17,292 flights (domestic and international passengers and flight included) in March 2020 after which the pandemic hit the sector and the country at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-s-t1-sees-94-000-passengers-in-a-week-to-shift-operations-of-a-few-indigo-domestic-flights-from-t2-to-t1-101634831728607.html

Despite the search operation going on every day since Tuesday from morning till evening, their bodies could not be found till evening.According to Mumbra police, the duo has been identified as Sagar Gaikwad (13) and Saksham Ingle (14). The police said that inquiries into the matter were initiated on Tuesday after their parents registered Missing Persons Reports, saying that they had left their residences on Monday but never returned. Both the boys stay in the same locality in Parsik, Mumbra.“We checked CCTV footage in and around their locality and saw them heading towards the Retibunder with two of their friends, Harshal Gade (14) and Shahbaz Sheikh (12). A further analysis of the footage showed that while Harshal and Shahbaz came back home in the evening, the other two did not,” an officer with the Mumbra Police said.The police then made inquiries with Harshal and Shahbaz, and after much coaxing, the two boys opened up and confessed that all four of them had gone for a swim at the Retibunder on Monday afternoon. During this time, Sagar and Saksham got swept away in the waves. Scared of how their parents might react, Harshal and Shahbaz ran back home and chose to keep the incident a secret, officers said.“Based on the information received from Harshal and Shahbaz, we immediately contacted the Thane Municipal Corporation and sought assistance for a search operation at Retibunder. Teams from the Regional Disaster Management Cell as well as the Thane Disaster Response Force were rushed to the spot,” the officer said.However, till late Thursday evening, there was no sign of Sagar and Saksham.Meanwhile, the body of an unidentified male in his 30s washed ashore at the Ganesh immersion point of the Retibunder on Thursday morning and was taken into custody by the Mumbra police.

Suryavanshi has also asked the city engineer to blacklist the contractors failing to do the work on time or doing shoddy work.The toll free number was introduced by the civic body on October 8 following which a total of 296 complaints were raised from different parts of the city by the citizens. As per the civic body, some of the complaints also included roads belonging to the Public Works Department (PWD), Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) region.“There are several repeated complaints of a single road we received through the toll free number. When we sorted out all of them, we could figure out that there are complaints regarding 48 roads in Kalyan-Dombivli. We have informed the respective authority of the road also to take up the work immediately,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.The road near the Shreeram Chowk in Kalyan (E) that falls on the vital Pune Link Road has patches with potholes releasing dust throughout the day.“The condition of this road is the same every year. We have been complaining to the ward officer to repair it but nothing is permanent. Now, since it has stopped raining, dust is released in the air, making it suffocating as well as a distraction for motorists,” said Anand Patil, a 39-year-old motorist who takes the stretch.“We could actually begin the pothole repair work in Kalyan-Dombivli after October 15 since it stopped raining. The civic body chief has asked to focus on repairing all the major roads in the city. In case the contractor fails to do the work or there is shoddy work, he will be blacklisted,” added Koli.Meanwhile, the KDMC chief also asked to call for a meeting with the contractors in the coming days and appeal to them to increase the manpower in order to repair the roads with priority and no delay.The toll free number on which citizens can complain is 1800 233 0045.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kdmc-chief-tells-civic-officials-to-repair-roads-in-kalyan-dombivli-before-diwali-101634830049128.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||Residential colleges in Mumbai in dilemma about reopening without hostel facilities||As attendance remained low on day two of reopening of campuses on Thursday, colleges are hoping for better numbers in the coming week. Institutes with residential facilities feel their students will only show up post Diwali holidays because at present, colleges are not allowed to make hostel facility available for students. “The government has suggested re-opening of campuses in a phased manner, so we are inviting outstation students only post Diwali break. Right now, we can’t open hostels for them at such short notice, it’ll be impossible for students to find alternative accommodation as well,” said TA Shiware, speaking for Wilson College and chairman of Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges. In the second week of October, minister for state higher and technical education Uday Samant announced reopening of colleges in a phased manner only for fully vaccinated students. In a statement made on October 13, Samant suggested that colleges should implement the physical reopening of campuses in a phased manner and should continue online classes for students who are not yet fully vaccinated. “City colleges are reopening as per government orders, but we will also have to reopen hostels. We have set up a committee to look into the possibility of reopening and suggest protocols. This committee will look into this and submit its recommendation based on all government regulations and protocols at the earliest,” said PK Shajahan, dean of academics, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). Some city colleges, too, are chalking out a plan to ensure outstation students are not left without accommodation. “Without the government’s go-ahead, we cannot open hostels to students. For the time being, we are chalking out a plan to ensure that only final-year students are brought back to the campuses first, followed by first- and second-year students,” said the principal of a prominent city college, on condition of anonymity. He added the state government’s decision to reopen colleges at such short notice, despite promising to do so only post Diwali holidays, has upset college staff as well as students. “We will, however, have to follow government guidelines and bring back students in small batches,” he added. Most colleges wore a deserted look on day one of reopening. While undergraduate students are busy with exams, postgraduate students could not attend lectures either because they are not fully vaccinated or because they are currently attending lectures from different cities and states in the country. “Unless the government gives us permission, hostels cannot reopen at present. And without the back-up of hostels, students won’t attend colleges physically,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/residential-colleges-in-mumbai-in-dilemma-about-reopening-without-hostel-facilities-101634829928450.html
21-10-2021||Lucknow||Deepotsav: 500 drones to draw Ramayan era scenes on Ayodhya skyline||For the first time, 500 drones will draw Ramayan era scenes on Ayodhya’s skyline during the Deepotsav celebrations that the Yogi Adityanath government will organise in the pilgrim town in November.The Deepotsav on the Diwali eve on November 3 will be the centre piece of the six-day celebrations starting on November 1 in Ayodhya. Apart from the drones, the other attractions will be 3-D holographic show, 3-D projection mapping and laser show at the majestic Ram Ki Paidi on the banks of the Saryu River. Mukesh Meshram, principal secretary, Tourism, was in Ayodhya on Thursday to review preparations for Deepotsav. The Ayodhya administration has set a target of lighting a minimum of 7.5 lakh diyas (earthen lamps) across Ayodhya. Most of them will be lit at Ram Ki Paidi, the venue of the main event. “Taking into account a margin of error, we have decided to light around 9 lakh diyas so that under any circumstances 7.5 diyas are illuminated,” said an official of the Ayodhya administration. A team from the Guinness Book of World Records will be in Ayodhya to judge the event. Around 12,000 volunteers, mostly students of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University, Ayodhya, have been engaged for making the lighting of the diyas successful. In 2020, the Ayodhya administration had created a new world record by lighting 6,06,569 diyas at Ram Ki Paidi ghat and other ghats of the Saryu. In 2019, the Ayodhya administration had lit 4,10,000 diyas, a record at the time. The Yogi Adityanath government has been celebrating Deepotsav in Ayodhya every year on the eve of Diwali since 2017. This Deepotsav will be the last one before the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/deepotsav-500-drones-to-draw-ramayan-era-scenes-on-ayodhya-skyline-101634829448368.html
21-10-2021||Pune||Pune-based school to face action over fee hike||PUNE After several complaints and allegations of fee hikes and denying online education by the parents, the deputy director of education on Thursday issued a notice to withdraw the registration of Aaryan World School, Warje. In an official letter, Audumbar Ukirde, deputy director of education, said that after several complaints from parents associations regarding various issues, the department has suggested taking further action in the matter. The education department conducted a separate audit of the school to look into the allegations.“Despite the orders of no fee hike, it was found in the investigation that for the academic year 2020-2021, there was a fee hike done by the school. And the Warje branch of Aaryan World School does not have an audit report as of yet and the work on the same is ongoing,” said Ukirde.The notice further added that despite several investigations at the school, the school staff failed to provide all necessary documents needed.“It was also found that for Class 9 and Class 10, the Warje branch of Aaryan World School does not have a Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliation. And so appropriate action should be taken against the school,” said Ukirde.Speaking about the notice, Prashant Khande, National President for All India Parents Students And Teachers Association (AIPSTA) said that audit reports are a must for schools.“After several investigations by the education department and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) education department, it was found that the school does not have audit reports and has hiked the fee last year. There should be concrete action against such schools. Parents are facing a lot of issues because of schools overcharging fees,” said Khande.Sanjay Botre, a parent whose ward is enrolled in the school said that last year the school denied online education to the children.“Even this year, for almost two months, online education was stopped. The school wants to charge all the fees at one time instead of instalments. Many such problems have affected the students who are enrolled here,” said Botre.However, the school management has refuted all allegations made by parents and the education department. Milind Ladge, managing director, Aaryan World School refuted all allegations.“There are some parents with different motives who are behind the commotion. A few parents have not been able to pay the fee. We have submitted all documents related to the CBSE affiliation and we have received the non-objection certificate in 2017-2018 itself. With CBSE we are following up on the matter for some time now. Our legal team will look into this whole matter,” said Ladge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punebased-school-to-face-action-over-fee-hike-101634829148291.html

Further, he also mentioned a few other Congress leaders, such as Nana Patole, who was also previously with the BJP. He also noted that Pargat Singh, presently a cabinet minister, was also with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for four years.Also read | No harm for Congress: Rawat reacts to Captain's new party announcementEarlier on Tuesday, Singh had announced his party and said he is open to a seat sharing agreement with the BJP, if the farmers issue was resolved. Several Congress leaders had criticised the move, however, they also said that it would not impact their party.“And what are you doing with @ShivsenaComms in Maharashtra? Or are you saying @harishrawatcmuk Ji that it’s ok to join forces with so-called communal parties as long as it suits @INCIndia purpose. What’s this if not sheer political opportunism?,” Singh’s media advisor quoted him as saying, on Thursday evening.Further, Singh also dismissed allegations that he was helping the Akali Dal and asked “Is that why you think I’ve been fighting court cases against them for the last 10 years?.” He also said that he had won all elections for the Congress in Punjab since 2017.Also read | BJP says open for alliance with parties that put 'national interest' first, calls Amarinder Singh ‘patriotic’Continuing his tirade, Singh also commented that the Congress party has damaged its own interests in the state by not trusting him and giving the reins of the party’s state unit to Sidhu, whom he called was “unstable” and “only loyal to himself.”Last month, Singh had resigned from the state’s top post after a bitter year-long feud with Sidhu. Later, he also met with Union home minister Amit Shah after which there was buzz around his joining the BJP. However, with his announcement on Tuesday, Captain confirmed he was forming his own party, a move that has been criticised by many in the Congress camp. Notably, the BJP had reacted positively about the move and has hailed Singh as a "patriot."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-singh-criticises-congress-questions-sidhu-s-presence-alliance-with-shiv-sena-in-maharashtra-101634828343986.html

The court refused to show leniency to the convict observing that he was 48-year-old when at the time of the incident.The special Pocso judge Bharati Kale said such incidents curtail the liberty of the girl child and need to be curbed.According to the special public prosecutor, SS Joshi, the incident took place at around 4.30pm on August 15, 2018. The girl was playing in an open space when the accused dragged her to a nearby autorickshaw and sexually assaulted her. Her uncle had confronted the accused and later approached the police.Joshi had argued that the prosecution has duly proved its case. She pointed out that the girl had categorically deposed that the accused had committed a sexual assault upon her and she was seen with the accused by her maternal uncle. He added that there was no reason for her to falsely implicate the accused.The accused through his counsel Anil Jadhav argued that the victim’s uncle is a social worker and he was falsely implicated. There was a quarrel over the parking of vehicles between them and the prosecution had not examined any independent witness.The statement of the victim was recorded belatedly, said the defence lawyer and added that the friends of the victims who were playing with her are not examined. He also pointed out that there were contradictions and variations in the evidence of witnesses and therefore the accused was entitled to acquittal.The judge observed that in such cases, witnesses, especially young children are reluctant to come forward and give statements and therefore the defence taken by the accused that despite several children playing nobody had come ahead, cannot be accepted. Also, the accused claimed that there was a parking dispute, however, he could not bring on record any material supporting it. “I find it highly improbable that for the reason of the parking dispute, the future of a 10-year-girl will be put at stake,” said the court while rejecting his claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pocso-case-50-year-old-gets-5-year-jail-term-for-sexually-assaulting-minor-101634828548768.html

As of now, 19.70 lakh people in Navi Mumbai have undergone Covid tests. In order to find as many possible cases, around 31 contact tracing is done after finding one positive case.“Since August, the per-day Covid cases have come down to two digits and the death rate too dropped significantly. There was zero death reported on March 1 and after that in September, there were 12 days of zero deaths reported. Similarly in October, there were 10 days without any deaths reported and hence the mortality rate of Navi Mumbai has now gone down to 1.80%,” Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Since March 2020, 1.80 lakh people have got infected with Covid, out of which 1.50 lakh have recovered. Thus, the recovery rate of Covid in Navi Mumbai is at 98%. The doubling rate of patients in the NMMC area currently is 1,773 days.“The targeted testing and testing centres at APMC market along with the 101 vaccination centres have jointly been of significance in tackling the virus,” Bangar added.Meanwhile, NMMC has also appealed to people to stay vigilant during the upcoming Diwali festival and maintain all Covid protocols while celebrating the festival so as to make sure that the cases do not increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-records-zero-covid-deaths-in-last-22-days-101634828069736.html

Gupte also informed the single-judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre that the application was moved after the special judge had made observations against his client last month.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for ED, however, objected to the application by Khadse and said that he should have applied for regular bail before approaching the HC. Gupte responded that there was no bar against filing an anticipatory bail application in HC.Justice Sambre granted Khadse protection from arrest for a week, to enable him to apply for regular bail. HC has restrained the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court from taking Khadse in custody and also directed it to decide his regular bail plea expeditiously.ED has also named Khadse’s wife Mandakini, son-in-law Girish Chaudhari and two others as accused in the money-laundering case. It is alleged that in 2016, Khadse misused his position as revenue minister to benefit his family in the land deal and caused a loss of crores of rupees to the state exchequer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pune-land-deal-case-high-court-grants-temporary-protection-from-arrest-to-ncp-s-eknath-khadse-101634827647975.html

At a press conference in the city, Soi said the state has only five motor vehicle inspectors (MVIs) to administer about 5 lakh heavy vehicles.“Punjab reports nearly 5,000 road mishaps and almost half of them involve heavy vehicles. There is not enough manpower to check fitness certificates and to enforce the law against the erring motor drivers,” Soi said, at a function where he launched ‘Mission Safe Malwa’, a social initiative by his NGO Raahat - The Safe Community Foundation.Soi added that since police personnel lacked training in vehicle accident investigation, in most mishaps even the culprits were not identified. In a scathing attack on the transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Soi said the state government had a dismal record in strict enforcement of high-security registration plates (HSRP) for old vehicles.“Only 20% of vehicles in Punjab are fitted with tamper-proof HSRP. Warring should start focusing on streamlining the functioning of his department. In most organised crimes like drug peddling and liquor smuggling, notorious elements use vehicles with fake number plates,” said Soi, also a BJP leader from Ludhiana.“Such security features enable easy identification of vehicles in case of accidents. Considering the high prevalence of crimes in which vehicles are used, such aspects assume great relevance. Details of owners can be obtained even if the vehicles are burnt,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/road-safety-expert-slams-punjab-for-poor-enforcement-of-norms-101634826447970.html

Raut on Thursday added that he has names of 100 BJP leaders involved in the various wrongdoings and said he will reveal them one at a time. Raut called Somaiya a “scam crusader” and said he has given him proof and documents related to the scam in the smart cities project in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Somaiya, meanwhile, asked if Raut’s letter meant his lack of trust in chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership. He added that the economic offences wing (EOW) of the police has the right to probe the matter. Raut, who tweeted the letter on Wednesday said, “Sent [the] following letter to ‘Scam crusader’ @kiritsomaiya. it gives details of misappropriation of funds to the tune of ₹500 crore in the smart city project run by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ruled by the BJP. Hope he will use his influence on ED to start the investigation.”Over the past few months, Somaiya has been in the news for “exposing” alleged financial wrongdoings, land scams, unauthorised construction without clearances, where he has attacked the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders and family members. The attack from Sena Member of Parliament (MP) also comes days after he asked MVA ministers to launch a counterattack and respond to allegations levelled by political opponents in the state. In the two-page letter dated October 11, Raut said, “In the year 2018-2019, many tenders worth several hundred crores were floated for various projects under the Smart City Project. However, these tenders, their terms and conditions were prepared keeping in mind the interests of a few select companies, namely — Crystal Integrated Services Pvt., Ltd., and Arcus. Both these companies were awarded tenders worth more than Rs. 500 crores (sic).”Addressing a press conference, Somaiya said, “I am confused whether Sanjay Raut is commending my work or lamenting the lack of ability of Uddhav Thackeray. He should first clarify this. Besides that, they don’t have the courage to respond to the allegations against them in the past 23 months... Who has the authority to investigate this [alleged scam]? Uddhav Thackeray government has the right to probe this matter. This matter comes under EOW.”Keshav Upadhye, chief spokesperson, Maharashtra BJP, said, “Kirit ji always speaks with evidence against any particular case. Here these are mere allegations and it smells of political conspiracy. If he (Raut) has given evidence, then it will be looked into.”Raut further said that even 50% of the work on the project was not completed despite the deadline having passed. He added that it was a clear case of misappropriation of government funds and public money to the tune of ₹500 crores “only for the benefit of these two companies.” The PCMC goes to polls in February 2022 and the Sena is eyeing to get a foothold in the civic body. The Sena chief spokesperson said that he handing over all the documents, proof of the scam to Somaiya.Sena leader, while speaking to reporters in New Delhi, said, that the party has the understanding and wherewithal to approach the appropriate investigating agency. “I am a lawmaker and I know whom to approach. But he should know where the corruption originated and whom all were involved. Does it mean that one party’s corrupt practices are wrong, if another party does it then it is acceptable? I have names of 100 related to the BJP, this was the first. The remaining 99 too will come out with proof,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kirit-somaiya-a-scam-crusader-should-take-up-issue-of-500cr-scam-in-bjp-led-civic-body-sanjay-raut-101634826387902.html
21-10-2021||Lucknow||Ensure complete ban on stubble burning, UPPCB tells districts||LUCKNOW The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Thursday asked district authorities to ensure complete ban on residue burning by farmers to get rid of stubble after the Kharif harvest.“Stubble burning is a major contributor to air pollution during winters. The district administrations have been asked to reach out to farmers and motivate them against stubble burning. The authorities have also been asked to suggest alternatives means to manage stubble waste,” said Ajay Sharma, member secretary, UPPCB.District authorities were also directed to form committees comprising local officials and farmers to ensure management of stubble waste.As per the air quality index (AQI) data of the Central Pollution Control Board, the average AQI of UP cities from October to January in recent years has been above 300. An AQI above 300 is considered very poor, with long lasting effects on human health on prolonged exposure.Considering this, the state government even lodged FIRs and fined farmers found burning stubble in their farms.On other hand, farmers objected to these harsh measures.”The state government must suggest better alternatives to remove stubble or should rather procure the stubble from farmers, if it really wants to prevent stubble burning. Otherwise it seems that farmers are made to bear the burden of a problem, which is caused by everyone,” said Jaswant Singh, a farm leader of Shahjahanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-complete-ban-on-stubble-burning-uppcb-tells-districts-101634826148044.html

The RSS chief also reviewed ongoing construction work of the upcoming Ram temple. He enquired about the foundation work, which has been completed, the Mirzapur and Karnataka stones that will be used for the plinth, besides asking about the other structures that will come up at the Ram Janmabhoomi, according to RSS office bearers. Champat Rai, general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, accompanied Mohan Bhagwat on his visit to Ram Janmabhoomi and informed him about the other Ayodhya projects that are expected to come up. The Trust has set a deadline of December 2023 for opening of the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram temple for devotees. The RSS chief was also told about a proposal to make the Ram Janmabhoomi campus eco-friendly and the projects associated with it. Mohan Bhagwat, however, did not meet Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Trust, due to time constraints. The RSS chief left for Lucknow by road in the evening. He had reached Ayodhya on Tuesday (October 19) to attend the Akhil Bhartiya Abhyas Varg, an event of the RSS. This event is organised every fifth year to apprise and train RSS volunteers on how to propagate nationalism, Indian culture and promote Swadeshi. The event is being organised outside Nagpur after a long time when assembly polls are due in Uttar Pradesh early next year. The event started on October 18 and will end on Friday.

21-10-2021||Mumbai||According to TMC, only 30% in 18-44 years category given with first vaccination dose in Thane||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has fully vaccinated only 30% of its population in the 18-44 years age group while 76% have taken at least the first dose.Within this age group, there are around 14% who are yet to take the first dose and 70% who have to be fully vaccinated.TMC has increased its testing to 3,380 on Thursday. However, the number of positive cases detected on Thursday was only 32 . This is a drastic change from the usual under-2,500 tests that are conducted in the city. Moreover, since more than a month, the city has been witnessing around daily positive cases between 60 and 100 cases.Meanwhile, the neighbouring Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has vaccinated 100% of its population with the first dose.TMC has undertaken various drives like organising mass vaccination in areas with poor response, encouraging colleges to conduct vaccination drives, having women-only centres and also has four mobile vaccination facilities. Despite these efforts, there continues to be around 14% of its population in the 18-44 years age group who have not taken even a single shot of the anti-Covid vaccination.“Although preference is given to local residents in the vaccination centres within Thane city, there are many who have taken their jab elsewhere within Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Similarly, there could be many who have come from other areas to Thane to get inoculated. This makes it difficult to be accurate about getting 100% of the population vaccinated. However, a poor turnout at government vaccination centres that provide free doses also highlights the fact that there is only a handful of people yet to get jabbed,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.Till mid-August, only 34.57% had received the first dose of vaccine and 3.73% were fully vaccinated in the 18-44 years age group. Overall, 46.36% were vaccinated with at least the first dose in Thane city till mid-August. However, now we have 86.72% with at least the first dose of vaccine.“Almost 40% of the overall population have got vaccinated in September and October. This, when there has been continuous supply of vaccine doses and every day we managed to vaccinate between 8,000 and 10,000 beneficiaries,” added Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner.As this is the most moving population, it is essential to vaccinate them at the earliest as this will help reduce the spread and impact of the virus, said the civic officials. With the number of cases stagnant, the third wave does not seem to be anywhere soon, TMC plans to take advantage of the situation and inoculate more and more people with at least the first dose of vaccination.“If more people get at least the first jab before the onset of the third wave, the impact of the wave would be less. Moreover, we have started the serosurvey in the city through which we work towards handling the third wave in a better manner. Meanwhile, we are trying to complete the entire vaccination schedule by March 2022. The only hurdle is the 84 days waiting period to get the second jab of Covishield. This is causing the delay in getting more people fully vaccinated,” said a senior civic official from TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/according-to-tmc-only-30-in-18-44-years-category-given-with-first-vaccination-dose-in-thane-101634824229973.html

21-10-2021||Lucknow||Night life to make a comeback in Lucknow||The lifting of night curfew by the Uttar Pradesh government has surely brought cheer to the restaurants, lounges and discs in the state capital. Joints with the late night service licence are dubbing the move as a silver-lining and hoping to cash in on the peak business hours which they were losing due to the curfew. As the business is set to make a comeback the owners of discs and lounges are the happiest of the lot. “For us, the peak sale is post-midnight till 1 am. As we are back to full capacity following the Covid norms now, we are looking forward to 11-1 am business which we missed on since the last six-seven months. Pre-pandemic we used to have patrons till 2 am,” says Shahbaz Khan, manager operations at Vintage Machine. They are all set to introduce a new concept of audio–visual experience for Lucknowites for which they are bringing people from Kolkata. With the relaxation Boombox Lucknow has obtained permission to operate till 1 am. “I am sure once things settle; we will get permission till 2 am. Business community and corporate executives who work till late evenings get free only after 8 to 9 pm. During night curfew, we used to ban the entry by 10 so we can wind-up by allotted time. But now, people will get time to relax for longer time leading to better business. We are keeping our fingers crossed after braving two lockdowns and huge losses,” says its owner Gaurav Singh. Hotelier Vijay Singh Bhadauria who recently opened food services at Pitambara Lawns in Vikas Nagar adds, “Our launch has been on the right time so with our cloud kitchen, multi-cuisine restaurant and quick-service café we will get extended time to serve. Late evening and night turnout gives us the main business,” he adds. Food consultant and Chef Zulfiqar Hussain looks at the extended business hours as a blessing in disguise. “As it is everyone has suffered a lot. The expenses were full-on, but the business time was curtailed so we were losing on the sale. Now, the entire staff at Grill & Chill lounge and Pepperz food joint is excited to be back to full business. Hopefully the festival season and favourable weather will drive it further,” he says. With Diwali approaching and winter season ahead everyone is upbeat about sale prospect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/night-life-to-make-a-comeback-in-lucknow-101634823627843.html

21-10-2021||Lucknow||Teachers in UP see red over order to collect plastic waste||LUCKNOW Teachers in Uttar Pradesh expressed ire against district authorities asking them to collect plastic waste from schools under the Swachh Bharat Mission and recite verses of the Valmiki Ramayan at a religious place during an event to mark Valmiki Jayanti on October 20. .On October 20, basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), Firozabad, Anjali Agarwal had asked block education officers (BEO) to ensure collection of plastic waste from primary schools under the Swachh Bharat Mission. Schools in each block of the district were asked to collect 100 kg plastic waste and deposit it at a designated panchayat bhawan.On the same day, 15 primary school teachers in Kasganj district of western UP were deployed for reciting verses of the Valmiki Ramayan during a programme organised to mark Valmiki Jayanti at the Sankat Mochan Dham in Salai. A science teacher, who was asked to recite the Valmiki Ramayan on the order of chief development officer (CDO), said:”The Valmiki Ramayan is in Sanskrit and I am a science teacher. I tried to do my best to read Sanskrit, but it was too difficult for me. Only three of four people were present at the venue. I don’t know what is the aim of organizing such a function.”Various teachers’ organizations expressed their discontent over the issue and took to social media platforms to criticise officials who ordered teachers to perform the said tasks.“If a teacher is made responsible for collection of plastic waste and read scriptures at an event being organised at a religious place, when will he get time to do his duty of teaching students,” asked Dinesh Chandra Sharma, president of UP Teachers’ Federation.Director general, school education, Anamika Singh said, “I have come to know about the orders issued regarding collection of plastic waste and have sought more information about the event.” Regarding the Ramayan issue, the officer said she would look into the matter.“District authorities, including chief development officer issue these orders, which are implemented by the BSAs.

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: BJP, Congress spar over choppers, deities||With the bypolls to one parliamentary segment and three assembly segments in the hill-state being seen as precursors to the general assembly elections due next year, the Congress and BJP are engaged in an intense battle of political one-upmanship involving choppers and deities. The Opposition has slammed chief minister (CM) Jai Ram Thakur for using the state government’s chopper for travelling across the state. “Even if the CM has to go from one panchayat to the next, he uses a chopper. He is a high-flying leader, whose ear is not to the ground,” said leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri. Congress’ nominee from the Mandi parliamentary seat Pratibha Singh also took a dig at Thakur’s chopper use, saying, “The roads are full of potholes, which are not visible from the chopper.” Pratibha, the widow of six-time chief minister Virbhadra Singh, is contesting polls for the fifth time. She has been elected to the Lok Sabha twice. The chief minister, however, said, “I am not the first CM who is using a chopper. Did Congress leaders use bullock carts to travel? The CM has to travel the length and breadth of the state. In fact, Congress leaders would use the state chopper for their personal use as well.”He was responding to questions at the Kangni Dhar helipad before flying to Fatehpur in a chopper hired by the BJP for the election campaign. On allegations of him not stepping out of the chopper, the CM said, “I have been travelling by road for the last eight days. I do not need the Congress’ permission to travel in a chopper.” “The state government’s chopper is used for relief and rescue during calamities in tribal regions. We delivered Covid vaccines to remote regions that are still inaccessible by road be it Dodra-Kwar in Rohru or Barabanghal in Kangra. The chopper is also used to ferry people from snowbound regions in winters when the roads are blocked.” Flak over stopping nazarana The government’s decision to stop nazarana, an honorarium paid to deities visiting the famous Kullu Dussehra has also drawn flak from the Opposition. There are 473 deities registered with Kullu Kardar Sangh, while the actual figure is around 600. During Dussehra around 281 deities congregate at the Dhalpur ground to participate in the historic Dussehra. The deities pay homage to the presiding deity Lord Raghunath and the district administration traditionally pays around ₹6,000 to ₹ 2 lakh to each deity visiting the Dussehra. However, this time the government has not paid any nazarana to the deities. Making the suspension of grants a poll issue, Agnihotri said, “Even the deities will not forgive the government this time.” “We had been assured that nazarana will be given to the deities after the elections are over. We are also demanding uniformity in grants” said says Jai Chand, head, Kardar Sangh Kullu district. “There were a lot of restrictions for Dussehra in Kullu, but that wasn’t the case for the Shivratri fair in Mandi. There was ban on business activities during Dussehra in Kullu “said Dhani Ram Chauhan, president, Pujari Kalyan Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-choppers-deities-in-the-eye-of-the-storm-101634821767500.html

21-10-2021||Patna||‘From Begusarai to Boston’: President Kovind praises ‘industrious people’ of Bihar||PATNA: President Ram Nath Kovind Thursday said the centenary celebration of the Bihar Legislative Assembly building was a historic occasion for more than one reason, as it had also coincided with India crossing the 100-crore mark in Covid-19 vaccine jabs.“Bihar is known for scripting history and today history has been scripted,” he said at the centenary celebrations of the Bihar Legislative Assembly building, which had hosted the inaugural session of the joint Bihar and Orissa Provincial Council on February 7, 1921.Responding to chief minister Nitish Kumar’s remarks about his Bihar ties since his stint as Governor, from where he was elevated as President, Kovind said visiting Bihar always felt like a homecoming and that he felt proud to be referred to as Bihari. He added that after the first President Dr Rajendra Prasad and former President Zakir Hussain, he got the responsibility to take the rich legacy forward and got a lot of love and respect from the people.“It is not just my ties as the Bihar Governor, but also because of the Buddhist connection and the contributions I made for the Vipassana Centre. I am happy that Nitish Kumar, the longest-serving chief minister of Bihar since independence, took it forward. Buddha got enlightenment here. Bihar is a land of knowledge and the world’s first democracy. There have always been special blessings on me in the land of Buddha, Mahavir and Guru Gobind Singh,” he said.Conveying his greetings to the people in the festive season, he said how Chhath was now being worshipped from Nawada to New Jersey and from Begusarai to Boston. “This is proof that the industrious people associated with the culture of Bihar have made their place on the world stage,” he said.Referring to the ban on sale and consumption of liquor in Bihar since 2016, the President cited Governor SP Sinha’s address to the Legislative Assembly of 1921, when the latter said there should be a definite policy to prohibit the production and sale of intoxicating substances or liquor.“In our Constitution, the duty of the State to improve public health is clearly mentioned under the ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’. This includes the prohibition of the consumption of liquor and substances injurious to health. By giving this a status of law, the Bihar assembly has taken a very good step in the interest of public health and society, especially in the favour of women from weaker sections,” Kovind said.He also laid the foundation stone for Shatabdi Smriti Stambh and planted a sapling of Mahabodhi Tree in the premises of Bihar Legislative Assembly on the occasion. “The enthusiastic presence of present as well as former members of Bihar legislature is a good example of the healthy parliamentary tradition developed in our country,” he added.The President also hailed the personalities from Bihar played in the Constituent Assembly — Dr Sachchidananda Sinha, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Shri Krishna Sinha, Maharaja Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga, Shyam Nandan Sahay, Satyanarayan Sinha, Babu Jagjivan Ram, among others.Kovind also lauded the state’s resolves, cited by Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha in his address, to keep Bihar free of social problems.Earlier, Sinha thanked the President for sparing time for the function and narrated the rich legacy of the Bihar Legislature and the way it had evolved over the years. “It has been witness to landmark legislation and scholarly debates. Now it has adapted to the digital era with online questions & answers and webcasting,” the Speaker said.In his speech, CM Kumar said, “We consider the President as our very own and we are happy to find him in our midst. I want that all government employees should attend the Vipassana Centre, and the government will grant 15-day leave to them. I am confident the Speaker will also try to bring the Prime Minister to this centenary function,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/from-begusarai-to-boston-president-kovind-praises-industrious-people-of-bihar-101634819727261.html
21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Moonstruck on Karva Chauth: Celebrating love and longing||As the sun sets on the auspicious day of Karva Chauth, the wait for moonrise begins. This Sunday, sighting the moon will be the most awaited event in India. The first thing I look for in the newspaper on Karva Chauth is the weather column for the moonrise time. Somehow, sighting the moon, which is visible easily on other days, becomes elusive on this special day. Nature seems to test our devotion. All family members keep gazing at the sky and the most-awaited sentence of the day is, “Chand dikh gaya (There’s the moon!)”. Thanks to the tall buildings in cities, spotting the moon has become even more challenging nowadays. The sky-scraping apartments block the view and clouds play a vital role amid the hide and seek. To tide over the predicament, I make the house help climb on the water tank on our terrace to gain height and locate the moon. Often, I get mistaken by bulbs gleaming in the distance and break into a happy gig with a sparkle in the eyes only to realise that it’s a case of mistaken identity. The long wait on the terrace eventually yields a glimpse of the moon, shining in the dark sky. There is a sense of achievement as an electrifying wave of enthusiasm engulfs everyone breaking the fast. Pictures of the moon are shared on social media amid phone calls to exchange greetings and blessings. I love this concept of Karva Chauth as it rings in the festive spirit. We Indians celebrate our special occasions with gusto, breaking the monotony of our lives. The flavours and frolic of our vivid celebrations keep us charged up and devoted. The custom of applying mehndi in the run-up to Karva Chauth, for instance, is an added charm for the children also as the mehndi wala (henna artist) comes home to apply intricate designs to our hands. On a selfish note, to escape the food craving, I keep the lunch menu for others as simple as possible. Next, I keep myself occupied as it helps cross the hunger bridge. Every year, I recall special experiences of this special day. Once when I was staying in a hotel in Chennai for a night en route to Tirupati, I went to the hotel terrace to do the puja and was feeling awkward as I thought I would be alone up there. To my surprise, a bevy of beauties, who were also guests at the hotel, had gathered to celebrate Karva Chauth. They were aesthetically attired, waiting to see the moon. We chatted for a long time. It was an unforgettable experience and many of us became friends and are still in touch. Wives keep this fast affectionately and devotedly. The festival entitles a wife the extra edge to win and rule over her husband’s heart. A husband owes much to his wife for the fasts and prayers for his long life, so there should be a ritual of pampering the wife in return. It will give him an opportunity to express his love as well. This pious occasion definitely deepens the bond between couples. It is an expression of intense feelings of true love and care towards the spouse. Nothing can express the infinite love more than a devotedly kept fast for the spouse. And yes, for every woman, be it a late or early darshan, Chandramaji’s blessings are the most important. kirtibihani02@gmail.com The writer is a New Delhi-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moonstruck-on-karva-chauth-celebrating-love-and-longing-101634819667537.html
21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Election expenditure reforms and level playing field||“Indian politicians start their legislative careers with a lie — the false spending returns they submit,” former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee once told a parliamentary committee. Lately, the intimidating role of money in the election outcome, quality of law makers and the resultant governance by the political executive have been worrying every thinking citizen. Also read: UP assembly polls: Priyanka promises phones, electric scooties for girl studentsThe ever-increasing electioneering expenditure disincentivises righteous people from participating in the process. It is believed that the expenditure incurred by candidates during assembly and parliamentary elections is manipulated and misstated. Nevertheless, such deceptions go unquestioned at individual, institutional and societal levels. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is well aware of the malpractices resorted to by the candidates to manoeuvre such expenditure within the limits set by it. Skyrocketing electoral expenses According to a report by the Centre for Media Studies in 2019, the maximum amount, roughly 33% of the total expense, was expended on campaigning and publicity. The second big spending head, about 25%, was distribution of money among voters. This report further stated that the political parties spent ₹60,000 crore in the last Lok Sabha elections. The report has called the 2019 general election the “most expensive election ever, anywhere”. The ruling parties spend more. While there is a limit on candidates to spend on their campaign, there is no such cap on political parties. Some suggestions are made to bring down this expenditure leading a real level playing field in true democratic spirit. Amend electoral bonds scheme The ruling party pockets most of the funds received through electoral bonds. These bonds introduced in 2018 and issued by the State Bank of India are purchased anonymously by donors in favour of an eligible political party (registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which have secured not less than 1% of the votes in the last general election to an assembly or Parliament). According to the latest data with the ECI, of the total bonds worth ₹3,435 crore sold in 2019-20, the ruling party at the Centre received about 74% and the other eligible political parties shared the rest. The existing scheme of electoral bonds creates an uneven playing field for political parties. Its very nature and functioning favour the ruling parties. The scheme lacks transparency, equity, fairness and a level playing field. It distorts the financial equilibrium among political parties. The scheme needs to be amended in a way that these bonds go to a common pool at the national level, and then distributed according to the vote share received by the eligible political parties in the last parliamentary and assembly elections. This will also snap the quid pro quo between the ruling dispensation and the donors, and thus remove the alleged influence by the donors on policy formulation, ensure genuine anonymity and create a level playing field with equitable sharing of political donations. Many are unaware that the cost of printing the electoral bonds and the bank commission charged by the SBI are borne by the government and not by the buyers. Why should the taxpayer bear these two charges? Let the donors who donate bonds worth crores of rupees, or the recipient bear these costs. Restrict number of election rallies Two leaders of the main political parties at the national level addressed more than 140 rallies each in the last Lok Sabha elections across the country. Such mega gatherings cost huge expenditure, become a potential threat to public health and disturb normal public life. There is a need to restrict the number of rallies each party can hold in each constituency and the state to bring down the election expenditure and ensure a level playing field. Access of political leaders to public may be increased through modern means of communication. A 1998 report of the Indrajit Gupta Committee on State Funding of Elections recommended partial state funding, mainly in kind. In addition to free TV and radio broadcast time on state-owned media, it recommended that private channels make available sufficient free air time to recognised national and other parties during elections. Rules need to be amended so that each TV and radio channel, whether government or private, mandatorily devote pre-determined time for campaigning and election debates to each political party free of cost. The print media be also mandated to publish political advertisements at DAVP rates. Filing online nominations A considerable amount is spent on filing nomination papers by organising a caravan of vehicles and making this event a show of strength. Taking advantage of modern technology, amend the rules to file nominations online. The oath can also be taken online with a video clip submitted to the returning officer for record. Include party expenditure In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled in the Kanwar Lal Gupta v. Amar Nath Chawla case that the party spending on behalf of a candidate should be included in calculating that candidate’s election expenses to determine whether the election expenditure limit had been violated. In response, Parliament amended the RPA in 1975 to nullify this judgment. Existing expenditure limits become meaningless if expenses incurred by a political party are not proportionately added to the expenditure of its each candidate. This amendment needs to be reversed. All political parties must come together to make the largest democracy on this planet the best democracy. sksandhu521@gmail.com The writer is a retired Punjab IAS officer.

21-10-2021||Lucknow||UP govt gives nod to organise Kartik Mela in Garhmukteshwar||MEERUT The district administration has started preparations for the Kartik Mela in Garhmukteshwar tehsil of UP’s Hapur district following the state government’s approval to organise the fair this year with all Covid protocols.The fair, which was cancelled last year due to the corona surge, will be organised on the riverbank from November 9 to 21 with the main Ganga Snan on November 18. Being a historic mela associated with the Mahabharat, lakhs of devotees from western UP and other parts of the country arrive here to take a dip in the Ganga. The mela is organised every year after Diwali. A tweet by the state’s home department shared that chief minister Yogi Adityanath had given approval to celebrate Kartik Mela at Garhmukteshwar in a grand way.Reviewing the preparations, district magistrate (Hapur) Anuj Singh convened a meeting with chief development officer Uday Singh, additional district magistrate Shraddha Shandilyayan and other officials on Wednesday. He directed officials to deploy a drone at the mela site to keep close vigil on the people’s activities and ensure their safety. He also directed officials to set up a Covid testing centre and a temporary hospital and ensure cleanliness, adequate barricading, illumination, sufficient boats, watch tower and round-the-clock availability of trained life guards and divers at the site.During the fair, the bank of Ganga turns into a “city of tents” as people from villages arrive with family and stay here in makeshift tents. They enjoy folk songs by various artistes along with different village sports like kabaddi, wrestling, kho-kho etc.The mela is also famous for its animal fair, which was once the biggest animal fair in Asia. President of Prajapati Samaj Kalyan Yuva Samiti Bhagwan Singh and general secretary Sriram handed over a charter of demands to the district administration and sough adequate facilities for the animal fair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-gives-nod-to-organise-kartik-mela-in-garhmukteshwar-101634818348261.html

However, with Covid cases again rising, the auditorium was shut in April.Municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said, “With the state government permitting the opening of auditoriums and cases reducing in Navi Mumbai as well, we have decided to open the auditorium. We have advertised for applications from organisations and individuals for holding dramas, cultural programmes, musical shows and other entertainment events, meetings and conferences for the period October 22 to December 31.“Now, Vishnudas Bhave auditorium is set to welcome the patrons with 50% occupancy.

NCB summoned Ananya Pandey after a team of the agency officers searched her house on Thursday as the investigators reportedly came across WhatsApp chats exchanged between her and Aryan Khan. An NCB officer said the chats were “drugs related“.Ananya Pandey reached NCB office at 4.15 pm and was accompanied by her father Chunky Pandey.In Pics: Ananya Panday and Chunky Panday reach NCB office after raids at her homeAryan was arrested on October 3 following raid on a cruise ship anchored at International Cruise Terminal in Mumbai. The cruise was set to go to Goa when NCB conducted searches of the guests and arrested Aryan along with his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha. The agency claimed to have found 6 grams of Charas in a plastic pouch concealed in Arbaaz’s shoe. Earlier, on Wednesday a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court denied bail to Aryan, saying there was prima facie evidence that the 23-year-old son was indulging in “illicit drug activities” on a regular basis, and could commit a similar offence if released. The court also rejected bail pleas of Arbaaz, 26, and Dhamecha, 28. Aryan is presently lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Central prison. His father Shah Rukh Khan on Thursday morning met him at the prison, first time since his arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ananya-pandey-reaches-ncb-office-after-summons-in-cruise-drug-seizure-case-101634816006241.html
21-10-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Priyanka promises smartphones, electric scooties for girl students||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday announced smartphones for Class 12 pass girls and electric scooties to those completing graduation as part of her party’s second promise to women ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.“I met some girl students on Wednesday. They told me they need smartphones to study and for security. I am happy that Uttar Pradesh Congress, in consultation with the election manifesto committee, has decided to give a smartphone to 12th pass girls and an electric scooty to those graduating following formation of Congress government,” said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in an announcement on social media on Thursday.This is the second political promise that Priyanka has made this week. On Tuesday, she announced that the Congress will give 40 per cent of the party tickets to women candidates in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.“These announcements will be part of the Congress’s poll manifesto to be released later,” said a Congress leader.Priyanka’s announcements are being considered her party’s attempts to reach out to women. Recently, she picked up a broom to clean a Valmiki temple in Lucknow. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) witnessed celebrations after the announcement about providing 40 per cent reservation for women in party tickets. It has decided to take the announcement about smartphones and electric scooties to the girl students to people across the state.“Please make sure to take these announcements to the people and post them on social media platforms,” said UPCC organisation secretary Anil Yadav in a communication to the party workers on Thursday.The Congress wants to focus more on the younger age groups as the party reaches out to the women voters.A picture of some young girls with the slogan “Ladki Hun, Lad Sakti Hun (I am a girl, I can fight)” formed the background when Priyanka Gandhi Vadra made the announcement about the distribution of 40 per cent party tickets to women in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.A close scrutiny of the Election Commission of India’s data indicates that as on January 1, 2021 Uttar Pradesh had 145.85 million voters and 67.05 million of them were women. The data also indicates that the number of young voters was high. Out of 145.85 million voters in the state, about 2.19 million were in the 18 to 19 year age group, 36.55 million in the 20 to 29 year and 37.45 million in 30 to 39 year age groups.About a decade ago, the Samajwadi Party’s promises in the party’s manifesto for the 2012 assembly election had included the distribution of laptops and tablets to students who passed the class 12 and 10 exams, respectively. The BJP, in its UP election manifesto in 2017, also promised free laptops along with free data to college-going students. Reacting to Priyanka Gandhi’s announcement, UP BJP vice-president and MLC Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, “The Congress is making all such announcements in view of the 2022 assembly election. Everybody knows the Congress did not keep its promise of loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh. The people are also aware of what the Congress has done for women in states where the party is in power.” “Announcing freebies in elections has become a norm for the political parties in recent years. It’s better to promise something to young girls in the education sector than making announcements on caste or community lines that are not healthy. As far as the issue of giving 40 per cent Congress tickets to the women is concerned, this may not cut much ice unless the party addresses other serious issues like rising unemployment,” Professor Roop Rekha Verma, former vice chancellor of Lucknow University, said. Niharika Singh, a class 12 student, expressed happiness over the announcement. “Having an electric scooter will make it easy for us to travel to our college. The smartphone will also help in a great way, especially for attending online classes,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-priyanka-promises-smartphones-electric-scooties-for-girl-students-101634815706118.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation puts on hold installation of CCTV cameras in civic schools||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has put on hold its plan to install CCTV cameras in civic schools as it was unable to execute another bigger project in the past five years.The decision of installing CCTV cameras in the civic schools was taken in 2019 and a budget of ₹4.75Cr was also allocated for the same.A senior officer from the NMMC electrical department said, “In 2016, the civic body decided to install a total of 1,450 high-tech CCTV cameras across Navi Mumbai with a budget of ₹154Cr. We also roped in IIT, Bombay, and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute for helping us at the planning stage. Five years on, we are still stuck in the tendering process. The bidders, who have shown interest, are presenting plans involving higher expenditures. Since this project has not seen any progress, the civic body has decided to put the project of installing CCTV cameras in civic schools on hold for now.”Sources from the education department said that NMMC runs a total of 70 schools, of which 53 are primary and 17 are secondary schools.The CCTV cameras in the school premises were a topic of discussion in the satellite city in 2018 after a minor girl was allegedly sexually assaulted inside her school premises in Vashi. The girl said that an unidentified person took her to a toilet by covering her mouth with a handkerchief and then assaulted her inside it. The police could not arrest anyone in that case.Vilashini Patil, a 41-year-old parent from Seawoods, said, “CCTV cameras have become essential for the safety of the kids inside the school premises. Almost all private schools in the city have installed such cameras and that has given their parents a sense of relief. NMMC should also install such cameras on the school premises soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-municipal-corporation-puts-on-hold-installation-of-cctv-cameras-in-civic-schools-101634814626139.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane police crack theft case using time-consuming investigation tool||In the absence of CCTV footage and eyewitnesses, the Thane Nagar police turned to a tedious and time-consuming tool of investigation called Dump Data Analysis to solve a theft case in their jurisdiction last week. The six-day long investigation led the police to three accused wanted not only in their own case but also in more than 50 other cases in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, officials said.According to the Thane Nagar police, Kandivali resident Rutu Nagaria (30) registered a complaint with them on October 14 about her laptop, cell phone and purse being stolen from her car while it was parked at Tembhi Naka the previous evening. Nagaria said in her complaint that the unidentified accused had smashed the rear window of her car while she was in a meeting and fled with her valuables.“There are no CCTV cameras covering the spot where the complainant’s car was parked, and we could not find any eye witnesses who might have noticed suspicious movements around the car either. With no other leads, we turned to Dump Data Analysis to see if it could yield any clues,” senior police inspector Ramrao Somvanshi, Thane Nagar police station, said.The investigating team obtained data about all cell phone numbers that had passed through the range of the cellular towers providing network to the spot where the car was parked and started going through them. All numbers that had stayed in the same range before and after the crime were eliminated on the assumption that the accused would not stay close to the scene of the crime after committing the theft.Next, the police started checking call records of all the remaining numbers to see if they had called each other, and using this method, isolated three numbers that were frequently in touch with each other before, after and on the day of the offence. Further analysis also confirmed that the three numbers were present in the same area multiple times over a large period of time, indicating that the owners of the numbers were frequently together.“We obtained details of these numbers including the names and addresses of their owners. Based on this information, we identified a house in Navi Mumbai and kept a watch on it for three days before we moved in and picked up the first suspect,” an officer who is part of the investigation said.The suspect, identified as Yusuf Sheikh (37), was brought to the police station and questioned and allegedly confessed to the offence. He also revealed the identities of his two accomplices, Shera Chauhan (39) and Kasim Qureshi (34), both residents of Mumbai. All the three accused were placed under arrest on Wednesday.The police also recovered two stolen laptops worth ₹3.5 lakh from the accused. However, they had already stripped Nagaria’s laptop and sold the parts, officers said.“Further inquiries have revealed that Sheikh has seven cases of a similar nature registered against him in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, while Chauhan has 37 cases and Qureshi, nine. We have informed the Mumbai and Navi Mumbai police about their arrest so that they can seek custody of the accused for inquiries in their cases,” Somvanshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-police-crack-theft-case-using-time-consuming-investigation-tool-101634813366164.html
21-10-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: When “Korphadicha muramba” became a synonym to talk about STIs||On April 13, 1866, the newspaper “Jnanaprakash” expressed anguish over the youth in Pune “succumbing to the lure of sex-workers”. “We have known that several notable citizens of this city are regularly seen visiting sex-workers. Prostitution has long thrived here, but now we should think about the future of the younger generation. The youth of Pune have been seen patronizing the flesh trade. Due to this, sex workers from other towns and villages have now started operating here”, it wrote.This was one of the hundreds of articles and editorials published in the last few decades of the 19th century in various Marathi newspapers expressing concern about the flourishing prostitution in Pune. Social leaders like Gopal Hari Deshmukh alias Lokahitawadi, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Mahadev Moreshwar Kunte actively cautioned the youth against visiting sex workers. BG Tilak and GG Agarkar later campaigned against prostitution in their newspapers “Kesari” and “Maratha”. After the 1860s, when Marathi newspapers started printing advertisements, the majority of those featured medicines to treat venereal diseases, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Most of the articles published then condemned prostitution on moral grounds. The leaders wanted young men to “give up vices like liquor and visiting brothels, and commit their lives for their country”. A few articles though, mostly written by Tilak and Agarkar, wanted their readers to know about the dangers of venereal diseases and STIs. The newspapers chose not to, or could not, write about the health hazards openly. Owing to the constraints of those times, and the unease felt by the authors, this had to be hinted at obliquely. They instead, very cleverly, adapted a euphemism to talk about venereal diseases.The said euphemism was “Korphadicha muramba”, or Aloe vera jam. This jam was being used to treat STIs by the natives of Pune. So naturally, people having STIs would eat it a lot. Whenever the authors wanted to draw the attention of their readers towards the growing number of patients with STIs, they would simply mention that “more and more people are now eating Korphadicha muramba”. This usage made venereal diseases and STIs look less scandalous. It also saved the authors from any possible embarrassment whatsoever while writing about the topic. While Marathi newspapers were using Aloe vera jam as a euphemism for STIs, English newspapers published in Britain, and India had started using “Fish market” as a euphemism for brothels.Aloe vera had been used in India for several centuries to treat a variety of diseases and infections. It was an aperient and deemed highly beneficial to persons predisposed to apoplexy. The fresh juice from the leaves was said to be cathartic, cooling, and useful in fevers, spleen, and liver disease, enlarged lymphatic glands, and as an external applicant in certain eye diseases.Garcia de Orta, a Portuguese physician, accompanied Admiral Martin Alfonso de Souza to Goa in 1534. According to Garcia de Orta, the juice of Aloe vera at that time was used for medicinal purposes in South India. He gives the prescription for the use of the fresh plant – “aloe leaves sliced, 3 oz., salt, heat to boiling, strain, add 1 oz. of sugar; to be taken cold early in the morning”. This concoction was widely used as an aperient and emmenagogue.It is unclear how, when, and where the recipe of Aloe vera jam was developed. Many medieval manuals of Ayurveda talks about using Aloe vera to treat several maladies, but only a few mention the said jam.The recipe for Aloe vera jam could be found in “Soopashastra”, the first Marathi cookbook written by Ramchandra Sakharam Gupte, and published in 1875 by Shridhar Ravji Gondhalekar in Pune.Gupte instructs his readers to wash Aloe vera pulp carefully and put it on a clean cloth. One part pulp is then added to three parts sugar syrup, and the mixture is boiled on moderate heat till the jam thickens. According to Gupte, this jam was used to treat Syphilis.Sadly, the prevalence of venereal diseases was not limited to Pune city. The Cantonment areas were severely affected too. Even though the British Government had been trying to control the situation since the early 1820s, the efforts gained momentum only during the last decades of the 19th century.According to “The Bombay Gazette”, there were 2,556 admissions in 1867 from venereal diseases which gave a ratio of 212 per thousand European men. STIs amounted to 15% of “the entire sickness”. The number kept on increasing for the next three decades.Several measures were adopted to keep venereal diseases among European men in check. Sex workers were forbidden in the Poona and Kirkee Cantonment areas. Female workers were employed to “keep an eye on the sex workers”, and trace the women “who were carrying the disease”. A “lock hospital” was established, where patients were not allowed to go out, and visitors were strictly prohibited.The British doctors in India in the 19th century did not hesitate from using traditional native medicines and modes of treatment. Accordingly, they did not shy away from using Aloe vera to treat venereal diseases amongst the European population in India.Dr MD Joynt, Brigade-Surgeon, Poona, Prof GM Woodrow, College of Science, Poona, and Dr William Dymock, Surgeon-Major, Bombay, came together to formulate a mode of treatment for venereal diseases. Their treatment included fresh juice of Aloe vera and the famed Aloe vera jam.GM Woodrow, Professor at College of Science, Poona, mentions in “A Dictionary of the Economic Products of India” that in Poona roots of Abrus precatorius (rosary pea) were used to treat Gonorrhea. A quantity equal to a drachm (a unit of weight formerly used by apothecaries, equivalent to 60 grains or one-eighth of an ounce) in weight was pounded and the juice was mixed with sugar-candy. This was sold on the streets of Pune. This was also included in the treatment formulated in the Cantonment hospitals.As a medicine, the inspissated juice from the forms of the species of Aloe vera found in India was regarded as but little inferior to the imported Socotrine aloes. The Socotrine Aloes (Aloe Perryi) is very similar to the Barbados aloes but has a purplish hue on the stem and lower parts of the leaf. Aloe fruticosa (Ghritkumari in Hindi) has a woody stem and narrow recurved toothy leaves.All three species were planted in Poona and Kirkee Cantonment areas to get a regular supply of fresh pulp and juice.Aloe vera jam suddenly disappeared from Marathi newspapers at the onset of the 21st century. But it stayed in popular literature for a long time. Authors like Shantabai Nashikkar, Anandibai Shirke, YG Joshi, NH Apte mentioned the dish in their short stories and novels. A man eating the jam was understood by the readers to indulge in debauchery. They sympathized with his wife.Euphemisms abound in food terminology. We should all be grateful when it comes to culinary name-calling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-when-korphadicha-muramba-became-a-synonym-to-talk-about-stis-101634813306507.html
21-10-2021||Patna||President Kovind attends event to mark 100-yrs of Bihar Vidhan Sabha Bhavan||President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday attended a function organised here to mark the centenary of Bihar Vidhan Sabha Bhavan, the sprawling building that accommodates the two houses of state legislature and has been a witness to many a historic legislative business and debate. On the occasion, Kovind planted a sapling of Bodhi tree and laid the foundation for a commemorative pillar. According to Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, the pillar would be around the same height as the imposing 100-year-old building and will be adorned on top with a metallic replica of the Bodhi Vriksh, the tree under which Gautam Buddha had attained enlightenment over two millennia ago. Later, the President addressed a symposium on the theme "debate in the legislature is at the root of parliamentary democracy". In his speech, Kovind fondly recalled his association with the state, his nearly two-year-long gubernatorial stint in Bihar before getting elected to the highest constitutional post. He paid glowing tributes to the contributions of Sachchidanand Sinha, the first president of the Constituent Assembly, in getting statehood for Bihar, formerly a part of the Calcutta presidency. The President also recalled that late Jagjivan Ram, the tallest Dalit leader of his generation who rose to the post of the deputy prime minister, had started his political career as a member of the Bihar legislative assembly. Earlier, in his address, Governor Phagu Chauhan expressed dismay over declining standards of debates in legislative bodies and frequent disruptions by agitated members. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who had famously supported Kovind’s candidature in presidential elections, said it was a matter of pride for Bihar that one of its former governors was now occupying the Rashtrapati Bhavan. "Although Dr Zakir Hussain had served as a governor of Bihar before getting elected as the President, he had been the vice president in between. But Kovind's achievement is rare in that he became the President straight away.

21-10-2021||Delhi||#CyberSecurity: When did you last change your password?||Online shopping for festivals is taking place in full swing, for many! And why not, for pre-Diwali is the time when one lets loose all restrictions on budget to enjoy the festivities. But, give it a pause and think and reply: When did you change your account password last? If the answer is taking a long time to come to you, then know that your accounts aren’t as secure as your believe them to be! Cyber crime cases have sure risen in the pandemic times. And recently, Gaurav Sharma, DCP (Southwest), Delhi Police, tweeted how important it is to change the passwords regularly, and not to use one’s mobile number or easy codes such as 0000, as your password. Sharma says, “The most important thing is whether you change your password or not, don’t, ever, share it with anyone! Many of us have the habit of delegating things... we give our card to someone and ask them to do a transaction on our behalf. That need to stop! When everything can be managed with a mobile phone, there’s no need to make a cash transaction. Senior citizens ask their servants to make these transactions for them, and this needs to stop too. To make it easier, you can make a set of 2-3 passwords that are interchangeable; so that if you forget one, you can check the second and third. One of them will click!”Why netizens avoid changing passwords frequently?Can’t remember!There is a lot of confusion when you change your password, says Sonali Kutariyar, a Noida-based banker. “It’s always difficult to remember a new password. In the bank, we need to change password just to mitigate risk of cyber fraud every two weeks. Like in our organisation, there is multi-factor authentication that leads to remembering many passwords at a same time, which creates chaos. So for personal things I tend to keep an easy password so that I remember it. But yes, if attackers crack a password, it’s easy for them to crack the next password because the person will keep almost similar passwords (in most cases),” she adds.Different combos are like Maths sum Shubhangi Jeswal, a dance teacher from Noida fails to wrap her head around all the mandates that a password demands on varied websites. “Most of the apps want specific passwords that include special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase and what not. Getting this combination right is at times like solving a Maths problem! It’s so tough to meet all these password requirements for every single app. And every time I try to make a new password, it takes several attempts to finally get it right. So now I’ve one password that I feel is strong, and works for everything,” she says.Autofill saves the day“When everything is fed in the phone, it gets so easy to use your accounts,” says Bhavna Bansal, an IT professional from Naraina, adding: “I keep same passwords for a lot of accounts because my memory isn’t that good to remember all different ones. And though I do want to organise my passwords as per the accounts like different for shopping and different for office or banking apps. But, I will have to do it manually, and if god forbid I don’t remember what I had put in, then it’s a whole process to get to get out of that game called — forgot password!”What do the experts say?‘Understand the consequences’It’s a human mentality to avoid change, says Dr Imran Noorani, consultant chief psychologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He adds, “It has to do with not understanding how important the issue is. People have to understand the consequences. For any human mind, they do only that what they feel is important and will fetch them something. A person who has faced an issue will tell the others about the seriousness. Otherwise, changing passwords is an added burden for them. It becomes difficult for humans to adapt to change.”Safety vault password as 123456?KPS Malhotra, DCP (cyber, special cell), Delhi Police, says people must be very careful nowadays as everything is connected to your bank account. “Will you keep the password of your safety vault at home as 123456? No, right? So you also need to value your cyber safety and security. Most of the things today are linked to our banking credentials and other important information. Giving easy access to such information can lead to major troubles, both on the financial and personal fronts. Guard your cyber credentials well and be safe online and in life,” he says.Try holiday spot instead of DOBSuggesting how to create an easy yet effective password, Ankur Tripathi, an associate director with MNC, says that a combination of some rules need to be followed while making your password. He says, “It’s important to not use your date of birth, name, or a pattern like 123 or common passwords like 0000 or your phone number. It’s best to use a combination of uppercase characters, lower case characters and special characters with length of at least 10 characters. These characters could be anything but not your basic information. Like you can maybe put your favourite holiday spot like this: MAldives@666.” So now when you log into your account, do make it secure by ensuring that its password has been recently changed!Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cybersecurity-when-did-you-last-change-your-password-101634804137024.html

So yes, our winter shopping has officially begun,” says Shubhendra Kumar, an IT professional from Greater Kailash I.Some like Ashish Jain, an entrepreneur from Adarsh Nagar, have decided to carry a jacket to work, to protect himself from the cold. “I’ve to travel to Gurugram for work, and it has now started getting cold in the evenings, when I’m on my way back home. Since it rained in Delhi after Dussehra, I had to carry a jacket with me to battle the cold. The centralised AC in office was another reason that made me do this, nahi toh meri kulfi jam jaati,” says Jain. Some denizens are also struggling to not to fall sick due to the change in weather, and hence stocking up on vitamin C pills and kadha to boost their immunity. “Winter is my favourite, but we need to be careful when such kind of a weather change happens because this is also the time when a lot of people fall sick,” says Shivani Jaiswal, a dentist from Anand Lok, adding, “I’ve bought vitamin C tablets and other basic medicines for cold and cough. I’m also going to wear only full sleeves clothing from now on, especially when I step out in the evenings. And I’m not drinking anything cold, but a lot of tea.

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder should explain why he stalled Maur blast probe: Randhawa||Keeping up his attack on Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio, on Thursday said the former chief minister should explain why he stalled the inquiry into the Maur bomb blast case that left seven people dead in January 2017. Also read: Farmers have right to protest, but roads can’t be blocked indefinitely: SCSpeaking to the media after presiding over a function at the Punjab Armed Police headquarters in Jalandhar on Police Commemoration Day, Randhawa said: “Capt Amarinder has been pitching the issue of national security in Punjab and making tall claims on busting terror modules, but he should first explain why the Maur blast probe was closed and why people don’t know the truth behind it. It’s a major failure of Capt Amarinder Singh, who was also the home minister.” The deputy CM claimed that the inquiry into the blast case was stopped rather than speeded up despite requests of party workers to direct the police to expedite the probe. “We are set to launch a re-investigation in the case. The culprits will be behind bars soon,” Randhawa said while referring to the internal threat from Dera Sacha Sauda in the 2022 assembly elections as the accused in the Maur blast case are still at large. Two probe teams yet accused at large Seven people, including three children, were killed and 13 others were injured in the blast at Maur Mandi in Bathinda district on January 31, 2017. The explosion had taken place close to an election campaign site of Congress candidate Harminder Singh Jassi days before the last assembly elections. In February this year, the Punjab government approved special provisions in its rules to provide government jobs to the kin of the children killed in the blast. The special investigation team, led by deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra, found Dera followers Gurtej Kala and Amrik Singh were supervisors of the workshop of the sect in Sirsa where the car used in the bombing was painted. The SIT probe pointed to the involvement of Dera Sacha Sauda but did not question its chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim. The dera chief’s son is married to Jassi’s daughter. Later, the Punjab and Haryana high court dissolved the SIT and directed Punjab Police to form a new team to investigate the case. Another SIT led by senior IPS officer Ishwar Singh was formed in 2019 that filed a chargesheet in a Bathinda court, but the accused remain at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-should-explain-why-he-stalled-maur-blast-probe-randhawa-101634800885951.html

21-10-2021||Kolkata||Covid-19 cases, positivity rate shoot up after Durga puja in West Bengal||Fresh Covid-19 cases have shown an increasing trend in the past five days in West Bengal along with the positivity rate and experts are blaming it on the rampant violations of Covid-19 containment norms amid huge public gatherings during the Durga puja celebrations earlier this month. The night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am, which was lifted for 10 days during the Durga puja, will be reimposed from Thursday, a senior official of the state government said. On October 16, 443 new Covid cases were recorded but the number almost doubled over the last five days to reach 867 new cases on October 20. The puja ended on October 15. Similarly, the positivity rate rose from 1.6% on August 20 to 1.9% by September 20 and to 2.4% on October 20. “Even though the puja was held last week, the shopping spree and festivity started much earlier. During the puja days, there were huge gatherings outside pandals and people from Kolkata and its outskirts hit the streets in thousands. Covid-19 protocols were rampantly violated,” said Dr Manas Gumta, general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. Also Read: TMC says Congress emulating it by promising 40% tickets for women in UPDurga puja, the biggest festival in West Bengal, spanned over five days between October 11 and 15 this year, but the festivity started much earlier and continued till October 17. Even though barricades were put up to implement the Calcutta high court ‘s order banning the entry of visitors inside puja pandals, devotees were seen gathering unchecked in large numbers on the other side of the barricades at the pandals. In one instance, the police had to stop the entry of visitors at one pandal in Salt Lake. The pandal, which was built resembling the iconic Burj Khalifa, was a major crowd puller this year. The Eastern Railway too had to cancel around 13 pairs of trains to stop people from coming to Kolkata for pandal hopping on the puja days. “The next two weeks will be very crucial as [Covid-19] cases are expected to rise,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee set up in 2020 to advice chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters. The maximum number of Covid-19 cases were recorded on October 22 last year during the first wave of the infection when 4,157 people turned positive. October 22 was the first day of Durga Puja last year.The state registered the peak of the second wave on May 14 this year just after the assembly elections ended. The daily count had then shot up to 20,846. In both cases health experts blamed huge public gatherings without caring for safety norms. The state health department has now started to ramp up testing, which had dropped during the festive season. “The number of RT-PCR tests had dropped to almost half during the puja. We have started increasing it. The night curfew would be imposed again from Thursday. While 39,661 tests were done on October 1, the number of tests dropped to around 21,217 on October 15. On October 20 we conducted 35,673 tests and this will be increased further,” said a senior official of the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/covid19-cases-positivity-rate-shoot-up-after-durga-puja-in-west-bengal-101634795845094.html

My legal team is preparing to sue him. He has the option to withdraw his comments, failing which I will pursue legal recourse,” Mehbooba said in a tweet. Mehbooba shared a video in which Malik, who was the last governor of Jammu and Kashmir state, is purportedly seen claiming that National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mufti have got plots of land under the Roshni scheme.The Roshni Act was brought in by the Farooq Abdullah government with the aim of granting proprietary rights to occupants of state land in lieu of charges. The money thus generated was to be used for setting up hydroelectric power plants in the erstwhile state.However, the scheme was disbanded after Jammu and Kashmir High Court declared it illegal and directed the CBI to investigate the beneficiaries of the scheme.It has emerged that proprietary rights to bulk of the state land (nearly 28,500 hectares) was given in the Jammu division, while proprietary rights were transferred to the occupants in Kashmir only on six per cent (1,700 hectares) of the land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/meghalaya-guv-s-claim-about-me-being-roshni-act-beneficiary-false-mehbooba-101634779044301.html

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Jammu and Kashmir: Work on Tawi barrage to be completed in 10 months||The Jammu and Kashmir administration has approved the revised project for the construction of balance works of Tawi barrage, popularly called Artificial Lake, at an estimated cost of ₹73.34 crore. The administrative council, which met in Srinagar on Tuesday under the chairmanship of Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, approved the revised project. Farooq Khan and Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, advisers to the LG, Arun Kumar Mehta, chief secretary, J&K and Nitishwar Kumar, principal secretary to the LG attended the meeting. The proposed gated barrage on Tawi is one of the three subprojects of the prestigious artificial lake project that which was conceptualised to give a boost to regional tourism in Jammu by creating recreational activities like boating and water sports, besides enhancing the overall aesthetic look of the city. The other two subprojects, viz Tawi river development project and beautification and creation of tourist facilities are to executed by the housing and urban development department and tourism department, respectively.. The project was originally sanctioned in the financial year 2010-11 at a cost of ₹70.00 crore by dovetailing funds from various sources. However, the project was stalled on account of contractor’s inactivity for seven years leading to cancellation of awarded tender and related cost escalation. “The administrative council has sanctioned the revised project which will be completed within 10 months of allotment through e-tendering at an estimated cost of ₹131.53 crore which includes the additional grant of ₹73.34 crore and already incurred expenditure of ₹58.19 crore,” said an official spokesperson. On completion, the project will promote water recreation and sporting facilities besides boosting commercial activities around the artificial lake which in turn create employment opportunities for locals and attract tourists to Jammu city. A whopping ₹60 crore of tax payers’ money has been spent so far in the past 12 years since it was conceived in 2009. On May 31 this year, J&K administration headed by LG Manoj Sinha had again set a timeline for the completion of the protracted project. Pertinently, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had engaged the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, for detailed assessment of works already executed on Tawi Barrage Project and to give expert advice on the completion of leftover work and recommend measures required to be taken to prevent erosion of the embankments and suggest required flood protection works. Under the Jhelum Tawi Flood Recovery Project (JTFRP) a Portuguese firm — Aqualogus — was also assigned the task of conducting morphology study of Tawi so that effective measures can be taken for flood protection. Last year in February, the general administration department had issued an order sanctioning constitution of a panel to probe lapses and fixing responsibility into the poor execution of the contract. A three-member panel of officers, headed by principal secretary Rohit Kansal, was given the task to probe the matter and submit a report to the government in a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jammu-and-kashmir-work-on-tawi-barrage-to-be-completed-in-10-months-101634778564211.html

Thereafter, there was a lull followed by a low-intensity blast around 4.37pm,” said a police officer. The blast was probably of an under barrel grenade launcher (UBGL) used by the soldiers to blow up a natural cave inside the forest, he added. Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “The operation is on, but there is no further headway.” The operation in the Rajouri-Poonch belt has become the longest ever with highest number of casualties of army personnel in recent years. Sources confided to HT that the terrorists, well trained in guerilla warfare, were using the thick forest having natural caves to their advantage.

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: People dislike the kind of language Cong leaders are using, says Jai Ram||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday said the kind of language the Opposition party leaders were using during the election campaign was not liked by the people of the state.“Even the Congress workers were hurt by the words they have used against me and BJP nominee Brigadier Khushal Thakur,” the chief minister said while addressing a meeting at Sarao in the Seraj assembly segment.He said that when the Covid pandemic hit the country, the Congress only made noise but did nothing to contribute to the fight against the virus.Responding to the Congress’ allegation that the CM doesn’t step out of helicopters, Jai Ram asked if the Congress leaders used to travel in bullock carts. Taking a jibe at the CM, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri had said that he flew in the helicopter and thus didn’t know the problems being faced by the common people.Meanwhile, addressing a rally at Mandi, Agnihotri said if the Congress is voted to power in 2022, it would give a new pay scale to the employees and would also implement ‘One Rank One Pension’ for ex-servicemen. Pratibha Singh said she was campaigning in the election without her husband Virbhadra Singh for the first time.Cong always promotes dynastic politics: Satti The Congress could not provide a competent leadership to the state as it prefers nepotism over capability, former president of Himachal BJP Satpal Singh Satti said on Wednesday.He was campaigning for BJP nominee Baldev Thakur in Fatehpur constituency.Satti said the narrow thinking of the Congress can be gauged from the fact that they have sacrificed the organisation for the sake of dynastic politics at national and state levels.‘BJP fighting bypolls on development issue’Meanwhile, addressing another election meeting in Fatehpur, forest minister Rakesh Pathania said that BJP was fighting the election on development issue.“Our government has ensured equal development across the state. The people of Fatehpur must make the assembly segment Congress-free so that the pace of development can be given a boost,” said Pathania.‘Jubbal-Kotkhai saw maximum development in Cong regime’Shimla The Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segment saw unprecedented development, especially in the road infrastructure, under the leadership of Rohit Thakur during the previous Congress regime, former state chief of Himachal Congress Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu said on Wednesday.He was addressing an election meeting at Sarhana in Jubbal-Kotkhai.He said that during the Congress regime, Jubbal-Navar-Kotkhai was allocated the maximum budget for roads. He said that Rohit Thakur had always been concerned about the development of the Jubbal-Kotkhai area.“It was due to his people-centric vision that the area got maximum budget among all assembly segments,” said Sukhu.He said that in the current BJP regime, all budget was going to only two assembly segments in the Mandi district.Rohit Thakur said that roads were given priority when the Congress was in power to carry forward the development of Jubbal-Kotkhai in the horticulture area. He said during 2012-17, more than ₹250 crore was spent on constructing 60 new roads while forest clearances were also obtained for as many roads. He alleged that the BJP government stopped the work on Theog-Hatkoti road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-people-dislike-the-kind-of-language-cong-leaders-are-using-says-jai-ram-101634777604197.html

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP bypolls: ‘Creating job avenues for youth will be my priority’||Khushal Thakur, 67, is a war veteran who shot to fame during the Kargil conflict in 1999 when he was the commanding officer of 18 Grenadiers that captured Tiger Hill and Tololing, which were of strategic importance to India. During his 34-year-old military career, he participated in the Indian peacekeeping mission in Sri Lanka against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). While on a UN peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, he successfully led Operation Khukri and liberated 234 soldiers. He was awarded the Yudh Seva Medal and his unit received a record 52 gallantry awards. Post-retirement, he got involved in social work and politics. Thakur also led the agitation of farmers affected by the widening of Pathankot-Mandi national highway. He was the chairperson-cum-MD of Himachal Pradesh Ex-Servicemen Corporation, but resigned from the post when he was pitted against Congress’ nominee from Mandi. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Thakur talks about his plans, priorities and addresses the allegations of the Opposition. Edited excerpts: Which will be top-three issues on your priority list if elected?My priorities would be strengthening the road Infrastructure, ensuring functional tap water supply to every rural household and promoting tourism that will eventually generate more employment in our region. What’s your take on the allegation that BJP is trying to cash in on your army background?That’s not true. The BJP is not trying to cash in on army sentiment. It is a nationalist party that respects each and every nationalist who has served the nation. For the BJP, nation comes first. How do you respond to the allegation that you abandoned the cause of those affected by Chandigarh-Manali highway project? The Land Acquisition Act was passed by the UPA government in 2013, which was made applicable for national highways in HP in 2015. All the hardships could have been avoided had the Congress implemented the Act in time. The BJP government has formed a three-member committee headed by Mahender Singh Thakur in this regard. I am sure that the panel will soon find a solution to resolve the issue. I can assure you that I will continue to take up the matter strongly with the state and central governments so that affected people get their entitlement. Don’t you think that real issues have been put on the back-burner in this bypoll?No, I do not think so. The BJP is always working on PM Narendra Modi’s motto ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas Aur Sabka Prayas’, which aims at making India self-reliant. I feel that we all should unite to foster this dream. Common man issues are the priority and are still at the forefront of the campaign. Why should people vote for you? People should vote for the BJP as our country and state are under dynamic and honest leadership. The central government under PM Modi in the last more than seven years and Jai Ram-led state government in the last four years have delivered remarkably. Casing point being PM Modi’s idea of ‘Jaan Hai to Jahaan Hai’ has been implemented in the state, which has done exceptionally well on the Covid vaccination front.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bypolls-creating-job-avenues-for-youth-will-be-my-priority-101634775984101.html

They held parties in the state responsible for allegedly wasting ₹350 crore of public money just to quench their political thirst.The protest, which was led by AAP activist Vineet Verma, in-charge, Mohali, claimed that the Congress, SAD and the local MLA failed to keep up their promises and did not make efforts to revive this project.Verma said, “The bus stand built at a cost of ₹350 crore was said to be an air-conditioned bus stand, but surprisingly there is no power connection to his building. The company has already defaulted investors and fled as they have not paid the power bills after which Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) disconnected the power connection. The building is in a poor shape and needs attention.”“The Congress and SAD governments did not foresee before getting the Phase VIII bus stand demolished by GMADA as now Mohali has no bus stand where people can board buses,” he said.The AAP leader said, “People are forced to board buses from temporary bus stands made by transporters at their own sweet will.” Notably, the state-of-the-art Baba Banda Singh Bahadur ISBT in Mohali, an ambitious project of former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, was inaugurated in 2016 after which it ran into rough weather as the construction-maintenance-operations were deserted by the C&C Company after which investors lodged a complaint with and police and, thereafter, cases were registered against the chairman and the directors under Sections 406, 420 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in August 2018.

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh PGIMER finds AI 85% effective in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy||Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered detection of diabetic retinopathy at public health facilities may soon become a reality.Under a central government-funded pilot project, the ophthalmology department of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has found 85% efficacy in diagnosing the disease through AI, allowing minimal intervention of a physician.The disease is a diabetes complication that affects the retina in the eyes due to damage to blood vessels. Symptoms include blurred vision, colour blindness, poor vision at night and floaters, and in severe cases, blindness may also occur. As part of the pilot project, being conducted only at PGIMER in the country, three AI platforms were used to diagnose 250 patients in Panchkula and Mohali.“The motive was true diagnosis of the disease in comparison with eye specialists. Advanced Eye Centre of PGIMER tested three algorithms on the fundus (back of the eye) images, out of which one showed 85% accuracy, while others gave reasonably well results,” said Dr Vishali Gupta, professor, community ophthalmology.Currently, patients are dependent on trained opthalmologists to detect the disease by looking at the image reports of the eyes.However, retinopathy tests done through AI-based cameras can give fast medical results without the involvement of a doctor. The test will have high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy and will be more cost-effective for the patients, according to PGIMER experts.“At public healthcare facilities in India, especially in rural areas, people do not have access to retina specialists. Majority of diabetic retinopathy patients have no symptoms until very late stages, and delayed detection can lead to loss of eye sight. Fundus photography is useful for screening and monitoring the rear of the eye. Therefore, by using fundus camera, PGIMER is able to precisely detect clinical signs of the disease using AI,” said Dr Mona Duggal, associate professor, community ophthalmology, PGIMER.The doctors said once approved by the central government, the AI-powered screening will be recommended to state governments to give people access to cost-effective test at public hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pgimer-finds-ai-85-effective-in-diagnosing-diabetic-retinopathy-101634764347222.html

21-10-2021||Lucknow||‘No justice for poor while…’: Priyanka Gandhi attacks UP’s Yogi Adityanath govt||AGRA: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday launched a bitter attack on Uttar Pradesh’s Bharatiya Janata Party government over the death of the 31-year-old Dalit sanitation worker in police custody after his arrest on charges of theft, saying there was no justice for the poor, Dalits and farmers in UP while sons of ministers are free to commit crimes.Priyanka Gandhi, who was earlier in the day stopped from proceeding towards Agra, reached Arun Kumar’s house in Agra’s Loha Mandi area town at about 11pm on Wednesday. She interacted with Arun Kumar’s wife and mother, and later with others in the locality where she spent nearly an hour.The attack on chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s government came soon after.“There seems to be no justice in the state….Illiterate family members of Arun Valmiki said they were asked to sign a document…. Their house was ransacked by the police, beds were damaged, clothes were thrown away,” she told reporters after meeting the sanitation worker who belonged to the Valmiki community.“I’ve met Arun’s family members. His wife told me that her husband was beaten in front of her... He was given electric shocks,” said Priyanka Gandhi who left Lucknow for Agra at 3pm but was stopped at the Lucknow-Agra Expressway on the grounds that the Agra administration has requested political leaders to refrain from visiting the area. Following her release, she left for Agra with Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior party leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam.“What kind of nation are we becoming? We are quiet on injustice to the poor, the government is silent. A man is kept in custody and tortured, his family is harassed for four days. The family made it clear that they want justice and will not remain silent after receiving ₹10 lakh compensation given by the state government,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in Agra.The Congress leader said she will reach out to the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan “to give Arun Valmiki’s family compensation” since the deceased’s family has links with Bharatpur also.The deceased’s family earlier demanded a compensation of ₹1 crore, a government job and action against the policemen concerned.According to the Agra Police, Arun Kumar died in police custody after his health suddenly deteriorated during interrogation late on Tuesday. He was arrested on charges of stealing ₹25 lakh from maal khana (storage room where confiscated items are kept) of Jagdishpura police station in Agra on Sunday.“Kumar was picked up from the Tajganj area on Tuesday and during interrogation, he admitted to his involvement in the theft and said that the stolen cash was kept in his house. A police team recovered ₹15 lakh cash from his house. However, during the recovery, he suddenly fell ill and was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared ‘brought dead’ by doctors,” Muniraj G, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Agra, said.Earlier in the day, BJP leader and UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh hit out at Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, alleging that Congress leaders were hatching conspiracy to destabilise law and order in the state. “Why doesn’t Priyanka speak out about that family in Hanumangarh, Rajasthan which is still waiting for justice? There a Dalit youth was beaten to death and in Chhattisgarh devotees were run over under a jeep. Both are Congress ruled states but Priyanka has never spoken on them. Why these dual standards,” he asked, asserting that the UP government suspended the police personnel responsible for the Dalit’ mans death. “Under Yogi government it is clear that law doesn’t discriminate against people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-justice-for-poor-while-priyanka-gandhi-s-bitter-attack-on-up-s-yogi-govt-101634761703049.html

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder hand in glove with BJP, backstabbed Cong: Randhawa, Pargat||Chandigarh A day after former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh unveiled his plans to launch his own political party, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and cabinet minister Pargat Singh on Wednesday accused him of being “hand in glove” with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and backstabbing the Congress. Calling the two-time former chief minister an “opportunist”, Randhawa said that Capt Amarinder always had his and his family and friends’ interests in mind. “Captain Saab has betrayed the (Gandhi) family that gave various positions and always honoured him. Had the Congress not given its support, he would not have remained the chief minister of Punjab for nine-and-a-half years. Now he calls it the worst party,” he said in a statement, accusing him of betraying Punjab. Randhawa, who also hurled personal accusations at the former CM, blamed him for the Centre’s unilateral move to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) from 15 km to 50 km, from the border. “He (Amarinder) says Punjab is a border state. I want to remind Capt Saab that if it is a border state then why were tiffin bombs and drones coming? Why smuggling of arms and drugs could not be stopped?” he asked. The deputy CM said: “Punjab does not fear Pakistan or China. If the state faces any threat today, it is from Amarinder”. He was accompanied by Amarinder’s one-time political secretary Capt Sandeep Sandhu. The deputy CM’s stinging attack came a few hours after Capt Amarinder announced his plans to launch a new party and hinted at a possible pre-poll pact with the BJP if the farmers’ issue was resolved. Randhawa was among the four ministers who had rebelled against Amarinder after the state government suffered a legal setback in the Kotkapura police firing case six months ago. Amarinder resigned as the chief minister last month after a bitter tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu and rebellion by several ministers and MLAs in which the Congress leadership sided with his detractors. The party then appointed Charanjit Singh Channi, one of the four rebel ministers, as the next chief minister. Asked about Sidhu’s differences with Channi, Randhawa termed it as an internal democracy. “In Congress, we do not stop anyone from voicing his views. We are not like the BJP and the AAP where you are not allowed to speak,” he said. Training his guns at the former chief minister, cabinet minister Pargat Singh also said that Capt Amarinder was in league with the BJP for the past more than two-and-a-half years. “I have been saying this since then, but many in the party did not believe me at that time. The truth is now coming out,” said the minister, who is a confidant of Sidhu. BJP hits back at RandhawaThe Punjab BJP hit back at Sukhjinder Randhawa for his statement that Punjab has no threat from Pakistan and China. In statement, party general secretary Subhash Sharma said Randhawa, was taking pro-Pakistan stand on the lines of Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. “Randhawa is holding a sensitive portfolio of home minister of a border state and by stating that state don’t have any threat from Pakistan, he has overlooked all misdeeds of our notorious neighbour,” said Sharma. How can Randhawa forget how Pakistan is pumping drugs and ammunition into Punjab and was using drones to drop at the borders, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-hand-in-glove-with-bjp-backstabbed-cong-randhawa-pargat-101634760204550.html

Today’s gathering is an important occasion in this direction,” he said.According to Young, faiths have a real voice to bring to this process.“We need you to lift up us to do the right thing. Hold us accountable when we fall short. We need your voices, we need your communities. We need your work to preserve our national natural heritage and God’s creation,” Young said.“As people of faith and conscience, we understand that the climate crisis is a spiritual crisis and that our faiths call us to prioritise the health and well-being of those who are most vulnerable,” said Reverend Susan Hendershot, president of Interfaith Power and Light.“Climate disasters and pollution are bringing death and destruction to communities in the US and globally. It is our sacred calling to act.

21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Fact-finding report disproves spurious seeds behind pink bollworm infestation in Punjab||The agriculture department has ruled out any role of spurious BT cotton seeds or substandard insecticides behind the widespread infestation of pink bollworm pest on the cotton crop in the south Malwa districts.In a fact-finding report submitted to the state government last weekend, the department has squarely blamed the cotton ginning factories and poor farm practices behind the worst ever pink bollworm pest attack in Punjab.Agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha confirmed receiving the report but declined to share its content.“The detailed report will be tabled in a cabinet meeting scheduled to be held later this week for compensation to affected cotton growers,” said the minister.Officials said Bathinda and Mansa are the worst-hit districts where 80% area under cotton crop has suffered 76-100% damage.Bathinda has the largest area of 96,000 hectares of Punjab under the cash crop whereas cotton was sown on 65,000 hectares in Mansa.BKU (Ekta Ughrahan) has been blaming the poor quality of seeds and insecticides for the pest infestation.BKU (Ekta Ughrahan), which is demanding a compensation of ₹60,000 per acre, ended the dharna outside finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s residence after 15 days on Tuesday and decided to resume the protest outside the Bathinda district administrative complex from October 25. Bathinda chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said there was no evidence of spurious BT cotton seeds sold to farmers in the region.Field inspections found that cotton ginning units were responsible for breaching safety protocols while processing raw cotton bought from other states, he added.Bathinda has 21 units whereas in Mansa there 14 units engaged in ginning.“These factories were bringing raw cotton from different states, including from the regions experiencing pink bollworm attack for over six years. As fumigation of factories was not conducted periodically, the pest population grew alarmingly in Bathinda and Mansa in the last four years,” said Singh.An agriculture scientist said pink bollworm is a monophagous pest which survives only on cotton plants. As farmers failed to follow guidelines of cotton crop residue management, it gave ample space for the pest to survive.Pink bollworm attack on BT cotton is nothing new and it was common in other states of Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra, said the expert.“It is a baseless claim that spurious seeds caused the infestation. The deadly pest was in the farm ecosystem of southern Punjab since 2018 when it was detected for the first time in Punjab at Bathinda’s Jodhpur Romana village. Field analysis shows that like ginning units, farmers also did not pay much attention to the repeated advisories against pink bollworm threat in the last three years. Overconfident farmers failed to notice infestation at the initial levels and the pest attack spread even in pockets of Sangrur and Muktsar districts as well,” said an official engaged in field surveillance.Cotton prices cross ₹8,000 markOwing to high demand in the market and suspected low productivity this kharif season, private players are paying up to ₹8,300 per quintal, the highest price ever, against the MSP of ₹5,925.Out of seven cotton-growing districts, the rate of raw cotton has crossed ₹8,000 mark in mandis of six districts. Till Wednesday, 5 lakh quintal cotton was purchased at various centres of the semi-arid districts of the state.Fazilka is leading with 1.78 lakh quintals, followed by Mansa 1.08 lakh quintals, Bathinda and Mansa 98,000 each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/factfinding-report-disproves-spurious-seeds-behind-pink-bollworm-infestation-in-punjab-101634759422934.html
21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab sets up three-member SIT to probe Singhu border lynching||The Punjab government on Wednesday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) led by ADGP, Bureau of Investigation, Varinder Kumar to probe if Tarn Taran resident Lakhbir Singh, who was brutally murdered by Nihangs at a farmer agitation site at Singhu border was allured by some persons. The SIT was constituted by acting director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota on the directions of deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is also the state home minister. DIG, Ferozepur range, Inderbir Singh and Tarn Taran SSP Harvinder Singh Virk are members of the SIT. As per the information, Raj Kaur, sister of Lakhbir, alleged that her brother was allured by some persons and taken to Singhu where he was murdered by some Nihang Sikhs on October 15 for alleged sacrilege.ADGP-cum-Director Bureau of Investigation Varinder Kumar may co-opt any other police officers posted in the state for the inquiry as per needs and requirements, reads the order, adding that he would also be at liberty to obtain the support of any other wing/unit of Punjab Police. After pictures of Nihang Baba Aman Singh meeting Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar went viral, Randhawa had signalled towards a deep-rooted conspiracy as how Lakhbir, who is said to be a drug addict, managed to reach Singhu. Randhawa has called the killing a possible conspiracy to defame the farmers’ agitation. On October 15, the body of Lakhbir, 35,, a Dalit farm labourer from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district, was found tied to a police barricade near the Singhu farm protest site on the outskirts of the national capital with his left hand and right foot chopped off. Nihangs, who claimed responsibility of killing Lakhbir, said he was trying to tear saroop of Guru Granth Sahib. Three Nihangs have surrendered in the case so far in the case registered by Sonepat police. Sikh activists give ₹1 lakh aid to Lakhbir’s kin AMRITSAR: Sikh activists gave a monetary aid of ₹1 lakh to the wife and daughters of Lakhbir Singh, citing that they (the family) were also victimized by him.Sikh and social activist Gangveer Singh Rathore and Sunny Singh Khalsa said the assistance has been extended with the cooperation of other members of Sikh community.Lakhbir’s brother-in-law Sukhchain Singh said: “Lakhbir has paid the price of what he had done. If he had committed the sacrilege, he also got the punishment. The question is how he reached the Singhu border? How was he taken to the protest site? The sacrilege has pained us. This act cannot be tolerated. If he is guilty, we stand with the Panth,” they said. Lakhbir’s wife and three daughters have been living at her parental house at Ladhewal village in Amritsar for last five years. Her two-year son died of illness during this period. Lakhbir met his wife and daughters only once during this period, and that too on the cremation of his son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sets-up-three-member-sit-to-probe-singhu-border-lynching-101634759243027.html

It will actually divide the votes of Congress’ rivals in the state. Channi has begun well and his performance will decide the showing of the party,” the former Uttarakhand chief minister said, questioning the former chief minister’s secular credentials. Rawat said that Amarinder was seen as a symbol of “sarvdharm sambhav” and was connected to Congress’ traditions for a long time but he wanted to go (to the BJP), he should. “Who can forgive the BJP that has kept farmers at the borders for 10 months? Can Punjab forgive them for the manner in which farmers’ agitation has been dealt with?” he told reporters after meeting former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. The AICC general secretary, who was made in-charge of Punjab a year ago, also requested the party leadership to relieve him of the responsibility to allow him to focus on his home state of Uttarakhand for next few months. “Things are getting complex. As the polls are approaching, I will have to devote time to both places (Uttarakhand and Punjab),” the Congress leader said in a Facebook post, pointing out that he was torn between his “janmabhoomi” and “karmabhoomi”.

21-10-2021||Lucknow||Bulandshahr farmer’s passion for dancing earns him fame||Lucknow: Love for dancing has catapulted a young farmer from a village in Bulandshahr district to fame. After recently being featured in a popular dance reality show, Vineet Kumar aka ‘Khomcha (a large basket woven with twigs)’ has turned into a local sensation. “ I like to be happy, have fun and dance. I try to incorporate dance in everything I do,” says Vineet with his trademark broad smile as he sits in his farm which is also his dance studio. With very little training in professional dancing, Vineet incorporates different dance styles in his performances. “I watch dance moves and practice them while working in my fields,” he says. For a 22-year-old who is the only brother of seven sisters belonging to a family of cultivators in debt, pursuing the passion of dancing is as hard as it can get. With no support from the family and only sniggers from villagers, Vineet took a leap of faith into dancing almost five years ago after being rusticated from his school. “I was rusticated from school after failing in class 11 twice. Everybody around me was angry but I was happy because I could devote my time to farming and practicing dancing,” he says. Vineet devoted himself to farming to support the family and continued dancing to keep ‘head in the right place.’ “Dancing helped me to get over the difficulties in life and keep a positive outlook about the situation I was in. Dancing takes me to a place where everything is happy and looks in control,” he says. The dance practice which he does using a pair of small rechargeable speakers helped Vineet get some popularity among the locals but getting a call from a popular dance reality show was his biggest success. “I went to Delhi and then to Mumbai where I stayed for over a month and danced in the reality show. It was certainly the happiest period of my life till date,” says Vineet who returned to his village over a month ago. “I was evicted after a few rounds but I learnt a lot. I will continue working on my dance because it has now become a part of me.” The dance reality show has certainly changed his life. The teachers at the school from where he was rusticated are now calling him for a felicitation, the villagers who made fun of him now trail him for a selfie. Firoz Khan, an assitant teacher at a government primary school, has also come forward to support Vineet chase his passion. Despite this jump in popularity Vineet still considers himself a farmer who cannot leave his village behind and people who laughed at him ashis biggest motivators. “People who mock me are my biggest promotors,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bulandshahr-farmer-s-passion-for-dancing-earns-him-fame-101634757863764.html
21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypolls: Ajay, Abhay Chautala hit out at each other||Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) national president Ajay Singh Chautala and his estranged younger brother Abhay Singh Chautala, who is seeking a fourth straight term on the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) ticket slammed each other as campaigning turned fierce for the Ellenabad bypoll, which is scheduled for October 30.This is for the first time that Ajay has started election canvassing against Abhay after forming JJP after the festering family feud resulted in vertical split of INLD in 2018. In the 2019 assembly elections, Ajay had not campaigned against Abhay.While campaigning at a village in Ellenabad constituency, Ajay slammed Abhay for resigning from the Haryana assembly and forcing people to go for bypoll in just two years.“Abhay resigned from the Haryana assembly amid the farmers’ protests against the Centre’s three farm laws with an aim to become the tallest leader of farmers. He had claimed that he will not enter the Vidhan Sabha until the farm laws are repealed. Has that happened? Abhay forced people to go for elections in just two years,” he said.“In the 2019 assembly elections, we (Ajay’s family) did not campaign against him because senior Chautala saab asked the voters to elect Abhay. Now, Abhay has forced the 86-year-old leader (father OP Chautala) to board a specially designed chariot and seek votes,” he added.“Abhay had claimed that he will not campaign in the bypolls but now three generations of his family (Abhay) are visiting door-to-door to seek votes,” the JJP chief added.Making a direct attack on Abhay, Ajay said he had given their parent party (INLD) to his younger brother, 20 MLAs with a voting percentage of 27%.“In the 2019 elections, the INLD had reduced to one MLA with nearly 1.8% vote share and this happened due to the ego of one man (Abhay). If he loses, people will say ‘ek thi INLD’. The voters of Haryana had given 10 seats with 17% vote share in 2019 assembly polls to a young boy (Dushyant Chautala), who had formed a party nearly a year ago and is working hard to fulfil his promises being listed in the manifesto,” Ajay added.Ajay’s uncle Rajnit Singh, who is jails and power minister of Haryana and his cousin Aditya Devi Lal, BJP’s Sirsa district chief, are campaigning against Abhay in the Ellenabad bypolls.Meanwhile, countering the allegations of JJP chief and his elder brother Ajay, INLD nominee Abhay said he had resigned from the state assembly after hearing the voice of farmers.“Some people (referring to Ajay) who were seeking resignation of Gopal Kanda (the then Haryana minister) in connection with an air hostess’ suicide case, are canvassing for his brother (BJP nominee Gobind Kanda) who is facing many serious charges,” he added.“The BJP and Congress did not have candidates and brought parachute nominees into the fray. This battle is being fought by farmers against the BJP and Congress, who were behind in bringing these three laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypolls-ajay-abhay-chautala-hit-out-at-each-other-101634757683721.html
21-10-2021||Mumbai||SC okays Maharashtra plan for ₹25 crore lying in court registry for years||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday approved a plan submitted by the Maharashtra government to provide a one-time financial assistance of ₹10,000 to every child in the state who lost both or either parents due to Covid-19 to help meet their educational expenses such as school fee, hostel fee and purchase of educational material.The plan came in response to a court order of September 13 when the state government was informed about ₹25 crore lying with the Supreme Court registry. The money was to be returned to the state government under a December 2016 order on the condition that it must be utilised for “issues of juvenile justice”.In Maharashtra, 20,407 children lost one of their parents due to Covid-19 since April 2020; another 635 lost both parents. The court wanted the state government to come out with a plan to utilise the amount for the benefit of Covid-affected children.For the state, advocate Sachin Patil submitted an affidavit by principal secretary, women and child development indicating three options. Of them, the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna zeroed in on the option that spoke about transferring ₹25.53 crore into the Juvenile Justice Fund that will give the money to affected children to meet their educational expenses such as school fees, hostel fees and educational material and equipment.“This option will be beneficial from all perspectives,” the bench said, noting that the district task force will be given the responsibility to distribute the amount after scrutinising need-based applications, following which a report will be submitted to the women and child development commissioner at Pune.Satisfied with the state’s plan, the bench directed the release of the money to the Juvenile Justice Fund.In December 2016, the Supreme Court held a medical college in the state at fault for admitting students in violation of standards prescribed by the then Medical Council of India. The court had directed the Maharashtra government to deposit ₹20 crore with the Court and recover the same from the defaulting medical college. This amount, over a period of time swelled with interest to ₹25.53 crore.Patil told the Court that this order should not come in the way of the state government to recover the ₹20 crore amount from the erring college. The bench accordingly stated in its order, “This order shall not, in any manner, affect the recovery of an amount of ₹20 crore from the defaulting institution as already directed by us”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-okays-maharashtra-plan-for-rs-25-crore-lying-in-court-registry-for-years-101634757502883.html
21-10-2021||Chandigarh||SAD to support INLD’s Abhay Chautala in Ellenabad bypolls: Chandumajra||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) plans to support Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) nominee Abhay Singh Chatuala in the Ellenabad bypolls.The SAD leadership has decided to support Abhay as this election is being contested on the farmer’s issue, said party’s senior vice-president Prem Singh Chandumajra in an interaction with the media in Kurukshetra.“Since Abhay had resigned in support of the farmers’ agitation and SAD is known to be a pro-farmer party, we have decided to support the INLD candidate in the bypols,” he said.The Akali leader said directions have been issued to the party workers from Haryana to join the campaign and ensure Chatuala’s victory with a huge margin.Chandumajra slammed the Opposition parties, especially the Congress, for fielding their candidate in the bypolls saying, “This election is a fight between pro-farmers and anti-farmers. Other parties that claimed to be pro-farmer should not have fielded their candidates against Abhay as he had sacrificed his legislature for the farmers and his win will be considered a victory of the protesting farmers.Ellenabad was earlier considered INLD’s pocket borough but this election has become a matter of prestige for Abhhay, who is locked in a triangular contest and facing a tough challenge from Congress’ Pawan Beniwal and the ruling BJP-JJP alliance’s Gobind Kanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-to-support-inld-s-abhay-chautala-in-ellenabad-bypolls-chandumajra-101634757145779.html
21-10-2021||Chandigarh||Congress leaders hit campaign trail for Ellenabad bypolls||Haryana Congress leaders hit the campaign trail in favour of party nominee Pawan Beniwal for the Ellenabad bypolls on Wednesday.Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, state Congress chief Kumari Selja, party’s state affairs in-charge Vivek Bansal and Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry visited many villages seeking votes for Beniwal, who is pitted against INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala and BJP’s Gobind Kanda.Former Congress legislature party leader and Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry slammed the state government over inflation, unemployment, rise in crime and farmers’ issues.“Farmers are lining up every day since early morning to get DAP amid mustard cultivation. The state and Union governments have failed on all fronts. We are hoping that Congress’ Beniwal will defeat his opponents,” she added.Hooda said Abhay had resigned to get political mileage and everyone knows that INLD has always helped the BJP.“We had brought a ‘no-confidence’ motion against the BJP-JJP government in the Haryana assembly. Instead of standing against the coalition government, Chautala resigned to help them .The Haryana government has failed to procure bajra and paddy and farmers are paying huge prices for their policies,” he said.“The Congress has been fighting for the common man. The BJP government has failed to end the deadlock with the protesting farmers over the three farm laws,” he added.Selja leads the campaignSelja, who is leading Congress’s campaign in Ellenabad, slammed the BJP-JJP government over Centre’s three farm laws, paper leak issue and procurement issues.“People of Haryana are unsatisfied with the rule of the current government. They want to get rid of the government which has been crushing the voice of farmers and labourers. They are further annoyed over cases of paper leak. INLD’s lone MLA Chautala had resigned to get political benefit but is struggling in the bypolls,” she added.As per experts, the Ellenabad election is crucial for Selja as this constituency comes under Sirsa parliamentary seat and she got elected twice from here.Her father Chaudhary Dalbir Singh also represented the parliamentary seat and Selja is making efforts to regain her grounds in Sirsa.“There was a huge role of Selja behind Beniwal’s entry into the Congress, besides finalising his name as party nominee for the Ellenabad bypolls. After former Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar quit the party, Selja has once again made attempts to make inroads to Sirsa constituency,” said Anant Ram, a retired political science professor of the Bhiwani government college.“Most leaders of Sirsa parliamentary seat joined the Congress in the presence of Selja in the last two years, which underlines her importance in district. The result of the bypolls are crucial for Selja and Beniwal as former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had showed his strength by ensuring the win of Indu Raj Narwal in the Baroda bypolls which were held last year,” the retired professor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-leaders-hit-campaign-trail-for-ellenabad-bypolls-101634757022875.html

21-10-2021||Kolkata||Nurse arrested for Kolkata top exec Subir Chaki murder, her family detained: Cop||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police probing the murder of Subir Chaki, 61, managing director of Kilburn Engineering, and his driver Rabin Mondal, 65, arrested a woman on Wednesday evening and detained three members of her family.The woman was identified by the police as a nurse, Mithu Haldar. She was picked up from the Diamond Harbour area of South 24 Parganas district, a police officer said on condition of anonymity. The officer said her elder son Vicky, who is suspected to have posed as a prospective buyer for Subir Chaki’s ancestral house, is missing.There has, however, been no formal statement by the Kolkata police on the arrest.Her husband Subhas Haldar, younger son Bilash and brother Tarun Haldar have been detained.Subhas Haldar was first picked up for questioning from south Kolkata on Tuesday night. South 24 Parganas district police officers said the nurse, Mithu Haldar, was arrested last year also on a complaint by her husband Subhas Haldar who alleged she tried to kill him. She was later released on bail.Subir Chaki had been trying to sell the three-storey building for the last six years and many prospective buyers came to see the property in the past. Local residents told the police that the property was valued at around ₹2 crore, given its size and prime location. Chaki, who lived in New Town on the eastern outskirts of the city with his wife, mother and mother-in-law, also owned a posh south Kolkata condominium. Interrogation of the suspects and security camera footage indicated that Vicky committed the crime with two associates, who are also missing.“Vicky contacted Subir Chaki around 10 months ago after seeing an advertisement for the sale of the property. Vicky came posing as a buyer and hatched a plan to rob Chaki. He was waiting for an opportunity. He called up Chaki again a few days ago but posing as another buyer. It seems Chaki was killed because he recognised Vicky when he arrived on Sunday. Chaki’s purse and ring were missing when his body was found. We are trying to find out what else was robbed,” said an officer. Pampa Gayen, who rented out her house to Mithu Haldar and her family in Diamond Harbour’s Kopathat area, told local media that Mithu was taken to Lalbazar police headquarters in Kolkata on Wednesday afternoon after being grilled for hours.“After Mithu returned home on Sunday night, I found her washing some blood-stained clothes in the common courtyard. When I asked her about the blood, she said her son got drunk and fell on the road while taking part in the immersion of a Durga idol. I had no reason to be suspicious,” said Pampa Gayen.Mithu Haldar’s brother and sons live in another rented house in Diamond Harbour. “The police also seized some documents and a pendrive while searching the house. We do not know anything about the contents,” she added.The twin murders took place on Sunday evening shortly after Subir Chaki went to his ancestral house located at Kankulia Road in Kolkata’s Gariahat area. Chaki’s body was found on the first floor the following morning; his driver’s body was on the second floor. Both bore multiple stab injuries. Chaki, who studied at Kolkata’s St Xavier’s School, IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta, worked for well-known companies all his life. His son and daughter live in London and Bengaluru respectively. Local residents told officers of the detective department of the city police that they heard several voices, including that of a woman, from the house on Sunday evening. In the past, Chaki sent Mondal to open the premises when prospective buyers came to see the property. The police suspect that Chaki may have been led to believe that he was close to sealing a deal and hence came to the house on Sunday. Police found that on the way he bought sweets from a popular shop in Gariahat.Subir Chaki’s family told the police that he called them on Sunday evening and spoke about some repair work required at the house. His phone was switched off around 7 pm, around the same time that his driver, Rabin Mondal’s phone was also turned off. Since both devices were missing, police examined their call records which helped them crack the case.A police sniffer dog on Tuesday led the officers to the Ballygunge railway station less than a kilometre away. The dog went to a platform after crossing the over-bridge. This led the officers to suspect that someone who came to the house walked down to the station to board a train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/nurse-arrested-for-kolkata-top-exec-subir-chaki-murder-her-family-detained-cop-101634748203509.html

21-10-2021||World||FATF expresses concerns about terrorist financing risk environment in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Thursday expressed its concerns about the money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment in Afghanistan due to the recent events in the country, in reference to the Taliban’s ascension to power.Further, the FATF also reiterated the resolutions adopted by the United Nations security council (UNSC) regarding the situation in Afghanistan and mentioned that the country’s territory should not be used to threaten or attack any other country.“The FATF affirms recent UN Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan. In particular, UNSCR 2593 (2021) demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts,” the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog said in a statement.“The FATF calls on all jurisdictions' competent authorities to provide advice and facilitate information sharing with their private sectors on assessing and mitigating any emerging ML/TF risks identified, in accordance with the risk-based approach,” it further said.Meanwhile, the watchdog also mentioned that non-profit organisations working in the war-torn country and other actors providing humanitarian assistance should be ensured of delivering the aid needed in the region “without delay, disruption or discouragement.”“The FATF calls on all jurisdictions to protect NPOs from being misused for terrorist financing,” it said. The recommendations by the FATF to ensure this included conducting sustained and targeted outreach that were consistent with their recommendations, “while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.”Mentioning that it would “closely monitor” the changes in money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Afghanistan, the FATF also said that it would consider all options to “help promote security, safety and the integrity of the global financial system.”On Thursday, the FATF also retained Pakistan in its grey list. “Pakistan has largely addressed 30 out of the 34 items, most recent action plan which was in June this year focused on money laundering,” FATF president Marcus Pleyer said. Further, the body also placed Turkey under surveillance for shortcomings in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-expresses-concerns-about-terrorist-financing-risk-environment-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101634837208692.html
21-10-2021||World||US puts India, 10 others on list of ‘countries of concern’ on climate||The United States has categorised India as a ‘country of concern’ along with 10 others that in the assessment of the American intelligence community will bear the brunt of global warming that could include intensifying and more frequent heat waves and droughts and water and power scarcity.The other countries on the list are Afghanistan, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, Pakistan, Nicaragua, Colombia, Myanmar and North Korea.The first-ever National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on climate was put together by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversee 16 intelligence agencies. The report, which was released on Thursday, has also named two regions of concern, countries on the African continent.“The IC (Intelligence Community) identified 11 countries and two regions of concern from the threat from climate change,” the report said, adding, “Building resilience in these countries and region would probably be especially helpful in mitigating future risks to US interests.”The report said the intelligence community assessed that these countries are likely to face “warming temperatures, more extreme weather, and disruption to ocean patterns that will threaten their energy, food, water, and health security”. Intensifying and more frequent heat waves and droughts will in turn “create water supply volatility and probably strain their electric utility operations, while growing economies and populations will increase electricity demands to handle rising temperatures”.More frequent and intense cyclones are likely to contaminate water sources and increase vector populations and the diseases they transmit in several of the 11 countries, the report said. It went on to say that projection models suggest that the incidence of dengue will probably increase in India, Afghanistan, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, and Pakistan.These 11 countries including India will “lack” the financial resources or governance capacity to adapt to climate change effects, the report said, which, will heighten the “risk of instability-induced migration and displacement flows” including to the US southern border and raise their already high level of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance.The US intelligence community also names other countries that are “comparatively more exposed and have fewer resources to adapt to climate change effects”. These countries are China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.In a separate fact-sheet, the White House said, “Climate change will increasingly exacerbate a number of risks to US national security interests, from physical impacts that could cascade into security challenges, to how countries respond to the climate challenge. While the IC judges that all of these risks will increase and that no country will be spared from challenges directly related to climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-puts-india-10-others-on-list-of-countries-of-concern-on-climate-101634837490679.html
21-10-2021||World||FATF keeps Imran Khan’s Pakistan in grey list, says now prosecute terror leaders||NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Thursday retained Pakistan in its grey list and urged the country to do more to investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups involved in terror financing.FATF president Marcus Pleyer said after a three-day plenary meeting of the multilateral watchdog that Jordan, Mali and Turkey have been added to the list of countries under increased monitoring or grey list because of serious issues in their regimes to counter money laundering and terror financing. Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, FATF also expressed “concern about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment” in the war-torn country. “Pakistan remains under increased monitoring,” Pleyer told an online news briefing.“Pakistan has taken a number of important steps but needs to further demonstrate that investigations and prosecutions are being pursued against the senior leadership of UN-designated terror groups,” he said.Pakistan was added to the grey list in mid-2018 and given a 27-point action plan by FATF to control money laundering and terror financing. In June this year, FATF asked Pakistan to implement another seven-point action plan to address serious deficiencies related to money laundering.Pleyer said Pakistan “addressed or largely addressed” 30 out of the 34 items in the two action plans. He said the country made “good progress” on the 2021 action plan by tackling four out of the seven items, including checks on businesses and enacting legislative amendments to ensure international cooperation. But Pleyer insisted Pakistan must deliver on the sole remaining item in the 2018 action plan by demonstrating that its investigations and prosecutions are targeting senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated groups. He brushed aside several questions from Pakistani journalists that FATF’s actions were political in nature and said that the watchdog made all decisions within a technical framework following voting by the organisation’s members. FATF said in a statement that Pakistan made significant progress in addressing its “strategic counter-terrorist financing-related deficiencies”. The statement added: “Pakistan should continue to work to address its other strategically important AML/CFT deficiencies, namely by: (1) providing evidence that it actively seeks to enhance the impact of sanctions beyond its jurisdiction by nominating additional individuals and entities for designation at the UN; and (2) demonstrating an increase in ML investigations and prosecutions and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with Pakistan’s risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze, and confiscate assets.”In a separate statement on Afghanistan, FATF said the watchdog, “as the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, expresses its concern about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment in the country”.FATF affirmed the UN Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan, especially resolution 2593 which “demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts”.The statement on Afghanistan added, “The FATF calls on all jurisdictions’ competent authorities to provide advice and facilitate information sharing with their private sectors on assessing and mitigating any emerging ML/TF risks identified, in accordance with the risk-based approach.”At the same time, FATF reiterated the “utmost importance of ensuring non-profit organisations (NPOs) and all other humanitarian actors can provide the vital humanitarian assistance needed in the region and elsewhere, without delay, disruption or discouragement. The FATF calls on all jurisdictions to protect NPOs from being misused for terrorist financing.” The FATF, together with its affiliates APG, EAG and the Global Network, will “closely monitor the situation, including any changes to money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Afghanistan”, and consider all options to help promote security, safety and the integrity of the global financial system.At its last virtual plenary meeting in June, the watchdog had retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to adequately investigate and prosecute leaders of UN-designated terrorist groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-keeps-imran-khan-s-pakistan-in-grey-list-says-now-prosecute-terror-leaders-101634837189330.html

Putting to rest the initial police reports that the car was on autopilot, the US National Transportation Safety Board said in an investigative update that a man was behind the wheel and was applying the accelerator in the moments leading up to the fatal crash.First responders had found one man in the front passenger seat and another man in the back seat. But the preliminary findings of the investigation suggest that both the driver and the passenger were in the front seats when the Tesla car hit a drainage culvert, a raised manhole and a tree, and burst into flames.The NTSB said the damage to the steering wheel was due to an impact as the car had reached a speed of 67 miles (107.83 kilometres) per hour before crashing into the tree. Though the agency said the crash is still under investigation, the preliminary findings effectively clear Tesla’s controversial Autopilot system which has been involved in dozens of other crashes.“The NTSB continues to collect data to analyze the crash dynamics, postmortem toxicology test results, seat belt use, occupant egress, and electric vehicle fires,” the agency said.The fatal trip began from the Tesla owner’s residence which was near the end of a cul-de-sac. Investigators analysed the footage from the owner's home security camera which showed the man entering the driver’s seat and the passenger riding the shotgun. The report hasn’t clarified how the driver unbuckled the seat belt and changed seating positions.The road did not have lines to define the travel lanes and no speed limit signs were posted in the crash area, even though the maximum speed limit for the road was 30 mph, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-crash-probe-finds-driver-behind-wheel-how-he-changed-seats-still-unclear-101634835810026.html

The global financial watchdog said that Pakistan addressed or largely addressed 30 of the 34 action plan items.“Pakistan remains under increased monitoring (grey list). The Pakistan government has two concurrent action plans, with a total of 34 action plan items. It has now addressed or largely addressed 30 of the items,” Dr Marcus Pleyer, the FATF president, said.Pakistan has been asked by FATF to demonstrate ‘an increase in MB investigations and prosecutions and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with its risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze, and confiscate assets.’Pakistan was placed on Paris-based FATF's grey list for gaps in its counter-terror financing and anti-money laundering regimes in June 2018. The FATF gave Pakistan three months in June this year to fulfil the remaining conditions by October.The FATF asked Pakistan to address issues regarding the investigation and prosecution of senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups. FATF’s Pleyer however noted that the country largely addressed ‘26 out of 27 items on the action plan it first committed to in June 2018.’The FATF also placed Turkey under surveillance and said there are serious offences remaining regarding the nation’s control over financial operations, news agency AFP reported. On the Afghanistan issue, the FATF said that it will continue to monitor closely any changes to money laundering and terrorist financing risks in the war-torn nation.It also stressed that the Afghan territory must not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts.The FATF congratulated Mauritius and Botswana after they were removed from the ‘grey list’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-remains-on-grey-list-of-fatf-101634834252914.html
21-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Justin Trudeau launches vaccination certificate for jabbed Canadians||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has launched a standardised proof of vaccination certificate that will be available to jabbed Canadians as a vaccine passport for international travel.The certificate is being backed by the national government but will be issued by Canadian provinces and territories using a standardised format which includes a QR code to access the individuals’ vaccination status. Some provinces and territories, like Ontario, have already started issuing the certificate since last week.A release from the prime minister’s office said that Ottawa is “also engaging with international partners to obtain recognition and acceptance abroad, so the proof can also be used to facilitate travel around the world”. Addressing the media in Ottawa along with Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland, Justin Trudeau said they were “very confident” this certificate “is going to be accepted at destinations worldwide as proof of vaccination”.The Justin Trudeau-led government also noted that for Canadians travelling, it was “a reliable and secure way to demonstrate their Covid-19 vaccination history, both in Canada and abroad.”In fact, the vaccine passport will also be required for travelling domestically by air as a new mandate comes into effect on October 30. Proof of vaccination will be required for all air passengers flying on domestic or international flights departing from airports in Canada, rail passengers on certain trains like VIA Rail, and marine passengers on non-essential passenger vessels, such as cruise ships, on voyages of 24 hours or more.Approximately 83% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated and can register to access the digital document.It is also intended to ease returning to the country for Canadians abroad, as it can be used with the ArriveCan app which is required when they arrive at Canadian airports.The government also said that privacy was a “key priority” and the data contained within the document “only includes the minimum information needed to determine whether a traveller meets their entry and public health requirements”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-justin-trudeau-launches-vaccination-certificate-for-jabbed-canadians-101634832088571.html
21-10-2021||World||‘Truth Social’: Ex-US prez Donald Trump gets his own social media platform||Former US president Donald Trump misses the social media megaphones he had before the January 6 insurrection. Shut out by them, he has now unveiled his own digital media venture that will launch a new social media platform in November called “Truth Social”, ostensibly to give him back his megaphone.A beta version of the platform is expected to be launched next month, but only for some invited guests. The national rollout is slated for the first quarter of 2022.“I created Truth Social and TMTG to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech,” the former president said in a statement issued in his capacity as chairman of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which will launch the new social platform. “We live in a world where the Taliban have a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favourite American president has been silenced.”Donald Trump was shut down by Twitter, Facebook and Google’s YouTube in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol in which, instigated by him at a rally, his supporters had stormed the US Congress. It aimed to prevent a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate from certifying President Joe Biden’s election as president, which is usually a formality but Trump tried to use it to remain in power in defiance of the election mandate.Donald Trump has railed against the ban and he and his supporters have wrongly claimed it is violation of the First Amendment of the US constitution that guarantees free speech, but only from government restrictions and clampdowns.Trump has also sued to get his social media accounts restored. His attorneys filed lawsuits against Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in July demanding overturning of their ban claiming it violated his First Amendment rights and of other conservatives also closed down by these companies. Earlier in October, he filed a motion asking a federal judge to order Twitter to restore his account.The former president has now launched his own technology company and a new social media platform. He announced the merger of TMTG with Digital World Acquisition Corp, which is a special purpose acquisition company, an increasingly popular alternative to initial public offerings.Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter when his account was closed. Since then, he has used email to convey his thoughts and remarks, with similar frequency and wordage. But they don’t have the same explosive impact as his tweets that had rung around the world in an instant.Donald Trump has returned to holding political rallies and events and has tightened his grip on the Republican party. Polls show he remains a favourite for the party’s presidential nomination for 2024 by an overwhelming margin. He has teased the possibility of a run but has not publicly committed to it yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truth-social-ex-us-prez-donald-trump-gets-his-own-social-media-platform-101634830288392.html
21-10-2021||World||Israel poised to welcome fully vaccinated foreign tourists back to country||Israeli leaders on Thursday recommended reopening the country to fully vaccinated tourists beginning on Nov. 1, a year and a half after closing its borders to most foreign visitors due to the global coronavirus pandemic.The decision, which still requires formal government approval, comes as Israel emerges from a fourth wave of coronavirus infections. Israel in July began an aggressive booster-shot campaign, offering a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to virtually anyone over the age of 16. That campaign appears to have brought the outbreak under control.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said that foreigners who were fully vaccinated less than six months ago, or who have received a booster shot more recently, will be eligible to enter the country. People who recovered from COVID-19 less than six months ago may also visit.The rules recognize most internationally recognized vaccines, including Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sinovak and Sinopharm - but not Russia's Sputnik. Bennett's office said people coming from “red” countries with high outbreaks would not be permitted, while officials will monitor new variants, including a strain identified in Israel this week.The decision could give a boost to the struggling tourism industry, which has been hit hard by the lack of tourists. It comes just ahead of the busy Christmas season, when tens of thousands of foreigners visit holy sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank.Senior Cabinet ministers, along with health, tourism, economic and security experts, took part in Thursday’s decision.Some details, including whether foreigners will have to be tested or undergo quarantine upon arrival, were not immediately announced.Throughout the closure, Israel has allowed some foreigners to visit, including people with close relatives in the country and people coming for work or study. It began allowing organized tour groups in September. Those visitors must take coronavirus tests before their incoming flights, upon arrival and before they fly out of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-poised-to-welcome-fully-vaccinated-foreign-tourists-back-to-country-101634827834086.html
21-10-2021||World||US envoy nominee Nicholas Burns’ remarks smack of Cold War mentality: China||China on Thursday “firmly rejected” US ambassador nominee Nicholas Burns’ tough comments on Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang, saying his remarks show a Cold War and zero-sum mentality.“The remarks of Mr Burns smack of Cold War zero-sum mentality and run counter to facts. China firmly rejects them,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday.Wang was responding to Burns’ remarks made during his US Senate confirmation hearing hours earlier where he said that the “genocide in Xinjiang”, abuses in Tibet, and bullying of Taiwan must stop.Calling China, the US’s “most dangerous competitor”, Nicholas Burns said Beijing was “blasting past” its pledge to maintain only a minimum nuclear deterrent.He added that Washington should work with allies in Europe and elsewhere to build economic leverage.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry issued a strong rebuttal to Nicholas Burns’ comments.“Issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong are purely China’s internal affairs that brook no foreign interference. The accusation of the so-called ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is an outrageous lie fabricated by a few anti-China scholars in Western countries and US politicians, with the true intention of oppressing and containing China’s development,” Wang Wenbin said.“The one-China principle is a political foundation of China-US relations and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory,” the Chinese spokesperson added.“We advise Mr Burns to be keenly aware of the overall trend of world development and people’s aspirations, learn the real situations of China objectively, view China and China-US ties in a rational manner and avoid underestimating the strong resolve, determination and capability of the Chinese people to defend their rights.” Wang Wenbin said.Ties between the US and China have been fraught over a range of issues ranging from trade to human rights and transparency over the origins of the coronavirus, which triggered the Covid-19 pandemic.During a phone conversation in September, President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart, Joe Biden that US’ China policy had resulted in serious difficulties in bilateral ties and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the common interests of the world.Xi Jinping suggested that on the basis of respecting each other’s core concerns and properly managing differences, the two sides “…continue with contact and dialogue, and advance coordination and cooperation on climate change, epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery as well as major international and regional issues”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-nominee-nicholas-burns-remarks-smack-of-cold-war-mentality-china-101634825967785.html

That being said, today, Pakistan Foreign Minister Makdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi landed in Kabul along with Lt General Faiz Hameed, who is still functioning as DG, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and were received by Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.According to Kabul watchers, Hameed, who is at the centre of a fight between PM Khan and Army Chief Gen Qamar Jawed Bajwa, had recently visited Tajikistan to win support for the Taliban terrorist regime. Despite Gen Bajwa transferring Hameed as XI Corps Commander at Peshawar on October 6 and replacing him with Karachi Corps Commander Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum, Gen Hameed is staying put in Rawalpindi under the protection of Imran Khan. Gen Hameed was publicly seen at Serena Hotel in Kabul on September 6 as he brokered the Taliban government formation.Also Read: Former DG (ISI) could succeed Gen Bajwa as Pakistan Army ChiefIt is understood that Qureshi and Hameed landed up in Kabul today to convince the hardline Sunni regime to make their government open to more minority representation particularly women so that the international community gets a face-saver to recognize the rabid Islamist regime. To date, even China, Russia, Qatar, Turkey, the closest supporters of the Taliban regime apart from controller Pakistan, have not recognized the Sunni Islamist government in Kabul. The democratic world has made it clear that the Taliban must fulfil conditions stipulated in UNSC resolution 2593 as the first step towards recognition.Also Read: China with Pak support has advantage in Taliban ruled AfghanistanWhile Pakistan is using its good offices with other countries to secure recognition for the government in Kabul, there is infighting within the Taliban government with Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob on one side and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of eponymous terror network, his chief rival. Such is the level of mistrust among the Taliban leaders that Deputy PM and Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Gani Baradar has refused to take personal security from the Interior Ministry and has decided to keep his own trusted people to guard him.It has been two months since the Taliban militarily occupied Kabul but there is no sign of any governance in the ventilator state with rival factions imposing their diktat through guns. Recently, when the Taliban government issued order allowing women to work at the Culture ministry, they were stopped by the guards saying that this was against the Islamic tenets and threatened to use force on women who just wanted to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-s-dg-isi-returns-to-kabul-wants-taliban-to-get-minority-reps-on-board-101634819604649.html

Pfizer-BioNTech announced the results on Thursday from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a 30-µg booster dose, the same dosage strength as those in the primary series, of the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. “These results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.More than 10,000 individuals who had completed the primary two-dose series of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine participated in the booster dose trial. Half of the trial participants received a 30-µg booster dose while the other half received a placebo. The researchers identified five Covid-19 cases in the booster dose group while 109 cases in the placebo group.Citing multiple subgroup analyses, the study suggests that booster dose efficacy was consistent irrespective of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions.The US and German partners are the first to publish efficacy results from any randomized, controlled Covid-19 vaccine booster trial.“In addition to our efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated, we believe boosters have a critical role to play in addressing the ongoing public health threat of this pandemic,” Bourla added.Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid vaccines are at the centre of the immunisation programme in the United States to fight the pandemic.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already authorised the third dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine for emergency use among individuals 65 years of age and older, all adults at high risk of severe Covid-19, and those with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-say-their-covid-vaccine-booster-dose-95-6-effective-101634816988733.html

The aim was to maintain the “seriousness and credibility” of the list, it said.The CAC said that from now on, when online news service providers reprint news information, they must follow the latest version of the “List of Internet News Information Sources”, and those “…who reprint beyond the scope will be punished in accordance with laws and regulations”.The omitting of Caixin Media means that its stories cannot be shared on China’s hugely popular online platforms like WeChat and Twitter-like Weibo.The ban could impact the outlet’s advertisement flow as well.Besides investigative stories related to business, corruption and pollution, Caixin’s coverage of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic in the central Chinese city of Wuhan was widely appreciated.Most recently, it had done a series of in-depth stories on China’s crippling power shortage.“Caixin is among the few news outlets in China that criticise government officials for perceived shortcomings. In 2016, it took the unprecedented step of reporting on how one of its own articles had been deleted by the Cyberspace Administration of China, exposing a practice that the government has sought to keep out of the public eye,” Bloomberg said in a report on Caixin’s ouster.The outlet had highlighted the issue of censorship in China in a rare show of defiance against the Communist government after an interview of a government adviser was removed from its website.Then helmed by one of China’s most well-known journalists Hu Shuli, it put out a bold rejoinder on its English language website after China’s multi-layered censors removed an earlier interview of the adviser who had called for freedom of speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drops-caixin-media-from-list-of-official-publications-wechat-weibo-added-101634815106250.html

The surgery, carried out on September 25, is being considered as a "potential miracle" by the surgeon who led the procedure.The surgery involved a genetically modified donor animal and a brain dead patient on a ventilator whose family had given permission for the two-day experiment, for the sake of advancing science, reported AFP."It did what it's supposed to do, which is remove waste and make urine," Robert Montgomery, director of the transplant institute at New York University (NYU) Langone, told AFP in an interview. The surgey went on for around two hours.The team of doctors joined the kidney to blood vessels on the top of one of the patient's legs, so that they could observe it and take biopsy samples.Montgomery told AFP that the patient wanted to be an organ donor but their organs were not suitable. However, the family "felt a sense of relief that this was another opportunity for donation," he said. The patient was taken off the ventilator and passed away following the 54-hour test.After the surgery, it was found that the organ was able to reduce the level of the molecule creatinine, a key indicator of kidney health.According to earlier research, kidneys from pigs are viable in nonhuman primates for up to a year. However, this was the first time that the same had been attempted with a human patient. The donor pig belonged to a herd that had undergone a genetic editing procedure to knock out a gene that produces a particular sugar."It is still a question what would happen three weeks from now, three months, three years," said Montgomery. "The only way we're really going to be able to answer that is to move this into a living human trial. But I think this is a really important intermediate step, which tells us that at least initially, things are probably going to be okay."Robert Montgomery plans to submit the findings to a scientific journal in the next month, and is expecting a clinical trial in around a year or two. The outside experts welcomed the news but said they would like to see the peer-reviewed data before drawing firm conclusions.The news comes amid a dire shortage of transplant organs. According to official US data, there are nearly 107,000 Americans awaiting an organ - 90,000 of whom need a kidney. Seventeen Americans die each day while waiting for an organ.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pig-kidney-works-in-human-patient-potential-miracle-hails-us-surgeon-101634787803264.html

21-10-2021||World||Enforce UN sanctions on North Korea, say US & EU||The United States and several European countries on Wednesday condemned North Korea’s recent missile tests and said Pyongyang’s technical advances demonstrate the urgent need to ramp up implementation of UN sanctions on its nuclear and missile programs and its economic activities.US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged North Korea to stop its “reckless provocations” that violate Security Council sanctions resolutions. She said it should start talks with the Biden administration without preconditions toward the goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.She urged all countries to fully implement UN sanctions “so that we can prevent the DPRK from accessing the funds, the technology, the know-how it needs to further develop unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.”Thomas-Greenfield reiterated to reporters before an emergency closed meeting of the council on North Korea’s latest missile tests that the United States has offered to meet officials from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea -- the country’s official name -- “and we have made clear that we have no hostile intent toward the DPRK.”In a separate statement, the three members of the European Union on the Security Council -- Ireland, France and Estonia -- said Monday’s reported test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile “forms part of a pattern of provocations by the DPRK” in recent weeks, including launches of short-range ballistic missiles, long-range cruise missiles, “and what it has claimed to be a hypersonic glider.”They said the new submarine missile launch “underlines the continued enhancement of the nuclear and ballistic program of the DPRK, which stated the ambition to ultimately acquire sea-based nuclear capabilities.”The EU council members urged North Korea to immediately end its “destabilizing actions and take concrete steps to abandon its ballistic missiles” and other weapons of mass destruction including its nuclear program “in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.”Ireland, France and Estonia also urged North Korea to respond positively to the repeated offers by the US and South Korea for dialogue saying “there is no other way to achieve peace, security and stability on the Korean peninsula.”The 15-member Security Council heard a briefing on the latest missile tests from UN Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari, but did not issue a statement.The council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions on North Korea severely restricting its imports and exports while demanding an end to its nuclear and ballistic missile activities. But North Korea has repeatedly flouted council resolutions and continues to launch increasingly sophisticated missiles, escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the region.Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration is committed to working with the international community to reduce tensions and maintain peace on the Korean peninsula. And the US commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan “is ironclad," she said.She criticized the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions on North Korea, saying it “is not doing its job.”“We must enforce these violations,” she said. “We need to ramp up the implementation of the sanctions and we’ve not done that. And particularly, we need to focus on those who are violating the sanctions and others who are engaging in activities that break the sanctions.”The US ambassador didn’t name any countries, but the panel of experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions has cited alleged violations by North Korea’s neighbors China and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/enforce-un-sanctions-on-north-korea-say-us-eu-101634783084413.html
21-10-2021||World||Covid-19: US FDA approves Moderna, J&J booster shots; says yes to vaccine mixing||The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for eligible individuals the use of third doses (booster shots) of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The public health agency has also approved the administration of a ‘mix and match’ booster dose after eligible individuals have completed the primary vaccination schedule with a different available vaccine.The FDA, in a press release, elaborated on the booster dose schedule that has now been approved in the United States. A single booster dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine may be administered to individuals 18 years of age and older at least two months after the completion of the single-dose primary regimen.To be eligible for the third dose of the Moderna vaccine, however, individuals have to be 65 years of age and older, since the federal agency considers this section of the population at ‘high risk’ of severe infection. Alternatively, the Moderna Covid-19 booster dose may also be administered to people 18 years of age and above whose job exposes them to the novel coronavirus or if they are at high risk of infection, according to the US FDA release. The third dose of the Moderna vaccine is to be administered at least six months after eligible individuals receive their first dose of an approved Covid-19 vaccine.However, the Moderna booster shot approved by the FDA will be half the dose that is given in the primary two-shot regime.In addition, the FDA said individuals may receive a booster shot from a different manufacturer compared to the doses they received earlier this year. "The use of each of the available Covid-19 vaccines as a heterologous (or "mix and match") booster dose among the eligible individuals following completion of primary vaccination with a different available Covid-19 vaccine," the FDA said in its press release.The clearances came after a panel of expert advisers to the FDA unanimously backed the Moderna and J&J booster regimens in two days of meetings last week. Regulators have now signed off on boosters for all three coronavirus vaccines available in the US.According to the Bloomberg news agency, the recent move by the FDA means that the United States will now have a larger toolkit to try to limit a potential coronavirus rebound this winter. The summer’s delta-variant fueled spike in Covid-19 infections helped increase the urgency to make boosters available, and health officials across the US are eager to forestall a rebound in cases that could cripple hospitals and disrupt work and school in winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-fda-approves-moderna-j-j-booster-shots-says-yes-to-vaccine-mixing-101634780660227.html

France vehemently protested the decision last month by the UK and the Channel Island of Jersey to refuse dozens of French fishing boats a license to operate in their territorial waters. Paris called the move “unacceptable”.France considers the restrictions as contrary to the post-Brexit agreement that the British government signed when it left the European Union.“We are obviously in a position to take sanctions if the agreement is not respected,” French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said. “There are several types of sanctions that are possible: energy prices, access to (French) ports, tariffs issues.”Jersey, which is only 14 miles (22 kilometers) off the French coast, is a British Crown dependency outside of the UK.

He spoke anonymously in accordance with the French presidency's customary practices.Earlier this month, France and 10 other EU nations issued a joint declaration denouncing UK's attitude over fishing licenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-may-announce-energy-trade-sanctions-amid-fishing-dispute-with-uk-101634780052123.html
21-10-2021||World||Europe the only region with surge in Covid-19 infections last week, says WHO||The World Health Organization said there was a 7% rise in new coronavirus cases across Europe last week, the only region in the world where cases increased, and said uneven vaccine uptake posed a threat to the continent.In its weekly assessment of the pandemic, the UN health agency said there were about 2.7 million new Covid-19 cases and more than 46,000 deaths last week worldwide, similar to the numbers reported the previous week.WHO said the two regions with the highest rates of Covid-19 incidence were Europe and the Americas. Globally, the US reported the biggest number of new cases, more than 580,000, which still represented a 11% decline.Britain, Russia and Turkey accounted for the most cases in Europe.The biggest drop in Covid-19 cases were seen in Africa and the Western Pacific, where infections fell by about 18% and 16%, respectively. The number of deaths in Africa also declined by about a quarter, despite the dire shortage of vaccines on the continent.But for the third consecutive week, coronavirus cases have jumped in Europe, with about 1.3 million new cases. More than half of countries in the region reported a rise in their Covid-19 numbers, WHO said. Britain and Russia each reported about a 15% increase in new cases.In a statement Wednesday, WHO's Europe office said 1 billion coronavirus vaccines have now been administered across the continent and described uneven vaccine uptake as “the region's biggest enemy in the fight against Covid-19.”In the past week, Russia has repeatedly broken new daily records for Covid-19 cases and the number of infections in the UK has surged to levels not seen since mid-July.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday backed a Cabinet proposal to keep Russian workers home for a week in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.Russian officials have struggled to vaccinate the population but due to vaccine skepticism, only about 32% of people have been immunized despite the availability of its Sputnik V vaccine. It has by far the largest virus death toll in Europe, with more than 225,000 deaths.Although the head of Britain's National Health Service has urged the government to introduce stricter Covid-19 protocols including mask-wearing and the faster vaccination of children, politicians have so far demurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-the-only-region-with-surge-in-covid-19-infections-last-week-says-who-101634779136336.html

But its Production Gap report found that total fossil fuel production would rise until at least 2040. Development plans would produce 110% more fossil fuels this decade than consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, and 45% more than for a world where temperatures rise 2°C.Putin will not attend Glasgow climate talksRussian President Vladimir Putin won’t go to next month’s UN climate summit, the Kremlin said.

21-10-2021||World||Virus rebounds, curbs return||Russia will shut workplaces for a week, Latvia went back into lockdown for at least a month and Romanian funeral homes are running out of coffins, as vaccine-sceptic countries across eastern Europe face a fresh surge of Covid-19 infections and deaths.Russia, which boasted of developing one of the earliest Covid-19 vaccines, has been unable to persuade large swathes of the population to take it, and is now facing its highest daily death rates of the pandemic.President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday that the period from October 30-November 7 would be “non-working days”, although salaries would still be paid.Public hostility to vaccination has hit other eastern European countries that were within Moscow’s orbit during the Cold War. The EU states with the lowest vaccination rates are all part of the former eastern bloc, including Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Poland, Latvia and Estonia.Romania, where one person is dying of Covid-19 every five minutes, had the world’s highest death rate per capita this week, with Bulgaria close behind.EU’s first new lockdownLatvia has imposed a month-long lockdown, becoming the first EU country to shut down again since the bloc began reopening this year as vaccines became widely available.Bulgaria, where only a quarter of the population has taken a first dose of vaccine, banned access to indoor public spaces this week for anyone who cannot show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from a recent infection.Poland’s health minister said on Wednesday “drastic measures” could be needed to respond to a sudden surge of infections there, although he said no new lockdown was being considered.Concern in Britain, tooHealth chiefs in the UK have urged the government to legally enforce some of the Covid-19 prevention measures, such as mandatory face coverings in enclosed spaces, as infections in Britain continue to spike over the 40,000 mark daily.The NHS Confederation, a membership body of the country’s National Health Service (NHS), said a back-up strategy, or “Plan B plus”, is required as pre-emptive action over winter. The warning comes as the UK hit a daily high of 43,738 cases and 223 deaths on Tuesday.Bolsonaro says ‘guilty of nothing’ amid chargesAfter Brazil’s senators said Jair Bolsonaro should be charged for nine crimes, including charlatanism, malfeasance and crimes against humanity in their conclusion of a probe into the government’s handling of the pandemic, the president insisted he’s “guilty of nothing”.A Senate commission presented a final report on Wednesday after six months of hearings.

21-10-2021||India||HT This Day : October 22, 1959 – Nanavati held not guilty by jury||Bombay- Commander K. M. Nanavati was today held not guilty of murdering Prem Ahuja by a majority vote of the jury.But the Sessions Judge, Mr R. B. Mehta, disagreed with the verdict and announced that he was referring the case to the Bombay High Court "in the interests of justice."The nine-member jury gave a verdict of not guilty by eight to one on both the charges of murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder.The judge termed the verdict “totally perverse."Pending the disposal of the reference by the High Court, Cmdr. Nanavati will continue in Naval custody.There was wild cheering and clapping when the jury emerged after a 135-minute session and declared its verdict.The judge ordered that the court room be cleared of the public immediately. He said their behaviour was "most disgraceful and nauseating."A large crowd had also collected outside the court when it was known that the jury had retired at 4-40 p.m. after a seven-hour summing up by the judge.Steel-helmeted policemen were posted on the approach roads to the sessions court building to control the crowds. A number of policemen in plain clothes were in the court room.Immediately after the jury returned the verdict, the Judge said that he was going to refer the case to the High Court.Mr Karl Khandalavala, defence counsel, wanted to speak on the question of reference, but the Judge remarked that he had already heard the counsel for four 'days and did not want to hear anything further on the question of reference. "It is my view that the verdict is not reasonable." he said.The Chief Public Prosecutor, Mr C. M. Trivedi, said the verdict was "patently perverse and would vitiate the rule of law for ever."Mr Trivedi then requested the court to order that the accused be kept in police custody instead of naval custody.Mr Khandalavala said that the prosecutor's application would mean "persecution" and not "prosecution ". At this stage there was an exchange of words between counsel and the Judge remarked that he was surprised at the way in which things were going on in the trial."We are supposed to be under the rule of law" he said. There-upon counsel apologized.Mr Khandalavala, referring to the scenes in court, said that the accused should not be held responsible for what had happened. How could he be penalized for the actions of the crowd, he asked.Mr Khandalavala said that there was no question of the accused running away or absconding if he was kept in naval custody. Only points of law would be raised in the High Court and there was no question of evidence. The trial was at an end.The Judge said that up to the last day he had not interfered on the question of the accused's custody and he did not think it necessary to interfere now.Mr Trivedi: We feel very strongly that naval custody has been abused in this case. We did not apply for police custody because we wanted to be graceful.The Judge said that if there was an abuse Mr Trivedi could apply to the court for cancellation of naval custody.The Judge then referred to the wild scenes and said: "I feel our whole law and Constitution are on trial if we are going to behave in this way."Addressing Cmdr. Nanavati the Judge said: "The jury have found you not guilty. I am unable to agree with the verdict as in my view it is perverse. I discharge the jury and under Section 307 CrPC, I submit the case to the High Court in the interest of Justice.”-PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-22-1959-nanavati-held-not-guilty-by-jury-101634837078358.html

21-10-2021||India||What is the issue between Nawab Malik and Sameer Wankhede? 10 points||Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik is a minister of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra. Sameer Wankhede is the zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau. Both of them are presently in news because of their ongoing exchange of barbs over the Aryan Khan case. Aryan Khan was arrested by the NCB on October 3 from a cruise rave party. Since Aryan Khan's arrest, Nawab Malik has brought a series of allegations against NCB and particularly Sameer Wankhede, extortion being the latest.Here is everything you need to know about what is the issue between Nawab Malik and Sameer Wankhede1. On Thursday, Nawab Malik threatened that he will not stop his tirade against Sameer Wankhede until Wankhede is put in jail. The minister on Thursday accused Sameer Wankhede of extortion.2. Nawab Malik said when Bollywood stars were in the Maldives, Sameer Wankhede was in the Maldives, hinting at a behind-the-scene development.'He is minister, I am a govt employee': Sameer Wankhede replies to Nawab Malik's 'threat'3. Wankhede refuted the allegation and said that he was in the Maldives on a vacation with his family. He took permission from the government (from his department) before taking the leaves. He also asserted that he has never been to Dubai contrary to what Nawab Malik claimed.4. Nawab Malik posted purported photos of Sameer Wankhede's sister Yasmeen Wankhede as evidence of his claim. The NCB chief said he has come under personal attack for the last few days as his family members are being dragged into the case.5. As Nawab Malik threatened to put him behind the bars, Sameer Wankhede wished him the best and said he is just a government employee, while Nawab Malik is a minister. On taking legal steps against Nawab Malik, Wankhede said as a government employee, he has to take his department's permission for that.6. Earlier, Nawab Malik had alleged that the day Aryan Khan was arrested, NCB detained many others in connection with the same case. But people with a connection with a BJP leader were released, Nawab Malik claimed. NCB replied that it detained around 14 persons on that day and six were released while the rest eight, including Aryan Khan, were arrested.7. Nawab Malik also exposed NCB's witnesses KP Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali who were present during Aryan Khan's arrest. The minister raised questions over the background of these two independent witnesses, as KP Gosavi himself has a fraud case against him and Manish Bhanushali is a BJP leader. The NCB clarified that the presence of independent witnesses is a must in all its operations and field verification of these witnesses is not possible as the focus remains on the raid.8. Nawab Malik then raised questions about the one Fletcher Patel who was a witness in some of the NCB cases. The minister claimed that Fletcher Patel is a friend of Sameer Wankhede.9. The Narcotics Control Bureau had arrested Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan in connection with a drugs case. While the enmity between Nawab Malik and Sameer Wankhede can be traced back to this episode, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, NCP chief Sharad Pawar have also slammed the NCB.10. Nawab Malik's son-in-law finally got bail and the court said that he was not in possession of ganja, but it was some herbs.Who is Sameer Wankhede?Sameer Wankhede is the NCB official who helming the agency's operation against drugs in Mumbai. He sprang to prominence since, in the last year, NCB has interrogated a number of Bollywood actors for their alleged links with drugs. Wankhede is known as a taskmaster as in his previous posting with the customs department of Mumbai Airport, he once caught singer Mika Singh with the foreign currency. In 2011, he made sure that the World Cup was released from the airport after paying duty. Wankhede is married to Marathi actor Kranti Redkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-the-issue-between-nawab-malik-and-sameer-wankhede-10-points-101634833078804.html
21-10-2021||India||‘Judge threatens arrest warrant’: Kangana Ranaut plea to transfer case rejected||MUMBAI: Additional chief metropolitan magistrate ST Dande on Thursday rejected a fresh plea filed by actor Kangana Ranaut to seek transfer of the defamation case filed against her by lyricist Javed Akhtar from the 10th court at Andheri to any other metropolitan magistrate. Judge Dande, who reserved his ruling a day earlier after hearing lyricist Javed Akhtar’s lawyer Jay Bhardwaj, delivered his verdict on Thursday. There was no reaction from the actor to the verdict.In her application, Kangana Ranaut told judge Dhande that she didn’t have faith in the 10th court at Andheri which was hearing Akhtar’s complaint against her. Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddique said the 10th court magistrate was insisting on her personal appearance without any sufficient reason and without an order which could have justified compelling her to appear in the case involving a bailable, non-cognizable and compoundable offence.“This court is threatening the accused on every date of issuing an arrest warrant without giving any sufficient cause,” her application said.Javed Akhtar’s lawyer opposed Kangana Ranaut’s request, arguing that it was only designed to delay proceedings. The grounds mentioned in the present application were raised for the first time after more than 7 months of summoning Kangana with the sole intent to delay the matter, his reply said.Akhtar filed the defamation complaint against Kangana Ranaut last November for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against him in a television interview.In a counter-complaint filed recently, the actress has alleged that after her dispute with co-star Hrithik Roshan, Akthar had called her and her sister to his house in Juhu with “mala fide intentions and ulterior motives”. She added that Akhtar called her and sister on the pretext of acting as a mediator but instead threatened her and forced her to tender a written apology to Roshan, thus forcefully seeking to create a document in a favour of her co-star.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-threatens-arrest-warrant-kangana-ranaut-plea-to-transfer-case-rejected-101634833048928.html

If he calls that extortion, then this is not acceptable," Wankhede said.Without mincing any words, Nawab Malik accused Sameer Wankhede of ‘extortion’ and as evidence, he produced the photos of Sameer Wankhede's sister in the Maldives. The minister said when all the Bollywood personalities were in the Maldives during the pandemic, Sameer Wankhede was also in the Maldives.

21-10-2021||India||‘Won’t stop till I put him in jail’: Nawab Malik stings NCB's Sameer Wankhede||In a fresh attack on Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal chief Sameer Wankhede, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Thursday said he won’t stop until he puts the official in jail. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader has levelled several allegations against Wankhede, including running an extortion racket in cahoots with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Accusing Wankhede of filing fake cases against celebrities, Malik said that the NCB official will lose his job within a year.“They (BJP) have a puppet - Wankhede. He raises bogus cases against people. I challenge that Wankhede that he'll lose his job within a year. You came to jail us, people of this nation won't be silent without seeing you behind bars. We have evidence of bogus cases,” news agency ANI quoted Nawab Malik as saying.Sameer Wankhede has been at the forefront of recent NCB investigations involving the film industry, including a drug probe linked to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death which led to the arrest of actor Rhea Chakraborty and his brother Showik. The siblings are currently out on bail while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continues its probe.Also Read | No NCB raid, team visited 'Mannat' to collect docus related to Aryan Khan: Sameer WankhedeMalik's son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested by the agency in a drugs case but was granted bail by Special NDPS court last week.“Tell us who your father is, the one who is putting pressure? Nawab Malik isn't going to be scared of anyone's father whatever pressure you may try to put on me. I won't stop until I put you in jail, I'd like to make this clear today,” the NCP leader said, apparently alleging that the official is working under political patronage.Malik has targeted Wankhede by questioning his and his family's alleged presence in the Maldives when many Bollywood celebrities were also in the island country. Hinting at a deeper link between Sameer Wankhede and Bollywood, the minister said that the NCB official “must clarify what he and his family members were doing there at that time.”“Sameer Wankhede has to explain about his visit to Dubai & Maldives. We are sure that this 'ugahi' happened in Maldives, Dubai,” Malik said.Wankhede has denied the claims of visiting Dubai and said that he went to the Maldives only after taking permission from the competent authority."The word 'extortion' is a disgusting term. I did go to Maldives after taking competent authority's permission. I went with my children and family after taking govt's permission. If he calls that extortion, then this is not acceptable," he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-won-t-stop-till-i-put-him-in-jail-nawab-malik-stings-ncb-s-sameer-wankhede-101634826134950.html
21-10-2021||India||IAF chief says eastern Ladakh situation led to stretching of equipment to limits||The situation that developed in eastern Ladakh last year required acclimatisation of a large number of IAF personnel and stretching of equipment to limits, but the force is "much better prepared" now in case there is a "long haul", Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari said on Thursday.In an interaction at a defence conclave here, he also said that in the last one year, due to the challenges faced in the harsh atmosphere of the region, "we have realised, where we fell short" whether it was in terms of adequate clothing, shelters for people to live there. "The situation that developed in eastern Ladakh last year was something that we were not very familiar with, particularly in the kind of environment that we needed to operate. It required acclimatisation of a large number of personnel at short notice, required stretching our equipment to limits, which some of it were not cleared for," he said. The IAF chief said, "we have moved equipment to altitude, well above the altitudes they were tried and tested for, when we acquired those systems." Following the escalation in tension in eastern Ladakh in mid-June last year, the IAF deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft as well as its attack helicopters in the key air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control. At the conclave held at the Constitution Club of India, the IAF chief, in response to a question, also shared other challenges faced by the air force in the region. There was also the challenge of continuously rotating the manpower, to take care of their health, he said. "As a result, over the last one year, we have realised, where we fell short, whether it was in terms of adequate clothing, shelters for people to live there. So, we have overcome all those shortages now, and I think, we are better prepared, in case there is a long haul, we are prepared this winter, much better than what we were last year," he said. During the 89th IAF Day speech at Hindon Airbase on October 8, Chaudhari had asserted that the IAF's prompt actions in response to developments in eastern Ladakh last year were a testament to its combat readiness. The year gone by was "quite challenging yet extremely rewarding", he had said. In response to another question on threats faced by India, he said, "I can assure you that we are fully aware of the threats that we face, and our acquisitions, training, and tactics developed to counter such a threat". The IAF chief also said that the ability to "seamlessly integrate" new weapons, new data, into the network and train its personnel to operate them, and keep them "future-ready" was the way forward. "I can say with some degree of confidence that the way we go about analysing the threat perception, carrying out global scan of the political situation, of the acquisitions and modernisation of the adversaries, and to counter that we plan are our own acquisition for air force, and linked to that is training, and development of new tactics," he said. "Every time you find there is an imbalance in technology and pure numbers, we counter it with better tactics and better training," the IAF chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-says-eastern-ladakh-situation-led-to-stretching-of-equipment-to-limits-101634824460535.html
21-10-2021||India||AIADMK files police complaint against Sasikala for plaque that calls her party boss||CHENNAI: The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) late on Wednesday evening filed a police complaint against expelled party leader VK Sasikala for unveiling a plaque at party founder M G Ramachandran’s memorial on October 17 that referred to her as the AIADMK general secretary. Sasikala’s surprise move on a day the AIADMK was ringing in its golden jubilee year was seen as a renewed attempt by the one-time close aide of Jayalalitha to signal to her supporters that she was still in the game.The AIADMK retaliated three days later with a police complaint filed by the organisational secretary and former minister D Jayakumar at Chennai’s Mambalam police station. The AIADMK sought action against Sasikala for “cheating by impersonation, promoting disharmony, enmity and hatred and circulating statements with intent to cause fear or alarm.”“The said Sasikala knew fully well that the said conduct on her part was dishonest and in effect impersonation of an office to which she has no claim,” the AIADMK’s written complaint to the police said. The complaint went on to explain the circumstances that led to Sasikala’s expulsion in 2017 and the eventual consolidation of the party under the dual leadership of former chief ministers Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam.Jayakumar also underlined that the Election Commission of India settled the dispute over the party name and symbol following J Jayalalithaa’s death by recognising the dual leadership as the ‘real AIADMK’.“It’s a settled matter. Even elections are over. She’s doing this out of boredom,” said E Palaniswami on Wednesday while interacting with reporters. “She has no links with the party.”When Jayalalithaa died in office in December 2016, Paneerselvam, who had filled in for Jyalalitha in the past, was named to succeed her as chief minister. Sasikala was elected general secretary, the AIADMK’s highest post that was previously held by MGR and Jayalalithaa. But Paneerselvam did not last long and was forced to make way for Sasikala to be chief minister, leading to his dramatic rebellion.Sasikala eventually handpicked Palaniswami as chief minister before surrendering to serve her sentence in a disproportionate assets case. While Sasikala was in a Bengaluru jail, rivals Pannerselvam and Palaniswami decided to merge their factions in August 2017 and expelled Sasikala. Jayalalithaa was named as the permanent general secretary; neither side wanted to let the other gain an upper hand. Pannerselvam and Palaniswami function as coordinator and co-cordinator of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-files-police-complaint-against-sasikala-for-plaque-that-calls-her-party-boss-101634824527789.html

He declined to give any further details, stressing that the police are still investigating the case.A person familiar with the matter said the post-mortem report pointed to injury marks on Arun Valmiki’s body but stressed that these were not of such a magnitude that could have led to his death.Arun Valmiki’s death triggered a political firestorm. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who travelled to Agra to meet his family late on Wednesday evening, said the death of the sanitation worker showed that there was no justice for the poor, Dalits and farmers in UP. The Congress leader cited her conversation with Arun Valmiki’s wife who alleged that the police brutally thrashed her husband and subjected him to electric shocks.On Thursday, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Maywati tweeted that she has also sent a team to meet Valmiki’s family. “The custodial death of a sanitation worker in Agra is most saddening. A party delegation led by Gayacharan Dinkar would visit Agra, meet the victim’s kin and also interact with officials to get justice in the case,” Mayawati tweeted. Valmiki was arrested in connection with the theft of ₹25 lakh from the warehouse of Jagdishpura police station in Agra on Sunday.Police earlier said he allegedly confessed to the theft and ₹15 lakh stolen from the police station was seized from his house. Agra SSP Muniraj G earlier said that Arun Valmiki fell ill when the police were making the recovery from his house and was rushed to hospital where he was declared brought dead.Additional director general of police (Agra) Rajiv Krishna said: “Our officers are in contact with his family. They’re cooperating. Action will be taken if there was any negligence. The family has filed a complaint. They suspect he was beaten up by the police following which he died. FIR was registered and the matter will be probed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/autopsy-report-says-arun-valmiki-died-of-heart-attack-not-injuries-agra-cop-101634821887630.html

After questioning her for almost two hours, the NCB has asked her to be present at the office again on Friday at 11 am as her statements regarding this case will be recorded. Ananya is not an accused in the case and was called only for questioning, reports said.  #WATCH | Mumbai: Actor Ananya Panday and her father Chunky Panday leave from NCB office. Ananya was summoned by NCB for questioning. pic.twitter.com/peUP3XSGloAs the NCB summoned Ananya Panday for interrogation on Thursday morning, the actor reached the NCB office at around 4pm accompanied by her father Chunky Panday. Reports said she was interrogated purely in connection with Aryan Khan and not the others arrested in the case. She was asked about her acquaintance with Aryan Khan and whether she had any knowledge about Aryan Khan's drug consumption. She was also reportedly asked whether she also consumes drugs and about the suppliers if any. Her father Chunky Panday waited and the duo left together at around 6pm. The NCB reached Ananya Panday after the agency claimed that her name has come up in one of Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats. On Thursday, the investigators reportedly raided her Mumbai home and seized her laptop and mobile phone for investigation. The actor is believed to have cancelled her shooting schedule for the next few days. On October 3, Aryan Khan and seven others were arrested from a Goa-bound cruise where they all were the attendees of a rave party. Aryan Khan was not found in possession of drugs but the NCB contested that he was part of the conspiracy that the agency is probing. Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats are playing a crucial role in the case as this is the evidence that the NCB is citing in front of the court. Based on WhatsApp chats, NCB said that Aryan Khan was not new to drug consumption. He was aware that his friend Arbaaz Merchant was carrying drugs. The agency also said Aryan was in touch with people who might be part of an international drug network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ananya-panday-quizzed-for-2-hrs-in-aryan-khan-drugs-case-called-again-tomorrow-101634820738767.html

However, the trade remains unbalanced in favour of China.”He said the trade deficit concerns were two-fold, the first one being the actual size of the deficit. “Trade deficit for the nine-month period stood at $47 billion. This is the largest trade deficit we have with any country. Second is the fact that the imbalance has continuously been widening,” the foreign secretary was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | India-China to talk border again, focus on resolving Hot SpringsLast year, the total trade volume between the two countries was around $88 billion.The two nations have been engaged in a border dispute that has turned sometimes turned fiery for over a year now. Areas of cooperation weren't limited to bilateral but also had regional & global dimensions.

That is why, Atmanirbhar Bharat becomes important,” he added.The senior diplomat said ties between the two nations had generally followed a positive trajectory since 1988 when we re-established contacts at the highest level. “Advancement of ties in this period was clearly predicated on ensuring that peace and tranquillity were not disturbed. Areas of cooperation were not limited to bilateral, but also had regional and global dimensions. It was also recognised that relations between India and China were in the interest of not only the two countries but also in interest of peace, stability and security in the region and world at large.“It was against this backdrop that bilateral trade between India and China has grown exponentially since the turn of the century,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-with-china-touched-90-billion-in-9-months-but-balance-tilted-shringla-101634819454748.html

Hedge, who applauded the ad for raising awareness against bursting crackers on the streets, sought the company to also address the "problem blocking roads in the name of Namaz and noise emitted from mosques during Azan."In a letter to the company's MD and CEO Anant Vardhan Goenka, the BJP MP requested him to take cognisance of the recent advertisement claiming that it created an “unrest among the Hindus”, and expressed hope that in future the organisation will respect the "Hindu sentiment". "Your company's recent advertisement in which Aamir Khan advising people not to fire crackers on the streets is giving a very good message. Your concern to public issues needs applause. In this regard, I request you to address one more problem faced by people on roads, i.e., blocking roads in the name of Namaz on Fridays and other important festive days by Muslims," Hegde wrote in the letter dated October 14.The MP from Uttara Kannada went on to claim that during the Namaz, when the roads are blocked, vehicles like ambulances and firefighter vehicles are struck in traffic causing "grave losses", and added that the “loud noise… emitted from mikes arranged on the top of mosques in our country” during Azan is “beyond the permissible limits”."On Fridays, it is prolonged for some more time. It is causing great inconvenience to people suffering from different ailments and taking rest, people working in different establishments and teachers teaching in classrooms," he said. "I am sure you can feel the discrimination done to the Hindus since centuries," Hedge wrote, adding that some "anti-Hindu actors" always try to hurt the Hindu sentiments.The objection also comes in the backdrop of the latest backlash received by a Fabindia ad campaign that used the Urdu phrase “Jashn-e-Riwaaz” to describe the festival of Diwali. Fabindia subsequently withdrew its advertisement and clarified that the phrase was meant to celebrate Indian traditions and not exclusively the festival of Diwali.Fabindia further stated that its Diwali collection is now called "Jhilmil si Diwali" which is yet to be launched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ad-featuring-amir-khan-hurts-hindu-sentiments-claims-bjp-leader-101634815522031.html

She insisted she has no role in his dealings and kept away from him after she learnt about his shoddy deals, said the official. However, the SIT will take a final decision on summoning her after examining her statements in detail, he added. After details of her statement came out, an audio tape carrying Mavunkal’s purported telephonic conversation with another unidentified person also surfaced. HT could not verify the authenticity of the tape in which Mavunkal claimed to have spent ₹14 lakh on Pullayil’s sister’s marriage which she purportedly refused to return. Pullayil is yet to respond to the allegation. After cheating cases against Mavunkal surfaced, Pullayil had appeared in a couple of Malayalam news channels claiming she was advising people, allegedly conned by him, to approach the police. Pullayil also said she was not aware of his tricky deals earlier and cut off her ties to him after becoming aware. While she stuck to her earlier position in the statement given to the SIT, she admitted to have introduced many police officials to him. She claimed that Mavunkal misused her high contacts owing to her association with several Non Resident Indian (NRI) welfare bodies and Non Governmental Organisations (NGO), the official quoted above said.Also Read: Monson Mavunkal, the conman who sold Moses’s staff, Krishna’s dahi handiShe said she had once even asked state police chief Loknath Behra to visit Mavunkal’s museum in Kochi, the SIT official said.

Mavunkal, who was arrested last month for selling fake artefacts and cheating, was also booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on Tuesday for allegedly raping the daughter of one of his employees two years ago. Police said he promised to fund the victim’s education and sexually assaulted her several times. In her complaint, the teenager’s mother said her daughter was 17 year old when sexually assaulted by Mavunkal and that her family was scared to approach the police. The police booked Mavunkal under the Pocso Act and then transferred the case to the SIT. The SIT also took the statement of Ernakulam Press Club secretary P Sashikanth on Wednesday in connection with a family event of club members purportedly sponsored by Mavunkal last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-records-nri-woman-s-statement-in-cheating-cases-against-kerala-antique-collector-101634817507044.html

As India reached the milestone of administering 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses, the association said it worked extra hard to mitigate the vaccination hesitancy and was delighted to see the country cross the landmark.“IMA salute the modern medical manpower, who had taken this nationalistic task on their shoulders as a priority task, reaching out to the unreached and making the vaccination reach 1 billion needy people with the government of India of giving it free of cost to the people,” the IMA said in a statement.The IMA stressed that the vaccination milestone also gives the hope to "confidently and assuredly" mitigate the impacts of the third Covid wave, saying it is evident that vaccination protects people from severe Covid-19.While the medical association lauded PM Modi’s “proactive leadership” in “effectively” managing the pandemic, it didn’t fail to highlight the challenges of bed availability, oxygen shortages, drugs, and misinformation campaigns during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. It said that the association leaders voluntarily took the vaccination on the first day to send a positive message when many had raised concerns about the vaccination safety and efficacy.The IMA was highly critical of pseudoscience peddled by some politicians amidst a ravaging pandemic and took Baba Ramdev head-on as the yoga guru was initially not in favour of vaccination. In many of his interactions with followers as well as media persons, Ramdev had questioned the efficacy of modern medicine in combating the pandemic. The yoga exponent did a somersault only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced free Covid vaccines for all.“Get both doses of the vaccine and the double protection of yoga and Ayurveda. They will combine to give you such a robust shield of protection that not a single person will die from Covid,” he told reporters in Haridwar,” PTI quoted Ramdev as saying in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-hails-altruistic-leadership-health-care-workers-for-1-billion-vaccination-milestone-101634813046169.html

Masih started threatening him and said Sapna will not return.”Ahirwar, who filed the complaint on Wednesday, said Masih converted to Christianity in 2001 and he was unaware of it. “My wife told me after marriage that she believed in Jesus Christ but had not changed her religion. Now Ramesh has misguided my wife and she is forcing me to change my religion.”Also Read: IAS officer accused of promoting religious conversions fails to get clean chitRamesh Masih has been booked along with his wife, Sakhi Masih, and her brother Nathu Masih.

I urge people to come forward, so that we are able to vaccinate 100 per cent of the population with the first dose," PTI quoted Patel as saying.The Surat, Junagadh and Gandhinagar municipal corporations along with Ahmedabad, Junagadh, Mahisagar and Tapi districts have achieved 100 per cent coverage of the first dose, Patel added. Besides, around 15,500 villages in Gujarat have managed to vaccinate 100 per cent of its eligible population with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, he added.The state health minister said they are planning to achieve 100 per cent first dose coverage in the next 15 days in Gujarat. "For that, we will ask government hospitals and health centres to check if incoming patients are vaccinated or not. We have also asked heads of government offices to check and ensure that all their entire staff is vaccinated," Patel further stated.To ramp up the second dose coverage, Patel said his department will launch a drive using the available data, to ensure that people take their next dose in time. People need not worry about the availability of vaccines, as the Gujarat government has nearly 40 lakh doses of the vaccine, Patel added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/90-eligible-population-in-gujarat-vaccinated-with-first-dose-health-minister-101634809834545.html

Her father actor Chunky Panday accompanied him. Though the actor was summoned to the NCB office at 2pm, Ananya Panday started around an hour late from her residence and reached the agency office at around 4pm. Reports said her laptop, mobile were seized by the agency. Ananya has not been named as a suspect and the agency has called her to only record her statement.Reports said Ananya Panday will be asked whether she knows Aryan Khan, whether she has seen Aryan Khan consuming drugs etc.The special NDPS court denied bail to Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, terming them parts or links of a bigger drug network. The NCB on Wednesday submitted Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats and said that the agency has found the mention of a ‘debut actress’. Though the name of the actor was not disclosed, NCB's summon to Ananya Panday indicates that Ananya's name might have featured in Aryan Khan's chats that the NCB referred to. Ananya has already had her debut in 2019 and starred in several movies.No NCB raid, team visited 'Mannat' to collect docus related to Aryan Khan: Sameer Wankhede#WATCH | Mumbai: Actor Ananya Panday leaves from her residence for the NCB office as she has been summoned for questioning today pic.twitter.com/t0m2JcViY4#WATCH | Mumbai: Actor Ananya Panday, her father Chunky Panday reach NCB office.

There was no raid on Sha Rukh Khan's house, the agency later clarified.Ananya Panday is the latest Bollywood personality to come on NCB radar as the agency summoned dozens of Bollywood actors for interrogation linked to its ongoing probe into the drugs case that came to the fore after the arrest of actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty on charges of procuring drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput. Ananya's name has cropped up in the latest Aryan Khan case, where WhatsApp chats have served as major evidence against Aryan Khan as Khan was not found with drugs. The NCB said it is immaterial whether he was found with drugs or not as he is not new to drug consumption and was aware that his friend Arbaaz Merchant was carrying charas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ananya-pandey-heads-to-ncb-office-responding-to-summon-over-aryan-khan-case-101634810980490.html

They are right to do so. For decades, Myanmar, a country of immense natural wealth, has been impoverished by bad governance,” the statement says.It also suggests a way forward to establish a “workable democracy” in the country which may result in the Tatmadaw return to its honourable role of a national army. The Tatmadaw is the official name of the armed forces of Myanmar. “Authoritarian rule... is destroying even the meagre democratic gains of the past two decades. If these gains are to be restored, this will come through people who build trust across the country’s divisions and unite Myanmar’s people, giving the ethnic minorities their rightful role in national affairs,” the statement said.Also Read: Myanmar junta to release over 5,600 prisoners jailed for anti-coup stirThe signatories affirmed that people across different nations can help and support the people of Myanmar by working through governments, institutions and the media to keep the spotlight on Myanmar and persuade the Tatmadaw to heed the people.“The crises we face will only be overcome if both leaders and citizens accept the new level of responsibility that our imperilled planet demands. As we work to help Myanmar in its hour of need, we are helping create a world fit for our children and grandchildren to grow up in,” it added.Signatories of the declaration of support included Dr. Wati Aier, convenor of Forum for Naga Reconciliation (FNR); Niketu Iralu, peace activist, social worker for fresh thinking, regional stability and development, Nagaland; L Wanglat, former home and finance minister, Arunachal Pradesh; Sanjoy Hazarika, commentator and author, Assam; Radhabinod Koijam, former chief minister of Manipur; Professor Amar Yumnam, former vice-chancellor, Manipur University among several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-declare-solidarity-with-myanmar-people-101634808925912.html

The move by Mayawati, who slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over the custodial death, came a day after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited the Dalit victim’s family amid high drama that also included her brief detention at the police lines. “The custodial death of a sanitation worker in Agra is most saddening. A party delegation led by Gayacharan Dinkar would visit Agra, meet the victim’s kin and also interact with officials to get justice in the case,” Mayawati tweeted. Mayawati also referred to the recent killing of a Kanpur trader in Gorakhpur and said that both Gorakhpur and now Agra incidents have put the BJP government in the dock. “The BJP government is in the dock and the BSP demands that necessary changes in the policing system are made,” she tweeted. Earlier on Wednesday, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi managed to meet the Dalit victim’s family after a nearly three-hour long standoff with the police.

The victim’s family has contradicted the police claim. Taking note of the political controversy generated by the case, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said that no one will be allowed to take law and order into their hands.

The statement was made by the NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede.Led by senior officials, the NCB team's visit to the Bollywood superstar’s residence, Mannat, in suburban Bandra came hours after Khan visited his son at Arthur Road Jail in Central Mumbai for the first time since his arrest earlier this month in a drugs-related case.“NCB team visited Shah Rukh Khan's residence to collect some documents related to Aryan Khan. No raids were conducted at ‘Mannat’,” Wankhede was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | Nawab Malik questions Sameer Wankhede's 'Maldives' link as NCB summons Ananya Pandey, visits SRK's houseLater, Wankhede issued a statement saying the officials visited the superstar's residence “for seeking certain material related to the investigation of the case” from Khan by “following due procedure of notice”. “It wasn’t a raid as erroneously reported in certain sections/channels of media,” it further read. NCB deputy director general Ashok Mutha Jain also said no search operation was conducted at the actor's house. “We had gone there as part of procedural requirement,” he was quoted as saying.Aryan was arrested with a few others on October 3 after the NCB raided a Goa-bound cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and claimed to have seized drugs, including charas.Another team of the NCB also visited actor Ananya Pandey's residence in Bandra and reportedly asked her to appear before agency officers later in the day to record her statement.On Wednesday, a special court denied bail to Aryan, stating that 'on the face of it', he was indulging in "illicit drug activities on a regular basis". His WhatsApp chats also showed, prima facie, that he was in touch with drug peddlers, the court noted. Aryan Khan subsequently moved the Bombay High Court to challenge the lower court's order. The high court on Thursday said it would hear his bail plea on October 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-raid-ncb-visited-mannat-to-collect-docus-related-to-aryan-khan-wankhede-101634806648450.html

The allegation comes as the agency on Thursday reportedly summoned Bollywood actor Ananya Panday in connection with the drugs case in which Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan has been arrested. Reports said Ananya's name featured in some of the WhatApp chats the NCB has accessed. उगाही का धंधा मालदीव में! pic.twitter.com/ECzlOI70vGHere are the proofs! pic.twitter.com/ouq3nUXcs7 "A special officer (Sameer Wankhede) was brought in to the NCB after Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide. CBI is investigating the case but the mystery over his suicide or murder remains unresolved. But the NCB is now after the film industry. Dozens of actors were paraded before the NCB. Rhea Chakraborty was implicated," Nawab Malik said.Hinting at a deeper link between Sameer Wankhede and Bollywood, Malik said, "During the pandemic, the entire film industry was in the Maldives. Sameer Wankhede must clarify what he and his family members were doing there at that time. He should clarify whether he was in Dubai," Malik said."We are very clear. All this extortion took place in Maldives and Dubai and I will release those photos," the Maharashtra minister said.This is the latest allegation brought against the NCB by Nawab Malik whose son-in-law was also arrested by the agency in another drugs case. Recently, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar criticised the ongoing NCB operation targetting Bollywood.  Thackeray recently said the NCB is only interested in catching celebrities, getting photos and making noise, while Maharashtra Police have recovered drugs worth crores. Sharad Pawar said Nawab Malik's son-in-law was arrested by the NCB in a drugs case while the court granted him bail saying that it was not ganja, but some herbs.After Shah Rukh Khan visited Arthur Road prison on Thursday, the NCB team visited SRK's mansion for some paper works.

21-10-2021||India||Bombay HC to hear Aryan Khan’s bail plea on Oct 26||The Bombay high court will hear the bail application of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan next Tuesday on October 26. The application challenges the special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) court’s refusal of bail to Aryan in the cruise drug bust case. The court set the date after advocate Satish Maneshinde requested the single judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre for an early hearing. The court also directed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to file its reply by Monday, October 25.The bench declined the request to hear the plea through video conferencing and said it will be through physical mode. The bail plea of model Munmun Dhamecha, another accused in the case, will also be heard on Tuesday.The special NDPS court had rejected Aryan’s bail applications on Wednesday, observing that a prima facie case of conspiracy and illicit drug trade by the accused was made out. The special court had reached the conclusion based on WhatsApp chats recovered from the mobile phone of Aryan Khan and his friend Arbaaz Merchant, which, the NCB had argued, showed that the accused were involved in dealing with the narcotic substances on a regular basis.The NCB also submitted before the special court that Aryan Khan was aware that his co-accused Arbaaz Merchant was in possession of the contraband before they were to board the cruise ship.Also Read | Aryan Khan denied bail: Raees director Rahul Dholakia, Swara Bhasker reactAryan Khan’s lawyers have so far argued that since no drugs were found on Khan he was eligible for bail and that there was no basis to the NCB’s suggestion that Aryan could be part of an illegal drugs trading syndicate. Earlier in the day, Shahrukh Khan visited Aryan, who is lodged in Arthur Road Jail. Aryan was arrested along with several others on October 3 in connection with a drug seizure on a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast following a raid by the NCB. A total of 20 people have been arrested so far in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-aryan-khan-s-bail-plea-on-oct-26-101634803885495.html

In a statement shared on Twitter, the global health body's South-East Asia regional director Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh said, "Huge congratulations to India for marking yet another milestone, a billion Covid-19 vaccine doses administered."She added that this extraordinary feat in a short period was not possible without strong political leadership, inter-sectoral convergence, and dedicated efforts of the entire health and frontline workforce."India's progress must be viewed in the context of the country's commendable commitment and efforts to ensure these life savings vaccines are accessible globally," Dr Singh further said.She previously congratulated India on September 13, when the cumulative vaccination had crossed 750 million.It took nine months for India to administer over a billion vaccine doses to eligible beneficiaries since the beginning of the inoculation drive in January. The Union health ministry said that around 30% of the country's adult population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 while 75% of the adult population has received at least one vaccine dose.India is the second country after China to exceed one billion vaccinations. As the vaccination drive is speeding up, the Union government is trying to inoculate the entire population by the end of this year.On Thursday, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will light up 100 of its heritage monuments in the colours of the national flag to mark this incredible feat.Meanwhile, the country's caseload due to Covid-19 climbed to 34,127,450 after 18,454 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day rise since October 14.

This was a tribute to health professionals, frontline workers, scientists, vaccine manufacturers and the citizens of the country who bravely fought the pandemic, officials said. India today achieved the milestone of administering a billion vaccine doses as part of the national inoculation drive which started in January.Among the 100 monuments were seventeen UNESCO World Heritage Sites including the Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Humayun Tomb, Tughlaqabad Fort, Purana Qila, Fatehpur Sikri Agra, Ramappa Temple, Hampi, Dholavira (Gujarat), ancient Leh Palace; Currency Building and Metcalf Hall in Kolkata; Khajuraho temples (MP), and Golconda Fort in Hyderabad.India's Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched on January 16, 2021. Initially, the vaccination was opened for Health Care Workers (HCWs) only. Later, it was expanded to cover persons above 60 years of age and those above 45 years with associated specified 20 comorbidities. It was further expanded to all people above 45 years of age from April 1. From May 1, all adults above 18 years of age became eligible for Covid-19 vaccination.Commemorating the “historic” day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the nation now has strong armour of 100 crore Covid vaccine doses to combat the biggest pandemic in 100 years.

21-10-2021||India||One billion done, but daily dose administration sees near-consistent decline||The billionth Covid-19 vaccine shot was administered in India on Thursday morning--exactly nine months and five days after the country’s vaccination programme kicked off on January 16. The milestone comes as new infections and active cases in the country are at the lowest levels since early March, or in over seven months.As of 11.30am on Thursday, 1,000,220,711 shots of the Covid-19 vaccine were administered across the country to 708.4 million people, according to data available on the Union health ministry’s CoWIN dashboard. Of these, around 880 million doses have been of Covishield (the brand name under which Pune-based Serum Institute of India has been manufacturing the vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca). Over 114 million doses have been of Covaxin (the shot developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the country’s apex biomedical research regulator, the Indian Council of Medical Research).In absolute numbers, the milestone places India as the second country in the world (next to China with 2.2 billion shots administered) in terms of total Covid-19 vaccine doses administered.Of the 708.4 million people, who have been administered these shots, 416.6 million have been partially vaccinated, while 291.8 million people have received both doses. When seen alongside India’s estimated population of 940 million adults, 44.3% of the country’s adults have been partially vaccinated and another 31% fully. This means in total, three out of every four adults (75.4%) in the country have received at least one shot.Also Read | Consistency key, efforts must go on: Dr VK Paul on 1-billion Covid vaccine featA cause of concern for the drive, however, is that daily dose administration has now seen a near-consistent decline from the peak levels during the second half of September – a factor that Union health ministry officials and experts have attributed to low turnout during the ongoing festive season and the vaccine hesitancy threshold finally being visible.The seven-day average of daily dose administration, a statistic that evens out the dip generally seen over weekends, touched a peak of 9.7 million for the week ending September 23 when several states increased daily numbers to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday on September 17. In the month since, however, it has dropped nearly 60% to around 4 million shots a day on average in the past week.An easy way to grasp the impact of this drop in vaccination pace is to see it as the required run rate in the final overs of a cricket match. In the race for vaccination, as is the case in a run chase, a slower run rate in the middle of an innings requires heavy slogging in the final few overs. In the case of vaccination, if the country had sustained its administration rate of around 10 million doses a day around the third week of September, then it would have been on course to meet its December 31 target of fully vaccinating all adults. But since this rate has dropped in the 25 days since, the required rate has shot up – now India needs to administer more than 12 million doses every day till the end of the year to meet this target. At the rate of administration in the past week (4 million a day, as stated above), however, this target will be delayed by more than five months, data shows.Such a calculation, of course, assumes that the entire adult population of the country will want vaccines, an unlikely proposition. Most experts fear the vaccine drive will hit a ceiling around the 75-80% level.Vaccine hesitancy, which was not visible in the initial months of the inoculation drive due to limited supply of doses and high rush for shots in a population of the size of India, is becoming more visible now as coverage has reached high numbers in recent weeks.Experts across the world have warned that any supposed vaccine hesitancy would start showing signs after countries hit a high coverage threshold. This is because those who were going to get their shots have now done so, and those who still remain away from vaccination centres are the ones who are hesitant.This has been the reason why even countries such as the United States, which have far better vaccine coverage than countries like India, have been unable to hit 100% coverage.Government officials have said the Union government plans to start a dedicated campaign to create awareness among the masses to overcome vaccine hesitancy once the billion-dose target is achieved. “After 100 crore (1 billion) Covid-19 vaccine doses are administered in the country, we will work on running a massive campaign for generating awareness about taking the second dose, and also addressing overall vaccine hesitancy,” said a government functionary who asked not to be named.“There is still a section that needs convincing to take the shot. It is also important for everyone who has already taken one dose to take their second shot ... taking both are important for maximum protection,” a second government official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-out-of-every-4-adults-in-india-have-received-at-least-one-covid-19-vaccine-shot-101634801846092.html

The study found correlations between death row incarcerations and mental illness. “The proportion of persons with mental illness and intellectual disability on death row is overwhelmingly higher than the proportions in the community population,” said the study.The findings of the study titled “Deathworthy: A Mental Health Perspective of the Death Penalty” were released after five years of research.“The big problem is that the death penalty sentencing process has been whittled down to such a formality that there is no time to conduct the kind of tests and assessments required to identify the disability,” said Maitreyi Misra, the lead author of the study.The report noted a UN General Assembly resolution in December 2020 urged countries not to impose the death penalty on individuals suffering from mental or intellectual disabilities. “In the case of nine prisoners, their disability was not even brought to the attention of the courts. Three of these nine prisoners had their mercy petition rejected by the President,” said Misra. She added judges have the power to call for psychological evaluations.Also Read: Why India’s civil services need corporate management structures and cultureAs many as 60% of the prisoners were no longer on death row. But it was not due to the discovery of mental illnesses or intellectual disabilities, but due to sociological factors. “In none of the cases, mental illnesses were the reason for acquittal or sentence reduction. The grounds taken in commuting death penalty sentences were reformation, social-economic circumstances, or young age when convicted. But mental illnesses and intellectual disability were not factors,” said Misra.B L Vohra, a retired Indian Police Service officer, said whether it is a physical ailment or mental ailment, prisoners are given the required care. “...only when a person is deemed fit, they are given the death penalty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mental-illnesses-deficits-in-intellectual-functioning-common-among-death-row-prisoners-study-101634799925538.html

PSN is essentially a technique of fishing that utilises a purse seine to capture large schools of fish.The division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar issued the directive on a petition filed by five fishermen, one from Mumbai and four from Ratnagiri district, engaged in PSN fishing. They had challenged the validity of February 5, 2016 order issued by the fisheries department, reserving certain areas along the shore for traditional fishing and restricting PSN fishing beyond certain limits of the territorial waters. The order also laid down strict norms for purse seine nets. They contended that the order was violative of their fundamental right to profess an occupation and that there was no effective consultation, as contemplated under the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981 and views of the PSN fishermen were not taken into account before issuing the order. Fisheries department, on the other hand, maintained that PSN fishing was allowed in about 60% of the coastline between September and December and the order balanced the rights of traditional fishermen and the PSN fishermen, who use mechanised boats. Also Read: Shiv Sena leader alleges ₹500 crore scam in BJP-led municipal corporationHigh court, in its order, noted that the February 2016 order was based on recommendations made by a committee set up by the state government in September 2011 which had recommended that the fish stock situation be reviewed every five year and fresh decision be taken as regards PSN fishing for the next five years. HC noted that despite the lapse of considerable period, the fisheries department had not reviewed the fish stock along the coastline and directed that it be done. The court also said that following the survey, a fresh decision in regard to PSN fishing is taken after due consultation with the District Advisory Committees and after hearing the representatives of the PSN fishermen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-told-to-review-fish-stock-along-konkan-coast-for-fresh-view-on-psn-fishing-101634799325616.html

The deployment is aimed at boosting the Indian Army's overall fire power in the face of China's aggressive posturing following the eastern Ladakh standoff, they further told the news agency.The tensions between the Indian and Chinese militaries in the eastern Ladakh border escalated last year following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley. Since then, both sides have been holding a series of military and diplomatic talks to end the disengagement.

21-10-2021||India||Anatomy of planned desecration and riots in Bangladesh||The Bangladesh Police said they have identified the man who placed the Quran in one of the Durga Puja pandals in Comilla on October 13, an act which triggered violence and led to the killing of three people. He has been identified as 35-year-old Iqbal Hossain from Sujanagar area of the city.According to local media, 41 suspects have been arrested for the Comilla incident and four of them are Hossain's associates. Two of the associates have been identified as Fayez and Ekram Hossain.According to Dhaka watchers, the Sheikh Hasina government is trying to unearth the conspiracy behind the planned desecration and then fan up communal flames against the minority Hindu community in the south of the country. While evidence is being pieced together, there is a strong possibility that rabid Islamists belonging to Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, who are supporters of the Taliban, would be behind this orchestration of communal violence. The objective was not only to embarrass the Sheikh Hasina government but also put a strain on excellent bilateral relations between two neighbours.The media in Bangladesh quoted police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, to report that the dark green-coloured Quran, which was found placed below the feet of Lord Ganesha in the Puja pandal in Comilla, was not printed in Bangladesh but brought from Saudi Arabia by Fayez.The officials said that Fayez returned to Bangladesh from Saudi Arabia a year ago and set up a mobile service shop in Comilla. On the day of the incident, he brought the people of the area to the pandal and Ekram called up the emergency services numbers 999 to inform the police that a Quran was found in the Puja area.They said the Quran is believed to be Fayez's personal copy of the scripture."We didn't see the scripture. Suddenly, two young men got excited and started shouting, 'Quran found in puja mandapa, Quran found in puja mandapa'," media quoted Subodh Roy, president of the puja celebration committee as saying.Fayez later hosted a Facebook Live video, in which he said provocative things, media reports in Bangladesh said. Both Fayez and Ekram are currently in police custody.Iqbal Hossain was identified by the police after analysing video footages of the CCTV cameras installed at the Durga Puja venues. He has not yet been arrested.In the footage, Hossain is seen taking the Quran from a local mosque and walking into a Durga Puja venue. He was later seen walking away with the club of Lord Hanuman, a report in Dhaka Tribune said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anatomy-of-planned-desecration-and-riots-in-bangladesh-101634792814812.html

21-10-2021||India||Authorities try crop diversification to check human-animal conflict around UP||Authorities in Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit have launched a campaign to check human-animal conflict around the tiger reserve there through crop diversification. “Since tigers can easily hide in sugarcane fields, they provide big cats a semblance of natural habitat. The tigers attack and kill farmers when they come across each other. We launched the campaign to persuade cane farmers to shift to equally remunerative alternative crops...,” said district magistrate Pulkit Khare. “After several rounds of discussions with progressive farmers and experts, crops such as haldi, laahi, sarson, matar, chana, soyabean, mentha, lemon, kheera, parval, lemongrass, khus and rose were identified as alternatives.”Khare said farmers would spend nights in their cane fields guarding their crops or moving in a group with torches while harvesting them. “They were then told about equally or even more remunerative crops as alternatives to the sugarcane plantation. ...medicinal and aromatic crops even drove the herbivores away due to their pungent odour, further reducing the chances of a tiger chasing prey and entering these fields.”The campaign has started yielding results. Khare cited a 2020-21 survey and said cane was gown on 1,04,213 hectares of land. “...(This has) reduced to 1,02,114 hectares...in 2021-22.” He added the reduction of around 2,099 hectares (3.5%) of cane area was a result of the campaign to motivate and train farmers for alternative safer crops which would reduce human-animal conflict too.Amandeep Singh, a farmer who has started growing vegetables instead of sugarcane near a jungle, said tigers would often come to his field.Gurumangat Singh Cheema, another farmer, said he has begun growing mentha and potato in his four-acre field.”(I) get equally good returns without any fear of tigers, who would easily hide in cane fields.”Pilibhit Tiger Reserve is home to Indian leopard, swamp deer, hispid hare, floricans as well as an estimated 65 tigers. Tigers would often stray into nearby villages. “In the last five years, 15 humans have been injured and 21 lives lost in such conflicts. Fencing the entire perimeter of the reserve is a mammoth project which moves slowly each year as per the availability of budget,” said Khare.Also Read: ‘Problematic’ tiger caught alive in 21-day operationThe lighting of the fire, the beating of drums to scare away the animals, moving in groups for irrigation or manuring were tried but did not help much in reducing the conflict and forced the administration to rethink their strategy.“Analysis showed a high percentage of such conflict in the sugarcane fields adjoining the jungle; 12 out of 21 deaths in the last five years were reported in sugarcane fields,” said Khare.“Sugarcane tigers” stray out of the reserve and adopt sugarcane fields as their habitat. These include sub-adults pushed out of the forest by dominant tigers. “Cane fields also provide a semblance of the forest ecosystem with long canes often providing hiding places...,” said Khare. He added farmers were reluctant but were convinced to shift to plantations of pulses, medicinal plants. Training sessions were also conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/authorities-try-crop-diversification-to-check-human-animal-conflict-around-uttar-pradesh-tiger-reserve-101634791105351.html

It also urged the government to carry out the evaluation of final year colleges and university students on the basis of reduced syllabi. AVBP called for increasing the number of centres for holding one-day entrance examinations for admission to reputed colleges and universities.“Apart from increasing the intake in colleges, there needs to be a review of how marks are being doled out by certain state boards.

The milestone was achieved half an hour after 10am. Also Read | List of 10 states with highest vaccination coverageThe number is twice the number of vaccines administered in the United States, five times that of Japan, nine times that of Germany and 10 times the number of vaccine doses administered in France, the government said in a presentation hailing the 'vaccine century'.It said that 75 per cent of eligible population has taken the first dose and eight states and union territories (UTs) - Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Goa and Lakhshadweep - have achieved 100 per cent first dose coverage. It also said that four states and UTs have more than 90 per cent coverage of the first dose.It took just nine months for the country to cross the historic figure. The government has planned a number of events to mark the occasion, including launching of a song and display of the country's largest tricolour at the Red Fort in Delhi.Also Read | 3 in 4 Indians get at least 1 Covid vaccine jabAfter the billionth dose was administered, the Centre recounted the journey to 100 crore vaccine doses in the presentation, which listed the milestones crossed by the nationwide vaccination programme since its launch on January 16, 2021. It said that CoWIN - the digital platform being used for keeping records of vaccination - has so far registered 76 crore beneficiaries. It also said that India used drones for the first time to deliver vaccines to remote corners of the country.The government said that the first 10 crore (100 million) doses were administered in just 85 days of the launch of the vaccination drive.Also Read | Focus on second dose coverage, says CentreThe inoculation programme has been speeding up since its launch, recording 25 million vaccinations in a day on September 17 (Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday), which translated to 15.62 lakh doses per hour, or 26,000 doses per minute or 434 doses every second.It also said that this is the fastest vaccination drive ever, comparing the 1 billion milestone with polio and tuberculosis (TB) drives. While one billion doses of Covid vaccine were administered in just nine months, it took 20 years for the polio drive (1994-2014) and 32 years for TB vaccination (1989 and still ongoing) to cross the milestone.The government release further said that the Covid vaccine is the fastest to be introduced for inoculation - it was developed in 2020 and implemented in the starting of 2021. Others like BCG, Hepatitis-B and measles vaccines took decades before they were introduced.Other achievements include introduction of two made in India vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - within 11 months of the discovery of the first case in the country and fastest ever approvals granted for the vaccines.Only China has administered a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines till now (and also has a population of more than one billion). It crossed the milestone in June.Despite the high number of Covid-19 vaccination, the opposition parties have questioned the government about how it can fulfill its promise of administering both doses of the vaccine to all the eligible adults in the country by December 31. The Congress said the number of eligible adults is 95 crore and there's still a long way to go before all of them receive both the doses of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-in-9-months-govt-hails-historic-milestone-101634789471695.html

He has written a letter to BJP leader Kirit Somaiya citing his “influence” over the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and to ensure a probe into the matter. Raut called Somaiya a “scam crusader” and said he has given him proof, and documents related to the alleged scam in the smart city project.Somaiya has been in the news for “exposing” alleged financial wrongdoings, land scams, unauthorised constructions. He has attacked Maharashtra’s ruling alliance leaders including chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, ministers Hasan Mushrif, Anil Parab, and Raut.Raut wrote the letter days after asking the ministers to launch a counter attack and respond to allegations that political opponents were levelling against them.In a tweet, Raut said, “Sent following letter to ‘Scam crusader’ @kiritsomaiya. It gives details of misappropriation of funds to the tune of 500 cr ₹in the smart city project run by Pimpri Chinchwad corporation ruled by BJP. Hope he will use his influence on ED to start the investigation.”Also Read: Revenue higher than last year despite fewer property registrations in MaharashtraIn the two-page letter dated October 11, Raut alleged tenders were floated and the conditions for them were tailored for certain companies in 2018-2019. He added even 50% of the work on the project was not completed even as the deadline has ended. “This is a clear case of misappropriation of government funds and public money to the tune of a whopping ₹500 crores only for the benefit of these two companies. It is also quite clear that the tenders were awarded to these companies by corrupt practices, misuse of power and under tremendous political pressure.” Raut wrote there is a general perception that agencies like ED conduct thorough investigations in all matters that Somaiya brings to their notice. “Hence, instead of sending this sensitive file to ED or any other investigative agencies, I am sending it directly to you, with the hope that you will investigate this matter thoroughly, and after you find the kind of corruption that has taken place, you will send the file to ED for further investigation and necessary action.”Somaiya declined to comment, saying he has not received any letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-leader-alleges-rs-500-crore-scam-in-bjp-led-municipal-corporation-101634789904821.html

After its late withdrawal from northwest India, the southwest monsoon remains active over some parts of the country, the withdrawal line currently passing through Kohima, Silchar, Krishnanagar, Baripada, Malkangiri, Nalgonda, Bagalkote, and Vengurla.Also Read | Monsoon is over. But why is it raining so much in October? Here's the answerThe IMD said that the conditions will become favourable for the further retreat of southwest monsoon from around October 23 in the remaining parts of northeast India, the entire north Bay of Bengal region, the remaining parts of West Bengal and Odisha, certain parts of central Bay of Bengal, parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, entire Goa, some more parts of Karnataka and the central Arabian Sea.The MeT department said that with northeasterly winds likely to hit the lower tropospheric (lowest level of the Earth's atmosphere) levels over the Bay of Bengal and extreme south Peninsular India, the southwest monsoon is likely to leave the entire country around next Tuesday. It is from this date that northeast monsoons are also set to commence over southeast Peninsular India.The withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from northwest India commenced on October 6, this time being the second-most delayed withdrawal of the southwest monsoon since 1975.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-set-to-depart-but-more-rain-forecast-from-tamil-nadu-to-leh-here-s-why-101634784115716.html

The government has indicated that further relaxations for train travel could be provided post-Diwali if cases continue to remain low. Currently, only fully vaccinated people are allowed to use the Mumbai suburban train services. The state government has been easing Covid containment restrictions gradually since mid-August and will now allow theatres and drama auditoriums to operate with 50% occupancy from October 22. On Tuesday, it extended operational hours for shops and restaurants in the state.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is monitoring the Covid situation minutely and has been speaking to the state Covid task force and senior officials. I think, post-Diwali, if there are not many cases or a high positivity rate, the chief minister can think about this [allowing all commuters on trains] positively,” health minister Rajesh Tope said to a TV news channel. Also Read: Colleges resume physical classes in MaharashtraThe government considered allowing commuters who had taken at least one shot of a Covid vaccine to use the suburban trains network. However, the move was deferred till cases drop further, state officials said.

21-10-2021||India||India-China to talk border again, focus on resolving Hot Springs||India and China have agreed to hold another meeting of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs this month to resolve the deadlock arising out of 13th round of senior commanders meeting on October 10. Both sides have agreed to hold the meeting, but the dates are still to be finalised.According to officials based in New Delhi and Beijing, the WMCC, headed by additional secretary level officials on both sides, will have tough time resolving disengagement and restoring patrolling rights to Indian Army in Depsang Bulge and Charding Nullah Junction (CNJ), Demchok, due to recalcitrant attitude of the Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA).It is understood that during the 13th round of military commanders meeting, the PLA resorted to half-measures to resolve the disengagement in Hot Springs area by refusing to move back to permanent bases or restoring status quo ante as existed in April 2020. In May 2020, the PLA using huge volume of troops unilaterally changed the ground positions on north banks of Pangong Tso, Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs in East Ladakh in a bid to impose rejected 1959 line along the 1597 kilometer Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.While the PLA decided to move back from the present position in Hot Springs area in a half-hearted effort to resolve the friction point, they did not agree to move back to permanent base as has been stipulated in the past meetings of India-China leadership. The Indian Army representative, on its part, rejected this proposal and insisted that both sides go back to their permanent bases to resolve the Hot Springs issue.China watchers believe that the PLA will continue to drag its feet over disengagement in Hot Springs and will require a whole lot of persuasion from the Indian side to restoring patrolling rights in Depsang Bulge and CNJ area south of Demchok.The Indian side, on its part, is also in no hurry with its formations matching the PLA build-up across the LAC. Rather than seeking compromise solutions as in the past, the Modi government will not back down from enforcing its just legal claims on the LAC. Even though the focus is on disengagement and de-escalation from Ladakh LAC, the Indian Army is closely watching the Central and Eastern sector to counter any transgression from the PLA along the full 3488-km LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-to-talk-border-again-focus-on-resolving-hot-springs-101634785242541.html

But after they came into power, they failed to keep their promises,” Goswami was quoted as saying by the local media. The APCC working president also said that in the upcoming by-polls on October 30, the Congress will win in three constituencies - Thowra, Gossaigaon and Mariani - adding the party will give a tough contest in the remaining two seats.The Assam Congress had earlier observed a 'maun vrat' (vow of silence) on October 11 against the violence which erupted in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur and demanded the removal of Union minister Ajay Mishra from the top post. "The law cannot be different for VVIPs and common citizens. No effort was made to arrest the minister's son till he surrendered," APCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah had said after the protest.In this year’s assembly elections in Assam, the Congress was a part of the Mahajot alliance and won 26 seats. The BJP, meanwhile, won 60 of the total 126 seats and returned to power for a second consecutive time with the support of Asom Gana Parishad which got nine seats and United Peoples Party Liberal which got six seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-failed-to-keep-its-promises-congress-to-stage-statewide-protests-101634778878842.html

21-10-2021||India||Growing up Karanth: A biography worth reading||“Growing up Karanth,” which came out this month-- October-- is a biography of Kota Shivarama Karanth, the polymath who has been a towering figure in fiction, drama, Yakshagana ballets, science encyclopaedias, children’s books and much more. Written by Karanth’s three children, Ullas, Malavika and Kshama, Growing up Karanth is a wonderful read. (Disclosure: Ullas and his daughter, Krithi are friends of mine).Why do we read a biography? Often, because we want to get to know greatness. We are drawn to charismatic compelling figures and we want to know the ‘real person’ behind the public persona. By this measure, Growing up Karanth delivers in full measure. It takes us inside the life and mind of the Karanth family. It shows us how they lived, the kinds of food they ate, the animals they kept, and the connections they fostered. There are lovely snippets of Shivarama Karanth, the father, whom the children call “Tata”. Each of them recounts unique episodes. The eldest, Malavika talks about going with Karanth to meet his friends in the evenings and chatting him up on these long walks. All three children talk about such perambulations with their father, the road-trips they took, and how he taught them about art, architecture, music and life. The setting for all this action is Balavana, their family homestead where people would drop in to chat and connect. Here, Karanth held court, wrote his many works of literature, took in students, friends and strays, taught them things, and reframed Yakshagana into a modern form while retaining its essence. It is clear that Shivarama Karanth was someone who followed his bliss, whether it was taking on projects that threw the family more into debt, or going on a voyage to Europe to see its museums.It is also clear that his wife, Leela Alva Karanth was the anchor to his sails. She is portrayed as a vibrant, compassionate and impactful woman, at least in the early years. There are many episodes that portray Leela as someone who goes out of her way to make people comfortable-- perhaps to her detriment, as her later years show. She makes conversation with all the important people who visit their home, ensures that everyone is fed and well, and balances out her husband’s vast appetites for creation and reform. She does this with empathy and panache.There is a scene early on in the book about how Leela decided that Shivarama Karanth was the man she wanted to marry based on his beautiful hands. She proposes to him and he accedes in his own way. We all think rural Indian women are constrained by tradition and boundaries. Not so as this memoir points out. Each of us contains “multitudes,” to use Walt Whitman’s term.The best memoirs and biographies are both specific and universal. They offer a prism into their subjects but also into an ethos, a milieu. When I read the episode of Leela proposing, I remembered many other instances where rural women surprised the world by “being forward” in their approach. Most of us deal with stereotypes. Occasionally a good book goes above them.The book also portrays both parents in all their complexities. The authors write about the tragedies that befell the family. They lost an elder brother, Harsha, very young. Leela was later diagnosed as bi-polar with alternating manic and depressive episodes. Karanth himself became enamoured with a much younger woman whom they call M in the book.Good biographies are cathartic both for the readers and the creators. They offer a glimpse into the inner and outer worlds of the subject. The best ones have a feeling-tone that allows the inner life of the subjects to fall off the page. At the end of the book, I was fascinated by-- and learned a lot about-- the world that Leela and Karanth inhabited, about the many hues of their relationships, about their magnificent largesse of mind and spirit and the myriad small things that make up the landscape of Karnataka. There are many types of biographies. The ones I love the most are exactly like Growing up Karanth-- written not as a worshipful hagiography but as gritty reality. The book portrays both Shivarama Karanth and his talented wife, Leela Alva Karanth as fascinating, complicated human beings-- each of them large-hearted and enormously talented in their own way, each with their own specific human frailties. Most important of all, I saw in their lives, shades of mine. I saw in their relationships, people who I had known. The feelings expressed in the book held a mirror to my own feelings. Isn’t that what you want from a good book? To lose yourself. Growing up Karanth will no doubt make many readers lose themselves in the book.(Shoba Narayan is Bangalore-based award-winning author. She is also a freelance contributor who writes about art, food, fashion and travel for a number of publications).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/growing-up-karanth-a-biography-worth-reading-101634756123976.html
21-10-2021||India||BJP looks to win over ‘voters of tomorrow’ for 2029 polls||The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has set its sights on preteens and adolescents who will be eligible voters in the 2029 general elections and is planning an outreach aimed at this demographic group to ensure they are not “influenced by the communist and anti-national narrative” said party functionaries aware of the details. The decision to woo the “voters of tomorrow” is an outcome of a series of meetings held over the past few months including the recent national office bearers meet in the capital on Monday, the functionaries added. The party’s ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has also stressed on reaching out the youth. “We are not only looking at 2024 but at 2029 (general elections). There is a concern (in the party) that while the communist parties have lost political ground they have still managed to retain the mind space (of the young). As a result we see the younger lot on social media platforms gravitating towards the communists and have cultivated negative perceptions about the BJP,” a senior party functionary said on condition of anonymity. Commenting on the social media discourse that is helping cement perceptions against the BJP, the functionary added, “Negative comments and sentiments that evoke the feeling of being wronged get a lot of traction. Sometimes our own kids question us based on the social media narrative.” The party plans to launch campaigns that will focus on different age groups. Interestingly , the BJP is already popular among the young: according to a Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey conducted after the 2019 general elections, the BJP topped the list of parties with 41% votes from voters in the age group of 18-22 years, which was nearly the double of what the other parties including the Congress ended up with. The party was also popular among those between 23-27 years of age. It is clear the party doesn’t want to lose that base. “The party’s own post-poll analysis also show that BJP was the most preferred party for the first time voters and the younger lot was attracted to the party because of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi’s development agenda. The percentage of youth voting for the party rose in 2019 by about four to five percentage points,” a second party functionary said on condition of anonymity. In 2014, when the BJP came to power at the Centre with a majority, it’s big win was partly credited to the support it got from the first time voters. There were 23.1 million first time voters in 2014 and post poll surveys showed that the party won 39% of the vote from this category. In 2019 there were 84 million crore first time voters. “Since 2013 the BJP has planned campaigns pivoted around the young and issues that concern them such as jobs, development and economy. The policies of the government that created avenues for earning through schemes such as Startup India and Mudra loans is a key reason why the party continues to get support fromthem,” the second functionary added. To retain its hold over the young demographic, the party has decided to groom its leaders, particularly young leaders, in subjects such as human rights, cyber laws, and laws pertaining to atrocities against women and scheduled castes and tribes.It also plans to get articulate young leaders put forth its views. “We are often attacked by our opponents on these issues, so it is imperative that the party leaders should be ready with facts and figures to counter allegations. Language proficiency is another issue that we will focus on,” the first functionary said. The overall idea is to create a “positive narrative” about issues that the BJP raises such as “nationalism” and “social harmony”, this person added. Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Studies on Developing Societies who has written extensively on the BJP‘s gains from the younger demographic group said: ”It is easier for the party to sway the young, who have not seen any other government and are therefore are unable to make comparisons. The BJP has been the biggest beneficiary of first-time voters and these fresh minds are easier to mobilise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-looks-to-win-over-voters-of-tomorrow-for-2029-polls-101634756062775.html
21-10-2021||India||Experts fear last-minute spike in farm fires this year||The late withdrawal of monsoon and the off-season showers over north-west India might have temporarily helped Delhi’s air to shake off the adverse impact of stubble fires, but with the next crop season fast approaching, environmentalists and weather experts have warned that the stubble fire count could rise fast in the coming days, and Delhi might be in for some intense pollution spells soon.After heavy, widespread rain over parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi over the past two days, satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) showed an increase in “red dots”—representing stubble fires—over the region.The impact of this high number of fires was also seen in Delhi’s air on Wednesday, as the air quality index climbing to 221, into the “poor” zone once again, after a welcome spell of good air days. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) analysis showed that high stubble fires were the primary reason behind the fall in air quality.According to Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), 746 fires were reported on Wednesday from Punjab and Haryana, which contributed 12% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels.Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, said fire counts could be low because farmers cannot set wet fields on fire, and while the stubble season is delayed this year, the number of fires is catching up with that of previous years.“From Tuesday, we are seeing from satellite images that after the clouds cleared up, smoke is visible over north-west India. Get ready for more intense burning and smoky skies in the coming weeks,” said Gupta.IMD scientist Ashim Mitra also tweeted satellite images of stubble fire smoke enveloping north-west India on Wednesday. He said these fires may have not been detected because of the cloud cover and rain, but after the rainfall stopped from Tuesday, the smoke started reappearing on satellite images.“A fall in temperature and winds may bring pollutants from these fires into neighbouring states,” Mitra said.Other scientists that HT spoke to also said these post-monsoon showers were only delaying the stubble fires in agrarian states and were not necessarily an indication of the season seeing a cumulative drop in stubble count.They also said with the IMD forecasting more rain in parts of Punjab and Haryana on October 23-24, the window before the next crop sowing will only shorten, leading to more stubble fires and intense pollution in the Capital in the coming weeks.“There is a western disturbance passing over the region on October 23-24 and under its impact, parts of Punjab and Haryana is likely to receive heavy rainfall. Delhi-NCR is only likely to see cloudy skies and isolated, light showers,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet.An analysis by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) shows that between September 1 and October 19, over 4,345 farm fires were recorded in Punjab, and 2,034 farm fires in Haryana. Experts said while the number of farm fires is lower this year compared to 2020, it is higher compared to the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019.“This year’s farm fires have been low so far, compared to the kharif season last year because of the delayed harvest on account of the extended monsoon. However, it is important to note that the year 2020 is an anomaly due to multiple reasons, such as significant adoption of the direct seeding technique for paddy sowing due to labour scarcity on account of Covid-19 pandemic. This resulted in an early harvest and an early and extended stubble burning season last year. Farm fires reported in Punjab so far are higher compared to the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019,” said LS Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW.She added, “That said, the delay due to extended monsoon will only add to the time crunch faced by farmers in managing stubble and preparing the fields for the next crops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-fear-last-minute-spike-in-farm-fires-this-year-101634755950967.html

21-10-2021||India||Congress suffers jolt as prominent Jat leaders quit ahead of UP polls||In a major setback to the Congress in Uttar Pradesh ahead of elections next year, former Rajya Sabha MP and four-time MLA Harendra Malik and his son, Pankaj Malik, quit the party on Tuesday.While the father-son duo have not said anything about their future plans, speculations are rife that they may join the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party soon.Harendra, a four-time MLA, was a member of Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s advisory committee. He is also a prominent Jat face in western Uttar Pradesh.“I have resigned for some unavoidable reasons. I served the party for 18 years and am not a man of levelling charges while quitting,” Harendra told HT on Tuesday.Harendra was a member of Rajya Sabha from Indian National Lokdal in 2004. He served as the party’s state chief and widened its support base before joining the Congress 18 years ago. Harendra’s son, Pankaj, is a former MLA and was serving as the vice-president of the state Congress unit. He was also made in charge of western Uttar Pradesh. According to people familiar with the developments, the father-son duo resigned as they felt they were being ignored by the leadership.“More and more leaders, from all parties, have been coming to SP or looking to join SP because SP is the party that will defeat BJP and form the next government. Our party president had repeatedly said that all are welcome,” SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said. Political analyst and Lucknow University professor SK Dwivedi said: “Leaders from Congress or BSP are joining the SP. Congress is creating a buzz but lacks organisation at the grassroots level while BSP has eroded in the state. It looks like the elections will be BJP vs SP by and large.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-suffers-jolt-as-prominent-jat-leaders-quit-ahead-of-up-polls-101634755825032.html
21-10-2021||India||Conference on PM Narendra Modi’s ‘model of governance’||After grand celebrations by the Centre and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 20 years in office, a three-day long conference has been organised by an RSS-linked organisation to discuss his governance model. Union minister Amit Shah is expected to inaugurate the conference on October 27.The conference titled ‘National conference in delivery democracy: reviewing two decades of Narendra Modi as head of government’, has been organised by Rambhau Mhalgi Pradodhni (RMP), a Mumbai-based charitable trust that works in field training people for leadership roles. The organisation, which started in 1982, is headed by former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Issues related to economic and foreign policies, citizen-centric approach and the “art of implementation” that made him “a popular leader” are likely to be the focus of the conference. A discussion is also likely on the three contentious agricultural laws, against which large scale protests by farmers are being held since November last year.Providing details of the event, Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who is the vice-chairman of RMP, said: “There will be sessions on Modi ji’s economic and foreign policies, new education policy, his philosophy of garib kalyan and how poor have benefited from the various schemes started by the government. Union home minister Amit Shah will inaugurate the event and BJP national president JP Nadda will attend the event on the last day.”Modi’s tenure as Gujarat chief minister and now Prime Minister are important milestones in the democratic process, Sahasrabuddhe said. He added that the decisions taken by Modi have focused on the welfare of people, especially the poor.“People have benefited from the schemes started by his government. This has been possible due to effective implementation. There will be experts and people at the event, who have worked with Modiji during his tenure in Gujarat and now at the Centre, to share their experience during the art of implementation session,” Sahasrabuddhe said.On the farm laws, Sahasrabuddhe said, “There will be experts on farm sectors who will discuss the government’s approach and the need for reforms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conference-on-pm-narendra-modi-s-model-of-governance-101634755644286.html

21-10-2021||India||20 cases of betting filed during IPL: CCB||The Central Crime Branch (CCB) in Bengaluru on Wednesday said it has so far registered 20 cases of betting during the Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the biggest sporting events globally. “In the recently concluded IPL, CCB booked (a) total of 20 cases of betting, seized ₹78 lakh and arrested 27,” Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (CCB), said in a statement on Wednesday.The statement came even as online gaming companies have approached the Karnataka high court seeking a stay on the legislation banning all gambling apps in the state.Patil told HT the cases were registered over the last two to three weeks or during the IPL season. “All this (cases) happened before the ban,” Patil said. He added gambling in itself is an offence under the Karnataka Police Act.The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill was passed last month and banned “any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill.”The online gaming industry, which gained significant traction during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, was slated to grow from 360 million gamers to 510 million by 2022, according to a 2021 report by All India Gaming Federation and EY. The report estimated that online real money game players were expected to grow from 80 million in 2020 to 150 million by 2023. Estimates indicate that Karnataka, known for its prowess in technology, accounts for around 15% of the country’s market.According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, 92 gaming companies registered in Bengaluru employed over 4,000 people and, in the last three years alone, attracted ₹3,000 crore in investments.Patil said the amendment to the law empowers police to crack down on such service providers.To be sure, most online gaming and gambling apps have disabled their services in Karnataka after the notification of the law on October 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-cases-of-betting-filed-during-ipl-ccb-101634755582668.html
21-10-2021||India||Karnataka AAP stages protest against civic ‘apathy’, corruption||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Karnataka on Wednesday held a protest against the poor quality of infrastructure in Bengaluru, decorating potholes with flowers and offerings, terming the event “Pothole Habba” or festival of potholes.“We are not standing in front of a pothole but a monument of the state’s corruption,” Prithvi Reddy, the party’s state convenor said on Wednesday.“The state government has spent ₹20,000 crore in the last five years on repairing roads in Bangalore. But the roads here are in a pathetic condition, accidents and deaths are common tragedy due to potholes,” he added.The protest comes even as lives are lost due to the poor condition or civic infrastructure in Bengaluru which is among the lowest quality in the country, political parties have alleged.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now started to fill potholes after at least three people died over the last couple of months.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there have been 18 deaths in Bengaluru due to civic apathy, which is several times more than all other major urban centres of the country put together.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been in control of the BBMP since 2010. However, there has been no elected councillors in the BBMP for over a year now. The recent heavy rains in Bengaluru continues to expose the shortcomings of the infrastructure in the city with flooding, potholes, overflowing lakes and building collapses which the civic authorities have conveniently blamed on the downpour and shirked responsibility.Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai, in the recently concluded monsoon session of the state legislature had said that over ₹20,000 crore was spent on roads in the last five years, sparking off a debate around where the money was actually used or if it was all gobbled up by corrupt politicians.Reddy demanded that a ‘White paper’ be furnished to account for the ₹20,000 crore spent in the city and the officials who were incharge of these projects.“These poor quality of works could have not happened without the active support or blessings of local MLA or corporator. The role of all such persons must be investigated,” Reddy added.The BBMP elections are likely to be held early next year and the AAP is preparing ground to contest the polls.Reddy said that if the demands of the AAP are not met within 15 days, the party will approach the courts.“The central and state governments are playing with the life of (the) common man by increasing fuel and gas prices,” Mohan Dasari, the Bengaluru city president of the political outfit said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-aap-stages-protest-against-civic-apathy-corruption-101634755525478.html
21-10-2021||India||Karnataka minister hits back at Cong, JD(S) for criticising RSS||Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka’s minister for home affairs, on Wednesday hitback at critics of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), terming the latter as nation builders founded by patriotic nationalists.“RSS is an organisation, founded by staunch patriotic nationalists, and is in the service of building a strong nation,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.He added that the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) were making defamatory remarks against the RSS, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), to get votes of minority communities.“Both the JD(S) and the Congress leaders are competing (with) each other with an eye on minorities votes,” he added.The statements come even as the Congress and JD(S) have intensified their attacks on the RSS and their attempts to saffronise the country and targeting of minorities.The BJP leadership has invited former chief minister and JD(S) leader, HD Kumaraswamy, to come and visit an RSS Shakha to see for himself the ‘good work’ done by the organisation.Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said that he wanted nothing to do with the RSS or their Shakha. “Haven’t we seen what they teach inside an RSS Shakha? When the assembly proceedings are on, watch blue films. This is what has been taught in their Shakha’s. Should I also go there and learn such things,” Kumaraswamy said.Kumaraswamy has made scathing remarks against the BJP and the Congress to put some distance between the JD(S) and the other two major political parties in the state in the run up to the October 30 bypolls in Sindgi and Hanagal.The JD(S) has been accused of fielding two Muslim candidates in both constituencies which the Congress alleged was to split the minority votes that would otherwise go to the Sonia Gandhi-led party.The Congress had accused the JD(S) of trying to cozy up to the BJP to ensure its own survival and attack the former, who both consider a common enemy. The JD(S) is the only party that has allied with both the BJP and the Congress at the state level and other local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-minister-hits-back-at-cong-jd-s-for-criticising-rss-101634755523950.html
21-10-2021||India||BSY slams Karnataka BJP chief for comments on Rahul||Former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday chided state BJP president for making “disrespectful” remarks against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday. “No one should speak of another in this manner. I will speak to him (Kateel). Dont know in what context it was said but if he has spoken like this, there is no need,” Yediyurappa said in Sindgi, one of the two bypoll-bound constituencies in Karnataka. “Whether it is Rahul Gandhi or anyone, they have certain respect and we should not speak in a manner that disrespects them,” Yediyurappa further said. Nalin Kumar Kateel, the state BJP president on Tuesday had called Rahul Gandhi a “drug addict and peddler” to target the Congress in Hubballi, about 450 kms from Bengaluru. “Your G-23 says that she is not yet the national president. Sonia Gandhi says that she is the president. One side says Rahul Gandhi should be made president. What is Rahul Gandhi? I am not saying this, but he is a drug addict, a drug peddler,” Kateel had said. The Congress had taken serious objections to the statements made by Kateel and demanded an apology from the latter. Randeep Singh Surjewala, the Congress general secretary incharge of Karnataka on Wednesday said that when someone does not get any attention from within his own party, they resort to such antics. “When someone goes mad, he tears off his clothes, throws stones at passersby, throws tomatoes to get attention,” Surjewala said in Bengaluru on Wednesday. “It is an uncultured statement made by the BJP leader in Karnataka which cannot be acceptable. Nalini Kumar Kateel being president of the party in Karnataka must apologize for his statement,” he further said. Condemning Kateel’s statement, former chief minister and Congress legislative party leader Siddaramaiah said, “He (Kateel) is an immature and uncultured politician who must take treatment in NIMHANS (centre for mental health).” There have been personal attacks made by all three parties in the run up to the October 30 bypolls which has become a big test for chief minister Basvaraj Bommai, who has been trying to emerge from the shadows of his mentor and predecessor, Yediyurappa. The BJP on Wednesday also took a dig at JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy and commented on his personal life. Taking objection to the BJP’s remark, Kumaraswamy said, “Other than looking at the problems of the people, they are trying to stir up personal issues. Who does this benefit? Does it benefit the people who are in problem. If you discuss my personal issues, I have no apprehensions on the same.” He said that there was no point in “mudslinging” as he had dirt on all of them making such personal remarks. “I am an open book. Nothing has happened in secret. There are things that have happened directly and the few times I have committed a mistake, I have rectified them and this has been recorded in the legislative assembly proceedings,” Kumaraswamy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-slams-karnataka-bjp-chief-for-comments-on-rahul-101634755522720.html
21-10-2021||India||10 years on, Bengaluru Metro project still on slow track||Exactly 10 years ago, the first 7 kms stretch of the Bengaluru metro between Byapanahalli and MG Road was flagged off, raising the hope of a city that was plunging deeper into chaos over the rise of private vehicles. However, till date, only 64 kms are operational so far. The delay in completion of the Metro project has forced over 12 million residents of Bengaluru to depend on private transport for commuting in the city. There are at least 9.4 million vehicles that ply the roads of Bengaluru, according to the Department of Urban Land Transport (DULT). Managing director of Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) while lauding the people of Bengaluru and the staff for their cooperation agreed that there is still a lot of work to be done. “Today Bengaluru Metro, BMRCL (Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited) has completed 10 years. On 20 October, 2011, the first line started. Today 10 years have been completed and this has been done with the cooperation of the people of Bengaluru, those who have lost their lands (for the project) and our employees and we have been very successful in giving this service,” Parvez said on Wednesday. He added that there was still a lot of work to be done as only 64 kms are operational so far. Till now, only the green line between Yelachenahalli and Nagasandra as well as the purple line between Byappanahalli and Kengeri are operational . The ridership of the Metro is in the range of 500,000 per day as against the BMTC, which during pre-Covid-19 accounted for over 4 million passengers or over 40% of the city’s commuters. Work for the Metro began in 2007 and the slow pace of work so far have resulted in just under 5 kms of operational lines being constructed per year. Parvez said that works are in progress and subsequent phases would take the total length to 175 kms across a city that expands to over 800 square kms by December 2024. This would mean that the agency would have to construct and operationalise 55 kms per year for the next two years or 10 times more than what it has achieved over the last 13 years (10 years since the first line became operational and 13 years since the metro works started)In a recent interview to Hindustan Times, Parvez said that the first phase was a learning experience and that the subsequent phases will progress faster. Each year of delay adds a minimum of 5% to the overall cost of the project, according to senior metro officials. The remaining phases include extension of lines towards the Bengaluru International Airport from Silk Board, one of the most congested junctions in the city, if not in the country. The ₹15,767 crore suburban rail project, another proposed solution to decongest Bengaluru, is scheduled to be completed only by 2026. Metro officials said that over 1.41 lakh vehicles have been taken off the road, leading to savings of over 13.25 lakh vehicle kms since the metro has been operationalised. The dependence on private vehicles have increased over the course of the last year and a half as people have stayed away from the public transport due to Covid-19. The poor quality of roads, inadequate public transport, increase of private vehicles has also added to the city’s crumbling infrastructure with promises on mass mobility solutions remain a distant and delayed dream which has caused more hardships due to addition of bottlenecks to the already nasty traffic snarls. With most of the roads dug up currently in Bengaluru in the name of “smart city” and other developmental projects, the dust and vehicular emissions have taken a toll on the general quality of life due to air and water pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-years-on-bengaluru-metro-project-still-on-slow-track-101634755464479.html
21-10-2021||India||NIA arrests 4 more terror associates in Kashmir||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested four more terror associates during raids, at 11 locations across Kashmir, in connection with a case to unearth a conspiracy hatched by various terrorist groups to carry out attacks in and outside the Union territory. The case was registered on October 10 and nine people were arrested by the central anti-terror probe agency on October 12 and 13.While three persons — Kamran Ashraf Reshi, Rayid Bashir and Hanan Gulzar Dar — arrested on Wednesday are residents of Srinagar, the fourth, Suhail Ahmad Thokar, is from south Kashmir’s Kulgam district.The NIA, in a statement, said the latest arrests were made following raids across multiple locations in four districts of Kashmir. “Today, NIA conducted searches at 11 locations in Srinagar, Pulwama, Kulgam and Baramulla districts of Jammu and Kashmir and arrested 4 more accused persons,” the statement said. “The searches conducted today have led to recovery and seizure of electronic devices and incriminating documents and posters, etc,” it added. Preliminary investigation revealed that the four persons were terror associates or OGWs (over the ground workers) of various proscribed terrorist organisations, the agency said.“They have been providing logistical and material support to terrorists,” it added.According to the NIA, the case pertains to information received regarding hatching of conspiracy both physically and in cyberspace for undertaking violent terrorist acts in Jammu and Kashmir and other major cities, including New Delhi, by cadres of proscribed terrorist organisations Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Al Badr and similar other outfits and their affiliates such as The Resistance Front (TRF) and People Against Fascist Forces (PAFF).The case was registered after seven civilians were killed in targeted attacks between October 2 and 7. Four non-local residents were also killed by terrorists after the case was filed. The agency is likely to take over the probe into the killings of six civilians, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-4-more-terror-associates-in-kashmir-101634755462767.html

He hailed the state Home Secretary for taking immediate steps to ease the traffic movement during the visits of VIPs to public places.Earlier, irked over the action of the police in erecting barricades on the roads and stopping all the vehicles, including that of his, which resulted in his starting the court work belatedly on October 1, the judge had slammed the police for not making any arrangement to let the judges go without any hindrance.The police had made the special arrangement, restricting the movement of vehicles in view of the 93rd birth anniversary of late film veteran Sivaji Ganesan at his memorial near Adyar bridge in RA Puram, in which chief minister M K Stalin and other ministers participated.The vehicle of the judge was also stopped for about 30 minutes. The judge had said this happened despite his assistant informing the police authorities concerned, in advance.Following summons, home secretary SK Prabakar had appeared through video-conferencing and expressed regret for the unpleasant incident. He also told the judge steps would be taken to avoid recurrence of any such incident in the future.Accordingly the decision not to hold up the traffic was taken and the same was conveyed to the judge today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-holding-up-of-traffic-for-cm-convoy-tamil-nadu-govt-tells-hc-101634755345950.html
21-10-2021||India||Centre to celebrate 1 billion doses milestone at Red Fort||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya will launch a song and an audio-visual film at the Red Fort on Thursday to celebrate the milestone of administering one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses, according to people familiar with the matter.The target is likely to be achieved on Thursday itself, so the event to commemorate it will begin at 12.30pm.While various government functionaries and other stakeholders will participate, the central government will also mark the occasion through public announcements at airports, railway stations, ports, bus stations and metro rail stations at the precise moment when India achieves the one-billion target.“People are excited about this milestone not just in India but globally also as many countries have shown interest in knowing how India has made it possible to jab so many people. The number of doses that we have already administered is even greater than the population of many countries,” said the health minister last week while elaborating on the plan.Under the national Covid-19 immunisation drive, at least 991 million vaccine doses have been administered since the countrywide drive was launched on January 16, according to government data.The states and Union territories have so far received at least one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses from the Centre and through direct procurement. States also have 107.8 million balance and unutilised doses.Many other organisations are also celebrating the event individually.The Union health minister, last week, also launched videos documenting efforts of Covid-19 warriors.From eight states, 13 Covid warriors, including doctors, ambulance drivers, volunteers and other healthcare workers have been identified as ‘Sentinels of the Soil’ and their experiences published in a book and videos.The Centre on Saturday also released a Covid-19 vaccination anthem produced by singer and musician Kailash Kher to bust myths and slay vaccine hesitancy.Close to 75% of the country’s eligible population has already received at least the first dose of the Covid vaccine with India’s Covid immunisation drive picking up pace owing to improved vaccine supplies.Also, at least 30% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated in the country so far, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-celebrate-1-billion-doses-milestone-at-red-fort-101634755261067.html
21-10-2021||India||AIADMK seeks governor action against DMK over irregularities in civic body polls||The opposition AIADMK on Wednesday petitioned the Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi seeking action on the ruling DMK for its alleged irregularities in the recently held civic body elections in nine districts of the State.AIADMK co-coordinator and former chief minister K Palaniswami, who led a delegation to petition the Governor at the Raj Bhavan here, said legal action would be initiated on former chief minister late J Jayalalithaa’s confidante V K Sasikala for claiming to be AIADMK’s general secretary. Speaking to reporters after submitting the petition, Palaniswami, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, accused the ruling DMK of indulging in irregularities during the conduct of the local body elections, and said his party’s plea for a free and fair poll went unheeded.“We gave a detailed representation to the Governor explaining how the DMK had murdered democracy and reduced the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (SEC) to the stature of a puppet in the party’s hands. We demanded action on the party,” Palaniswami said. He alleged his party candidates who won by a whisker were announced as losers while their contenders, the DMK candidates, were declared elected. “The AIADMK, initially, approached the SEC requesting for a free and fair poll but was constrained to knock at the door of the court when the plea went unheeded,” the former Chief Minister said and added that during his tenure his government conducted the polls in a democratic manner.He slammed the media for maintaining what he said was silence over an incident of an MLA entering a counting centre and allegedly walking away with a ballot box. “Why was no action taken on the poll official?,” he asked. Referring to an alleged incident of a Minister’s assistant slapping a traffic police constable in the southern Thoothukudi district, Palaniswami said the policeman was made to withdraw his complaint. “This is the situation in Tamil Nadu. Police lack security. If this is the plight of the police, then imagine what will the condition of the common man be,” he wondered.On the series of DVAC raids on former AIADMK ministers, he replied, “It’s political vendetta. We have nothing to hide, and, therefore, nothing to fear,” Palaniswami said and claimed the DMK won the local body polls by bribing the voters.Asked about Sasikala contending to be AIADMK’s general secretary, the former Chief Minister shot back: “You (media) are giving undue importance (to her). She has no connection with the AIADMK since she was expelled in 2017. Legal action will be taken against Sasikala for claiming to be the general secretary of the party.” The party had paved the way for dual leadership (under him and coordinator O Panneerselvam) democratically, and this set-up would continue, he said and ruled out any scope for rapprochement with her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmkseeks-governor-action-against-dmk-over-irregularities-in-civic-body-polls-101634755285669.html
21-10-2021||India||Sharmila begins padayatra, aims to end TRS rule||YSR Telangana party president Y S Sharmila on Wednesday kick-started her marathon padayatra (foot march), which, she said, is aimed at ending the autocratic rule of Telangana Rashtra Samithi president K Chandrasekhar Rao and bringing back “Rajanna Rajyam,” the welfare state envisioned by her father late YS Rajasekhar Reddy.Sharmila’s mother Y S Vijayalakshmi flagged off the padayatra, after a massive public rally at Chevella town in Ranga Reddy district, a place which had been sentimentally attached to her father. It was from this town that YSR took up his “Praja Prasthanam” padayatra for over 1500 km across the combined Andhra Pradesh in 2003 and brought the Congress party to power in the 2004 assembly elections.Vijayalakshmi said only Sharmila could make the Bangaru Telangana (golden Telangana) a reality. “My daughter has the courage and commitment to fulfil the aspirations of the people and dreams of late YSR,” she said and appealed to the people to bless her daughter.Addressing the rally, Sharmila, sister of YSR Congress party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, said she had embarked on a marathon padayatra only to end the arrogant and dictatorial rule of KCR, as the chief minister of Telangana is known.“Today, I am taking the first step towards heralding a welfare state in Telangana and dethroning the dynastic rule of the TRS. I shall touch every village and meet every villager during my journey,” she said.Taking a vow to expose the alleged corruption at all levels of the TRS government, Sharmila said KCR is the worst chief minister of any state in the country. “He has pushed the revenue surplus state into a debt-ridden state with indiscriminate borrowings,” she said.“Hundreds of the educated unemployed youth have died by suicide due to lack of employment opportunities, and many others turned into daily wage workers. Though official records say there are 190,000 vacancies in the state, the TRS government has not issued a single job notification so far,” she further said.Sharmila also accused the TRS government of neglecting the weaker sections. “KCR announced that he would make a Dalit as the first chief minister of Telangana after TRS came to power in 2014. He also promised three acres of land to each Dalit family. But he did not fulfil even a single promise. On the contrary, atrocities on Dalits have gone up during the TRS regime. He also has not done anything for OBCs,” she said.She also took the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party to task for failing to take on the corrupt TRS government. “Present Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy has no guts to fight against the government, as he was involved in the cash-for-vote scandal. The BJP is hand in glove with the TRS and has not been able to prove the cases against KCR,” she said.Sharmila hopes to break all the records as part of her walkathon. YSRTP official spokesman Tudi Devender Reddy said as per the route map, she would undertake padayatra for nearly 4,000 kilometres across the length and breadth of Telangana in 14 months, covering 90 assembly constituencies. “On average, she will walk for about 12-15 km a day,” Reddy said.The previous record in padayatras is held by her brother Jagan Mohan Reddy. He walked for a distance of 3,648 km over 341 days starting from November 6, 2017, to January 9, 2019, in the name of “Praja Sankalpa Yatra,” and came to power in April 2019 assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh.On the first day, Sharmila would walk for a distance of 10 km from Chevella and take the night halt at Nakkalapalli village. “Every day, she will start the padayatra at 8.30 am and take a break at 12.30 pm. She will resume the walk at 3 pm and conclude at 6 pm,” the party spokesman said.After the padayatra, she will conduct a “Mata Muchata” (chit-chat) programme at one place, where she would sit with villagers for some time and interact with them to know their problems.The programme schedule and route map for her padayatra are being handled by a team of the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC) of political strategist Prashant Kishor. “She is expected to touch at least three blocks in each assembly constituency. In all, she would address nine big public meetings,” the party spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharmila-begins-padayatra-aims-to-end-trs-rule-101634755284049.html

21-10-2021||India||42 dead and 6 missing after floods, landslides: Kerala CM Vijayan||Forty-two people have died due to rains and landslides between October 12 and 20, while six people are missing, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed on Wednesday. Talking to newsmen in the state capital on Wednesday, Vijayan said 217 houses were destroyed and 1,300 were partially damaged, and the government will do everything possible to alleviate the suffering of the flood-affected. “Twin low-pressure areas formed in the Arabian and Bay of Bengal aggravated the situation. Time is not ripe to lower our guard as fresh showers are expected. Many dams including Idukki were opened anticipating another wet spell,” he said, adding 11 teams of the Natural Disaster Response Force were camping in different districts. The chief minister has asked people residing near river basins and hill areas to be extremely vigilant. He said, currently 3,859 families are staying in 304 relief camps, and the government will expedite relief distribution soon. Vijayan also rejected the opposition charge that rescue operations got delayed at many places. “They are making wild allegations just for the sake of raising charges, and people reject them with contempt,” he said. Earlier in the day, the assembly adjourned after paying respects to the flood victims. The unseasonal downpour last week has left a trail of death and destruction in Kerala. Many areas in Wayanad and Thrissur witness heavy downpour and many shifted to relief camps. Wayanad is a landslip prone area and in 2019 it witnessed many landslides. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi represents Wayanad in LS. RESIDENTS IN AGONY Tragedy struck small-time farmer P Sebastian (52) in Erumeli (Kottayam) when he was piecing together his life after the 2018 floods, in which he lost everything. He only got an initial relief of ₹10,000 from the government but managed to rebuild his house after taking soft loans from many. But last Friday, he and his family of four were forced to flee again after gushing water ravaged his newly painted house. “I don’t know what to do. All furniture and household goods got destroyed. Even my small agricultural plot is now unsuitable for farming. I don’t know how to go ahead,” Sebastian said. Many rain-ravaged people share the same experience and agony. Semi-literate people like Sebastian have no idea about global warming or climate change, but they admit inclement weather has made their lives difficult. In Kootickal, where the landslide claimed 10 lives on Saturday, the situation is different. Even during the flooding of 2018, dubbed as the flood of the century that claimed 480 lives, this village was untouched. But on Friday, landslides polished off a part of this scenic village in Kottayam – carved mountains and slushy terrain stand testimony to nature’s fury. “We have been complaining about quarries functioning on the other side of the hills for long. We heard some of them even functioned on the day of the landslide. In 2013, the state biodiversity board had recommended that quarrying should be stopped here but nobody listened to it,” M P Chandradas, a resident who approached the court against these quarries, said. “Most of these disasters are man-made. Around 200 quarries are functioning illegally in three districts, Idukki, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. Now the government is also thinking about a hill highway project. It’s another ploy to plunder natural wealth,” said John Pervanthanam, a conservation activist, adding that the state is yet to learn from the past calamities. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the state received 135 per cent excess rain during the period from Oct to 19. The usual rainfall during this period was 192.7 mm, but this time actual fall was 453.5 mm. Though the IMD issued a yellow alert in 11 districts, it was reduced to three, Pathanamthitta, Idukki and Kottayam, later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/42-dead-and-6-missing-after-floods-landslides-kerala-cmvijayan-101634755224028.html
21-10-2021||India||Developed world should fund clean energy projects: Power Minister RK Singh||Union minister for power and new and renewable energy, RK Singh on Wednesday said that developed countries should fund clean energy projects in poor countries through the International Solar Alliance. During the ministerial plenary of ISA’s fourth general assembly, in his opening remarks, Singh said, “It is your (developed nations) business. You developed nations used fossil fuels and occupied most of carbon space. You have created this emergency of climate change in some ways.” “It is true that the available carbon space has been taken up mostly by the developed world. For the developing world to develop some carbon space should be free. We have 800 million people around the world without access to energy and ISA can play a major role in ensuring that access. It is incumbent upon the entire developed world to enable the ISA to do this... Direct your funding to ISA so that we can set up solar parks, renewable energy parks in countries that have problems with energy access,” Singh added.The ISA is an inter-governmental treaty-based international organization with a global mandate to catalyse global solar growth by helping to reduce the cost of financing and technology for solar. International Solar Alliance (ISA) was initiated by India and conceived as a coalition of solar-resource-rich countries (which lie either completely or partly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn) to address their special energy needs. It has 86 membersAn Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report last month flagged that developed countries had not delivered on their promise of mobilising 100 billion dollars a year even in 2019. This finance was meant to support climate change mitigation and adaptation to climate change impacts through resilient infrastructure and other means in developing countries. This year’s report shows that in 2019, total climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries for developing countries was USD 79.6 billion in 2019, an increase of only 2% from 2018.John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy on Climate also addressed ISA where he reiterated that the world needs to reach net zero emissions by 2050. “To keep 1.5 degree Celsius within reach, we need to take dramatic action during this critical decade in order to reduce emissions by half worldwide. If we don’t do enough between 2020 and 2030, we can’t achieve net zero by 2050 and we certainly can’t keep in limit the rise of the earth’s temperature by 1.5 degrees.” But he also made it clear that US alone shouldn’t be expected to “invest in solar energy”.“President Biden recognizes the clean energy opportunity of the value of solar energy. The United States has communicated a strong new NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) ahead of the COP 26 Summit in Glasgow next month...”Frans Timmermans, European Commission Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal announced a project of 1 million Euros that “will allow the deepening of cooperation between EU and ISA including by connecting and mobilising academic, financial and business communities”. Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance (ISA) said “The solar power landscape is evolving everyday with new technologies, investment sources and ever lower tariffs being discovered across the globe. At ISA, we are making significant efforts to accelerate solar power deployment in every corner of the world and mobilising USD 1 trillion in solar investments...”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/developed-world-should-fund-clean-energy-projects-power-minister-rksingh-101634755222775.html
21-10-2021||India||Flood toll hits 52 amid rescue ops in Uttarakhand||The number of people who have died in Uttarakhand due to rain-related incidents this week has risen to 52, and at least five people are still missing, said officials on Wednesday as rescuers dug through debris of landslides and building collapses, and attempted to reach people marooned by flooded rivers.Record-breaking amounts of unseasonal rain led to flash flood in the Ramgarh area, and several other regions were hit by landslides. In multiple places, bridges were washed away and some roads remained blocked, making rescue work difficult. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who on Tuesday described the human loss as huge and said infrastructure as well as crops were destroyed, assured state support. “We want to assure the people that our government is with the affected people in this hour of need. We are providing every possible help including food and medicines to the needy ones and will continue to do so,” he said after visiting some of the badly hit areas on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the confirmed toll was at 34. According to Jyoti Negi, spokesperson of the state disaster management department, the 52 deaths confirmed till Wednesday include 28 from the Nanital district, six from Almora, eight from Champawat, two from Udham Singh Nagar, and one from Bageshwar district. The rest of the deaths have happed on October 17 (one) and October 18 (six).Around 500 people stranded on Kainchi to Bhowali road were rescued, taking the total number of people pulled to safety since Monday to around 1,500. State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel also carried out rescue operations in waterlogged areas of Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar, using rafts at some places on Tuesday night. Most of the casualties were of people who died when their homes collapsed due to the heavy rain in the early hours of Tuesday. “We were sleeping in the house early in the morning when we heard a big blast-like sound. Soon, heavy muck and boulders came crashing down and buried our house. I’m not sure how, but I somehow stood up and came out of the house. My husband and grandchildren couldn’t,” said 54-year-old Kiran Negi. The children were pulled out 12 hours later, but her husband did not survive.Rescue workers said their job has been complicated by incessant rains. “We have already rescued many people in the last three days. Several rescue operations are still on in the affected areas with additional deployment of personnel in sensitive areas,” said SDRF commandant Navneet Singh Bhullar, who has been on the ground in Rudrapur to monitor and assist in relief and rescue. Electricity supply and telephone connectivity, badly hit by the rains, have been restored in the town. But villages on the outskirts remain affected, officials said.The rescue and restoration work was likely to pick up with the improvement in the weather, Nainital district magistrate Dhiraj Garbiyal said.Aerial photos showed raging rivers and the lake at the picturesque tourist town of Nainital overflowing onto the famous Mall Road. “In 1995, the water had overflown to some extent. But this time, it was much more. I don’t think such a case has happened here before,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, a noted environmentalist who lives in Nainital. Rawat said usually, local authorities release waters into Baliyanala when the water level rises. “But this time, the rains were so severe that it left the entire area inundated,” he said. By Wednesday morning, most of the water had receded from the roads.Dhami issued instructions to officials to conduct survey of crop damage in affected areas so that farmers can be compensated for their losses. He had on Tuesday announced ₹4 lakh compensation to the kin of the deceased. In the high reaches of Uttarkashi, at least 14 people — including eight trekkers from West Bengal and Delhi — went missing after heavy snow caused by the same weather system that brought the deluge in the lower reaches. Union home minister Amit Shah was scheduled to reach Uttarakhand on Wednesday night to assess the flood situation in the state on Thursday, said Devendra Bhasin, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state vice president. Uttarakhand saw 17.8 centimeters (7 inches) of rain in the first few weeks this month, but recorded nearly 58 centimeters (22.8 inches) within just 22 hours on Tuesday, news agency AP quoted aid Bikram Singh, the director of the Meteorological Center in Dehradun, as saying.Scientists have attributed an increasing trend of intense rainfall in parts of India to disruptions in weather patterns caused by the climate crisis, and this, experts say, has exacerbated the harms by unplanned construction work in ecologically sensitive areas such as the Himalayas and the Western Ghats, which too have been hit by floods and landslides. “In both these regions, we are seeing extremely destructive activities in the name of so-called development. Road projects cutting through hillsides are common to both regions. In 2019, I travelled to Puthumala in Kerala after the landslides and saw several small landslide sites leading up to the big one. These were all along a road construction project. Rock quarries are proliferating along these construction sites to provide construction material. This is leading to a gradual crumbling and weakening of the hills,” ecologist Madhav Gadgil told HT in an interview published on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-toll-hits-52-amid-rescue-ops-in-uttarakhand-101634755163249.html

Seems it’s time for introspection and social intervention,” it added.According to reports, the three juveniles lived near the victim’s home and used to watch pornographic clips on their mobiles. On Tuesday, they reportedly lured the victim to the quarry where they tried to get her to watch those clips. When she refused, they killed her with stones.“It is a very unfortunate incident. Two of the accused are 11 year old and one 8 year old. The juveniles used to watch pornography on mobile of the adult who is the father of one of the three. We have seized the phone which was full of pornographic clips,” Nagaon superintendent of police Anand Mishra told reporters.The arrested adult is the father of one of the three juveniles. “Family/social intervention and institutional guidance to the kids could have saved these 4 young lives. 1 lost life, 3 lost for life. It can happen with anyone or anyone around us. If our upcoming generations fail on social-moral standards responsibility lies greatly on us,” Nagaon superintendent of police Anand Mishra tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6yrold-girl-refused-to-watch-porn-killed-by-neighbour-3-minors-including-son-101634755105076.html
21-10-2021||India||Congress calls Amarinder Singh an opportunist, BJP says open to alliance ahead of Punjab elections||A day after Amarinder Singh said he would launch a new outfit and hoped to tie up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the Punjab assembly elections next year, the Congress on Wednesday termed the move a “betrayal” while the BJP lauded the former Punjab CM as a “patriot”.Singh resigned as the Punjab CM last month after a bitter tussle with his rival, Navjot Singh Sidhu, amid infighting in the state Congress unit. The party later picked Charanjit Singh Channi as the next chief minister of the state. “Our doors are open for an alliance, though only our parliamentary board can take the decision,” BJP general secretary and party in-charge of Punjab affairs, Dushyant Gautam, said, adding that the BJP was always ready to join hands with outfits that are nationalistic, concerned about the country and national security.“He (Amarinder Singh) was a soldier. He knows about the threats to the country and how to secure it is... He is patriotic. And whenever it was a matter of national security and security at the borders, we have appreciated his stand,” he added.On Singh’s condition of resolving the ongoing farm stir, the BJP leader said Singh did not talk about ending the agitation against three central laws. “He talked about farmers’ issues. We are committed to it and are working for the welfare of farmers. When the time comes, both will sit together and discuss farmers’ issues,” Gautam told PTI.HT reported earlier this month that Singh was set to launch his own political party and could even consider an alliance or seat adjustment with the BJP. The development could alter the electoral landscape in the upcoming polls in Punjab. After resigning as the Punjab CM, Singh announced his intent to quit the Congress. The Congress, meanwhile, slammed Singh as an “opportunist”, asserting that allying with the BJP will kill the “secular Amarinder” within him. “Captain Amarinder Singh is an opportunist leader who only thinks about himself, his family and his friends... He has destroyed himself by announcing a seat arrangement with BJP, whom he has always abused,” said Punjab’s deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. “Punjab does not fear Pakistan or China. If Punjab today faces any threat, then it is from Amarinder Singh,” he added.Congress general secretary and party’s Punjab in Charge Harish Rawat, too, attacked Singh. “If he (Amarinder Singh) wants to eat crow and go with BJP, he can. Who can stop him if he can’t stay with his old commitment to secularism? He was considered a symbol of “Sarvdharm Sambhav” and was connected to Congress’ traditions for a long time. If he wants to go, he should,” Rawat told news agency ANI after meeting party leader Rahul Gandhi in Delhi.“Who can forgive BJP that has kept farmers at the borders for 10 months? Can Punjab forgive them for the manner in which farmers’ agitation has been dealt with? His statement is really shocking. It seems he has killed the ‘secular Amarinder’ within him,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-calls-amarinder-singh-an-opportunist-bjp-says-open-to-alliance-ahead-of-punjab-elections-101634755042752.html

We get the impression that you are dragging your feet. Please, do the needful to dispel that,” said a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, as it heard the case registered by the top court on its own (suo motu) as a public interest litigation. The bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, took umbrage to the fact that the state police was yet to record statements of all the crucial witnesses before a judicial magistrate so that their versions could have a greater evidentiary value during the trial. Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, who is named as an accused in the murder first information report (FIR) lodged by the farmers, was arrested on October 9, a day after the Supreme Court came down heavily on the state government for the police’s lenient handling of Mishra. Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the Yogi Adityanath government, on Wednesday cited a status report on the probe submitted in the court that pointed out that statements of 44 witnesses were recorded by the police, but only four were taken to a magistrate to put their versions on record under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). “You have said in your status report that you recorded statements of 44 witnesses. But only four of them were recorded under section 164 (of the CrPC). Why haven’t you recorded statements of others under 164?” the bench asked Salve. “Your SIT (special investigation team) is in a better position to recognise who are the most vulnerable witnesses and can be browbeaten. We want to know why statements of only four have been recorded under 164? You know that evidentiary value will be far better for statements under 164,” added the bench.Salve replied that the concern of the court initially was that the police was going slow on the accused but all the 10 accused have now been arrested. He also mentioned that there were two FIRs arising out of violence on October 3, and that the arrests in the second FIR was a “little difficult” since a crowd had allegedly lynched four people after the vehicle ran over an equal number of protesting farmers. But the bench made it clear that it was not looking into the second FIR. “We are only concerned about the FIR where the farmers died,” the CJI told Salve. The bench also questioned the state government about the period of custodial interrogation of the accused in the FIR on the farmers’ deaths, adding that the police “cannot get out anything unless the accused are in police custody”. At this, the state’s additional advocate general, Garima Prashad, informed the bench that the accused were interrogated in custody, and that they were now in jail while the police have been working on reconstructing the crime scene. Salve submitted that several phones have been seized, and the purported videos of the incident have been sent for forensic examination. “If the forensic reports come, there may not be any need for further questioning in custody,” he added. To this, the CJI responded: “Mr Salve, it should not be a never-ending story... Ask your team to record section 164 statements as soon as possible...also, ensure protection and safety of witnesses.” Salve assured the bench that the necessary steps for recording of section 164 statements and witness protection will be taken to dispel the doubts of the bench. The court then adjourned the matter to October 26, asking the UP government to file a further status report on the investigation before the next date. Advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, the lawyer whose letter to the CJI formed the basis of this PIL, requested the bench for a copy of the status report that was filed by the state government in a sealed cover envelope. The bench, however, said it would consider sharing the report on the next date of hearing. The incident on October 3 claimed eight lives. Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village on Sunday afternoon. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same. The minister and his son, however, deny the charge that the latter was in the vehicle and say farmers pelted the car with stones that led to the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed.The Mishras claim that Ashish Mishra was not even at the site. On October 6, a new 45-second video of the incident showed the Thar ploughing through the farmers at high speed, with two vehicles in tow. The identities of individuals in the vehicles were not clear and HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the clips. On October 8, the apex court pulled up the UP government for not immediately arresting Ashish Mishra, commenting that the state police do not appear to be “really serious” even as the “brutal” episode left eight people dead. “This is an offence registered under Section 302 (murder charge under the Indian Penal Code). Do you treat everyone in the same manner? Issue notice and then wait for them to appear? Will an accused in every part of the country be treated in the same way like the present case? Giving them an invitation that you please come? We want to question you so you kindly come?” the bench had asked Salve and added that the court is “not satisfied” with the investigation conducted so far. Salve conceded at the time that what needed to be done was not done, and that gave a “personal assurance” that the state will be in a position to satisfy the court with its action by the next date of hearing (October 20). Mishra was arrested shortly after.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impression-is-state-is-dragging-its-feet-sc-to-up-govt-on-lakhimpur-101634754922754.html
21-10-2021||India||India joins meet with Taliban; Afghan terror, aid discussed||New Delhi A Taliban team led by deputy prime minister Abdul Salam Hanafi held talks with a delegation of Indian diplomats on the margins of a regional conference on Afghanistan hosted by Russia on Wednesday and reportedly discussed the need to address the concerns of both sides. There was no official word from the Indian side on the talks held on the sidelines of the “Moscow Format” meeting, which brought together diplomats from 10 countries, including India, Pakistan and China, and the Taliban delegation. The talks represented the first contact between the Indian side and a top member of the Taliban’s interim cabinet, which was formed last month after the group marched into Kabul on August 15 following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. On August 31, India’s envoy to Qatar had met senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai. A statement issued by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the delegation led by Hanafi met the Indian team led by joint secretary JP Singh, head of the Pakistan- Afghanistan-Iran desk in the external affairs ministry on the sidelines of the Moscow Format meeting. “Both sides considered it necessary to address each other’s concerns and improve diplomatic and economic relations,” Mujahid said. The Indian side expressed its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, he added. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the Taliban spokesman’s remarks were not a full and accurate reflection of the discussions. India has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it stands ready to help the Afghan people against the backdrop of a looming humanitarian crisis. Earlier, the diplomats from the 10 countries and the Taliban team discussed crucial issues such as providing humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and countering terror emanating from Afghan soil. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, in his opening remarks at the Moscow Format meeting, called on the Taliban to prevent anyone from using Afghan territory against the interests of third countries, primarily the immediate neighbours and the Central Asian states. The Indian side was represented by joint secretary JP Singh and joint secretary (Eurasia) Adarsh Swaika. Discussions at the Moscow Format meeting dragged on for more than six hours, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Lavrov, who held a separate meeting with the Taliban delegation before the Moscow Format meeting, said he had discussed with the Taliban leaders the need to prevent the use of Afghan soil against other countries. Pointing to the lack of stability in Afghanistan, Lavrov said: “Numerous terrorist groups, primarily the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, are trying to take advantage of this in turn, and are once again rearing their heads and launching brazen [and] deadly attacks in various parts of the country.” Speaking in Russian, he added, “Unfortunately, the problem of drug production in Afghanistan remains acute. Today there is a real threat of an overflow of terrorist and drug activity, including those masquerading as migration flows, onto the territory of neighbouring countries. In this context, for obvious reasons, we are especially concerned about the Central Asian region.” Countering these threats to the security of Afghanistan and the surrounding region requires a “timely, adequate response both within the country and from external partners”, Lavrov said. “We call on the Taliban movement to strictly follow the line of preventing anyone from using the territory of Afghanistan against the interests of third countries, primarily against Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours - the countries of Central Asia, our friends and allies.” The people cited above said the diplomats of several countries, including India, raised the counter-terrorism commitments made by the Taliban during the Moscow Format meeting. Lavrov also said sustainable peace could be achieved in Afghanistan through the formation of an “inclusive government, which should fully reflect the interests of all ethnic and political forces”. Hanafi, in his speech, contended the Taliban takeover of August 15 had resulted in a “historic transformation” that took place “without bloodshed and destruction”. According the text of his speech released by the Taliban, he said the security situation in Afghanistan is “satisfactory” and the Afghan people “have a responsible government committed to the national interest and safeguarding political freedom”. The Afghan people, Hanafi said, expect the world community to “have a formal interaction” with the Taliban government as the “isolation of Afghanistan is of no benefit”. He also called on the US to lift a freeze on the foreign assets of Afghanistan. A joint statement issued after the Moscow Format meeting noted the Taliban’s reaffirmation of previous commitments to “prevent use of the Afghan territory against its neighbours, other states in the region and the rest of the world”. Expressing concern at the activities of proscribed terrorist organisations in Afghanistan, the parties “reaffirmed their willingness to continue to promote security in Afghanistan”. The 10 countries called on the Taliban leadership to take “further steps to improve governance and to form a truly inclusive government that adequately reflects the interests of all major ethno-political forces”. They also called on the Taliban to “practice moderate and sound internal and external policies, adopt friendly policies towards neighbours of Afghanistan...and respect the rights of ethnic groups, women and children”. While expressing concern at the deteriorating economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, the parties proposed to convene an international donor conference under the auspices of the UN as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-joins-meet-with-taliban-afghan-terror-aid-discussed-101634754806357.html
21-10-2021||India||Centre’s reply sought on appointment of CBI director||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought the Centre’s opinion on allowing the director of Central Bureau of Investigation to continue in office after retirement if his replacement isn’t recommended by a high-powered committee chaired by the Prime Minister in time. The suggestion came while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by NGO Common Cause that opposed the decision of the Centre to appoint an interim CBI director on February 3 this year, a day after the post fell vacant following the superannuation of the then CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla. A regular CBI director was appointed only in May when the 1985-batch IPS officer Subodh Kumar Jaiswal was recommended to the post by the HPC having PM Narendra Modi, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.Although the ground for the petition no longer remained, advocate Prashant Bhushan appearing for Common Cause asked the court to pass an order that an interim CBI director cannot be appointed as such a post is not contemplated under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 that governs CBI. “This is the third time an acting director has been appointed. It was previously done in 2016 and in 2019. On both occasions, petitions were filed but this can’t happen again and again,” Bhushan said.Attorney general KK Venugopal appeared for the Centre and said that such an order cannot be passed as there are “exceptional circumstances” when the HPC cannot meet. “Each member of the HPC holds a constitutional post and are concerned with important affairs of the state,” Venugopal said.Bhushan suggested that in such a case there is an option to continue with the existing director. The bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai found this suggestion favourable and asked the AG, “Do you accept this suggestion?” Venugopal sought time to seek instructions. The court posted the matter for Monday.Bhushan argued that the post of CBI director fell vacant on February 2 and the process to select his successor should have begun at least two months before. He cited the Prakash Singh judgment of the Supreme Court in 2006 which secured a minimum tenure for directors general of Police (DGPs) and required the state to send a panel of names to Union Public Service Commission at least two months in advance of the impending vacancy.The AG said that the suggestion about having a CBI director selected in advance is reasonable but pointed out practical difficulties faced by the Centre. “The meeting of the HPC could not be held as a letter was received from Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury dated April 18, 2021, informing that he won’t be available till May 2. If the HPC cannot meet, we have to appoint an acting director. We will produce material to show why acting directors came to be appointed.”The bench agreed to consider this limited issue on the next date and allowed AG to produce the material. The petition by Common Cause had said, “The Director of the CBI is the final authority in the organization. He supervises all the work in the CBI and is responsible for the constitution of investigating teams for probing cases. Hence, this Court and later even Parliament have made determined efforts to enhance the functional autonomy of the CBI Director and limit the extent of executive discretion in the matter of appointment of this key functionary.” The petition highlighted the importance of having an independent mechanism to appoint the CBI head since the agency probes cases involving rampant corruption in high places across the country. “The manifest unwillingness of the government to institute a transparent and accountable system to ensure that the culprits are punished seriously impairs the right of the people to live in a corruption and crime-free society which violates Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the citizens,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-reply-sought-on-appointment-of-cbi-director-101634754806990.html
21-10-2021||India||Convictions over 65%, aim to cross 75%: CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been able to maintain a success rate of about 65-70% in getting conviction over the last 10 years, agency director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal has told the Supreme Court, adding that the CBI is trying to improve this average to 75% by August 2022.Submitting his personal affidavit, Jaiswal informed a bench headed by justice SK Kaul that CBI secured conviction of the accused in 69.83% and 69.19% of the cases in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and that he was making specific attempts to improve the directorate of prosecution for a better conviction rate in trial courts.“It is the endeavour of the CBI to bring the present conviction rate to 75% by August 2022,” stated the director’s affidavit while laying down several crucial statistics on the functioning of the premier investigating agency.

21-10-2021||India||SC questions Centre over exclusion of private doctors, health workers in insurance scheme||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to explain why doctors and health workers employed in private clinics and dispensaries were kept out of a central insurance scheme that provided ₹50 lakh cover for the families of frontline health workers who died fighting Covid. The scheme introduced on March 28, 2020, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) was titled ‘Insurance Scheme for Hospital Workers Fighting Covid-19’. Under it, a sum of ₹50 lakh was assured to health workers employed in public healthcare institutions and the same was extended only to those private hospital staff and contract workers whose services were “requisitioned” for Covid duties by the state or central government hospitals or autonomous institutions like All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Other conditions attached to the scheme required the beneficiaries to be employed for Covid-related duties and their death had to be due to the infection. Funds for the scheme were allocated from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and released through the New India Assurance Company.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said, “Prima facie the objective of the scheme is to provide social security to health professionals in view of the risks they faced due to Covid-19, be it in public or private institutions.”The court was hearing an appeal filed by the family members of seven doctors of private establishments in Mumbai who died fighting the pandemic during the first and second waves. They challenged an order of March 9 passed by the Bombay high court which held that those not “requisitioned” by the state or Centre were not entitled to the insurance cover. Issuing a notice to the Union ministry of health and family welfare and the Maharashtra government, the bench said, “The matter raises issues of considerable public importance since it has bearing on the security of health professionals who served the nation during Covid-19.” Though the petition before the high court was filed by the widow of a single medical practitioner, the top court allowed the family members of six other doctors to represent the appeal before it, noting the “nationwide consequences” flowing from the petition.The court requested the solicitor general of India to assist in the matter when it comes up for hearing after three weeks to ensure that the objective of the scheme is duly fulfilled. The petition was argued by Pradeep Arora, one of the petitioners, who submitted that the HC order was wrong as it failed to consider an order issued by the commissioner of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation on March 31, 2020, directing all clinics and private medical establishments to remain open for serving Covid-19 patients when the nationwide lockdown was in place.This came on the heels of another order of the state government on March 14 under the Epidemic Act, 1897, requiring all medical institutions to remain at the disposal of the municipal commissioner for steps to prevent and contain Covid-19. Fearing criminal action, the doctors were forced to keep their clinics open and, in the process, lost their lives treating patients.The petitioner who approached Bombay high court was one Kiran Bhaskar Surgade whose husband, having his private dispensary in Thane, succumbed to the infection on June 10, 2020. She first approached the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation to claim benefits under the PMGKP insurance scheme. On September 7, 2020, her claim was denied by the insurance company on the ground that the private dispensary of her husband was not recognised as a Covid-19 dispensary. Surgade challenged this order before the high court.While the issue was pending in the HC, the Maharashtra government wrote to the Union health secretary on October 1, 2020, on whether the benefit under the central scheme could be extended to all private practitioners. A fortnight later, the Centre responded by saying no benefit could be provided to those not “requisitioned” by the Centre or states. The HC relied heavily on the Centre’s letter and dismissed the widow’s petition. It said, “The letter (by the Union government) categorically states that for a private healthcare provider to be covered under the scheme, he or she must be ‘drafted’ by the state/Centre for Covid-19-related responsibilities.” It added, “Considering that Surgade’s services were not requisitioned as mandated under the scheme, we are unable to extend the applicability of the scheme to persons who fall outside the ambit thereof. Resultantly, no relief can be granted to the petitioner.”In the HC, the Central Council of Indian Medicine and Maharashtra Council of Indian Medicine had supported the petitioner and demanded an extension of the scheme to cover all private doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-questions-centre-over-exclusion-of-private-doctors-health-workers-in-insurance-scheme-101634754623522.html
21-10-2021||India||CBI files charge sheet in Dhanbad judge death; charges auto-rickshaw driver and accomplice for ‘murder’||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday filed a charge sheet against two accused in the alleged murder of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand, who was mowed down by an autorickshaw on July 28, an incident which sparked off security concerns in the entire judiciary. The central probe agency filed the chargesheet before a special court against auto driver Lakhan Verma, 22, and his accomplice Rahul Verma, 21, under sections 302 (murder),201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code, officials familiar with the developments said.The duo were arrested two days after the alleged murder took place. The CBI has accused them of deliberately knocking down the judge while he was on a morning jog. The two are presently in judicial custody. “Further probe into the larger conspiracy will continue,” a senior officer said, seeking anonymity. The chargesheet was filed within 90 days of the accused’s arrest, as per protocols, to ensure that they are not granted bail, the officer added. The Supreme Court and the Jharkhand high court took suo motu cognisance of the hit-and-run incident after CCTV footage showed the three-wheeler swerving on an empty road to knock him down. The auto-rickshaw, which was stolen from Dhanbad, was later recovered from the neighbouring Giridih district that night.The CBI took over the probe on July 31 after the Supreme Court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary. The state government had also recommended an investigation by the central agency into the case. CBI joint director Sharad Agarwal, who is heading the special investigation team in the case, had informed the Jharkhand high court in September that the judge’s death was not an accident and the agency was investigating all angles to unravel the conspiracy. Several people have been interrogated in the last three months and lie-detector and psychoanalysis tests were also conducted on them, Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-charge-sheet-in-dhanbad-judge-death-charges-auto-rickshaw-driver-and-accomplice-for-murder-101634754622668.html
21-10-2021||India||Terrorists behind three civilian killings gunned down in Kashmir||Security forces on Wednesday killed four terrorists, including two commanders linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) who were involved in the killing of non-local workers in Jammu and Kashmir, a development that came amid a wave of attacks on civilians in the restive region.While two terrorists were killed in an encounter in Shopian’s Dragad, two others were shot dead in a gunfight in the Kulgam district, a police official said. An Indian Army soldier also lost his life in the Shopian gun battle. Two other security personnel were injured, another official said.The Jammu & Kashmir Police say they have “neutralised” 17 terrorists in 10 encounters in the Valley amid the latest phase of violence in which 11 civilians – seven of them in Srinagar – have been killed in targeted attacks since October 2. Some of these terrorists were allegedly either involved or were collaborators in the civilian killings – five of people from outside the Union territory – this month.The slain terrorists included two Lashkar-e-Taiba-linked district commanders who were allegedly involved in the killings of a carpenter from Uttar Pradesh on October 16 and two labourers from Bihar on October 17. The official, who asked not to be named, said the two terrorists were linked to The Resistance Front (TRF), a shadow outfit of Lashkar-e-Taiba.The Shopian encounter began after security forces received information about the presence of terrorists in Dragad area of the district. A cordon and search operation triggered a gunfight between the terrorists and a joint party of security forces including the police, army and the Central Reserve Police Force.“Two terrorists were killed in the encounter,” said a police spokesperson.In a late-evening tweet, the police said they also killed two terrorists in Kulgam, where two non-local labourers from Bihar were killed on October 17.“Police and Army neutralised LeT district commander (Gulzar Ahmd Reshi) of Kulgam and one other, who were involved in killings of two poor labourers from Bihar on October 10 at Wanpoh,” said inspector general of police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar in a tweet.Raja Reshidev and Joginder Reshidev, labourers from Bihar, were shot dead on Sunday at Wanpoh, Kulgam. Chun Chun Reshi Das, also from Bihar, sustained multiple injuries and was being treated at the Government Medical College in Anantnag.The army’s Chinar Corps said the joint operation in Shopian earlier was launched based on specific inputs. “Repeated surrender appeals turned down by terrorists. Terrorists opened fire forcing Security Forces to retaliate,” it tweeted.The army also suffered a fatality in the encounter. “An Army man has attained martyrdom and two jawans have suffered non-fatal injuries,” said the army’s PRO Lt Col Emron Musavi.The slain soldier was identified as Sepoy Karamveer Singh of 44 Rashtriya Rifles. Aged 25 years, he was a resident of Daldal, Rampur Bhagelan, Madhya Pradesh.Inspector general of police Vijay Kumar identified one of the slain terrorists in Shopian as Adil Ahmad Wani, who was active since July 2020. Another slain terrorist was identified as Shakir Ahmad Wani, a resident of Litter Pulwama.“Adil Wani was district commander Shopian of proscribed terror outfit LeT(TRF),” Kumar said.He said that Wani was involved in the killing of a carpenter named Saghir Ahmad Ansari, a resident of Saharanpur, UP.Sageer Ahmad, 53, who was working in Litter Pulwama for the past one year, was killed after terrorists opened fire on him on October 16. He was living in a rented accommodation there and had been coming to Kashmir for the past one year. Another non –local, Arvind Kumar Sah, a golgappa seller, resident of Banka in Bihar, was also shot at close range by militants in Srinagar’s Eidgah area on the same day. On the same day (October 16), two LeT (TRF) militants were killed by security forces in an encounter at Drangbal area of Pampore in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-commander-involved-in-killing-carpenter-killed-jkpolice-101634729901095.html
21-10-2021||India||PM Modi: No safe haven for those committing crime against country||Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance Commission to have a “zero tolerance” policy towards corruption and ensure that there were no safe havens for those committing crimes against the country. Addressing a joint conference of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) virtually, Modi said that over the past seven years, the work of his government has given people faith that corruption can be stopped. He added: “ People of the country have faith today that they will get benefits of government schemes without any give and take or without any middlemen.” Comparing this with the record of the previous government he said that lacked the will to control corruption.“The way the earlier government functioned, it lacked the political and administrative will to fight corruption. Today, there is a political will and administrative reforms are also being carried out to achieve the goal.” The second term of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government was marked by several high profile corruption scandals and a popular protest against corruption and it is widely believed that its loss in the 2014 elections was partly on account of this. Modi reminded the officers of CBI and CVC about their responsibility. “You have to remember that your partnership is with this ‘mitti’ (soil), with Maa Bharti (Mother India). “The conference was themed around a New India that is increasingly using digital tools to push back corrupt practices. Modi’s comments on safe havens comes at a time when the central government is engaged in legal proceedings to bring back alleged economic offenders like Vijjay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi, who have taken refuge in foreign countries.Also Read: BJP, SP trade barbs over inauguration of Kushinagar International AirportHe also called upon the officers of CBI and CVC to rededicate themselves to abolishing corruption from all walks of national life and said that “corruption takes away the rights of people and hinders the pursuit of justice for all”.  21st century India no longer wants corrupt governance, the PM said even as he reminded citizens that the implementation of laws made by the government was their responsibility. Responding to PM’s barbs on previous governments, Congress spokesperson Pranav Jha said, “This is rich coming from a PM who only believes in opacity and obscurity. I wonder, if he really remembers that we don’t have a Central Vigilance Commissioner at the moment. The one officiating is merely an acting one. Look at how elections are being funded in the country, didn’t EC object to electoral bonds? Yet it continues. And one doesn’t want to remind the status of funds collected through PM Cares! In Corruption perception index India has slipped 6 places down in just 1 year in Jan, 2021... So these are hollow words, meaning nothing.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodi-no-safe-haven-for-those-committing-crime-against-country-101634721560259.html

This makes India only the second country in the world (after China with 2.2 billion shots delivered) to cross this mark. Three out of every four (75%) adults in India have now received at least one shot of the vaccine, while close to a third (around 31%) are fully vaccinated. The milestone also comes at a time when the recession of the second wave has continued, with new infections at the lowest levels since early March. In all, these numbers present a rather impressive outlook of India’s battle against Covid-19, and must be celebrated, but there’s more to be done in the country’s battle against the virus.

Several Delhi hospitals are swamped with at least 723 dengue cases reported in the Union Territory so far. Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan have seen an increase in dengue cases since last month.
