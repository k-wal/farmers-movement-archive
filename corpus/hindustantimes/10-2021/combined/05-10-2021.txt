05-10-2021||Lucknow||Congress sit-ins, protests a political stunt: UP BJP chief||A day after making a veiled attack on the opposition parties while comparing them to “vultures”, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh targeted the Congress leadership on Tuesday. “From day one these leaders tried to make the situation worse instead of improving. This is the reason why instead of helping the government in bringing the situation under control, they started conspiring to make the situation more explosive by going to the spot and now when action is being taken against the Congress leaders for breaking the law, they are crying foul,” Singh said. Singh’s statement came on a day when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra released a video and a letter questioning her confinement and seeking sacking of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and the arrest of his son Ashish against whom a named FIR has been registered in connection with the Kheri violence. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too is expected to visit Lakhimpur Kheri. Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who had landed at the Lucknow airport on Tuesday but after being prevented from leaving for Sitapur to meet party leader Priyanka Gandhi, had staged a sit-in at the airport itself. UP BJP chief described such sit-ins and visits a “political stunt”. “At the time when the leaders of the opposition, including the Congress, were staging political stunts at the airport and elsewhere, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji was healing lakhs of homeless families. That is the difference between the BJP leadership and that of the opposition,” Singh said. He made these comments barely a day after he had likened the opposition parties to vultures and credited the Yogi government of having successfully negotiated a crisis in Lakhimpur Kheri. “The victims’ families and farmers’ organisations are satisfied with the government’s action but the opposition parties are constantly trying to mislead them and create instability in the state,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-sit-ins-protests-a-political-stunt-up-bjp-chief-101633457656899.html
05-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi mollifies former health minister Balbir Sidhu||Strap:  A week after dropping three-time Mohali MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu from the Punjab cabinet, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi visited his house on Monday night in an apparent attempt to mollify him.It is learnt that both Channi and Sidhu, who were having strained relations for the past two decades, decided to burn the hatchet and work together for the state’s development during the three-hour informal meeting.Seen close to former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Sidhu was among five ministers who were dropped from the cabinet on September 26 in a rejig after Channi took over the state’s reigns. The same day, the former health minister along with Gurpreet Singh Kangar, who too had been dropped, held a press conference and questioned the move.Accompanied by finance minister Manpreet Badal and senior Congress leader Harish Chaudhary, Channi went to Sidhu’s house in Phase 7, Mohali, on Monday evening. As it was undergoing renovation, they then went to his brother and Mohali mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu’s house in Sector 78, where the meeting was held from 9:30pm to 12:30am.Deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said that during the meeting all three leaders told Sidhu that he was an important leader of the party and the Mohali constituency. “They assured him that, whether he is a minister or not, he is an integral part of the government. They all assured him of all cooperation in completing pending projects in his constituency,” he said.Talking to HT on Tuesday, Sidhu said the CM had made him a courtesy call and “we held discussions for nearly three hours on some issues”. “I am a Congressman and will remain a Congressman till my last breath,” he said.Channi and Sidhu have been engaged in a turf war for two decades, which first surfaced when the former was the Kharar MC president and latter had contested the assembly elections from Kharar in 2002. The rift only widened with time, according to party insiders.Since 2007, Sidhu has won the Mohali seat three times in a row, and after the Congress formed the government in 2017, he was awarded with a cabinet berth. His clout kept increasing under Amarinder Singh, and even his brother managed to get elected as the Mohali mayor this year. After Sidhu was dropped from the cabinet, several local Congress leaders including Deepinder Singh Dhillon, Kuljeet Singh Bedi, Amrik Singh Somal and Rajinder Singh Rana had come out in support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-mollifies-former-health-minister-balbir-sidhu-101633457535554.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Rohini court shooting: Special police unit to guard all district courts||The city police on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that the security of the seven district courts in the national capital has been taken over by “the security unit”, a specialised wing of the Delhi Police, and necessary arrangements are being made to prevent a recurrence of the recent firing incident at the Rohini courts, in which three persons, including gangster Jitender Gogi, were killed.In a status report filed before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the police said security audits of all seven district courts have been conducted and the results are being analysed to decide on the further course of action to revamp the existing security setup at these courts.The report also said security gadgets and systems on the district court premises are outdated, and they must be updated/replaced with high resolution CCTV cameras and monitors, 360-degree vehicle scanning with RF tag/bar code reader facilities, scanners for luggage and bags, scanners for explosives and narcotics, and boom barriers, among others.“District courts may be directed to provide these security gadgets and logistics at the earliest to the security unit at each court,” the police said in their affidavit.The police also recommended that technology be utilised to the maximum to conduct hearings, rather than the accused/litigant being produced before the court or being physically present. “Given the mark of technology, it would be only prudent to maximise its use. Physical presence, physical production ought to be resorted to in extreme and in compelling circumstances. This will obviate security concerns/ issues to a very substantial degree,” the police affidavit said.It further said, “It would not be out of place to mention that with the burgeoning population and the pressure on infrastructure, sheer logistical handling of the security becomes a matter of great concern. It is the plea/ suggestion of the Delhi Police that this court may be pleased to sensitise the entire judicial setup to maximise the use of technology.” The police reply came on a petition that the court had initiated suo motu, to ascertain the safety and security of litigants and other stakeholders following the shooting at Rohini courts. On the last date of hearing, the bench asked the city police and all stakeholders, including bar associations, to suggest ways to improve the courts’ security.Police also told the court that the parking area in city courts is insufficient for lawyers; thus vehicles are parked inside the premises and also all along the boundary wall, posing a great security risk.“Similarly clients/litigants do not have earmarked parking at all in any court. They are parking vehicles on the road and traffic gets jammed. This is a matter of concern and new infrastructure needs to be developed in nearby places with multilevel parking facilities for advocates and clients,” the police affidavit read.Police said an automatic entry system for advocates and court staff by way of issuing non-clonable smart ID cards should be considered.“Entry gates for visitors, lawyer and court staff, including police, should be segregated to ensure proper access control,” the police said, while also suggesting that the lawyers’ chambers on court premises should not be allowed to remain open till late night and that respective district courts may issue an order in this regard.“In all the seven district courts, there should be proper facilities of barracks, women’s rest room with basic amenities, offices and sentry posts, so that security staff can perform duty more effectively...To handle any untoward incident/causality, an ambulance equipped with basic medical facilities should be stationed in every district court,” the police affidavit said.On Tuesday, the court asked the other stakeholders, including the Centre, the Delhi government and various bar associations to also give their suggestions so that they could be incorporated in the final order. The matter would next be heard on October 12.Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul, representing the Centre and Delhi Police, said the police have filed their suggestions on the issue.On September 24, jailed gangster Jitendra Maan Gogi, who was produced before the Rohini courts in connection with a case trial, was gunned down inside the courtroom by two men posing as lawyers. The two assailants were killed in the retaliatory firing by the police. Police later said the gunmen were suspected to be members of the Tillu gang, Gogi’s rival outfit.Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207. A woman lawyer was also injured in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rohini-court-shooting-special-police-unit-to-guard-all-district-courts-101633457176031.html

Baghel arrived at Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, Lucknow, to leave for Sitapur to meet Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who is under detention there. “The video released by Priyanka Gandhi clearly shows that a car mowed down farmers from behind while they were moving peacefully,” claimed Baghel while addressing media persons over Zoom App. “The Union minister of state for Home Ajay Mishra is clearly responsible for this incident. He must resign immediately. His son Ashish Mishra must be arrested as he was in the car that mowed down farmers,” Baghel said. Replying to a query, he said: “As I am not being allowed to move out of the airport, I have sat on a dharna inside the airport. I wanted to go to Sitapur where Priyanka Gandhi has been detained and not to Lakhimpur Kheri.” Attacking the UP government, Baghel dubbed it as anti-farmers. As the Chhattisgarh CM was addressing media persons virtually from inside the airport, Congress workers assembled outside the terminal and raised slogans against the BJP government. Later, Baghel returned to Chhattisgarh on his state plane.He shared a video shared from his official twitter handle in which he was seen questioning cops on duty at the Lucknow airport. “Prohibitory orders are in Lakhimpur not in Lucknow. We are not going to Lakhimpur. So what is the problem?,” questioned Baghel. Congress leaders denied entry to airport Earlier in the day, Congress leaders Pramod Tewari and Panna Lal Punia were not allowed to meet Baghel when they arrived at the airport to receive him. “We were asked by police personnel deployed at the airport to go back. We were denied entry to the airport where we had gone to receive Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel,” Pramod Tewari told media persons at the Congress office. Tewari demanded a probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday when farmer leaders were returning after holding a protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kheri-violence-baghel-demands-resignation-of-union-mos-his-son-s-arrest-101633457056121.html

From different stakeholders, we learnt about different issues like pollution of water bodies, lack of treatment facilities for wildlife, lack of knowledge among locals about their regional biodiversity, due to which, many a times, important resources are lost. We will be studying all these issues and connect with the stakeholders individually to find a common solution while preparing the action plan,” Vineet Kumar Garg, the chairman of the Haryana State Biodiversity Board, said.This was the fourth workshop conducted by the board in the state, and a first in the city, ahead of preparing an action plan that will focus on preserving the biodiversity of the state for the next 10 years with available resources. The board has set a target of March 2022 for formulating the plan.According to the targets of the National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP), an effective, participatory and updated biodiversity action plan must be made operational at different levels of governance. In this context, various states and union territories are required to prepare their own state biodiversity action plans in alignment with the NBAP.Experts from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), who attended the workshop, said that as the next step, discussions will be held at a block level to understand more about the issues from those who handle it on the ground level.VP Uniyal, a senior scientist from WII, said, “All elements of the environment, be it birds, insects or plants, all work in sync and are essential in some or the other manner, and it is important to make people aware about these issues and work in an integrated manner.

From next month, we will start discussions at block level and reach out to school students also to make them aware.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/biodiversity-management-workshop-held-for-preparing-action-plan-101633456577165.html
05-10-2021||Gurugram||Aravallis: Demolition of illegal structures hits legal hurdle||The Supreme Court’s three-month-old direction to remove all unauthorised structures from Aravalli forest land has hit a legal hurdle, with the Haryana government informing the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the issue required judicial determination to ascertain if these structures have come up on forest land.The Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), in a status report filed in compliance with the court’s orders, stated that besides the demolition of Khori Gaon situated on MCF land in Lakkarpur village, the authority has been able to demolish just nine of 129 unauthorised structures.The MCF, represented in court by senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj, informed a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari that a group of owners, who were served show-cause notices for demolition by the forest department, filed representations before the state government claiming that their plots were not covered under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) notification of 1900, which demarcated forest land.A second group of owners claimed that in 2019, the Haryana assembly passed an amendment to the PLPA, exempting certain lands from the ambit of the PLPA, thus, allowing them to continue their operations. However, this exemption was stayed by the Supreme Court in March 2019 and the matter is pending with the top court since.A third group of affected owners have obtained orders from the Supreme Court, in the MC Mehta batch of cases, for continuing their activities.Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state forest department, said, “We have decided on the representations received from the owners of unauthorised structures. We have held that they fall under forest land. But on the 2019 amendment, there is an injunction by this court, due to which it is not implemented. This amendment was necessary as after the Kant Enclave in Faridabad was ordered to be demolished in 2019 by Supreme Court; several government buildings, hospitals and state offices also faced demolition.”The bench agreed to sort out the issue and posted the matter for hearing on Friday. It asked the state to file an affidavit explaining the factual basis on which the area in question came to be notified as a forest area.Most of the properties facing demolition are farmhouses and banquet halls, while a few schools, factories, ashrams, places of worship and hotels are also included, according to the MCF status report. The properties are spread across villages of Ankhir, Mewla Maharajpur, Manger, Pali, Badkhal, Lakkarpur and Anangpur.The MCF was directed by the court on July 23 this year to clear all unauthorised structures on Aravalli forest land.The July 23 order of the court stated, “Needless to observe that the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on forest land applies to all unauthorised structures without any exception….after due verification of the fact whether it is unauthorised and is constructed on the forest land as such. If the structure is covered in the category of unauthorised structure on forest land, the same shall be removed within the same time.”Further on September 20, the Court directed MCF to file a chart showing demolitions carried out on forest land with justification for non-demolition.Lawyers representing affected property owners said that the area was declared forest under the Indian Forests Act of 1927, while SG Mehta claimed that the notification declaring forest was covered under the PLPA.The MCF status report further indicated to the court that as and when the forest department passes an order for demolition, requisite assistance shall be provided by the corporation in carrying out the same. Only those structures, over which no objections could be raised, were demolished. The corporation demanded eight weeks to carry out the court order to clear unauthorised structures from Aravalli forest land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aravallisdemolition-of-illegal-structures-hits-legal-hurdle-101633456575867.html

The deceased had used the part of a bedsheet to commit suicide. A magisterial inquiry is being conducted into the incident and proceedings under Section 176 of CrPC [Code of Criminal Procedure] have been initiated,” Kumar said.The police said that the body was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday and that it was handed over to the family members after a post-mortem examination, reports of which are awaited.Jail officials said that Singh behaved normally on Monday and did not exhibit any emotional distress. “He last met his wife on Saturday as she is also in jail for the same offence. He also used to compose songs as he visited the music centre in the jail,” Kumar said.Rao Rai Singh was arrested for allegedly murdering four persons on August 23 over suspicions of an extramarital affair between a tenant, Krishan Tiwari (42), and his daughter-in-law, Sunita (32), at their residence in Sector 105 of Rajendra Park. Singh’s wife is also lodged in the same jail.Harinder Singh, the jail superintendent, said that a team of judiciary officials visited the jail to conduct an inquiry. “We have not found any suicide note from his possession,” he said.The accused used to run a real estate business in Rajendra Park and lived in a three-storey building with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. He was also the vice-president of the residents’ welfare association.Following the murders, Singh surrendered at the Rajendra Park police station around 6am on August 23 and confessed to having killed four people. The deceased were identified as Sunita Yadav, Krishan Tiwari, Anamika Tiwari (Krishan’s wife), and a minor girl.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that during the preliminary investigation, they ascertained that the accused murdered his daughter-in-law over suspicions of having an extramarital relationship with Tiwari. “First, he murdered his daughter-in-law, who was sleeping on the first floor and then went on the second floor and killed three family members with a sharp weapon. A minor daughter of the tenant, who was also attacked, survived,” he said.While the police did not find a suicide note on his possession, sub-inspector Krishan Kumar, who is the investigating officer in the case, said that they found a register in which Rao wrote about his life experiences. “This register was issued to him from the IGNOU study centre in the jail. We have not gone through the entries in the register,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rajendra-park-murder-spree-main-accused-commits-suicide-in-bhondsi-jail-101633456338182.html

This is the third sighting of the bird in the National Capital Region (NCR) since the first sighting in April 2017.“Though it is not the first time that a hair-crested drongo has been spotted in Delhi-NCR, it is uncommon to find it in this area,” a Gurugram-based birder, who spotted the bird on Tuesday morning, said.The first sighting of the bird was at Yamuna Khadar in north Delhi, while the second sighting was at the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in the city in November 2019.Nikhil Devasar, the founder of the Delhi Bird Foundation, said, “The hair-crested drongo is usually found in the foothills of Himalayas but over the years, we have seen that birds are changing habitats. It could be a straggler or could have come down due to heavy storm in the Himalayas, but all these years, this bird has not been commonly found in the plain areas. Change in ground cover and more trees being cut could also be a driving force.”Pankaj Gupta, a birder with the Delhi Bird Group, also reiterated that despite previous sightings, it is not commonly found in this region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rare-bird-sighting-hair-crested-drongo-spotted-in-gurugram-101633456336864.html
05-10-2021||Gurugram||Water supply pending month after CM launch, claim residents of newer sectors||Over a month after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurated piped water supply to residential societies in the newer sectors, many societies said that they are still awaiting clean drinking water connections, even after around 100 residents of a housing society in Sector 85 allegedly fell sick last week due to contaminated water supply. Praveen Malik, the vice-president of United Association of New Gurugram, a body of 40 housing societies located in sectors 77 to 90, said, “There are almost 50 societies from Sector 81 to 95, of which half the societies still do not have water connections due to delays in he application process. Due to this, residents are suffering as we are now scared to drink the borewell or tanker water that used to be supplied. Many residents have been purchasing bottled water since last week’s incident.” Until August, housing societies in New Gurugram sectors were dependent on groundwater, either through borewell or supply by tankers. The GMDA completed laying over 50 kilometres of pipelines for potable water supply to these sectors earlier this year, at a cost of ₹76 crores. On August 16, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had inaugurated the water supply, which was one of the prime projects of the GMDA. The water is supplied from Chandu Budhera and Basai water treatment plants. Anudeep Saxena, a resident of SS Coralwood Society in Sector 84, whose one-and-a-half-year-old son fell ill last week, said, “Basic clean drinking water supply is lacking in our housing society, even though all the infrastructure is in place. Due to this, residents are suffering; infants, children and elderly all are at risk.” Sanjay Sura, the facility manager of SS Coralwood society, said that an application has been submitted for water connection but did not share further details. Members of residents’ welfare associations and developers from some of these societies said that despite filing applications with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), supply is yet to begin. Captain Satyaveer Shekhawat (retired), the general secretary of Sare Homes society in Sector 92, said, “We have submitted all documents for water connections to our society, but the authorities accept the application through either builders or resolution professionals. We are following up with our resolution professional and the authorities to get water connection at the earliest.” Meanwhile, officials with the infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said that 20 connections have been issued till now to societies in these sectors. “Connections are being approved as soon as complete documents are submitted by the housing societies. So far, around 20 connections have been approved. All infrastructure is ready from our end with complete pipelines laid,” an official said, requesting anonymity. This week, the Municipal Corporation of Manesar also started issuing notices to housing societies that release untreated water in open areas, after several residents fell sick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/water-supply-pending-month-after-cm-launch-claim-residents-of-newer-sectors-101633456335783.html

05-10-2021||Mumbai||As Maha reports 2,401 fresh Covid infections, Ahmednagar continues to be a cause of concern||Maharashtra recorded 2,401 fresh infections pushing the count to 6,564,915 on Tuesday. The tally of active cases further reduced to 33,159 as 2,840 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours.It also saw 39 casualties and the total number of fatalities stood at 139,272. Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with 10 deaths as its tally stood at 6,894.Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra is under control as the average daily cases are on decline for the past few months. The drop in active cases has also been constant for the past two weeks. It has reached its lowest tally since February 5 when 33,936 cases were reported.However, districts such as Ahmednagar continue to be a cause for concern for the state as it has been reporting 400 to 500 cases a day. On Tuesday, it clocked 397 cases comprising both district 383 cases and city 14 cases, which is also the second highest in the state after Mumbai. In the past five days, it has clocked 2,277 cases and its average daily cases recorded at 455. The weekly positivity rate of the district is less than 5%. Last week, it was recorded at 4.28%, which was also highest among all other districts of the state.To bring the situation under control, the district administration has imposed a 10-day lockdown in 61 villages of the district starting from Monday (October 04). As per the fresh order, all shops, except essential ones will remain shut till October 13, while assembly of more than five people has also been prohibited in these villages. Even though the state has allowed physical classes in schools for limited classes, they will not open in the 61 villages of the district until October 13 at least.Rajendra Bhosale, district collector, said it is a precautionary step to ensure there will not be any spike in the cases. “The daily cases are more concerning for us even though they have become stable. As a precautionary step, I decided to impose a ten-day lockdown in the villages from where most of the cases were coming,” he said.Bhosale, however, said that they have ramped up daily testing and consequently their daily cases are reporting high. “We are taking all precautionary measures and have stepped up the daily testing and the number of daily cases is high. We are conducting around 20,000 tests a day and are looking to increase it even further,” he added.The lockdown in Ahmednagar district is likely to be further extended and the decision will be taken by the district administration after holding a review. “I will take a review of the Covid situation before October 13 and if required, the lockdown will be extended for some more days,” the district collector said.Ahmednagar has reported a total 333,222 cases till date and has 4,280 active cases at present. This has impacted the bed occupancy rate of the district as only 30% beds are left vacant.According to health experts, there was a delayed peak in the district and the state government is vigilant and alert because the daily cases there are persistently high. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state task force, said, “Definitely there is a delayed peak in Ahmednagar and it has persisted for some time. In contrast, daily cases in Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Pune have come down, whereas in Mumbai and Thane they are still high but their testing numbers are also reasonably high. We are very aggressively looking at any new variant coming up in Ahmednagar district.”There are predictions that a potential third wave may hit the state by December or January next year. Officials are still worried about the upcoming festive season as there are chances of a spike in cases post Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali festivals that are falling in October and November.From Monday, schools in urban areas were reopened for Class 8 to 12. In rural areas, physical classes have also been resumed for Class 5 to 7. Physical classes in schools were shut in Maharashtra from March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state.Apart from reopening physical classes in schools, all religious places will be reopened from October 7 and cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes from October 22.With 427 cases, Mumbai reported the highest number of cases in the entire state and its tally reached a 746,079 cases. It also recorded two fatalities taking the toll to 16,129.In the past 24 hours, the state tested 131,340 samples and had a positivity rate of 1.82%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 11.04%, according to the data issued by the state health department.The state also vaccinated 427,782 doses on Tuesday and has administered a total 84,639,659 doses till date, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-maha-reports-2-401-fresh-covid-infections-ahmednagar-continues-to-be-a-cause-of-concern-101633454177707.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||More schools across Maharashtra reopen||A few more schools and junior colleges reopened on Tuesday, the second day after the Maharashtra government permitted students from classes 8 to 12 to attend schools from October 4 onwards. This decision was purely on the basis of parents’ consent. As hardly 50 to 70% parents have given consent in individual educational institutes, provisions to conduct both online as well as offline sessions are being made. “We planned to start phase-wise as many students may find it difficult to travel. Initially we will only be conducting science practicals and have formed batches of 30 students each accordingly. On the first day, barring a handful all students were present in the college, we set up a complete protocol in place and explained the same to staff and students in terms of Covid precautions,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College, Churchgate. Some schools have received a positive response on the second day with more students keen on attending classes. Kshama Valanjoo, assistant headmistress, VPM’s Vidya Mandir High School, Dahisar, said, “We have scheduled alternate offline sessions, class 10 attended on Monday and classes 8 and 9 attended on Tuesday. On the first day, from the total strength of 170, around 82 students had visited school. However, on Tuesday, 138 from around 336 attended school, which included some who came at the last minute with parents’ consent. We have adopted a hybrid model of classroom so those attending online probably noted the interactive sessions and safety measures within the classroom. Such that we have received calls from parents who did not give consent initially requesting to be able to send their kids to school as well. As online examinations are ongoing, many schools have decided to wait for a few more days or another week before starting offline classes. “We had already scheduled the online exams, to conduct the same offline or in a hybrid format will need a lot of coordination. Moreover, children get disturbed if their examination patterns are changed mid-way. So we plan to wait until the exams are over and then start school,” said Kala Gangadharan, Principal, Rajhans Vidyalaya, Andheri. Similarly, Smt Sulochanadevi Singhania School in Thane started classes for only class 12 on Monday. “We shall wait for the examinations to complete before starting offline sessions for class 8 onwards,” said Revathi Srinivasan, principal, Smt Sulochanadevi Singhania School, Thane. Meanwhile, some parents continue to be sceptical about sending their children to school. “Children have been indoors for almost two years now, they are eager to step out and meet their classmates. However, if it was a matter of a day or two we could have given it a thought but to send them regularly will be difficult. Once the children get comfortable they will let their guards down and not follow the mask, sanitiser and social distancing rules,” said Pradeep Shettye, parent of a 13-year-old boy Rudra Shetye from Airoli who has not given consent yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-schools-across-maharashtra-reopen-101633453936418.html
05-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur violence: Mortal remains of three farmers cremated||LUCKNOW/LAKHIMPUR KHERI/BAHRAICH A pall of gloom descended over the villages of Terai region near Tikunia in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday as the mortal remains of three of the farmers, who were allegedly mowed down by an SUV during a protest on Sunday, were cremated at their native places. The family of the fourth one demanded a second post-mortem examination of the body, said officials.Satnam Singh, a farmer, lit the pyre of his only son Lovepreet Singh, 18, in Palia area of Lakhimpur Kheri in the morning. Villagers helped the family clear a patch on the paddy field where the teenager’s body was kept amid the presence of senior police officers. A few kilometres away in Dhaurara area of Lakhimpur Kheri, more than 200 Sikh men assembled on a field where another deceased farmer, Nachhatar Singh, 50, was cremated. One of his two sons, Mandeep Singh, a jawan in the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSSB) performed the last rites.“We never imagined this kind of an end to my father’s life. He was killed for speaking for the cause of farmers and we will remember this,” said Mandeep. On Monday, family members of the deceased had refused to cremate the bodies and staged protest over the Lakhimpur incident. They relented after the government announced ₹45 lakh compensation to the family of deceased farmers, jobs to them and swift investigation into the violence. On Tuesday morning, family members of Lovepreet Singh of Palia and Nachhatar Singh of Dhaurara had also refused to perform the last rites, alleging that the administration may tamper with the post-mortem report post cremation. Senior police officials were rushed to the spot and the families agreed for cremation after assurances by the authorities. Cheques of the compensation amount were handed over to the family members of Lovepreet and Nacchatar Singh by the evening and a team under the additional SP was formed to investigate the case.In the adjoining Bahraich district, family members cremated Daljeet Singh amidst heavy police presence. His 14-year-old son Rajdeep lit the pyre. ASP (rural) Ashok Kumar and other local officers were present during the cremation. Singh’s wife and 20-year-old daughter also attended the funeral from a distance. Meanwhile, family members of Gurvinder SIngh, 18, of Mohraniya village in Bahraich, refused to cremate his body alleging that the farmer was shot dead and the post-mortem report did not reveal this. Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait reached the spot to speak to the family members. Considering the demand of the family, the local administration agreed for a second post-mortem of the body by experts. ASP (rural), Bahraich, Ashok Kumar said a panel of doctors had been deputed for the second post-mortem examination of the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-mortal-remains-of-three-farmers-cremated-101633453635811.html
05-10-2021||Other||15 students injured after hanging bridge collapses in Assam’s Karimganj||As many as 15 students sustained injuries after a hanging bridge collapsed while the students were returning from school in Assam’s Karimganj district. The incident happened in Nivia area under Ratabari assembly constituency on Monday afternoon, officials said. The hanging bridge is over the Singla River which flows from the hills of Mizoram. The students were returning from Cheragi Vidyapith High School after finishing their classes.According to the onlookers, around a hundred students stepped on the bridge together when suddenly it collapsed. Some of the students managed to cross the bridge but most of the students fell into the river. Most of them are students of class IX and they knew swimming so they helped in rescuing each other. Around 30 students got injured, some of them had minor injuries and recovered with initial treatment. However, some students sustained severe injuries and they were taken to a nearby government health centre with the local people.A resident, Gyash Uddin said, “During the rainy season, the river is in spate. The students were fortunate enough that school was closed during the rainy days. If this incident happened at that time, we could have lost few students. This shows the poor condition of basic infrastructure in our area.”He also said that the present member of parliament from Karimganj constituency was a three-time MLA from this area. There was a long pending demand for the RCC bridge on the Singla river. However, three years back, instead of an RCC bridge, the administration constructed a hanging bridge.“We requested the government and administration to construct an RCC bridge because thousands of locals, including students, are dependent on this. Singla River becomes a high-risk area in the rainy season. The hanging bridge increases the risk for the students. After the construction of the hanging bridge, it wasn’t even maintained properly by the administration in the last 3 years. Today’s incident is a wake-up call for all of us that something bigger can happen in future if we keep ignoring this issue,” he added.The bridge connects Kashinathpur with Cheragi Bazar. A large part of the Ratabari area is connected to Ramkrishna Nagar of Karimganj district with this bridge which is used by thousands of people regularly. After the state government ordered the opening of schools recently, students in a large number started using this bridge.Deputy Commissioner of Karimganj district Khageswar Pegu has ordered an enquiry and asked the local circle officer to look into the matter. He said, “It was an unfortunate incident and we are now investigating the reason behind this. I have already involved a circle officer to look into the matter closely. Apart from investigating this matter, our officials will go through a survey to find out a permanent solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15-students-injured-after-hanging-bridge-collapses-in-assam-s-karimganj-101633453395642.html

05-10-2021||Other||80-yr-old will get citizenship after 10 years. Not sure will be alive, she says||An 80-year-old lady whose name was enrolled in voters’ list of 1970 in Cachar district, has been termed as a streamlined foreigner by foreigners’ tribunal in Assam court on Monday, officials said.The tribunal in Silchar of Cachar district has asked her to register her names along with her late husband and children before the local Foreigners Regional Registration Office within 30 days. Once she registers the names, the entire family will lose their right to vote for the next ten years.Bhandari Das is a resident of Bholanathpur village under Borkhola constituency in Assam’s Cachar district. Her name appeared in the final list of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) published in August 2019. Foreigners Tribunal Court-III in Cachar district issued a notice against Bhandari Das suspecting her an illegal migrant in 2018. She was asked to appear before the court and prove her identity by producing adequate documents in support of her claim.According to the office of the Superintendent of Police (Border), Cachar district, a case was registered against Bhandari Das in 2018 alleging her to be a foreigner who came to India after March 25, 1971, from Udhopuz village under Ajmeri police station in Sylhet district of Bangladesh. She could not submit any document of her citizenship in India at that time. Almost a decade later, when she received a notice from Tribunal court, she made a prayer before the court to decide as to whether she is an illegal migrant.She appeared before the tribunal court several times in the last three years. Along with the certified copy of the 1970 voters’ list where her name appeared, she showed the Relief Eligibility Certificate issued by the Government of India to her in 1967. Though the court admitted that she has been living in India since 1967 but in the final order, the FT-III member (judge) BK Talukder termed her as a “Foreigner Of The Stream 01-01-1966 to 25/03/1971” and asked her to enrol as migrated Bangladeshi to Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO).In the final order cum opinion, member BK Talukder wrote, “I have gone through the written statement, evidence and documents submitted by the lawyer of Bhandari Das carefully. My considered opinion is that the opposite party is a foreigner of the Stream 01-01-1966 to 25/03/1971. The OP (Bhandari Das) is directed to register her name along with her husband and children before the Foreigners Regional Registration Office, Cachar, Silchar.”Bhandari Das’s lawyer Tonmoy Purkayastha has informed that a case was registered against her in 2008 but the court issued an order in 2018. The hearing started in 2020 and the final order cum opinion came on October 4 this year. Now the lady has to wait for at least ten more years to get Indian citizenship.He said, “This judgement was drawn as per provisions of the Assam Accord. Bhandari Das has proven that she has been staying in India since 1967 and the court has agreed that the documents she submitted are authentic. Now after staying in India for more than five decades, she has to register her name as a migrant. We are part of this system and cannot criticise it but in my personal opinion, these people deserve better treatment.”Clause 5 of Assam Accord says, All persons who come to Assam prior to January 1, 1966, including those amongst them whose names appeared on the electoral rolls used in 1967 elections, shall be regularised as citizens. Foreigners who came to Assam between January 1, 1966, and March 24, 1971, shall be detected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946.Names of those detected foreigners will be deleted from the electoral rolls in force. Such persons will be required to register themselves before the Registration Officers of the respective districts in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act and the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939.For this purpose, the Government of India will undertake suitable strengthening of the government machinery. On the expiry of a period of ten years following the date of detection, the names of all such persons that have been deleted from the electoral roll shall be restored.Bhandari Das submitted documents that show that she was in India in 1967 but her name was not enrolled in the voters’ list of that year. Though the tribunal court asked her to prove her identity, she was not arrested or detained somewhere during the hearings. But in the final order, the court has asked her to enrol the entire family’s name as migrants.A senior official from the Foreigners Tribunal said that the member (judge) of the FT-III has committed an error by asking Bhandari Das to enrol the names of all her family members at FRRO.He said, “In the order itself, it is said that the case was between the State of Assam and Bhandari Das. So, how can the judge ask the other family members to declare themselves as migrants? They can have their father’s legacy which is not yet challenged.”Senior advocate Soumen Choudhary called this an “extended harassment” to the common Indians by Tribunal Court. He said, “It takes years for a person to prove his identity before the court because in many cases the document they submit needs verification. Various government departments delay these verifications which keep the person waiting for long. But after facing all these processes, the Court calls the person streamlined foreigners, which in my opinion, is half citizenship. This seems a joke made by our judicial system. In my opinion, this is just extended harassment for the common people.”Social activist Kamal Chakraborty informed that there are other people who have received similar orders from Tribunal Court. He said, “It has happened to many people and in some cases, people were responsible because of their ignorance. I know a family who has a land purchasing document of 1964 but they did not submit this before the Court during the hearing. So the court declared them streamlined foreigners. Now they have to appeal again and it may take another episode to solve the issue. We have started educating people regarding the documents they need to submit before such hearings.”Bhandari Das, however, has expressed a sigh of relief even with this order. Talking to Hindustan Times she said, “My only fear was to die without proving my Indian citizenship. I don’t want to leave a bad legacy for my children. Now, the court has said that if I wait for 10 years, my family and I will be declared permanent Indian citizens. At the age of 80, I am not sure I will live for another 10 years or not but even if I die before that, my children will live a respectful life as genuine Indian citizens.”Taking about her experience of leaving her house in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in the mid-1960s and their initial days in India, Bhandari Das said, “I got married in 1961 at our village house in Sylhet district of East Bengal. I was around 13 years old. We were being attacked from various sides because of our religious beliefs. Many of our neighbours left for India because Hindus can be safe in one country, that is India. One morning my husband decided to leave for India as well. It was the toughest time of our life which we never forget. When a few years back an order came from court, I thought before my death I have to go back to Bangladesh again, which I never wanted to.”Talking about their initial days in India, she said, “After travelling for the entire day from Sylhet, we reached a camp at midnight and did not know what to eat or where to sleep. Things started getting normal slowly and we stayed in the camp for almost 3 years. Finally, we managed to get some work in Bholanathpur village near Silchar town and shifted there. My two kids were born in that village.”Bhandari Das’s husband Rajendra Das was a farmer, he died in 2009 after struggling with illness for few years. Bhandari Das stays with her son Rajkamal Das and his family. Her daughter is married to a farmer in a nearby village and she has four kids. Rajkamal informed that Bhandari Das has developed a hearing problem with her age. She is a brave lady but the pain of partition remains in her stories.“I was born in 1971 at Bholanathpur, my younger sister was also born here. Before that our parents went through a pathetic life and they supported each other to survive in the toughest times. We have heard many stories from our father. We are a family of farmers and our father taught us to be ready to face any situation in life. When the case was filed against my mother, our father’s words helped us to be strong. The court has asked my mother to wait for 10 years to get Indian citizenship. We are not afraid or disappointed by this,” said Rajkamal.Last year, 104-year-old Chandradhar Das died in Cachar district without proving his identity after fighting for more than four years. His only wish was to die as an Indian. The Tribunal Court sent his citizenship card, which was issued in his name in 1964 in Tripura, for verification which never came back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/80yearold-assam-woman-declared-streamlined-foreigner-in-court-101633452557296.html
05-10-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati: BJP following steps initiated by BSP govt of allotting houses to poor||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Tuesday said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was following the steps initiated by her government of allotting houses to the poor in Uttar Pradesh.The remarks came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi digitally handed over keys of PMAY-U houses to 75,000 beneficiaries at a function held in Lucknow. She also cautioned the BJP that the work of allotment of houses to the poor should not be left half-completed or done in a hurry just for fulfillment of electoral interests. “It is better if the housing schemes are properly inaugurated and allocated only after completion. Only then people will get the right benefit of it,” she said in a tweet.In a series of tweets, the BSP chief said “As the elections are approaching, there has been a wrong trend of laying foundation stones of schemes and inaugurating half-completed schemes. It creates an adverse impact on public interest and welfare. The development and welfare schemes should run continuously with the formation of the government.”The former chief minister further said the tradition of allocating various government schemes of public interest and public welfare and other economic benefits directly in the bank account of women was started on a large scale during BSP government.To note, the BSP government (2007-12) had launched Kanshiram Shahri Garib Awas Yojana in 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh in 2008. A BSP leader said: “In 2008-09 one lakh houses were allotted in various districts to the poor and homeless people. In 2009-10 50,000 and in 2010-11 75,000 houses were allotted to the poor. When Samajwadi Party came to power in 2012 the scheme was scrapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-bjp-following-steps-initiated-by-bsp-govt-of-allotting-houses-to-poor-101633451655456.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Can’t rule out drastic spike in Covid cases, says Mumbai civic body||Although there has been no drastic spike in the number of Covid-19 cases reported after Ganeshotsav, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said one cannot completely rule out an alarming surge in the coming months. This comes a day after the BMC informed the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday that it doesn’t see the much-feared third wave of Covid-19 hitting the city. On Monday, reportedly the BMC’s counsel, Anil Sakhare, informed the high court that the work is on (of vaccination) very smoothly. Now, there is no shortage of vaccines too. Mumbai is safe. We do not see a third wave (of the Covid-19) coming. However, the BMC has said any spike further cannot be ruled out.According to BMC officials, the seasonal migration post monsoon and upcoming festivals are going to involve social gatherings and if Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is not followed, there is a possibility of further spike. The 15-days incubation period after Ganesh festival ended on October 5 and the BMC has maintained that the city is in a comfortable position for now.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “The situation right now in the city is very comfortable and it is maybe safe considering we are able to handle the caseload very well and there is adequate health infrastructure to handle cases. However, we cannot completely rule out any further spike. There are festivals upcoming, including Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali where there will be gatherings.”Kakani added, “We cannot make any claim that a third wave will not come. In Ahmednagar district, several villages are facing a spike and we cannot claim anything on the above lines. We have to remain cautious and continue following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, and get vaccinated considering it is definitely helping control the spread.”An indication of Covid-19 vaccines being effective was concluded in an analysis conducted by the BMC last month. HT had reported on September 12 that an analysis of D ward in South Mumbai had revealed that only five out of 158 fully vaccinated patients had to be hospitalised due to complications and most importantly all of them had recovered.Further, on Tuesday, the city reported 427 cases, followed by two deaths. The recovery rate of the city is 96% with 721,310 recoveries. The mortality rate is 2.16% and there are 6,161 active cases in the city. The city’s daily positivity rate has been hovering between 0.90% and 1.40% for nearly two weeks now. On Tuesday, a daily positivity rate of 1.33% was reported due to 31,969 tests. Further, 66,005 citizens were vaccinated on Tuesday, taking the total to 12,710,607. Of the total, 4,396,477 citizens are fully vaccinated in the city. The BMC aims to fully vaccinate the entire adult eligible population by February 2022.Meanwhile, experts claimed there may be a spike post festivals and seasonal migration, but the spike should be mild and not like the spike during the second wave. Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “There will be a spike maybe after Diwali, but there cannot be something like a third wave. 95% there will not be any third wave as the virus variants currently out are unlikely to mutate, but yes we cannot completely rule it out. Hence, we will have to continue wearing a mask and following Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cant-rule-out-drastic-spike-in-covid-cases-says-mumbai-civic-body-101633451235414.html

05-10-2021||Patna||Lalu mocks Cong’s ‘high command’ culture||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Tuesday mocked ally Congress’s “high command” culture and dismissed its allegations that his party had violated coalition principles by fielding candidates for both assembly seats in Bihar going to vote in the October 30 bypolls — Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga district and Tarapur in Munger district.The former Bihar chief minister was addressing a meeting of his party’s senior leaders virtually from New Delhi, where he has been recuperating since his release from jail on bail earlier in fodder scam cases in which he was convicted. “RJD is a self-made party and it never had the culture of high command in clearances of tickets to candidates. In other parties, including Congress, people used to wait for clearances of ticket selection from the high command. In my party, I have given tickets to candidates sitting under a tree,” Prasad said. From Kusheshwar Asthan, a constituency reserved from candidates from scheduled caste (SC), RJD has fielded Ganesh Bharti, who belongs to the subcaste of mushars. “Musahars are in large numbers in Kusheshwar Asthan, along with Yadavs and other castes . During my chief ministership, I had tried hard to uplift the socio-economic condition of the community considered most backward. Bharti is our candidate from the seat,” Prasad said.In 2020 polls, Ashok Kumar of Congress had contested the seat as part of Opposition alliance led by RJD but lost to Janata Dal (United). This time, Congress has fielded Ashok Kumar’s son Atreya Kumar. Attacking chief minister Nitish Kumar, Prasad said he was just fooling the people Bihar as he had failed to get the demand for special category status for Bihar fulfilled from his ally BJP, which leads the coalition government at the Centre. In an apparent effort to dispel any misgivings that he was being held captive in Delhi at his daughter’s residence, as claimed by his elder son and MLA Tej Pratap Yadav two days ago, Prasad said he was would come to Patna once he gets approval from his doctors. “ I will come to Patna and be with you all soon,” he said. The former union minister praised his younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who was present among the audience. “Our party did very well under Tejashwi’s leadership in the assembly polls. It emerged as the single largest party though the NDA got majority by manipulation of results in tightly contested seats,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-mocks-cong-s-high-command-culture-101633451000975.html

Apart from senior seers of the Niranjani Akhara, several seers of various other akharas also offered shawl to Balbeer Giri as part of the ritual. Shawls were also offered to him on behalf of the chief minister Yogi Adtiyanath and deputy CM, Keshav Prasad Maurya. Prior to the anointment ceremony, an event was held at the Math wherein several seers and prominent officials of the district administration remembered Narendra Giri and recollected their association with the seer, whose body was found hanging from the fan of a room at the Math on September 20. The seer’s death is currently being probed by the CBI. While speaking at the event, Acharya Maha Mandaleshwar of Niranjani Akhara, Kailashanand Giri remembered Narendra Giri as a seer who courageously took decisions for the overall welfare of all the 13 recognised Akharas of the country. President of Shankaracharya Parishad, Swami Anand Swaroop said that Narendra Giri always led the cause of Akhara and the seers from the front. He remembered his close association with Narendra Giri and hoped that his successor would keep the values of the Math intact and serve the seers, as did his Guru. While paying homage to Narendra Giri, secretary of the Niranjani Akhara, Ravindra Puri raised the issue of differences between the Akharas of the country. “We are thankful to the 10 Akharas of the country, representatives of which attended the function at the Math but at the same time, it is sad to notice that three Akharas of ‘Bairagi sect’ have not attended the ceremony.” It is worth mentioning that differences had emerged between the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) and the three Akharas, namely Nirvani, Digambhar and Nirmohi over allotment of land at Haridwar Kumbh. After paying homage to Narendra Giri, Kailashanand Giri announced the name of Balbeer Giri and invited him for the Chadarvidhi ceremony. Beginning the ceremony, Kailashanand first applied tilak to Balbeer Giri and after garlanding him, offered the first shawl. Thereafter, number of seers, starting from one each from the Giri and Puri branch (within the Niranjani Akhara), offered shawls to newly appointed Mahant of the Math. Thereafter, Balbeer Giri reached the Samadhi Sthal of his guru Narendra Giri, located within the Math and offered his homage. Then in a close-door ceremony, the Shodashi ceremony (the 16th day post-death ceremony of a seer) of Narendra Giri was also performed wherein 16 items were given to seers by the new Mahant and other senior seers and office bearers of the Niranjani Akhara. Balbeer Giri then visited various locations within the Math where seers and other invitees were seated for the bhandara. He supervised the serving and instructed the ‘sewadar’ (disciples) for various work pertaining to offering food in the bhandara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-balbeer-giri-anointed-as-baghambari-math-head-101633450999755.html

Kharif season begins in June and ends in October.Officials said that the department, after an assessment of different types of fertilizer, has put its requirement of urea at 12 lakh metric tonners, DAP(Di-ammonium phosphate) at 4 lakh metric tonnes, MOP (muriate of phosphate) at 1.5 lakh tonnes, 2 lakh metric tonnes of complex (mixture of nitrogenous, phosphatic and potash) and 1.25 lakh metric tonnes of SSP (single super phosphate). Secretary (agriculture) N Saravana Kumar said the review of requirement of fertilizer this time was being done minutely with regular updates from the field so that there is no shortage as such of any variety of fertilizer during the upcoming rabi season. “We had faced some difficulty in availability of fertilizer during the kharif season but it was resolved immediately,” said Kumar. A month back, there was shortage of fertilizer, especially urea, leading to protests by farmers at different places during the kharif season. There were reports of farmers purchasing urea at double the standard price. Opposition parties had alleged the crisis of urea was an “artificial” one created by retailers in connivance with officials. Foodgrain productionThe state’s total food production this year has been 169 lakh metric tonnes, higher than last year’s 163 MTs.As per the fourth estimate of foodgrains production, considered to be the final assessment of total production of rice, wheat and maize and other crops in a particular year, the state produced 63 lakh metric tonnes of wheat this year while rice production stood at 68 lakh metric tonnes, In 2019-20, the foodgrains production stood at 163 lakh metric tonnes, of which rice was 69 lakh metric tonnes while wheat was 55 lakh metric tonnes. Secretary (agriculture) N Saravana Kumar said the overall the foodgrains production this year has been good, especially wheat, despite some crop damages during the rabi season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-writes-to-centre-for-fertilizer-stocks-for-rabi-season-101633450817981.html

In her complaint, Singh’s widow Jiramani Devi has sought a police case against eight named and dozens of unnamed security personnel, alleging that they killed her husband even after seeing Singh and his friends, who were out for hunting on the occasion of Sarhul festival, surrendering themselves while shouting that they were not Maoists. “When the security forces opened fire, Singh and his friends left their guns and shouted that they were not Maoists. But the security forces continued to fire at them. When Brahmdev Singh’s aunt reached the spot, she saw injured Singh alive. The security forces chased her away and took Singh with them. Later, he was found dead in the jungle,” Jiramani said in her complaint. She also alleged that Singh was wearing a different-coloured shirt when he went out and the security forces changed his clothes after his “encounter”. Later, while the police admitted that Singh was not a Maoist, a case was filed under Arms Act against all six youths, including the deceased. The case was later transferred to the crime investigation department (CID). The Latehar district police administration has ever since maintained that any further action would be taken after the CID files its charge sheet after the completion of the probe.On June 29, Jiramani Devi, wife of deceased Singh, had submitted a complaint with Latehar police requesting a case be filed against the security men who were involved in the killing of her husband.On July 31, the family members led by gram pradhan of Piri village Modi Singh in association with rights activists and family members of Brahmadev Singh protested for a day outside the deputy commissioner’s office, demanding action, besides granting monetary compensation. A memorandum of the gram sabha in the name of chief minister Hemant Soren was handed over to Latehar deputy commissioner regarding the demands..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/lateharwife-of-man-killed-in-encounter-seeks-fir-against-security-personnel-101633450815516.html
05-10-2021||Ranchi||Taking legal opinion on new TAC rules: J’khand Guv||Jharkhand Governor Ramesh Bais on Tuesday said that he was taking legal opinion on the amended Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) rules while underlining that the Constitution provides special powers to the Governor concerning governance in scheduled areas.“Jharkhand has Schedule V areas, which are under me. As far as the TAC goes, it should have members appointed by the government as well as the four members as Governor nominees. But now, they don’t have Governor nominees. I am yet to see the files but from whatever I have heard, I am taking legal opinion over it,” Bais told reporters in an interaction at Raj Bhawan. The Hemant Soren government on June 22 amended the Tribes Advisory Council (an advisory body that deliberates and helps the government with issues related to tribes and their development in states that have areas classified under the fifth schedule of the Constitution), transferring the power of constituting the TAC from the office of the Governor to the chief minister (CM). The state government reconstituted the TAC with the CM as ex-officio chairman and the state tribal affairs minister as the deputy chairperson. Fifteen MLAs, including three from the Opposition BJP, are also a part of TAC, besides two experts from the ST community. The Hemant Soren government has, however, maintained that the amendment has been done as per law and cited the example of Chhattisgarh where a similar exercise was done by the previous BJP government headed by Raman Singh. Bais, who is also from Chhattisgarh and a former seven-term Lok Sabha member from Raipur, said the Governor’s power has not been diluted in his state. Meanwhile, CM Hemant Soren chaired two meetings of the new TAC since it was constituted. Former Governor Draupadi Murmu, who made way for Bais on July 14, also raised a red flag over the issue. In her last interaction with media before relinquishing office, Murmu had said that she had sought the TAC files and briefed the incumbent Governor over the issue. Bais also expressed dissatisfaction over the level of development in Jharkhand since its creation two decades back as compared to his own state Chhattisgarh, which was formed along with Jharkhand.“The state has huge potential, especially in the field of education, tourism, agriculture. I keep reading about traffic jams even in the state capital Ranchi. There needs to be an overall plan and get it implemented,” he said. Bais also said he was taking stock of the situation from concerned departments and he would give his feedback and ideas to the state government wherever possible. “Yesterday, I met university officials. Today I met agriculture department officials. It is important to know the realities before giving any advice,” he said.When asked if his reviews and advice may be interpreted as interference in governance and a possible showdown between the office of the Governor and the state government as it has been in some other non-BJP ruled states, Bais said that he has no political bias.“My only focus is that I contribute in development till the time I am here. I will only advise. It is up to the government to consider it or not,” he said. The Governor said he has already had 2-3 rounds of discussion with the CM over development issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/taking-legal-opinion-on-new-tac-rules-j-khand-guv-101633450758225.html

The officer will soon collect the evidence and file the report,” the ADG said.Recently, a delegation of Bihar Policemen’s Association led by its president Mritunjay Singh had also met the ADG and demanded an inquiry. “The incident with a woman officer which compels her to apply for VRS is a serious matter,” Mritunjay Singh said, adding that the probe against Barnwal should have ideally been handed over to an officer outside the special branch in the interest of fairness.On July 26, 2021, Kumari, 1994-batch inspector, had written a letter to state police chief, seeking voluntary retirement while accusing Barnwal of mentally torturing and harassing her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/senior-cop-in-bihar-faces-probe-after-complaint-from-female-inspector-101633450755405.html

It is the vindication of our claim that we are the real holder of Ram Vilas Paswan’s legacy. Some parties wanted to sabotage our election prospect but truth has finally won,” said LJP (Chirag group) spokesperson, Ashraf Ansari.LJP leaders are happy that the addition of Ram Vilas Paswan’s name would help the party win over the Dalit votes. “It’s a blessing in disguise,” said a Chirag faction leader.Experts also agree. “Late Ram Vilas Paswan was a tall leader of Dalits and he still has a strong following which was proven during Chirag’s Aashirvad yatra. Union minister Pashupati Paras could not get the same response,” said Gyanendra Yadav, associate professor of sociology, College of Commerce, Patna.The LJP, with six MPs in Lok Sabha, split in June this year after five of the MPs refused to identify Chirag Paswan as their leader and petitioned the Lok Sabha Speaker to recognize the group as the real LJP. Both the groups announced their own president.The LJP contested the Bihar assembly election in 2020 separately and caused considerable to JD(U) in no less than 30-35 seats. The JD(U) could win only 43 seats. Ever since then, voices of dissent started to rise in the party. However, the party won a single seat and the lone party MLA defected to the JD(U).With Chirag deciding to field candidates once again from two assembly seats going to by-polls, things are not going to be smooth for the JD(U) which is contesting the elections on both seats. Both the assembly seats were represented by the JD(U).Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party was guarded in its comments. Pashupati Kumar Paras welcomed the Election Commission's decision of allotting his faction of the Lok Janshakti Party the name Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party and sewing machine as the party symbol."I welcome the Election Commission's decision. I have been allotted the name Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party and the sewing machine as the party symbol," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/new-names-symbols-for-ljp-faction-chirag-group-happy-101633447040504.html

The case was later transferred to Panvel Taluka police station.“I was called by the Panvel Taluka police for punchnama of the hotel and to identify the lady named ‘Baby’. On that day, the manager of the hotel said she had not reported. I feel the hotel people were trying to save her. If no arrests are made, I won’t hesitate to protest in Navi Mumbai,” she added.The victim had not told her husband about the incident fearing that he might abandon her and their two children.Further investigations are being done by ACP Bhagwat Sonawane. “The accused have fled and none has been arrested till now.

05-10-2021||Pune||Some residents of Pune’s Mangalwar peth evacuated during Mon evening downpour||PUNE The torrential rain in a short-span of time on Monday evening crippled not just traffic at many places in the city, but saw water logging in various housing societies. This was accompanied by incidents of trees falling caused by the thunderstorm and lightning. Parge chowk in Mangalwar peth was flooded with firefighters even evacuating some residents from there.Given the flash floods that have plagued Pune during the monsoon season in the recent past, a torrential downpour like the one on Monday evening always has Punekars worried.“Water level started rising around our area. When I looked out of the window the water level was above three feet, and people were still walking on the road. Then firefighters asked us to vacate our houses till the rain stopped, which it did, thankfully,” said Renuka Mandhare a resident of Mangalwar peth.The Pune Fire brigade received a total of 21 calls, of which 13 were about trees falling and waterlogging, all in different parts of the city. “The calls came from areas like Mangalwar peth, Sadesatra Nali in Hadapsar, Vishrantwadi, Yerawada, Camp and also Pune railway station. There were no injuries or major damage of goods and vehicles. Our firefighters reached the spots quickly and rescued people. Fallen trees were also cleared,” said Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer. According to the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) fire brigade department, 12 incidents of trees falling were recorded on Monday. The heavy rain started at 6pm on Monday and the water level on roads quickly rose, while the underpass at the Pune railway station was partially submerged, with people having to wade through waist-high water to get to the road.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm on Monday, Shivajinagar reported 26.3 millimetres (mm) of rain, Chinchwad reported 2.5mm, whereas Lohegaon reported 23.4mm of rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/some-residents-of-pune-s-mangalwar-peth-evacuated-during-mon-evening-downpour-101633444575021.html

This is apart from the ones set up by individual municipal corporations within the district.From among these 150 beds set up recently, around 25 will be specifically used in case of any disaster or emergency wherein children need hospitalisation.The paediatric ward has been set up on the ground floor of the health department adjacent to the Mental Hospital. Moreover, a state-of-the-art operation theatre has been set up for the convenience of pregnant women along with a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).“We have planned for an additional 50-bed facility within the premises and preparations for the same are going on. This will be apart from the existing NICU and the 150-bed facility. If there is a sudden spike in numbers, we will have enough space to admit children and no one will be devoid of any facility or treatment,” said Dr Kailash Pawar, civil surgeon, Thane district.Within Thane district, Thane Municipal Corporation has already set up a 100-bed paediatric facility, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation has set up a 50-bed paediatric ward and Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation has set up an 80-bed facility within their respective jurisdictions.

05-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur violence: SUV ploughed into farmers’ crowd from behind, say eyewitnesses||LUCKNOW Rajdeep Singh, 14, was with his father Daljeet Singh, a farmer, when the latter was allegedly mowed down by an SUV from behind on the Tikunia-Lakhimpur road on Sunday. “After peaceful protest, we were walking down the road when I heard a speeding SUV. It all happened in front of me… my father was knocked down by the vehicle. I tried to hold him but couldn’t do anything,” lamented Rajdeep.He said this SUV was part of the cavalcade of Ashish Mishra, son of BJP minster Ajay Mishra Tani. These vehicles were deployed to welcome UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and were on their way back after his visit was cancelled. After a peaceful protest, the farmers including Daljeet Singh were also returning home.“As my father lay unconscious on the road, my uncle held his head in his hands. That was the last thing I remember,” said Rajdeep who fainted on the road after witnessing the violence and arson.Harpreet Singh, 28, another farmer, was standing on the roof of a house on the road along with at least 20 others and saw the carnage unfold from a vantage point. “The road was packed with farmers who were returning from the venue. They were stopping to take photographs and selfies, which slowed the movement and led to further crowding on the road. Meanwhile, I saw three cars leaving the playground. The SUV leading the pack began accelerating, and some farmers had a close shave, with this vehicle nearly hitting them,” he said. “This SUV kept speeding till it reached the spot where farmers had assembled. I saw it plough into the crowd from behind. To save themselves, farmers jumped into ditches on both sides of the road. It appeared like a tractor moving through a paddy field, crushing the plants and leaving tyre marks behind. People started shouting…I couldn’t believe my eyes,” added Harpreet. Moments after the accident, this SUV was forced to stop and the people inside it jumped out and started running. The second SUV in the cavalcade tried to take a sharp turn and escape, but lost balance and landed in a ditch on the other side of the road. A farmer, Balvinder Singh Mangat, 39, who was standing here, hardly 10 metres ahead with his friends, said: “We heard a thumping sound of a vehicle moving from behind into the farmers’ crowd, followed by cries of farmers. The second SUV was seen going down into the ditch. But I was alarmed when I saw a third car speeding towards us. We pushed ourselves on the sides of the culvert to escape being hit and saw this third car fleeing,” recalled Mangat.Within minutes, the road which was crowded with farmers, was left barren as people jumped into ditches on either side for safety.“Everything was quiet for around 30 seconds, before people started coming out to check the injured and the dead lying on the road. Everyone looked alarmed and some were angry. People started calling out for help and cars were brought in to ferry the injured. I saw people running behind the driver of the first SUV,” said Joginder Singh Virk, another farmer who jumped into the ditch. According to the police, the angry farmers lynched four people, including the drivers of the SUVS and a local journalist. Both the vehicles were set ablaze by the time additional police force reached the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-suv-ploughed-into-farmers-crowd-from-behind-say-eyewitnesses-101633443314796.html

Rai said that these pollution hotspots will be closely monitored and preventive action will be taken with the help of concerned departments and officials.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched the Green Delhi application in October last year, to enable people to file complaints about the pollution of anti-pollution norms in Delhi. The government had also set up the 'Green War Room’ last year itself to monitor and coordinate anti-pollution efforts.Speaking at the launch of the Green Delhi application's IOS version, environment minister Gopal Rai said on Tuesday that over 23,000 of the total 27,000 complaints received on the application have been resolved.

The Olympian was arrested on May 23 for his role in the Chhatrasal Stadium murder case and is lodged in jail since June 2.Police said that Kumar, along with his associates, assaulted Dhankar (which led to his death) and his friends in Delhi’s Chhatrasal Stadium in May over a property dispute.In his bail plea, Kumar said that the police tried to paint a ‘false and guilty image’ of him and presented distorted information about the case to the media to establish connections between him and a few gangsters.Kumar, who won bronze medal at Beijing Olympics in 2008 and a silver at London in 2012 games, was also booked for robbery, dacoity and dishonestly receiving stolen property, according to a report by HT.According to a Delhi Police chargesheet accessed by HT, the police said that Kumar and Dhankar were involved in a feud over a flat in Model Town. Dhankar allegedly refused to vacate the property despite several intimations by Sushil Kumar. Although Dhankar eventually vacated the premises sometime between March and April this year, Kumar "felt humiliated", the chargesheet added.Police said that Kumar felt that his ‘ego was bruised by rumours of his diminishing clout and he wanted to re-establish his authority among younger athletes’, the report from HT said.Police named 13 accused in the first chargesheet, filed on August 2, and held the Olympian as the primary accused.

05-10-2021||Chandigarh||Surviving a nightmarish social media blackout||Last night, it was with shaking hands that I rebooted my mobile for the sixth time to log on to my favourite social networking sites, but they failed to open. I rushed to the tablet, and then the laptop, but things were no different there as well. Oh no! They are gone! I was filled with an inexplicable anxiety. Watching my restlessness, my husband asked, “Hey! What’s up?” “There’s no WhatsApp!” His inquisitive expression made it clear that he was still unaware of the catastrophe. “Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger are all gone,” I said in a choking voice. “Really! Doesn’t matter. Maybe it’s an internet issue. We’ll check it tomorrow,” came his stock response. “No, YouTube and other websites are working. Oh my God! What will we do if these are never restored? So unfair. As if these Covid restrictions were not enough, now our only connection with the outside world is snapped. I was trying to check when our sons last checked their Facebook and WhatsApp accounts. It’s a daily ritual before going to sleep,” I said. But he seemed to be unperturbed by the development as he is hardly into these activities; I’m the only one addicted to these sites. With sleep miles away, and time hanging heavy on my hands, I wandered in the house as if in a daze. There were no funny videos to cheer me up, no goodnight messages on WhatsApp to lull me to sleep. Without Facebook, I felt like a faceless entity lost in a forest. What are my friends doing at this moment? Are they all in the same situation, fiddling with their mobiles in panic like me? I wondered “Just relax. Didn’t we manage without all these things in the pre-mobile and pre-internet days? Go back in time and relive those days, it will give you some consolation,” my husband tried to alleviate my agitated mind. Time travel, oh no! All science-fiction stories like The Time Machine and 11.22.63 flashed in my mind, where the protagonist could travel back and forth in time. I could visualise a genie, a well-attired modern version, coming out of the landline phone and asking in accented English, “Which time slot would you like to visit, madam?” “Shut up and get lost! I’m not going anywhere with you.” I found myself muttering. Frustrated and flustered, I put the mobile on the side table and went off to sleep only to find myself stranded in a desert in my dream. Suddenly, the mobile became alive with a familiar sound. As I picked it up, lo and behold! It was the first good morning message from a friend on WhatsApp! And the morning never felt so good. Am I narrating a fictional story? You know I’m not.njkaur1953@gmail.com The writer is a Patiala-based retired associate professor in English||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/surviving-a-nightmarish-social-media-blackout-101633439354546.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai ex-top cop Param Bir Singh may have fled India using forged passport: Probe agencies||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh may have fled India either before the Lookout Circular (LOC) was issued against him by the state police or using a forged passport, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday, citing investigating agencies. Notably, the LOC was issued against Singh in July, two months after the former state police chief went on leave.A senior official told ANI that there is zero probability for any individual to cross the immigration at any airport of India if an LOC has been issued against him/her. Elaborating the process further, the official pointed out that when a person against whom LOC has been issued puts their passport in the system to cross the immigration, it gets red-flagged and they are handed over to the concerned authorities. “The Maharashtra government issued an LOC against Singh just after several FIRs were registered against him,” the official was quoted as saying by ANI.The official stated that forged passport is the only way Singh could have fled the country, if he did, after he obtained the same using someone else’s ID and his photo. “Many a times people with forged passports get detained but some also manage to pass through because the verification is computer-based with less manual interference,” the official said.This latest development comes after Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil said last week that the state government of the investigative agencies are unaware of the former police chief’s whereabouts. “I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance,” Patil said on speculation of Singh escaping to Russia.Singh is wanted in a probe into a corruption claim he levelled against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, saying that the latter was involved in an extortion racket wherein he asked police officials to collect money from bars and restaurant owners. Singh also named dismissed former Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze in this case.Singh was demoted as the DG (Home Guards) on March 22 after being removed as the Mumbai police commissioner a few days before, following the Antilia bomb scare and the subsequent Mansukh Hiren murder cases. He had appeared before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on April 7 to record his statement in both the cases, however, he didn’t respond to summons by the NIA thereafter.Also Read | Maharashtra ACB gets nod to launch second inquiry against Param Bir SinghHe last attended office on May 4 after which he went on leave from the next day, citing health issues. Singh had also requested for an extension of his leave after May, even claiming he underwent a surgery. In mid-August, he requested the Maharashtra government for another extension of his leave on health grounds, and he has been untraceable since then.A state home department official recently said that the Maharashtra government has commenced the process of suspending Singh but it wants the case to be fool-proof in order to stand legal probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-may-have-fled-india-using-fake-passport-investigating-agencies-101633435305377.html

05-10-2021||Chandigarh||Resolving farm crisis: Assured procurement of pulses at MSP||India is the largest producer of pulses. Since the population has low-income levels and people are largely vegetarian, pulses provide good quality protein, and they contribute significantly to the nutritional security of the nation. In India, pulses are cultivated in both the kharif (autumn) and rabi (spring) seasons. Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka account for nearly 80% of the total area under pulses. The important pulses produced in India are gram (chickpea), tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram), moong (green gram), masoor (lentils) and peas. Also read: BJP to focus on delinking agitation from farm issuesEven though we are the largest producer of pulses, the population growth has outpaced the supply of this essential commodity. While production has grown at 1% from 1970 to 2013, the population grew at 2% per year. At present, the domestic consumption is about 25 million tonnes. It does not meet the demand for pulses. This year, India will import three million tonnes of pulses worth about $1.5 billion. The import of pulses has been moved from the ‘restricted’ to the ‘free’ list. Since 2015, the country has imported pulses worth ₹1,08,200 crore. India is the largest importer of pulses in the world. India imports dry peas and lentils from Canada and the United States. Australia and Russia are the major suppliers of chickpeas to India. Large quantities of urad, moong and pigeon peas are imported from Myanmar. In 2018, India signed an agreement with Mozambique for the import of pulses for the next five years. Low productivity of pulses The productivity of pulses in India is low. It is only 755kg/ha as compared to 1,900 kg/ha in the US and Canada. We grow pulses in rain-fed conditions in regions where there is widespread variability in precipitation. The production of pulses is caught in the vicious cycle of low and uncertain yields and poor per hectare returns. As a result, farmers give least preference to grow pulses on fertile and irrigated lands. The overall result is unstable and low yields. There is an inadequate adoption of production technology leading to production risk. Worst of all, prices are highly volatile. Imports hurt indigenous farmers and the milling industry. The results from household consumption surveys indicate a decline in the consumption of pulses leading to an increase in malnutrition. About 15.2% of the people in India are undernourished. Making pulses available at affordable prices by boosting domestic production is the best strategy for providing nutritional security to the poor masses, relying on a vegetarian diet. The country has to develop and adopt more efficient crop production techniques along with favourable marketing policies and price support mechanism. In fact, the lack of an assured market is the single most important reason for the poor availability of pulses in the country. Step towards sustainable agriculture If the government were to guarantee procurement of pulses at the MSP, backed by a law to this effect, production of pulses would move to irrigated lands as well. Backed by technological support with high-yielding variety seeds from the agriculture universities, along with a package of practices of use of fertilisers and pesticides in proper doses, domestic production will soon bring about self-sufficiency. We must remember that pulses fix biological nitrogen and need less water. This diversification will be an important step in sustainable agriculture. For enhancing the nutritional status of the poor masses, pulses should be included as an item in the public distribution system. Punjab has already implemented the ‘atta /dal’ scheme in the state. To procure a sufficient quantity of pulses Nafed, FCI, STC and state government agencies, such as Punsup and Markfed, should be roped in. Post-harvest management and transport The Government of India should arrange funds. Procurement must happen in already declared APMC market yards as the farmers have confidence in the arrangements. Mechanisation of procurement operations with an automatic facility for cleaning and weighing would be a step forward. We must remember that the infrastructure required for post-harvest management of farm produce will not come cheap. But it is a necessary precondition for smooth operations along with a road network to help the producer reach the market. The hitherto levied market fee and rural development fund must be restored, or the arrangements so painstakingly built for national food security will crumble. Sufficient procurement of pulses in different states for supply to the poor in those regions will provide farmers with assured income and lead to a more prosperous nation as the farmer is a buyer of all consumer goods. In fact, making the farmer prosperous by payment of appropriate rates will actually give a fillip to the economy. Which government would not be happy to enjoy this bonanza? Area under cereal crops will shrink One spinoff side-effect of the scheme to mandatorily purchase pulses (and oilseeds) at the announced MSP is that the area under cereal crops will shrink. Money saved from procurement of cereals can fund the purchase of pulses by government agencies. This can be supplemented by building and utilising a reserve fund by exporting cereals that are far above the buffer stock level. The export of food grains would be a welcome relief to the spiralling mountains of wheat and rice that cost the nation dearly in terms of procurement and carrying costs. Pulses in India are the ‘poor man’s meat’ and ‘the rich man’s vegetable’. The nation has the capacity to ensure its production at home at affordable prices. So, let’s all join hands and do it. dhanbirbains@gmail.com The writer is a retired Punjab IAS officer and has a master’s degree from Harvard University.

Police are investigating the case. Severe punishment will be awarded to the accused,” the minister told ANI.On the night of October 3, a woman was burnt alive at her home in Supur taluka after she resisted the rape attempt of a man, who the police later identified as Gangappa Basappa Arolalli, a resident of Chowdeshwarihal village, according to a report in Deccan Herald on Monday.Superintendent of police CB Vedamurthy told reporters that the accused entered the victim’s house late at night while her husband was away and attempted to rape her. When the woman resisted his move the man left only to come back with gasoline from his motorbike and used it to set her ablaze.The woman was rushed to Surpur taluk hospital on the morning of October 4 and later shifted to Kalaburagi district hospital after her condition worsened. She succumbed to her injuries later that evening.Last month another such incident rocked Yadgir district after a video emerged of four men stripping, sexually abusing, and assaulting a Dalit woman on the Yadgir-Shahapur state highway. The video also showed the miscreants clicking selfies with the victim during the assault.Police arrested the four accused from the video which was reportedly filmed an year ago. “The police department has taken the case very seriously.

05-10-2021||Pune||In my opinion: Tribe of priests on “cannon-ball” run espouse courage to change||Because a Spanish soldier got hit by a cannon ball on May 20 1521, in a battle now referred to as the Battle of Pamplona, I got an education. My education came 460 years later in Pune, 7,450 km from Pamplona in Spain. Iñigo López de Oñaz y Loyola was the soldier. And his “cannon-ball moment” changed the world. It certainly changed my world. It gave me access to education. Ignatius of Loyola would go on to found the Catholic Society of Jesus, now known as the Jesuits and the Jesuit mission – as far as my experience of the priestly order goes – has been one of education, social justice and empowerment of the underprivileged masses. From May 2021 until July 2022, the Society of Jesus celebrates the Ignatian Year. What is an Ignatian Year? May 20, 2021, marked the 500th anniversary of Ignatius’ conversion — that fateful day when Inigo the soldier, struck by a cannon ball, began his transformation into Ignatius the pilgrim, or as those in the Catholic faith refer to him today, Saint Ignatius. July 31, the day Inigo died in 1556 is marked as his feast day. As the pandemic sent the Pune Jesuits and the Jesuits across India online to celebrate, mark and “re-live” the “Inigo impact” in India, one catch-phrase has caught on – “cannon-ball moment”. If Inigo the soldier does not get hit by the cannon ball, effectively, this column does not get written; because, myself and millions of students in Pune do not get an education; because hundreds of thousands of young men do not become priests and, thousands of priests do not join the Jesuits; priests like Fr Maximillian Riklin and Fr Rudolph Schoch do not come to Pune; St Vincent’s High School in Pune Camp never sees the light of day. The school website – stvincentspune.com - has the names of principals from the year 1867 – which is when the St Vincent’s High School cannon-ball run is believed to have begun. That “millions of students” figure above is based on an anecdotal calculation of 70 students per class, four divisions per standard, and Classes 1-10 at the very least. That was just one generation (1979-1988/89) at my alma mater – St Vincent’s High School. The Jesuits are firmly entrenched in the edu-social mission in Pune. Apart from St Vincent’s, the Jesuits run the Loyola High School in Pashan , the St Vincent’s night school, now on Shankarsheth road and the St Joseph’s technical school at the same premises. The latest addition to the Jesuit resume is the St Xavier’s High School in Vitthalwadi – co-ed, CBSE board, no less. My grandfather, my father, my brother, me and my son, all attended the same Jesuit school of St Vincent’s in Camp. So, forgive the over-indulgence in cross-referencing the St Vincent’s impact with Inigo’s cannon-ball moment. The fact is, four generations of one family went to school because of a cannon ball. Modern day “worthiness” is more often than not judged by the “super-achiever” count – how many world-famous names came out of Jesuit institutions? In Pune, it is not so much about the big names, as it is about the masses (as in people, not the Catholic church services). Educating the masses so that the cogs that allow the world to wheel on are primed for the job, is what the Pune Jesuits are all about. I could list the big names that got to where they are because of the Jesuit education, but I would rather tip my hat to the masses, like myself, who got the essentials of life from priests responding to their own “cannon-ball” moments – essentials like character, discipline and service, all firmly ingrained. As I sit across the table from Fr Kenneth Misquitta, SJ, my former school principal and now director of the night school/college, he reminds me that we do not choose our cannon-ball moment, but when the cannon ball strikes, how we respond is the key. Inigo, a soldier building his career and looking to win the love of a woman, responded to being hit by a cannon ball by picking up a Bible. The rest is history. Jesuit priest Father Stan Swamy, a person repeatedly referred to as a “human rights defender” by the press, died in custody nine months after his arrest on alleged charges of terrorism – charges that, as has been repeatedly pointed out by political commentators, were far from the truth. His cannon-ball moment shook the foundations of democratic process in the country. The argument that the Jesuits use education as a Trojan horse to further the much-maligned Christian ultra-motive of “conversion”, does not hold any water in my experience. Not one of the 2,600 students who were in school with me at St Vincent’s converted to Catholicism; and if any did, it certainly was not because they received an education, or a fee reduction, or access to the best sporting facilities, or a chance to live life… because my school, St Vincent’s, provided all that, at the very least. Instead, values, principles, character, and that fundamental of “service” was exemplified by the priests at St Vincent’s. That and a good knock on the head back in the day when corporal punishment was de rigueur. The Jesuits in Pune allowed each of their individual cannon-ball moments to collectively impact a city and educate its “sons of the soil”. The Covid pandemic is Pune’s cannon-ball moment. Collectively as a city, in our societal groups, in families, and as individuals... we have been hit. Like Inigo, our response can impact the generations to come. Like Inigo, from this position of pain, discomfort and loss we can all reach for our “bibles” – that book, person, belief or vision – that, like Inigo, can change us and the world forever.

Also read: Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi to meet Union home minister Amit Shah todayFarmers of Bathinda and Mansa districts said they were already braving losses caused by the pink bollworm attack and the inclement weather would hit them further. Cotton and paddy are the main kharif crops sown in seven districts of the state’s southern belt. Picking of cotton is underway, whereas paddy harvesting in Malwa is yet to pick up. The wet conditions will now stall harvesting till the weekend. Sudden showers damage raw cotton at mandis According to Punjab Agricultural University’s observatory at the Bathinda-based regional research centre, Bathinda district recorded 70mm of rainfall on Monday evening. Strong winds were reported from Bathinda, Fazilka, Muktsar and other adjoining places. Unsold raw cotton at several mandis of Muktsar, Bathinda and Fazilka was damaged due to sudden showers in the evening. Lodging of crops reported: State agri dept State agriculture department joint director Gurvinder Singh said rainfall at this juncture would affect the quality of cotton bolls and paddy grains. “Initial field inputs suggest lodging of crops of cotton and paddy at several places across the state. Rains are undesirable for kharif crops as paddy and cotton are ready for harvest,” he said. Harvesting held up for at least five days Bathinda chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said cotton harvesting would be stalled for at least five days following rain in various parts of Malwa region “Unfriendly weather conditions would also push paddy harvesting, that is yet to gain momentum, by 3-4 days. Farmers are being advised to delay harvest,” he said. Sharanjit Singh from Mann Khera village of Mansa district said inclement weather would be a double whammy for farmers.“Pink bollworm attack has done considerable damage to the crop. Delay in the harvesting of cotton and paddy would lead to a delay in wheat sowing in the area. We are keeping fingers crossed to tide over these challenging times,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-farmers-worried-as-rain-delays-paddy-cotton-harvest-in-malwa-101633415953242.html

There are around 30 helipads in the state and plans were afoot for more.“We received a proposal from the South 24 Parganas district authorities (for the helipads in the Sundarbans). Around a month back, the state public works department was asked to do a survey. It is in the planning stage,” said a state transport department official, who did not want to be named. Officials said the need for helipads was felt most after the region was hit by three cyclones in as many years – Bulbul (November 2019), Amphan (May 2020) and Yaas (May 2021).“The islands were badly hit, and river water gushed into the villages through breaches in the embankments. It took a lot of time to reach out to the victims on boats as the roads were damaged and inundated,” said an official in South 24 Parganas district, requesting anonymity.The Sundarbans is the world’s largest mangrove delta spread across India and Bangladesh. The Indian part of the delta covers 102 islands including 54 inhabited ones. The rest have dense forest covers and are home to tigers. Boats are the lifeline for travel from one island to another.Also Read: Bengal’s Sunderbans to get women tourist guides for the first timeOfficials said helipads have been proposed for Gosaba, Patharpratima, Kakdwip, and Diamond Harbour, which were severely hit by the cyclones. “We are also receiving proposals from other districts too and they are under examination. The helipads can be used for any purpose apart from reaching out to victims during natural disasters. If they come up at the right place where tourists want to go, they can also be used for tourism,” said the transport department official. The official added the Centre is coming up with a heliport tourism policy and that the state was going to identify more places where helipads could be built to promote tourism in Bengal.In 2019, the National Green Tribunal ordered an injunction on the construction of a helipad on Sagar Island in the Sundarbans after an environment activist alleged mangroves were being destroyed for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/plans-for-4-helipads-in-sundarbans-for-better-disaster-management-101633411933133.html

05-10-2021||Mumbai||WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan, 2 others showed international drug trafficking: NCB to court||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has got the custody of Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, and two other accused arrested for alleged drug abuse onboard a cruise ship till Thursday. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate RM Nerlikar extended the NCB custody of the three keeping in view the fact that the agency recovered an intermediate quantity of drugs from one of them, and Aryan Khan was accompanying them. Nerlikar also took into consideration that the investigation was at a preliminary and crucial stage.The NCB arrested Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha on Sunday and produced them before a special holiday court later that day. That court remanded them to NCB custody till Monday. The NCB on Monday sought further custody of Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha till October 11, saying it had to unearth the nexus between drug consumers and suppliers and confront all the arrested accused with each other and apprehend other suppliers of narcotics substances. However, the court extended their custody only till October 7.The NCB claimed before the city court that "shocking and incriminating" material has been recovered in the WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha showed international drug trafficking. The NCB also claimed that Aryan Khan discussed modes of payment for procurement of drugs and that several code names were used. “Raids are going on now. Shocking and incriminating material recovered in WhatsApp chats of the accused shows international drug trafficking,” additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the NCB, argued. “All the accused persons have to be confronted with each other. The international transactions need to be investigated,” he adding that the NCB has arrested a supplier from Juhu and found a commercial quantity of drugs from him.Also read | 'Stop witch-hunting SRK’: Shashi Tharoor on Aryan Khan’s arrest in drugs caseSingh said while the sections under which the accused have been booked are bailable, the court has to consider the purpose of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) which is to remove the drug menace from the society, while hearing remand applications or granting bail. “One cannot say that just because he or she is found with a small quantity, they are entitled to bail. Consuming drugs has nowadays become very common with even college-going kids consuming them. The accused here are high profile persons who are considered as role models by regular persons,” the NCB counsel said.Aryan Khan's advocate Satish Maneshinde opposed the extension of custody sought by the NCB and argued that his client had no criminal antecedents. Maneshinde also claimed no drugs were recovered from his client's possession, who had shown good conduct by not running away from NCB officers when the raid was being conducted and allowed them to search him.Maneshinde argued Aryan Khan was invited to the cruise along with his friend Merchant and that he had not paid any money to get on the ship. “Nothing incriminating was recovered from Aryan Khan except his mobile phone. His friend (Merchant) was arrested because he had six grams of charas, but that has nothing to do with my client,” Maneshinde said.Also watch | Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chats had code words, says NCB; court extends custodyHe also refuted the NCB’s claims that Aryan Khan consumed drugs even when he was abroad. “During the entire period of his (Aryan) stay abroad, he has not been involved in any trafficking, supply or distribution of drugs,” Maneshinde said.Aryan Khan, Dhamecha and Merchant have been booked under sections 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell or purchase of drugs), 20(b) (punishment for contravention of cannabis), 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotics or drugs) read with section 35 of the NDPS act. Possession of up to one kg is termed as a 'small quantity' of cannabis and a seizure of over 20kg is considered as a 'commercial quantity' under the act. For charas or hashish, a small quantity is up to 100gm while commercial quantity is 1kg or more under the act. The NCB has said it seized 13gm of cocaine, five grams of MDMA, 21gm of charas and 22 pills of ecstasy and ₹133,000 in cash after it raided the Goa-bound cruise ship. The NCB said in its remand note against the five others arrested on Sunday night that it seized 2.5gm of ecstasy, 54.3gm of mephedrone (MD) and two grams of charas from them.Also read | Shah Rukh Khan, Aryan Khan being targeted, says Suchitra KrishnamoorthiTaraq Sayed, the lawyer who represented Merchant, said that there is no clarity of how much quantity of drugs was allegedly recovered from each of the accused and that the NCB was seeking custody only on the basis of some chats recovered from WhatsApp.“The remand note of the NCB is misleading. If only six grams of charas was recovered from Merchant, why is he being charged for the other drugs seized?

05-10-2021||Lucknow||Day after clashes, UP hamlet turns fortress||A nondescript hamlet just 10km away from the India-Nepal border, Tikunia was known in the region for its superior paddy crop and the Lohri mela, the folk festival marking the end of winter.But on Monday, the area turned into a fortress as close to 1,500 security personnel descended on the hamlet to contain the protests that started after the death of eight people, including four farmers, on Sunday. All the four farmers killed were Sikhs.Tikunia — in the Terai belt of the state — has a sizeable Sikh population comprising primarily of farmers, who have been protesting against the three cental farm laws. “Will we be killed for protesting peacefully now? What kind of rule is this?” asked a protesting farmer Jaswant Singh on hand-held megaphone, clad in a white kurta-pyjama and green turban. The crowd sitting on the ground listened quietly as the man continued, “If we remain quiet now, we will be silenced forever.”The protesters blocked the narrow road connecting the area with district headquarters, about 70 km away, demanding compensation for the kin of the deceased farmers and action against the local Bharatiya Janata Party MP -- Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra and his son Ashish Mishra, who is an accused in the case.“We will not leave this spot till a decision is made regarding the arrest of the minister and his son,” said a farmer standing atop a trolley, blocking the Tikunia road. Residents from the town, including youngsters, thronged to pay their respects to the four farmers, whose bodies were kept in freezers on the road. A large number of police personnel stood on one side of the road, 100 metres from the spot where farmers negotiated demands with government officials. Over 1,000 Sikh farmers and members of farm unions reached Tikunia from nearby districts and states, including Uttarakhand, Punjab and Haryana, to participate in the protest.Hundreds of Sikh volunteers carrying sticks managed the crowd, directing them towards the bodies and then to the ground, where the crowd swelled as the day progressed. The volunteers distributed tea and water to both the crowd and the security personnel.Later in the day, farm leader Rakesh Tikait asked protesting farmers to clear the road after the government accepted their demands. “This is a victory for all the farmers of the country. It is the first time that an FIR has been lodged against a Union minister in this government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/day-after-clashes-up-hamlet-turns-fortress-101633386056661.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A tragedy, and its aftermath||It was a brief sleep, and a deep sleep. And a rare occurrence, for Rupkesh Kumar, 53, never sleeps during the day. But this late afternoon he had a splitting headache. After quickly finishing dal-roti in an eatery, he parked his auto on the roadside, swallowed down a pain-killer, and sprawled his exhausted body along the passenger’s seat.“I instantly fell asleep.”He woke up 15 minutes later and discovered “my wallet was no longer in my shirt pocket. The shirt pocket too had gone. “The thief slashed it with a blade, I think.”Mr Kumar unbuttons the shirt and shows the remnants of the pocket. The “haadsa (tragedy)” took place some minutes ago, here along this central Delhi road. Still in shock, Mr Kumar is talking like a person who just got injured but is too dazed at the moment to feel the pain. He shows his other pocket. “He tried to cut this one too but couldn’t… It has my mobile.”Mr Kumar’s wallet had ₹370—“the money I’d made since the morning.” The amount isn’t substantial, he concedes, but “even the loss of a single hard-earned rupee hits hard.” Mr Kumar works daily from sunrise to sundown. It is 5pm. Perhaps he may prefer to stay on the road for a few more hours to compensate for the stolen cash.“This isn’t my auto. I drive it on rent and have to return it to the owner everyday by 6 latest.” He fears he will not be able to pay this day’s rent— ₹280. “That will add up as debt,” he rues, absentmindedly running his fingers over the part of the shirt that had the lost pocket.Such a thing has never happened before in Mr Kumar’s 28-year-old career as a Delhi auto driver. He buttons up the shirt. “I’ll have to now return the auto (to the owner in Kalyanpuri) for the day.” He later plans to call his wife and daughters in Meerut to “share the news.”Suddenly Mr Kumar becomes intensely hyperactive, opening up a drawer beside the auto’s steering handle. He seems to be searching for something, his hands are fumbling all over. “This morning I had no idea that… the day began normally…” He gradually slows down, closes the drawer, starts the auto and drives away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-tragedy-and-its-aftermath-101633384018964.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Of 341 dengue cases so far, 60+% reported last month||The total number of dengue cases reported in the Capital crossed the 300-mark on Monday as the weekly report released by the municipal corporations added 68 more cases, taking the total tally to 341 till October 2. Of the total, 217 cases (63.6%) were recorded in September, which is the highest number of cases seen in the month in the last three years.The cases of dengue usually start increasing in July and August after monsoons, and peaks in mid-October. This year, however, the cases started increasing in August-end and September due to heavy showers that the city received in the last month of monsoon.“There was an increase in mosquito breeding after the heavy rainfall. The rains were later than usual this year; it was also very heavy with gaps in between, all of which favoured breeding,” according to an official from the south corporation.Hospitals have also seen an increase in the number of cases being reported. “Dengue has increased substantially, probably 50-70% over the last three weeks. We see one or two person admitted with dengue every day at our hospital,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max hospital-Saket.He said, “The good thing is that most of the cases are mild and can be treated at home. Even in the few patients who were admitted, the symptoms resolved within two-three days.”There are four serotypes of dengue virus – Type 1 and 3 are the milder serotypes while type 2 and 4 are associated with severe disease. The Delhi government has started the “10 hafte, 10 baje, 10 minute” campaign to urge people to check for mosquito breeding in their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/of-341-dengue-cases-so-far-60-reported-last-month-101633383843653.html

05-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana to revise deputy commissioner rates||The Haryana government has decided to revise the deputy commissioner (DC) rates of various districts to rationalise wages paid to unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers.An official spokesperson said the state government had reviewed the matter, and decided to fix DC rates based on broad principles of minimum wages and district specific consumer prices. The methodology includes various factors like rental housing values, vegetable prices, school fee rates, etc. An annual increment of 5% will also be allowed in line with inflation. The DC rates for all categories and districts will be fixed by the general administration department (GAD) under the chief secretary. The spokesperson said the initial purpose of the DC rates was to have a readily available payment rate, which could be used in times of emergency, like engaging workforce for flood control works, etc., when it would not be feasible to go for tenders due to time constraints. Gradually, these rates came to be recognised as the standard rate of engagement of ad-hoc and temporary staff, even in non-emergency times. The spokesperson said for the purpose of revising the rates, districts had been classified into three categories. Category A includes Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula and Sonepat; Panipat, Jhajjar, Palwal, Karnal, Ambala, Hisar, Rohtak, Rewari, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Bhiwani and Jind are in Category B, while Mahendragarh, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Nuh and Charkhi Dadri will form Category C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-revise-deputy-commissioner-rates-101633380555242.html
05-10-2021||Chandigarh||Tardy pace of paddy procurement has Karnal farmers staring at glut||Even as paddy has been arriving steadily since Sunday, poor pace of procurement is leading to a glut at grain markets, leaving no space for farmers to unload more produce.Second day into the procurement, reports said only 10% of the produce coming in had been bought, while lifting of the procured paddy had not begun at most mandis.“Due to delayed procurement and lifting, there is no space to bring more produce and harvesting is also being held up. The grain markets will be overloaded in the next two-three days,” said a commission agent, Sohan Lal, at Ladwa grain market. On the hand, officials of procurement agencies said the farmers were arriving without any schedule, leading to disorder, and as per government norms, they cannot purchase paddy with moisture content beyond the permissible limit, which is 17%.“Officials are citing higher moisture content for delay, even when we are ready to bear deductions,” said Ajay Kumar, a farmer waiting at the Indri grain market in Karnal district.Vexed farmers lock mandi gatesOn Monday, as farmers arriving without schedule were not allowed to enter, they locked the entrance gates of grain markets at Karnal, Nilokheri and Indri. They also blocked highways to express resentment against the procurement norms set by the government.Later, Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav held a joint meeting with the farmers, commission agents and rice-millers, and assured that gate passes will be generated from 5am to 9pm every day.Rice millers also demanded waiver of the 5% security levied on them for milling the procured paddy under the custom-milled rice (CMR) policy. Yadav said the rice-millers had agreed to join the procurement process following an assurance to resolve their concerns within two days. He appealed to farmers to bring their produce as per schedule to avoid inconvenience and allow hassle-free procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tardy-pace-of-paddy-procurement-has-karnal-farmers-staring-at-glut-101633380553867.html

The farmers can’t indulge in such behaviour. I am not lodging any police complaint, but the incident depicts that miscreants are waiting to manhandle public representatives once they come out in public,” he said.On the other hand, local farmer leader Ranbir Singh alleged that the MLA reached the rest house while farmers were present there to intentionally provoke them.He claimed that the farmers only raised slogans as a mark of protest and no one manhandled the MLA.BKU activists gherao Haryana CM’s house in KarnalFarmers on Monday started an indefinite protest outside the residence of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Karnal to protest farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni’s detention in Uttar Pradesh.They threatened to intensify their agitation on Tuesday morning by blocking all highways of Haryana if Charuni was not released by Monday night.The protesters said Charuni was going to Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on Monday morning, when he and his aides were illegally detained by the UP police.Soon after the farmers reached the CM’s residence in Prem Nagar in the heart of Karnal city, the administration deployed police in the locality.Similar protests were reported in Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts, as BKU activists blocked the Hisar-Chandigarh highway at Titram Chowk in Kaithal.In Shahbad of Kurukshetra district, farmers gheraoed residences of sports minister Sandeep Singh and JJP MLA Ram Karan. “The protests will continue and will spread in the entire state if he is not released soon,” said Rakesh Bains, spokesperson of BKU (Charuni).Statewide protests against Lakhimpur Kheri violence, CM’s remarksEarlier in the day, farmers held peaceful demonstrations at the district headquarters across the state against the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s reported “pick- up sticks” and “tit-for-tat” advice to the BJP Kisan Morcha workers.The protesters assembled in large numbers following a call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) and held sit-in protests for three hours till 1pm, amid heavy police deployment.They reached the respective mini-secretariats, resorted to anti-government sloganeering and submitted memorandums to deputy commissioners (DCs) addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking action against the BJP leaders involved in the violence.They also sought the chief minister’s resignation for allegedly advising BJP workers to launch tit-for-tat action against the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws and not allowing the BJP-JJP leaders to hold public functions in the state.In Kaithal, tension prevailed when the protesters blocked the highway. As per reports, when the farmers went to hand over a memorandum to DC Pradeep Dhaiya, he did not come out for hours.When protesters blocked the Karnal-Kaithal highway, Kaithal SDM Sanjay Kumar rushed to the spot to pacify them and received the memorandum. According to Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU, Charuni) Rohtak district president Raju Makrauli, khaps and farmers blocked the Rohtak-Chandigarh national highway near Makrauli Kalan village of Rohtak and the Jind-Hisar road till 1pm.Ravi Azad, BKU’s state youth president, said protests were peaceful at all district headquarters.“Farmers are capable of giving a befitting reply to Khattar. It is deplorable that the CM is asking his party workers to retaliate violently,” said a protesting farmer leader Jagdip Aulakh.Congress burns UP, Haryana CMs’ effigiesMeanwhile, Congress workers burnt effigies of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.They held protests against Khattar’s reported remarks, now viral on social media, wherein BJP workers were advised to raise groups of 500-700 volunteers armed with lathis in each district of north and west Haryana, and retaliate against the protesting farmers. “The CM has used highly provocative language. He should resign. It is shameful that a CM is asking people to hold sticks against farmers,” said Tarlochan Singh, a Congress leader from Karnal.The protesters also gathered in large numbers in Ambala and Yamunanagar and demanded action against those responsible for the “murders” of the farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. A large number of activists affiliated to BKU (Charuni) protested at DC offices in both the regions and burnt Khattar’s effigies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charuni-detained-in-meerut-farmers-hold-bjp-mla-captive-in-hisar-101633380552249.html

Manipur’s additional chief secretary V Vumlumang, along with other officials, were physically present during its formal launching session at Bishnupur district headquarter, 35 kilometres south of Imphal.Congratulating the people of the country on this innovative step, the Union minister further added, “India is home to geographical diversities and drones can be used to deliver essentials to the last mile. We can use drones in delivering important life-saving medicines, collecting blood samples. This technology can also be used in critical situations.”“Our immunization program for Covid-19 has already exceeded all expectations. I strongly believe that this initiative will further help us achieve the highest possible immunization coverage for Covid-19. Incorporating such drone technologies into the national programs would help deliver other vaccines and medical supplies as quickly as possible,” he added.Sharing a video of the event on his social media accounts on Monday, Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh tweeted, “For the first time in South-East Asia, the State Govt in collaboration with ICMR launched a drone to deliver 900 doses of Covid vaccine from Bishnupur district hospital to the PHC in Karand island.”This i-Drone has been designed to overcome these challenges by deploying Unmanned Aerial vehicles/drones to remote areas and hard to reach terrains. Currently, the drone-based delivery project has been granted permission for implementation in Manipur and Nagaland, as well as Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Island, according to a PIB press release.ICMR conducted an initial study in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, to test the capacity of drones to carry and transfer vaccines safely in Manipur, Nagaland and Andaman and Nicobar.

According to officials, 62 cases were lodged in 2020, wherein drugs worth ₹91.56 lakh were seized and 71 persons were arrested during different operations by the ANC. In 2019, 73 persons were arrested and drugs worth ₹1.69 crore were seized in 62 cases registered by the anti-narcotics wing of the city police. According to the crime branch the banned drugs seized comprised cocaine, MD, ganja, hashish oil, brown sugar, heroin, mephedrone, LSD and MDMA. According to the ANC, MD topped the list of drugs seized, followed by cocaine, during the raids. The issue of narcotics search and seizure operations in Pune assumes significance in the wake of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan’s arrest, from a cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai. Deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Sriniwas Ghadge said, “We have seen a trend of buying drugs which are expensive amongst the youth, especially young women. It is the cultural and social set-up in which they live which has given rise to the increase in consumption. Also our teams are conducting regular raids to ensure that the flow of drugs is halted and the menace be brought to an end.” According Prakash Khandekar in-charge of ANC Unit II, police have seen the involvement of Nigerian nationals in the trade and the drugs are being brought to Pune from Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh through couriers. “It becomes very difficult to trace the main operators due to the need-to -know basis of the distribution channel. Sometimes, the consumers sell their drugs at high prices to the other consumers and earn money on the bought material. We are taking regular and strong action against all those involved in the trade.” Oct 1, 2021 Pune Crime Branch arrests two Nigerian nationals for possession of cocaine worth ₹2.17 lakh.

Therefore, monitoring these stations will help us provide detailed forecasts with respect to day and night temperatures in different parts of the city,” Kashyapi said.“As per our observations as of now, rainfall forecasts for these new stations may not vary so much. We will soon start issuing three hourly forecasts for these regions as well,” he said.Citizens can access the IMD Pune website to get localised forecasts and details of day and night temperatures of these stations.According to Kashyapi, “On the IMD Pune website, citizens can go to the Pune city weather section and get the data of all six stations under the ‘ARG Stations’ tab.” IMD Pune plans to further increase the number of stations. “Localised forecasts for Junnar, Purandhar, National Defence Academy (NDA), Wadgaon sheri and Talegaon are in the pipeline. Once the three new stations start monitoring and issuing data, other stations too will start,” Kashyapi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/thunderstorms-with-heavy-rainfall-in-pune-on-monday-evening-101633377070111.html

ED submitted a chargesheet against them before a designated court in Kolkata on September 1.The speaker sent the summons to CBI deputy superintendent of police Satyendra Singh and ED assistant director Rathin Biswas as these two officers signed the respective charge-sheets, assembly officials said.“I was surprised to see the agencies bypassing my office. It is mandatory to seek the speaker’s permission before filing charge-sheet against a sitting legislator,” Banerjee said before sending the second summons to the ED, asking its officers to appear before him on September 22.While ED wrote back to the speaker saying that the agency does not need to seek his sanction, CBI said the arrests were made after sanction was given by governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. CBI also petitioned the high court.On Monday, justice Rajasekhar Mantha, while hearing a CBI request, said the agency has to respond to the summons as the speaker is a constitutional authority but also directed that no harsh action should be taken against the officers. The judge asked CBI to file a report on the discussions with the speaker at the next court hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-officers-appear-before-bengal-speaker-over-narada-sting-chargesheet-101633376831018.html

He flew to different cities using his loot money and stayed in hotels with room rents ranging between ₹7000 and 10000 a day. In his entire life, he has looted more than ₹5 crore but spent almost all of it in wining and dining and visiting brothels,” said the DCP. When he was arrested, there was only ₹1,400 left in his bank account, he added.While studying in the BJB College in Bhubaneswar in the 1980s, the “crowbar man” was sent to jail in 1988 for his involvement in a case of group clash. There he came in contact with a notorious burglar in the jail. After his release from jail, he continued to be in touch with the notorious burglar and they became good friends. He then dropped out of college and chose burglary as his profession.Hemanta confessed that he looted only cash from hotels and houses and was committing the crimes alone.In 2018, the special squad arrested Hemanta and he was sent to jail.

In the memorandum, the CM also sought repeal of the three agriculture laws, which according to him is a reason behind deep resentment among farmers. Those accompanying the CM were his deputy OP Soni and ministers Brahm Mohindra, Manpreet Singh Badal, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Vijay Inder Singla, Randeep Singh Nabha, Raj Kumar Verka, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Gurkirat Singh Kotli,. Channi said he was forced to bring the matter to PM Narendra Modi’s notice as the violent incident at Lakhimpur Kheri has shaken the conscience of everyone. “It is all the more painful that our ‘annadatas’ (food providers) lost lives in this unfortunate incident while protesting peacefully against the farm laws,” he added. Seeking the PM’s intervention, Channi said the faces of real culprits behind this barbarous act should be exposed, howsoever influential or connected they might be.“The common people and farmers are feeling alienated from the present system, which has gradually crumbled due to erosion of democratic values and ethics. It is high time that people’s confidence and trust in the democratic set-up is restored,” the memorandum read. Farm organisations from across the country have been agitating amid the trying circumstances, an unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and harsh weather conditions for almost a year at the borders of Delhi, he added. “Several farmers have lost lives during the stir in the crusade against the three laws, which posed a threat to their livelihoods,” Channi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-charanjit-channi-cabinet-colleagues-meet-governor-over-lakhimpur-kheri-deaths-submit-memorandum-101633376354820.html

Effectively, consumers will have to dish out ₹59.50 per kg of CNG as opposed to ₹57.50 per kg according to the last hike in prices recorded on August 2 this year. On Monday, petrol cost was ₹107.95 per litre while that of diesel was ₹96.50 per litre. With soaring fuel prices, several vehicle users have already switched to CNG.With a majority of auto-rickshaws in the city running on CNG, convener of the Pune Auto-Rickshaw Association, Nitin Pawar, said that considering the surge in price will closely impact auto-rickshaw drivers’ lives, a hike in fares maybe in order.“Earlier, we had reduced the fare hike but as CNG prices have inched closer to ₹60 per kg, it seems inevitable. As it is, the lives of operators of this business had become difficult due to overall inflation. Now to make things worse, CNG prices have increased. After meetings with all stakeholders, a final decision on the fare hike will be taken. It is already being implemented in Mumbai,” Pawar said.Social activists working for rickshaw drivers said that even a hike of ₹2 will impact profit margins. Keshav Kshirsagar, head of the organisation, Baghtoy Rickshawala, said, “Even the slightest hike impacts profit margins. A hike of ₹2 per kg may seem slight for a regular CNG vehicle user but it makes a great difference to rickshaw drivers.”Those who use CNG cars are also miffed with the price hike. Sunil Pote, who switched from petrol to CNG for his car expressed disappointment over the increase in price. “A few months ago, I decided to switch to CNG because of soaring petrol prices. But now CNG price is also increasing. How is a common man to stay afloat! If this continues, fuel will soon be out of reach of the common people,” Pote said.Prices under Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL)PMC (Pune Municipal Corporation) area + Fursungi + Pisoli + Ambegaon: ₹59.50 per kgPCMC (Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation) area + Hinjewadi + Chakan: ₹59.50 per kgNashik-Dhule-Valsad area: ₹63.50 per kgRamanagara district: ₹60 per kgSindhudurg district: ₹64 per kg(Source: MNGL website)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cng-price-hiked-by-2-in-pune-rickshaw-union-says-fares-may-increase-101633376349903.html

However, Faesal resigned from the party after he was released from jail, where he was detained soon after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A.This led to Mir’s appointment as the president of the party and his departure will effectively render the fold without any prominent leader.Mir said his politics was founded on honesty: “When I was in People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, the case of Article 370 was in court, and it’s still in court when I am joining a new party today.”The last few months have seen many former legislators and ministers joining either the People’s Conference or the Apni Party, which political analysts say reflects leaders’ hope for elections in Jammu and Kashmir in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/peoples-movement-chief-javeed-mustafa-mir-joins-apni-party-101633376229643.html

Government should tell where this money went,” he said.The Congress leader said the eight accused, who were arrested in the case, had got bail which reflected that the government deliberately pleaded its case in a careless manner and its intention to hush up the matter.He said the MMU chairman was already facing a case under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code for a similar scam while running some vocational courses back in 1998, when also BJP was in power.“Despite this, he managed to get a huge chunk of land to set up a private university in 2008 when BJP introduced the Private Universities Act,” he said. “This is a fit case for CBI investigation, but the government is avoiding the probe as it wants to save those behind it,” he alleged, adding that even senior BJP leader Shanta Kumar had raised the matter with the government and demanded punishment for the real culprits.‘Benami land deals rising under BJP regime’Rana further alleged that benami land deals were on the rise under the current BJP regime and some ruling party leaders were also involved in it.He said the registry of a piece of land measuring 38 kanals near the international cricket stadium was done for just ₹75 lakh, while its actual price was in crores.“This was just to convert black money into white. The person on whose name the land was bought is a farmer, with no source of such huge income,” he alleged, adding that while the government talked tall about zero tolerance against corruption, it was itself in neck deep in corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-govt-shielding-fake-degrees-scam-accused-sujanpur-mla-101633375930193.html

The new rules have been published in the media and are also available on the SRA website.SRA chief executive officer Rajendra Nimbalkar said, “The citizens can file suggestions and objections till October 28 following which objections will not be registered.”“In Pune city, 28% of the population lives in slums while in Pimpri-Chinchwad, 14.85% of the population lives in slums. Pune city has 486 declared slums with 1.65 lakh families living there,” Nimbalkar said.Although 28% of the city population lives in slums, they occupy only around 4% of the land and live without any basic facilities, as per official data. The state government constituted the SRA to improve slums and give better homes to slum dwellers free-of-cost by developing these plots. The scheme is being implemented with the help of private builders. SRA is a separate organisation working for slum redevelopment. The Pune Municipal Corporation is also planning to file suggestions and objections on the new rules. BJP leader Ujwal Keskar said, “This issue is related to 28% of the city population. We will carry out a detailed study of the plan and submit our objections to it very soon.

State party chief along with the AICC secretary co-in-charge for party affairs in Himachal Sanjay Dutt and leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri called on AICC in-charge for Himachal affairs Rajiv Shukla in Delhi to apprise them about the candidates.“We have apprised the party high command about the prospects of the candidates,” said PCC chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore. Pradesh election committee had passed a single-line resolution asking the high command to take a final decision on the names.There were single names of the party leader from Jubbal Kotkhai and Fatehpur. Former chief parliamentary secretary Rohit Thakur who’s been a legislator twice had taken to campaigning much in advance. The bypolls to Jubbal Kotkhai had been necessitated after the death of former horticulture minister Narendra Bragta.Rohit is the grandson of former chief minister Ram Lal Thakur and BJP has already given a go-ahead to Narendra Bragta’s elder so in Chetan Bragta.Bhawani Singh Pathania, son of Rajput leader and former minister Sujan Singh Pathania, is the party’s lone choice from Fathepur. The race is intense in Arki where the party had to make choice from Sanjay Awasthi and Rajender Thakur, a local leader in Arki and close aide of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh.Sanjay Awasthi had contested to assembly in 2012 on Congress ticket but lost to Govind Ram of BJP by a slender margin, and in 2017 Virbhadra Singh shifted to Arki vacating Shimla rural for his son Vikramaditya Singh. Awasthi’s candidature is being backed by former PCC chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu.From Mandi parliamentary seat, former Lok Sabha member Pratibha Singh’s candidature is almost certain. Pratibha has been a member of Parliament twice from the Mandi seat which her husband represented five times. Congress is hoping to gain sympathy votes in Mandi after Virbhadra Singh’s demise.Former health minister Kaul Singh’s name also figured for Mandi but he himself had been unwilling to contest elections while former Union minister Sukhram’s grandson Ashray Sharma is intensely lobbying for the ticket using his grandfather clout in Delhi. Ashray had lost elections to BJP’s Ramsaroop Sharma in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/october-30-bypolls-himachal-congress-sends-four-names-to-party-high-command-101633375570050.html
05-10-2021||Pune||Chipi airport will land tourists... locals believe business will take off||PUNE For Sameer Mhadgut and his family, it is an exciting opportunity to start a small restaurant after him having served in the hospitality industry for years.If the Covid-induced lockdown took away his job, the upcoming airport at Chipi in Sindhudurg district has opened the doors to a new life for the Mhadguts.With the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) granting an aerodrome licence to Sindhudurg airport, aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia will inaugurate the airport on October 9, putting this Konkan backwater firmly on the country’s aviation radar. Locals feel the new airport at Chipi will bring an economic boom with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for locals, who otherwise have to migrate to Mumbai and Pune for better employment opportunities. “I was working with a private firm earlier and when the countrywide lockdown was imposed last year, tourism and other industries in Sindhudurg district came to standstill with people losing jobs. So we decided to start our own small restaurant in Malvan. One of the major reasons we took this decision was the Sindhudurg airport, which will bring more tourists, which means more business for us,” said Mhadgut, 42, who stays in Malvan city along with his wife, daughter and son. Like him, many on the costal belt are looking forward to the opening up of new opportunities in the region and competing with neighbouring Goa, now that the airport in Sindhdurg will aim to be as good as the Dabolim airport near Vasco, if not better. The Sindhdurg airport in Chipi surrounded by various tourist destinations like the the historic Sindhudurg fort in Malvan, and serene beaches at Tarkarli, Devbagh, and Chivla. The airport falls under Vengurla tehsil, bordering Goa. International tourists landing at Dabolim airport, 90km from Chipi, will now be one target audience. The Sindhudurg airport cost approximately ₹8 crore to set up and is the first of its kind in the south Konkan region, aimed at enhancing air connectivity with western Maharashtra and the southern states. “The airport, an SPV of IRB Infra, will not only generate passenger traffic, but will also be a boon for the economic development of the region as it will facilitate and boost cargo transportation, and generate direct as well as indirect employment and other business opportunities for the local people,” reads a recent statement from IRB, after the airport received its aerodrome licence on September 17. Locals feel the Chipi airport, which was awaiting clearance for four years, will open the doors of the Konkan to the world. Currently, most international tourists visit this costal belt on the Konkan railway by boarding trains from Mumbai, 550km from Vengurla. “Before Covid, 1,000 people used to come to our watersports centre on a daily basis and to cater them we had staff of 22 people. This number will increase once we start getting more foreigners coming to Sindhudurg after the resumption of flight operations. This is going to play a major role in creating job opportunities in the tourism industry in our region,” said Damodar Todankar, owner of a watersport centre at Malvan beach. Sindhudurg beaches offer scuba diving, parasailing and the mandatory speed boats and jet-skis. For mango and cashew growers, along with fishermen, cargo services once flight operations begin, offer much hope. “It has the potential to become a cargo hub of the western region as there is ample space for handling the cargo, and is expandable to meet the future growing needs,” a statement from IRB Infra adds. According to Nitin Walke, former president and current convenor of the Sindhudurg district Vyapari Mahasangh, cargo services from the airport is what farmers and traders have been looking for. “There are several major agriculture products the region grows, like mango and cashew, apart from the fisheries. This cargo service can bring a revolution for locals who can send their products internationally. There are 10,000 traders and small shop owners around the district who would benefit from this cargo service,” said Walke. According to airport officials, the 2,500-metre-long runway can handle 200 departing and 200 arriving passengers during peak hours and is suited for operating A-320 and B-737 types of aircraft. The government is looking start flight operations here under the UDAN scheme. Political mileage: who is in the pilot’s seat?Politically, it is likely to provide mileage for Union minister and BJP leader Narayan Rane, who was a driving force behind the airport. For Shiv Sena, the airport is equally important to retain its hold over Konkan. After becoming union minister, Rane’s first major achievement has been the airport, first envisaged around 15 years ago, though on-ground work began only five years ago. Nitesh Rane, son of Narayan Rane and legislator from Kankavali in Sindhudurg district said, “I think it is more important to give due respect to everyone who has given their contribution for development of this airport. I don’t want to see this positive beginning from a political angle. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Union minister Narayan Rane and of course, union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia will all be present on the inauguration day which is more important to me,” said Nitesh Rane. According to Nitesh Rane, the airport will bring change the way investors and traders look at this region. “The class of tourists who will fly down to Sindhudurg airport with family will eventually help the local people increase revenue. There will be direct and in-direct employment opportunities coming up now all across the district, once the airport starts operating.” Maharashtra’s technical and higher education minister and the guardian minister of Sindhudurg district Uday Samant said, “Around two years ago Uddhav Thackeray was on a Konkan tour and he had given a commitment to start the Chipi airport for the development of the region. Finally, this dream is coming true.” This proposed inauguration of this green airport stands in contrast to projects proposed previously by various governments, that either met with resistance from locals or failed to gather momentum; one being the Nanar refinery. After stiff resistance, the then Devendra Fadnavis government was forced to shift the refinery from Nanar to a location the government has not announced yet. Then there is the Enron-Dabhol power project, which after facing opposition initially, eventually began functioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chipi-airport-will-land-tourists-locals-believe-business-will-take-off-101633375452377.html

The protesters also submitted a memorandum addressed to the President of India. BKU (Sidhupur) state vice-president Mehar Singh Theri said, “This has been done under a deep conspiracy hatched by the Uttar Pradesh and central governments.”Farm leader Parminder Singh Sohana said, “It is clear from these incidents that some persons in constitutional positions are using their power for planned violence against the peaceful agitators. This is a crime against the Constitution and the country under the laws of the land.” In the memorandum, the farmers have demanded that Union MoS Ajay Mishra be sacked and charged with inciting violence and communal hatred, besides murder of farmers. “An immediate arrest should be made and the case should be investigated by a special investigation team under the supervision of the Supreme Court,” the letter read, further seeking the removal of Manohar Lal Khattar from the post of Haryana chief minister.

The centrally-sponsored scheme is applicable for the meritorious and economically weaker students of government, government-aided and local body schools.Those, who pass Class 8 with at least 55% marks and are regular students in Class 9, are eligible to apply for NMMS. The annual family income of the candidate should not be more than ₹1.5 lakh. Teachers and students overburdenedDistrict education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra has asked the NTSE school representatives, district mentors (DM), block mentors (BM), school nodal officers, and the school heads to hold daily classes to prepare students for NMMS and NTSE.The teachers feel that the department has created a ‘war-like situation’ for the students. While teachers are already teaching students NAS modules during school hours and preparing them for NTSE via online classes in the evening, they will now also have to cover the syllabus for the NMMS exam during the virtual lessons.The block mentors or the nodal in-charges share the science, mathematics, and mental aptitude test (MAT) modules and videos with the students in special Whatsapp groups formed for this purpose.“Teachers have too much on their plates. We are finding it difficult to do our jobs. We have already been preparing students for NAS and NTSE, and now the department has directed us to hold classes for NMMS as well. This is too much, not only for us but also the students,” said a government school teacher.Voicing the same concern, another teacher said it has become difficult to teach the mainstream syllabus as they are busy preparing students for these exams.“At times, I feel like quitting my job as the department is pressurizing us to get the top spot for the state. All this pressure can even deteriorate our health,” she said.Meanwhile, Davinder Singh Chhina, nodal officer, media, education department, Ludhiana, stated that the department is preparing the students for the future entrance exams and get admissions in good colleges.“The trend and technique of the three exams are the same. We want a maximum number of our students to procure the scholarships. Our resource teams are working hard to train them.

Bhartiya Janata party (BJP) leader Vineet Pal Singh Monga said, “No parking fee can be charged om the site, but a few miscreants supported by the Congress councillor Poonam Malhotra were collecting around ₹50,000 a day from vendors, and those parking their buses, four-wheelers and two-wheelers on the site.Monga alleged that the illegal practice was being carried out on the say-so of a Cabinet minister. Seeking a vigilance inquiry into the matter, a complaint has been forwarded to the chief minister’s office, local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, Central Bureau of Investigation, Ludhiana deputy commissioner and commissioner of police among others. A copy has also been forwarded to the Prime Minister’s office. Monga alleged that the land had been lying vacant for a long time and that the fee was being collected illegally for the last two years, which had led to a fraud of around ₹3.6 crore. “Around ₹500 is charged for parking a bus and ₹50 for a four-wheeler. A fixed monthly rent is collected from vendors. The LIT officials are also hand in gloves with the miscreants,” he alleged.“Action should be taken against the miscreants, and the politicians who patronise them. LIT officials are also involved in the scam as nothing was done to rectify the situation, though we had submitted a complaint with them in August,” said Monga. Refuting the allegations, councillor Poonam Malhotra said the BJP leader was levelling baseless allegations and she had nothing to do with collection of parking fee. “If someone is illegally charging parking fees from the visitors, then the LIT should lodge an FIR in the matter,” said Malhotra.It is a free parking site: LIT chairmanMeanwhile, LIT officials said that buses had been removed from the site after transport minister Raja Warring visited the bus stand on October 3 and directed that private buses be removed from the site. LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said posters had been installed at the site advertising the spot as a free parking site for bikes, autos and cars, until a parking contract was formally allotted by the LIT. “Parking of buses will not be allowed on the site and a height barrier will also be installed at the site in a few days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-seeks-vigilance-probe-into-illegal-charging-of-parking-fee-on-lit-land-101633375390947.html

Kerala is known for its communal amity and brotherhood and nobody can dent it,” he said. The Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front and a section of religious heads have been demanding all-party and all-religion meetings for quite some time.The CM reiterated his position that there was no need for a meeting to discuss a non-issue like ‘narcotic jihad’. Soon after the bishop’s statement, the CM had said the religious leader’s statement was “unfortunate and uncalled for” and both love jihad and narcotic jihad were not based on any statistics or fact. The bishop’s statement had triggered a war of words between different communities in the state even as opposition parties urged the government to call an all-party meeting. Addressing a church ceremony in Kottayam on September 9, the bishop came out against a particular community, saying that Catholic girls and youth were targeted by it. “Wherever arms are not used, narcotic drugs are being used and Catholic girls turn victims. Some groups are functioning in the state to support them. To understand this, one needs to analyse how women from other religions landed in the Islamic State camps,” he said. The bishop was referring to the trip of 21 people, including five converts to Islam, from north Kerala to Afghanistan in 2016. Though there were widespread resentments over his remarks, the bishop later justified his statement in church mouthpiece ‘Deepika.’ In an article, the bishop said pseudo-secularism will destroy the country. “Those who insist that one should not talk about the evils that befall his own community are silently encouraging such things to flourish. Instead of ignoring the warnings, attempts should be made to discuss and study these issues to prevent such social evils,” he said, adding that pseudo-secularists are trying to suppress voices that point out evils in the society. He said while secularism remains the core of the country, pseudo-secularism will destroy it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-cm-vijayan-rules-out-meeting-of-religious-heads-over-narcotic-jihad-row-101633375269458.html

Petitioners contended that the decision was taken without hearing them and it was also a violation of natural justice.They argued that the state government has no right to fix the price for the testing and cited the price of RT-PCR tests in neighbouring states to buttress their point. They also said criminal cases were slapped on some of the laboratories after they refused to do RT-PCR tests citing loss.At this point the state government submitted a report stating that the cost of kits and related consumables have drastically come down and the argument of the private labs was not right. Test rate in Punjab is ₹415 while it costs ₹500 in Maharashtra, Haryana and Uttarakhand, it said.The government said it arrived at the figure of ₹500 as per the advice of the Kerala Medical Services Corporation (KMSC) and all expenditures will come to ₹448.20 per test. The private labs, however, contended that rates arrived at by the KMSC were not justified as it makes purchases for the state in bulk and, therefore, can get the materials at a price lesser than the institutions which do not procure the same in such large volumes.But the court after hearing both sides said there is merit in the contention of the petitioners and directed the government to talk to private laboratories and fix a new rate in three weeks that would be economical for labs and patients.Meanwhile, the state reported 8850 Covid-19 new cases on Monday after 128,736 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 11.82%. It also reported 149 deaths taking total fatalities to 25,526, according to the data released by the state health ministry. Active cases also reduced to 128,736. The state has been reporting maximum cases in the country for almost four months. Cases peaked after Onam festival in August-end.

If we can curb the drug supply to these higher educational institutions, we can control 80 per cent of the drug menace in the state,” the chief minister said.He asked the police department and the special enforcement bureau (SEB) of the prohibition and excise department to keep a watch on the colleges and universities to find out the source of the supply of drugs.“We have to identify the institutions where the consumption of drugs is high and map all such colleges. With the help of intelligence and the SEB, the police should track down the origin where these narcotics are coming from and who is supplying the same. If we can break the network of drug peddlers, we can control the menace easily,” Jagan said.Asking the police to take curbing the drug menace in educational institutions as a challenge, the chief minister instructed all the district superintendents of police and commissioners of police to work out an action plan on the issue and submit reports on supply and consumption of narcotics once in four weeks.“Our endeavour should be making all the educational institutions completely drug-free,” he said.There have been periodical reports of seizure of drugs from students in the state. In April this year, the Guntur (Urban) police booked cases against six students of a private university in the district for consuming drugs in an apartment near Tadepalli, close to the residence of the chief minister. The police seized 1.9 kg of ganja, two hookahs, bhang bottles, and six mobile phones.The recent arrest of a Telugu couple in Chennai linked to seizure of nearly 3,000 kg of heroin worth around ₹9,000 crore by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) at Mundra port in Gujarat, triggered a political uproar in the state.The main opposition Telugu Desam Party alleged that the arrested couple – Machavarapu Sudhakar and his wife Vaishali, have links with the YSRC leaders in East Godavari district.The firm floated by the couple – Aashi Trading Company, located at Vijayawada supposedly for exporting of rice from Kakinada – was the recipient of the consignment of heroin, declared as semi-processed talcum powder, being imported from Afghanistan to Mundra Port via Bandar Abbas Port in Iran.The Andhra Pradesh police, however, denied the allegation that the heroin was meant for distribution within the state. Vijayawada city police commissioner B Srinivasulu said the consignment was not meant to reach Vijayawada. “Except for using the address of a house owned by Vaishali’s mother, no activity relating to drug peddling was noticed in Vijayawada,” Srinivasulu said.The TDP, however, alleged that thousands of crores had changed hands in the drug peddling in the state. “Drug mafia is ruling the roost in the state and import of drugs, supply of ganja, gutka have become common. The YSRCP leaders have emerged as drug dons and smuggling kings,” a statement from the TDP on Monday said.At the review meeting in the afternoon, the chief minister, however, accused the opposition leaders of falsely propagating a drug deal which was not connected to the state. “The opposition is making irresponsible statements to tarnish the image of the police department, the government as well as the people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/make-colleges-and-universities-narcotics-free-andhra-pradesh-cm-jagan-tells-police-101633375089500.html
05-10-2021||Other||Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin reaches out to 12 CMs, seeks support against NEET||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin has written to his counterparts in 11 non-BJP-ruled states and Goa, seeking their support to oppose the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and restore “the primacy of states” in education, the government said on Monday. Stalin has also deputed his party MPs to reach out to the heads of such states to drum up support against NEET held for medical admissions. In a letter to his counterparts, the chief minister reiterated his government’s opposition to NEET. “Our considered position has always been that the move by the union government to introduce NEET goes against the spirit of federalism and violates the constitutional balance of power by curbing the rights of the state governments to decide on the method of admission in the medical institutions founded, established and run by them,” he said. The state governments need to assert their constitutional right and position in deciding the method of admission to their higher educational institutions, Stalin urged in a letter dated October 1, made available to the media on Monday.The CM enclosed a copy of the Justice A K Rajan Committee report based on which a Bill was passed in the assembly last month to dispense with NEET and provide for admission to medical courses based on Class 12 marks to ensure social justice. Also, a copy of that Bill, passed on September 13, was attached.Stalin requested them to peruse the attached documents and extend their support to ensure that the students in the respective states, hailing from rural areas and marginalised sections of the society are not put to hardship in obtaining admissions to higher educational institutions. “We need to put up a united effort to restore the primacy of state governments in administering the education sector, as envisaged in our Constitution. I look forward to your cooperation in this crucial issue.” Stalin wrote to the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, West Bengal and Goa.The Justice Rajan panel, constituted by the government to ascertain the impact of NEET in the state, had submitted its 165-page report in July. The Bill, quoting the panel report, had said if NEET continued for a few more years, the health care system of Tamil Nadu would be very badly affected and there may not be enough doctors for postings in primary health centres or state-run hospitals and that the rural and urban poor may not be able to join the medical courses.The committee had concluded that the NEET is not a fair or equitable method of admission since it favours the rich and elite section of the society and is against the disadvantaged groups. The panel had recommended that “the state government may undertake immediate steps to eliminate NEET from being used in admission to medical programmes at all levels by following the required legal and or legislative procedures.” SC dismisses plea seeking cancellation of NEET The Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain a plea seeking cancellation of the NEET, undergraduate, held on September 12 on the ground that the examination was not conducted in a fair and transparent manner.The apex court dismissed the plea saying that cancellation of the exam cannot be at the cost of lakhs of students.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, which stopped short of imposing ₹5 lakh cost, noted that the petitioner seeks setting aside the NEET-UG Exam and directing the National Testing Agency to conduct the exam afresh.The basis is that CBI has registered 3 FIRs wherein it has stated that there has been impersonation of the candidates, the apex court noted.“What kind of writs are filed under Article 32? Lakhs of people have taken these exams? When people come to you (advocate), don’t you say that these will be dismissed with cost? You now want to cancel the entire exam? You argue, we’ll deal with this at length and we’ll deal with you specially,” the bench also comprising Justice B R Gavai said.Advocate Ninad Dogra, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that CBI has registered three FIRs and examination papers were leaked on WhatsApp.The top court was hearing a plea filed by 20-year-old petitioner Saloni seeking cancellation of the NEET UG exam held on September 12, 2021, citing alleged malpractices and conducting the exam afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-chief-minister-stalin-reaches-out-to-12-cms-seeks-support-against-neet-101633375029506.html

Allianze Airlines is operating flights out of Chipi right now and bookings are full till October 21. The formal inauguration of the airport, by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia is on October 9. The airport is located in Chipi village uner Vengurla tehsil and apart from the local attractions, Goa is 95km away. The airport came up under the Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT) model, with a runway that is 2,500 metres long and 45 metres wide, and can further be extended by 1,000 metres. The passenger-handling capacity is 400 pax or two flights per hour, with aircraft like the Airbus A-320 and Boeing 737 cleared to land. Kiran Kumar Chikkote, director, Sindhudurg airport said, “The first flight is by Allianze Airlines with an ATR 72 aircraft which will land here at 1 pm from Mumbai. It will return to Mumbai at 2 pm on the same day. Depending on passenger load, other airlines will come in. People around the Sindhudurg are enthusiastic, as it has been a long-pending demand.” Sindhudurg district has 21 beaches. “The airport will put Sindhudurg just 50 minutes way from Mumbai. In the next five years there will be 20 to 25 flights operating from this airport,” said Chikkote. The airport is an “all-weather airport” that received clearance from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Currently, it has been given visual flight rules (VFR) for day operation permission, and later on looking at the load factor, it can get instrument flight rules (IFR) for night operation permission, according to officials. According to Chikkote, the airport design is for both day and night flight operations, and can handle domestic and international flights as well. “There is a vision of another 90 years ahead while building this airport,” he added. IRB Sindhudurg Airport is a special purpose vehicle of IRB Infrastructure Developer that was formed and mandated with the task of project development and operations. Virendra Mhaiskar, chairman and managing director (CMD) at IRB had earlier said, “We are very happy to achieve yet another milestone in the current year and see the airport receive the licence to operate after successful completion. We now look forward to opening the facility for airline operators and the general public soon.” Speaking about starting of cargo services from the airport, Chikkote said, it may take some time to operationalise. “As we all know there are three major products here - mangoes, cashews and fisheries. We have plans to start the cargo though it may take some time. Everything being produced here goes to Mumbai and from there to the international market. We have provisions and enough space to start cargo services. As per the load factor and response to the flights these further decisions will be taken,” Chikkote said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mumbai-to-sindhudurg-in-50-minutes-flight-bookings-full-till-oct-21-101633374912870.html

The applications were withdrawn due to no fresh developments in the trial court. The matter is now listed for hearing on December 4.This was the first hearing after appointment of senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains as special public prosecutor by Punjab to deal with post sacrilege violence cases. Advocate Sant Pal Singh Sidhu appeared for the former DGP, who was earlier being represented by Punjab’s advocate general APS Deol.Senior advocate Deol paved the way for Bains’ appointment on October 1 as his appointment came under criticism since he had represented Saini in these cases. Senior advocate Gurminder Singh is appearing for Umranangal. In these pleas, both have sought quashing of the FIR and chargesheet submitted by the special investigation team of Punjab police and transfer of case to the CBI. Initially, the FIR (number 130) was registered against Charanjit Singh, former Moga SSP, and subsequently the duo, too, were nominated as the accused.The case was registered on October 21, 2015, a week after two protesters were killed allegedly in the police firing at Behbal Kalan in the aftermath of incidents of sacrilege reported at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. In the second set of the FIR of 2015 sacrilege violence (FIR 129 registered at Kotkapura police station), the chargesheet submitted has been quashed and the SIT has been told to file it afresh by the high court in April 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-ex-punjab-dgp-saini-umranangal-withdraw-applications-on-advancing-of-hearing-101633374909430.html
05-10-2021||Chandigarh||PGIMER to review operations as OPD footfall rises||With the number of patients getting physically examined at outpatient departments (OPDs) of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) rising by 67% over a week, the institute will call a review meeting in a week to decide upon the operations. The PGIMER had resumed the walk-in facility for physical consultation at its OPDs on September 27. Since then, in the six working days, 32,913 patients were physically examined while 8,540 people were given consultation on telephones. The OPDs were closed on Saturday (Gandhi Jayanti) and Sunday. On Monday, 6,579 patients got physical consultation at the hospital’s New OPD department, as compared to 3,942 last Monday. Before the resumption of the walk-in facility, nearly 3,000 patients were visiting various OPDs daily, after prior appointments through tele-consultation or official website.Keeping in view the possibility of a third wave, the institute authorities believe that capping the number of patients for physical examination is important. The institute is providing tele-consultation only between 8 am to 9 am, to scale up physical consultation.“The number of patients coming to the institute is more than expected. Since Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh and neighbouring states are fluctuating daily, crowding at one place can spread the infection. A cap of numbers and resuming OPDs in a phased manner is a must,” said a PGIMER official, who did not wish to be named. Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, said that on an average, 6,000 patients are visiting the institute daily, and each patient has two or three attendants with them. The total footfall is more than 18,000 daily. “At present, we are trying to manage the crowd and are accessing problems being faced by patients. In a week, we will call a review meeting with heads of each department and will decide upon further action. Guidelines on OPD operations will be reviewed,” he said. Before the contagion, over 10,000 patients visited PGIMER’s OPDs daily. Since the suspension of walk-in consultation and online appointments in March last year, the institute had been providing OPD services through tele-consultation. From June 21 this year, physical consultations resumed, but only after prior appointment through tele-consultation.On September 6, the institute also restarted an online appointment facility, but with a cap of 30 patients per department to ensure adherence to Covid protocols. Later, the limit was increased to 50 patients, with 100 allowed at three major departments — opthalmology (eye), hepatology (liver) and internal medicine.Now, patients can simply walk into the institute’s New OPD between 9.15am and 11am and get registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-to-review-operations-as-opd-footfall-rises-101633374852074.html

Under Section 30 of the Punjab Panchayati Raj Act, a gram panchayat has the duty to plant and preserve trees on roadsides and other public lands under its control. Further, under Section 6 of the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, a gram panchayat can auction only such trees standing on its shamlat land, which may be useless and surplus, the court was told. It was added that the administration, however, cannot declare useless and surplus the 337 trees of different varieties on the shamlat land. The forest cover in Punjab is depleting, therefore, trees have to be protected, the court was told, adding that auction of such a large number of trees by a gram panchayat is a severe blow to the environment of the area concerned. The court has posted the matter for November 1 and restrained cutting of trees within the area in question till the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-bars-mohali-admn-from-cutting-trees-in-majri-101633374849503.html

Upon a thorough search of the suspected SUV, police recovered smuggled gold weighing 48.14 kilograms (approx) worth ₹22,78,46,620.Police said the gold, in bars, were found hidden under the cover of the gear lever of the vehicle. The consignment and the vehicle were seized and two persons - Saurabh Singh (35) and Pawan Kumar (45), both residents of Uttar Pradesh, have been detained for further questioning to initiate appropriate legal action, the ADGP said.Besides the smuggled gold, the state police also confiscated 552 grams of illegal contraband suspected to be heroin and about 12 Kg opium at the same checkpoint, while another 532 grams of suspected heroin were seized from another location on the highway within the last 48 hours. Seven persons have been taken into custody in connection with the cases, police said. The total value of the seized illegal drugs is estimated to be worth over ₹4 crores in the international market.“In the quest of controlling the menace of drugs and narcotics under psychotropic substances along with the rest of the country, Nagaland police is also equally committed to controlling this menace,” Tamgadge said. He stated that the state police has increased its efforts towards this so as to make the highway from Manipur linking Assam and Nagaland free of all kinds of illegal activities.Although the cops did not divulge on the destination of the seized goods, PRO Nagaland police headquarters Manoj Kumar said investigation on said cases will be taken up in multiple states as the contraband was intercepted in transit. According to narcotics officials, Nagaland is used as a prime conduit route by drug traffickers as the state is located in close proximity with the Golden Triangle of the drug world, especially with it sharing borders with Myanmar. Conventionally, the Golden Triangle is a region between the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand.An official, who did not wish to be named, mentioned that while the Government of India looking to boost foreign trade by building economic corridors in the northeast region with neighbouring South-East Asian nations through the Act East Policy, there is an uneasiness that this could also open ways for illicit drugs to easily ride the new access routes of greater connectivity.....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-police-seize-smuggled-bullion-and-drugs-worth-over-rs-25-cr-in-48-hours-101633374790955.html

The protesting traders also submitted a memorandum with MC zonal commissioner (Zone A) Jasdev Sekhon.They rued that despite repeated complaints submitted with the MC official, the authorities have failed to resolve the issue.President of the association, Bittu Gumber, stated that the dust arising from potholed roads enters their shops and is taking a toll on the health of the shopkeepers and customers. The customers avoid visiting the market and the shopkeepers who are already facing financial constraints due to the ongoing pandemic are left a harried lot.“Over five months have elapsed since the road was dug up for installation of a storm sewer. The road also caved in from different points during monsoon and many vehicles got stuck there as a result.

While hearing a petition filed by advocate NP Amrutesh, a single-judge bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit issued the notice. “Office objections are overruled. Learned AGA is requested to accept notice to the respondent. Issue emergent notice to respondent No 4 (BS Indrakala),” it stated.The case came to light when a person identified as Yuvaraj Swami was arrested in December 2020 by Bengaluru police for allegedly cheating several people of crores of rupees by promising them high positions. Following his arrest, the former high court Judge B.S. Indrakala filed a complaint with police saying she had paid sums of ₹3.7 crore and ₹4.5 crore on two different occasions to Yuvaraj. The payments were made after Yuvaraj had promised the governor’s post. She also named another person in the complaint in the scam. However, it was the former judge’s claim that Yuvaraj did not secure her a post as promised nor did he return the money that was paid to him for securing the said post. Following this, the petitioner, advocate NP Amrutesh, on December 21 last year, filed a complaint with the police where he highlighted the involvement of the former judge in the bribing scandal. “As the complicity of the Respondent No.4 (former judge) was forthcoming in the said FIR and also various newspaper reports, the petitioner submitted a representation dated January 16, 2021 to the police narrating in detail the involvement of Respondent No.4 and that the allegations made in her written information, dated December 21, 2020 incriminate her and as such request police to investigate the same and take necessary action,” the bench had said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-high-court-issues-notice-to-former-judge-in-graft-case-101633374313127.html

The incident took place when Congress workers, led by Navjot Singh Sidhu, reached the governor’s house without intimating police about the protest. As Congressmen sat at the gate and started raising slogans, a drone was spotted flying over the protest site. Policemen, who had reached the site by then, swung into action and found a man operating the drone while standing at some distance from the protest site. He was immediately stopped and his drone and other devices were checked, but no recording was found. The man told police that he had come to cover the protest. He was let off after questioning. “We are verifying his credentials. No case has been registered,” said Ketan Bansal, superintendent of police (SP, City), Chandigarh. In view of security threats and the possibility of misuse of drones by anti-social elements, the UT administration had banned their use on September 15.

05-10-2021||Bangalore||Using bluetooth-enabled devices while driving may invite ₹1k fine in Bengaluru||The Bengaluru traffic police have decided to imposed fines of up to ₹1,000 on those using bluetooth-enabled devices for communication while riding or driving. As per the amended Motor Vehicles Act use of any mobile devices while driving has been brought under the ‘dangerous driving’ category and attracts a fine of up to ₹5,000 or up to one year jail or both. While police said that use of the mobile devices for navigation will be allowed, Bengaluru traffic police said that using headphones for navigation will be punishable. According to police, the first violation of rule will attract ₹500 fine, while the fine for the second violation will be ₹1,000. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said that the use of earphones to speak on the phone would lead to restrictions and the department is clear that it is a violation. “As per the Motor Vehicle Act, the use of gadgets that divert the attention during the operation of a vehicle is restricted. Whether it is mobile phones, headphones, bluetooth earphones or any other equipment, it violates this provision, so we have given clear instructions to fine those indulging such use of technology while commuting,” said Gowda. The officer also said that use of phone or earphone even at signals will attract fines. “Even using these devices while waiting at the signal would attract punishment. Even at the signal, people are on the road and the use of mobile devices is an offense. So, yes, those using mobile phones or bluetooth devices will attract fines,” said Gowda. Until August this year, Bengaluru traffic police has booked 86,565 people for using mobile phones while driving. The decision of the police, however, has invited criticism in the city. Several people took on to social media to express their displeasure. Rishi Bangera, a delivery agent with a food delivery app said that the earphones are helpful in getting directions. “The idea of having these headphones was to avoid using a phone while riding. We can get directions from the GPS app and get information from the customer as well. It saves a lot of time,” he said. Rohan Menezes, a city-based graphic designer said that traffic police are focusing on the wrong issues. “One of the biggest problems in the city has been parking on the footpath and recently, the speeding incidents. But the police are more interested in people wearing headphones. It is absurd,” he said. “We have heard passengers complaining about the new rule, but the fact is that whenever someone puts a headphone, they don’t hear any noise from around. With bluetooth headphones having technology that cuts all the noise around the person, it is possible that the person may not hear the honk or a vehicle coming towards it,” said a senior east division officer, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/using-bluetooth-enabled-devices-while-driving-may-invite-1k-fine-in-bengaluru-101633374251070.html

The protesters demanded that police must arrests the culprits by Wednesday or they will intensify their protest. Members of one of the groups that took part in the protest said that president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi, will arrive in the city to take part in the protests, if police action is delayed. Six days after the gruesome murder of Arbaz Mullah, police are yet to make an arrest in case. The decapitated body of Mullah was found on the railway tracks in Khanapur in the border district, about 505 kms from Bengaluru, on September 28. While police had initially registered a case of unnatural death, they later filed a murder case after a post-mortem report revealed injuries on the head. Laxman Nimbargi, superintendent of police, Belagavi district and Raghavendra Suhasaa Inspector General of Police (Northern Range) were not available for comments. Officials of the Belagavi rural police said that the investigation is underway. “The case was transferred from railway police to local police on Sunday itself. We are investigating the case,” said an official, who didn’t want to be named. In her complaint to the police, the mother of the deceased, Nazeema Mohammad Sheikh, alleged that her son, who was a car dealer, was killed by the family and relatives of a Hindu woman he was in a relationship with. Sheikh claimed the two families were aware of the relationship and also alleged the role of two members of a Hindu right-wing group in the murder. Based on her complaint, police booked three persons, including the girl’s father, for murder (section 302 of Indian Penal Code). “We knew about the relationship and I had spoken to the woman’s mother to ensure she doesn’t meet him. I also told my son not to meet her. I shifted from Khanapur to Azam Nagar in Belagavi with my son. But the two continued to meet, and we started getting threats from her family and relatives,” Sheikh said. A relative of the deceased alleged that the woman’s family roped in members of Sri Ram Sene who, on September 26, who reportedly threatened the man. “They called him to Khanapur where he took his phone and deleted the woman’s photos. They also demanded money from him for a settlement. He then sold his (Volkswagen) Polo car for ₹90,000 to pay them,” the relative said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/belagavi-hate-crime-protests-erupt-over-delay-in-arrests-101633374189764.html

The issue was brought up as a delegation of CBM met UT home secretary Nitin Kumar Yadav on Monday.CBM president Charanjiv Singh said no more vending zones should be established in city markets, especially in the first phase sectors, as they are already very congested. He added that commercial properties must be made from leasehold to freehold to increase trade.Chairman Satpal Gupta urged Yadav to rationalise collectorate rates in Sector 7, Madhya Marg, as it is more than the market price and Sector 17A and B, which is still under-developed as compared to plaza in main city Centre, Sector 17 C, D and E. General secretary Sanjeev Chadha said that Sector 17 should be kept as a no vendor zone and green belt opposite the GPO should be developed as an amusement park with eatable stalls, so that it is more attractive for tourists.General secretary Kamaljit Singh Panchhi asked that apart from the one seat already reserved for the president of CBM to represent traders in the administrator’s advisor council, one more seat must be given to the chairman.

The protesters alleged that the LIT had deliberately deputed a law officer, who is known to have given an incorrect legal opinion in the 2019 double plot allotment case, to defend the state government. The LIT wants to weaken the defence to benefit the petitioner, they alleged.“Earlier also, the chairman had tried to benefit the bidder by auctioning the land at a throwaway price,” they alleged.“We have also sought action against the officials as recommended by the local bodies department in the 2019 double plot allotment case. Some other advocate/law officer should be deputed to defend the case of cancellation of auction proceedings. Also, the state government should take action against LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam,” said Chopra.The protesters also served a legal notice to the LIT chairman and executive officer for not taking action against the guilty officials in the 2019 double allotment case, even after the local bodies department had directed them to lodge an FIR against them.Chopra said the local bodies department had also recommended that action as per the law should be taken against the advocate for giving incorrect legal opinion in that case.Meanwhile, Balasubramaniam termed the allegations levelled by BJP leaders baseless.“Baseless allegations are being levelled without any proof. The advocate was selected by the government as the petition has been principally filed against the state department. LIT is only a party. We had recommended three names to the state government and suggested that two advocates should be deputed. However, the government decided to depute only one advocate, and LIT had no say in that decision.”Earlier, in September, the local bodies department had cancelled the e-auction of 3.79 acres of land in Model Town Extension. BJP had called it a ‘scam’, stating that land worth around ₹350 crore was auctioned for around ₹98 crore.Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra had, however, stated that the auction was cancelled as there was a difference in the statement of deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and LIT chairman regarding fixation of reserve prices for the said land. An inquiry was marked in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/eauction-of-prime-site-at-model-town-extension-bjp-leaders-accuse-ludhiana-improvement-trust-of-favouring-petitioner-101633373949579.html
05-10-2021||Chandigarh||PU to consider increasing chances for employees to apply for jobs||Panjab University (PU) is considering increasing the number of chances in a calendar year for employees to apply for jobs outside the varsity. A special panel, which will meet this week, has been constituted to take up the matter along with other items on its agenda. The Panjab University Staff (non-teaching) Association (PUSA) had in 2019 requested the varsity to amend the existing rule, which allows employees to send only two applications for jobs outside the varsity in a calendar year. The PU calendar’s Volume 3 also states, “A member of the teaching staff, in case of his selection, shall not be relieved during the academic year. His/her request for grant of leave and retaining accommodation on the university campus will be considered in accordance with the normal rules and regulations of the varsity.” PUSA, in its representation, had said the chances must be increased so that employees have better future prospects. The matter was already placed before a committee in 2019, which at that time had recommended that four chances should be allowed to the confirmed university employee. The panel will also take up the matter of reducing eligibility for promotion to the post of stenographer at the varsity. As per the PU calendar, 50% of posts of stenographers are filled by promotion from among the stenotypists and those having completed 15 years service as a stenotypist. A committee in 2019 had unanimously recommended reducing the eligibility condition from 15 years to five years for promotion as stenographer, and the matter was placed before the PU syndicate which had deferred the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-to-consider-increasing-chances-for-employees-to-apply-for-jobs-101633373709366.html

The decision comes close on the heels of the central varsity starting offline classes for students of select semesters enrolled in postgraduate courses from October 1. “In view of the fact that the Covid-19 situation is under control at present and there is a concerted effort by the state government to bring maximum population under the cover of vaccination, AU has begun a phased reopening of its campus,” said public relation officer of AU, Jaya Kapur. The university authorities have decided to reopen the university for students of undergraduate classes from December 17, she added. However, AU administration has notified that it will be compulsory for the students to carry their vaccination certificate and I-cards for entering the campus.

05-10-2021||Chandigarh||E-cycles’ exclusion from export policies may cost industry ₹10,000 crore in 5 years: Hero Cycles||The exclusion of electric cycles from all major manufacturing and export promotion policies has dashed the Indian cycle industry’s hope to displace China as the world leader in e-cycle manufacturing, as they may lose orders approximately worth ₹10,000 crore over the next five years.  Hero Cycles chairman and managing director Pankaj Munjal on Monday said the government had snubbed e-cycle manufacturers from major export polices such as faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles in India, Phase II (FAME-II) and production-linked incentive (PLI), which will result in Indian companies losing export orders to the European Union, even as the bloc reduces its dependancy on China. “The EU levies a heavy anti-dumping tariff on e-bike imports from China that may go as high as 83%. It had initiated a re-shoring of e-bike production in 2019. The estimated re-shored e-bike production was 9,30,000 units with countries such as Portugal, Poland, France, Bulgaria, Italy and Romania grabbing more than 80%. With quality products at a competitive price, Indian manufacturers are poised to grab this opportunity to secure the migrating business. However, we are losing out on the policy side, which would have helped the industry to take advantage of the shrinking share of China and the far-East as suppliers of e-bikes to the EU,”Munjal said. Hero Cycles had started manufacturing electric bicycles three years ago. The company had invested around ₹300 crore on a state-of-the-art factory, ₹400 crore on establishing a vendor base and ₹300 crore in the UK for exporting the bikes to international markets. “The e-bike market in the EU is 50 times that of India. E-bike sales in Europe are expected to grow five times in the next decade. India has the second largest bicycle making capability in the world and lower import duty will help to increase exports to the UK. Besides, generalised systems of preferences benefits are given to many Indian products in the UK, but not to bicycles that attract an import duty of 14%. Therefore, to remain competitive globally, India must lock a deal to bring down import duties on bicycles,” added Munjal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ecycles-exclusion-from-export-policies-may-cost-industry-10-000-crore-in-5-years-hero-cycles-101633373291566.html

05-10-2021||Mumbai||Pothole repair on highway between Mumbai and Nashik to be done by Oct 25: NHAI to Bombay HC||The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) on Monday assured the Bombay high court that the work of repairing the Mumbai-Nashik expressway by filling up the potholes and doing the patchwork was in full progress and would be completed before October 25. The assurance by the Centre was made in response to HC’s query on the time required by the highway authority to improve the around 100-km stretch, which had become unfit for travelling, resulting in serpentine lines of vehicles having to move at a snail’s pace.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, after taking cognisance of news reports on September 24 regarding potholes on the Mumbai-Nashik highway – a part of the old Mumbai-Agra Highway – had asked the state and Centre to work in coordination to prevent loss of lives of commuters due to the poor condition of roads.According to HT’s September 23 report, “Commuters had to endure a nightmarish commute on both Tuesday and Wednesday as 15km-long serpentine queues of vehicles were witnessed on the Mumbai-Nashik Highway. The traffic snarls spilled over to Ghodbunder Road, Waghbil, Kalwa, Majiwada and other areas in Thane city.”During the hearing on Monday, additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh representing NHAI, informed HC that the repair work on the 24-km stretch between Thane and Vadape was in progress and three teams had been assigned to work on the stretch. He submitted that work on the same was expected to completed by Tuesday, unless there is heavy rainfall in the area.ASG Singh added that patchwork and pothole-filling work on the remaining stretch of the expressway between Vadape-Nashik, which was approximately 97km, was expected to be completed in around three weeks as seven teams had been assigned to do work there. He added that a stretch of around 5km was severely damaged, but work was expected to be completed by the next hearing provided the work was not interrupted by heavy rains.The court accepted the assurances and asked the Central and state authorities to give a status report on the patchwork by October 25 and adjourned the hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pothole-repair-on-highway-between-mumbai-and-nashik-to-be-done-by-oct-25-nhai-to-bombay-hc-101633372689630.html

05-10-2021||Delhi||Bulk of dengue cases in Delhi came in September||The total number of dengue cases reported in the Capital crossed the 300-mark on Monday as the weekly report released by the municipal corporations added 68 more cases, taking the total tally to 341 till October 2. Of the total, 217 cases were recorded in September, which is the highest number of cases seen in the month in the last three years. Dengue usually start increasing in July and August after monsoons, and peaks in mid-October. This year, however, the cases started increasing in August-end and September due to heavy showers that the city received in the last month of monsoon.“There was an increase in mosquito breeding after the heavy rainfall. The rains were later than usual this year; it was also very heavy with gaps in between, all of which favoured breeding,” according to an official from the south corporation. Hospitals have also seen an increase in the number of cases being reported. “Dengue has increased substantially, probably 50-70% over the last three weeks. We see one or two person admitted with dengue every day at our hospital,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max hospital-Saket. He said, “The good thing, however, is that most of the cases are mild and can be treated at home. Even in the few patients who were admitted, the symptoms resolved within two-three days. There were cases where the platelet count dipped, but there was no need for transfusion or ICU care. This leads me to believe that the milder serotype 1 is affecting the people in the city.” There are four serotypes of dengue virus – Type 1 and 3 are the milder serotypes while type 2 and 4 are associated with severe disease.Patients suffering from serotypes 1 and 3 have symptoms like fever, headache, body ache, and pain behind the eyes. Type 2 is associated with more severe disease leading to drop in platelet count, inability to form blood clots, and internal bleeding. Type 4 is associated with leaking of fluids from the capillaries leading to drop in blood pressure and circulatory shock (not enough blood reaching the organs). Dengue came into prominence amid a waning Covid-19 pandemic after it was identified as one of the diseases, along with scrub typhus and leptospirosis, which claimed at least 51 lives, mostly of children, in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. Doctor advises wearing full-sleeve clothes and using mosquito repellents when stepping out to protect one-self from the mosquito which bites people during the day. The aedes aegypti mosquito that spread the disease breeds in clean stagnant water. The Delhi government has started the “10 hafte, 10 baje, 10 minute” campaign to urge people to check their homes and nearby areas for mosquito breeding. The doctor also advises against the use of any pain medications as it may complicate the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bulk-of-dengue-cases-in-delhi-came-in-september-101633372571785.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Maha schools reopen: Banners, Covid norms welcome students at Matunga municipal school||On October 4 at 8 am, Pooja Singh, a Class 10 student of LK Waghji Mumbai Public School in Matunga (East) walked into her school 19 months after she last sat in a classroom.Pooja and her friends were greeted with colourful banners carrying educative slogans warning students to maintain social distancing and to keep their masks on. Staff members also conducted thermal screening before asking the students to enter in a single file. Chalk markings and stickers on the floor directed the students to their respective classrooms; markings on the benches instructed them to occupy alternate seats in a zig-zag manner.“I was a little worried about sending her to school, due to all the news about covid-19 cases. But for how long will students sit at home? I packed a sanitizer and I got her to wear a double mask. She is also old enough to be aware of the care she needs to take. I have another child in class 3. I am glad the government has not started primary school, because a younger child will not be able to take care of itself,” said Pooja’s mother, Sapna Singh (36) a home-maker. The teenager and her classmates were split up between separate classrooms as seating capacity was halved. Different teachers taught different subjects to the groups of students. Each class was livestreamed simultaneously for the students who didn’t attend school. Through it all, Pooja and her friends sat with their masks on -- there was no lunch break, and four hours later, they were free to go home. On Tuesday, the school will do the same drill, but with Class 9 students. In order to prepare for Monday, the municipal school appointed coordinators to oversee preparations and manage schedules of the teachers. Santosh Gawli, in-charge of classes 9 and 10 at the Matunga school said, “We have received a positive response from students and parents. We closely coordinated with all parents over the weekend and kept them updated about the preparations we were making for Monday morning. We have decided to conduct classes for 9 and 10 on alternate days to avoid crowding.” “At the end of the school day, only four students were allowed to exit the classrooms and the school at a time, to avoid crowding. I felt really happy to be back,” Pooja said. Shubhangi Kale, a student of class 9 said, “My classes start on Tuesday. All my classmates have been coordinating with each other about the safety measures we need to take once we are back in class. We have been asked to get textbooks only for three subjects: Marathi, Maths, and English, so they will be easy to sanitise once we are back home.” Municipal schools that reopened on Monday saw a mixed response: some schools seeing over 80% attendance while some seeing as low as 10% attendance on Day 1. At Pooja’s school, 22 out of 34 students enrolled in class 8 attended their classes, while 12 out of 33 students enrolled in class 10 attended school. On Tuesday, 29 out of 39 enrolled students have submitted consent letters from parents to attend schools.Over the next three days the BMC will conduct an online awareness programme for parents and students who have not yet submitted consent letters, or did not attend school on Monday. Parents still have the option of not sending their children to school, a senior civic officer from BMC’s education department said. As per the BMC circular issued last week announcing the reopening of schools for classes 8 to 12, parents’ consent is required for students to attend school, and attendance is not compulsory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-schools-reopen-banners-covid-norms-welcome-students-at-matunga-municipal-school-101633372389189.html
05-10-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Two constables held for taking bribe from truck driver||Two policemen were arrested on Saturday for allegedly beating up a truck driver andsnatching ₹400 from him on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The policemen, deployed on the expressway under the jurisdiction of Kasna police station, were identified as constables Tara Chand and Gyan Singh. The truck driver, Arvind Saini, is a resident of Sikar, Rajasthan. He said that he ferries cattle from Rajasthan to Meerut in a truck via the expressway. “On Saturday, I was on my way to Meerut in the truck when the two policemen stopped me near Sirsa toll plaza at 6.30am. It is an unwritten norm that they illegally seek money from truck drivers. So I gave them ₹400. However, they appeared unhappy and demanded ₹4,000 from me. When I expressed my inability to pay more, they grabbed me and started beating me,” he said. Saini said that he was beaten up so badly that he needed medical treatment. He also made a video of the injuries he sustained. He then informed his employer, who advised Saini to file a complaint. Saini then filed a complaint at Kasna police station against the two constables. Sudhir Kumar, station house officer, Kasna police station, said a case has been registered against the two policemen under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), Section 504 (intentional insult) and Section 7 of The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. “The matter is being investigated by Brijnanda Rai, assistant commissioner of police (3), Greater Noida,” he said. Rai said that the two constables were arrested. “They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody. Saini has alleged that he was extorted by the policemen. The matter is being probed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-two-constables-held-for-taking-bribe-from-truck-driver-101633372330247.html

The complainant, Harwinder Singh of Raikot, a salesperson at the liquor vend at Bassiyan Road, said he had locked the vend at 10pm on Sunday, but when he returned on Monday, he saw that the vend had been ransacked and the liquor had been stolen. The burglars had barged into the vend after cutting through the grills of the window, and had taken 50 cartons of liquor of different brands.Assistant sub-inspector Surjit Singh said a case had been registered under Section 457 ( house-trespass) and 380 (theft in dwelling ) house of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged against the accused. “The accused used a pickup truck to commit the crime. We are scanning CCTV footage to trace the accused,” the ASI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/burglars-strike-at-ludhiana-liquor-vend-make-off-with-50-cartons-101633372210278.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Limited attendance recorded as Mumbai schools reopen for classes 8-12||Banners, balloons and posters exhorting caution greeted Mumbai students as they set foot in their classrooms after a gap of nearly 19 months following a state government notification permitting students of classes 8 to 12 to return starting October 4.On September 29 the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) permitted city schools to reopen for the first time since they were closed mid-March to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Day 1, however, saw limited attendance in schools across all boards even as schools across the city greeted students with ‘Welcome Back’ posters, balloons and posters exhorting them to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.“Only 25% students from classes 9 and 10 batches came to school today and they were thrilled, as were we. Teachers as well as other non-teaching staff members have been waiting to hear the buzz of students in the school corridors and finally, online interactions were once again replaced with physical interactions in a classroom,” said Rupa Roy, principal of Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar.At Pant Nagar School No. 3 in Ghatkopar, a “Welcome Back” banner greeted students at the gate and balloons decorated the corridors of the school. However, out of 133 students enrolled in class 8, only 55 students had submitted consent letters from parents -- a condition put forward by the BMC for all city schools -- to attend class. Only 10 attended school on Monday.Over 20 municipal schools in Mumbai did not resume classes on Monday, as the vaccination or quarantine centres on their premises could not be moved, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said.As per a BMC circular issued last week announcing the reopening schools for classes 8 to 12, parents’ consent was mandatory for students to attend school; attendance was not compulsory; lunch breaks were not permitted and schools could only conduct classes for up to four hours. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced last week that after a 19-month break, physical lessons for classes 5 to 12 schools in rural parts of the state and classes 8 to 12 in urban areas would resume from Monday. The plan is to allow other classes to return to school in a phased manner, she said.Schools have followed an online mode of teaching for the past two academic sessions, even the Class 10 and 12 boards were scrapped this year due to rising Covid-19 cases following which students were assessed on the basis of their performance in the previous as well as current academic years.Many schools have chosen to retain both online and offline teaching modes, for the time being. Others chose to stagger the classes of students at different hours. At Balmohan Vidyamandir, two teachers were deputed to conduct the same lecture — one for those attending physical classes and another for those attending school online. “Merging the two seems difficult for the time being and we would like to wait until we are more comfortable with physical classes,” Roy said. At Pant Nagar school No. 3, which offers English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu medium for classes 9 and 10, the English medium school was open in the morning, in two batches from 8 am to 10 am, and 11 am to 1 pm, while the Marathi medium classes were held in two batches in the afternoon. Hindi medium classes were also held in the morning. “We cannot force parents to send their children to school. However, we have been interacting with all parents to create awareness about the safety measures we are taking up at school,” said Suman Singh, principal of Pant Nagar school. Some junior colleges also remained shut on Monday. “The government order has been very clear that classes can’t start without consent of parents. We still haven’t collected the consent forms and therefore, deferred the reopening day by a couple of days,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of K C College, Churchgate.Some non-state board schools are also busy with end-of-semester exams at present, and had no choice but to defer physical reopening of schools by a week or more. “Our schedule was set much in advance so we didn’t want to disturb the same due to the last minute decision of the state government. Once the online exams are over, we have decided to continue regular lectures online from 7am to 10am for all batches, and then invite interested students from batches 8, 9 and 10 to attend two hours of physical school for problem solving as well as practical sessions,” said Rohan Bhat, chairman, Children’s Academy group of schools.He added that if this schedule works well, post Diwali vacation, the school might reverse the system and conduct only physical classes for students from older batches while the problem-solving sessions will go online.The state’s decision to open schools has seen a bit of back and forth in the past owing to the conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state had asked schools to work towards re-opening physical classes in a phased manner on August 17 but had to roll back the decision following concerns put forward by the state task force, as well as of parents, students and school management boards over the potential spread of Sars-CoV-2. Similarly, the school education department announced the re-opening of schools for classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner last November. In January 2021, another circular directed students from classes 5 to 8 to be brought back to school in groups. Both these circulars, however, were revoked once Covid cases started rising again starting February and the state government called for another complete lockdown starting mid-April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/limited-attendance-recorded-as-mumbai-schools-reopen-for-classes-8-to-12-after-19-months-101633371911285.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Maha schools reopen: Malad school students, teachers share pandemic experiences||For 15-year-old Prisha Cholera, her first day back in school was not what she had expected. While she was impatience to enter the classroom and find a seat next to her best friend, the Class 10 student found herself feeling apprehensive. “The minute I entered the school, my first instinct was to wear a double mask and look for my sanitiser. Even when I saw my friend at the gate, we didn’t hug, as we usually would. Never before did we have such apprehensions,” said Prisha, a class 10 student of D G Khetan International School, Malad. Monday marked the first day back to school for students across batches 8 to 12 in the city. However, the management of S G Khetan decided to start the first day of physical school only for students of classes 10 and 12 with their end of semester exams. The day started at 8am as school staff stood at the gate to welcome students and remind everyone to maintain social distancing. “It was different to see students already following Covid-19 protocols and maintaining distance from each other. Even once students settled on their classrooms, teachers encouraged students to share their experiences and were very sad to hear about the experiences of some students. It’s sad to see what a pandemic has done to routine school life,” said Kavita Agarwal, the school’s director.Typically, nearly 800 students would walk in the gates of the school in two separate sessions, with parents dropping off their children on the first of day of school. On Monday, however, students entered the school premises in a single file and parents turned away from the gates. “We (principal and teachers) were all waiting to see excitement among students and parents, many of whom have been part of the institute for more than a decade. But I could barely recognise parents through their masks and students too showed barely any excitement. First day of school is supposed to be full of stories but that’s not what happened,” added Agarwal.Devansh Dhanuka (14) another class 10 student, knew exactly what he wanted to do the minute he entered the school premises. Sanitise hands, wear mask, say hello to teachers, drop bag in classroom and head straight to the stilt area (common play area) to meet up with his friends and catch up on football. “I was heartbroken when our staff informed us that only the classrooms on the ground floor and the auditorium where exams were on are open for students. Rest of the school premises remain off limits,” said Devansh. The stilt areas, routinely used by students between school hours to play football, basketball, kho-kho and kabbadi wore a barren look, though over 150 students were present on campus. “I’m already in class 10 and this could be the last year in school. My year will be incomplete without a few friendly games with my friends on the school campus,” added Devansh.The school management, for the time being, has decided to call only class 10 and 12 students and complete their exams over the next few days. Starting October 20, class 9 students too will be asked to attend physical classes while the rest will join post Diwali holidays. “We miss how lively our school gets with students around and we cannot wait for things to go back to normalcy. After all, a school without its daily hustle is just another building,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malad-school-students-teachers-share-pandemic-experiences-101633371671017.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Show cause notice to Ganga Ram hospital over free treatment to poor||The Delhi government’s ’directorate of health services has served a show cause notice to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Monday for violating norms related to providing free treatment to the poor, officials in the know of the matter said. Private hospitals in Delhi that received land from the government at a concessional rate are required to earmark 10% of their hospital beds and 25% of their out-patient clinic for providing free treatment to the poor.Karol Bagh MLA Vishesh Ravi wrote to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), informing them that the hospital was not admitting deserving poor patients despite 95% of the 68 beds earmarked for such patients lying vacant.The MLA said the hospital created multiple hurdles for the EWS (economically weaker section) patients and merged patients from the hospital’s charitable trust into the EWS category to deny admission and treatment to deserving poor patients. He also said the government-appointed liaison official at the hospital was not given any powers to implement the EWS norms.“The beds are available at the hospital and the nodal officer is the one responsible for allocating them. Of course, there were some disruptions during Covid-19 -- we gave the beds to anyone who came, irrespective of whether they belonged to the EWS category or not. Any EWS patient with Covid-19 was provided free treatment as per the mandate, but there was a decline in the number of EWS patients who came to us during that time,” said Dr DS Rana, chairperson of the board of management, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The notice was served for violations of Delhi Nursing Home rules, which govern space, staffing and other facilities at all registered hospitals and nursing homes in the national capital. Most of the hospitals in the city, including Sir Ganga Ram, are currently in the process of renewing their licences, as all licence renewals were suspended during the pandemic and all hospitals being allowed to operate on their existing licences.“The directions of the high court are very clear. If a hospital does not follow the EWS norms, then the management of such a hospital can be taken over by the government. The land granted at concessional rates can also be taken over, or the hospital can be held in contempt of court,” said advocate Ashok Agarwal, who has been working to ensure that EWS norms are followed by Delhi hospitals. He is also part of the high-court appointed monitoring committee on this subject.He said, “Until two or three years ago, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital had an excellent track record when it came to treating EWS patients. We could refer patients to them at any hour and they would arrange a bed, sometimes even going beyond the mandated 68 beds. Then, things took a turn -- the hospital started treating patients admitted to their economy wards there. They started taking a long time to verify a patient’s EWS status, sending the patient from one doctor to another, and taking a long time to complete the documentation .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhishow-cause-notice-to-ganga-ram-hospital-over-free-treatment-to-poor-101633371070486.html
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Maha schools reopen: Thane students excited to head to school after 19 months||Best friends Vaishnavi Kamat and Dhanvi Sakharkar from Shreerang Vidyalaya and Junior College in Thane were excited to head to school on Monday morning. Both 15-year-olds were meeting each other after almost 19 months. Just as they were about to greet each other with a warm hug outside the school gates, parents and school staff were quick to remind the girls about the social distancing rules. Around 62 students of Shreerang Vidyalaya’s class 10 came to school with their parents’ consent forms in hand. Students formed a queue, as staff checked their temperature at the entrance. Posters in the school’s common areas reminded students to maintain distance. Inside each classroom, students were asked to sit on alternate seats. Teachers wore masks and gloves and the day started with a set of instructions issued to the students regarding Covid protocols. “I was most excited to meet my friends and teachers whom we have been interacting only through online sessions since the past year and a half. Although school means more discipline if compared to offline classes, we missed attending physical classes all this while,” Dhanvi said. The school had adopted a hybrid teaching method, wherein the students who did not visit physical classes could attend online. “An additional teacher was present in every classroom to stream the physical session on the online platform and monitor the students in the online class at the same time. We did not want to make it hectic for teachers as they would otherwise have to take the same session twice,” said Chandrika Nair, the headmistress at Shreerang Vidyalaya and Junior College. The school only called class 10 students on Monday. It will conduct classes for classes 10 and 12 on alternate days. The school also plans to resume physical classes for class 8 students eventually, after receiving consent from parents. The school and the junior college have a strength of 133 and 55 students respectively. Only 62 and 35 students respectively came on Monday. “We were a tad nervous as they were going out on their own after a long period, however the precautions mentioned within the school premises was an assurance that our students will be safe,” said Varsha Kamat, parent to a 15-year-old. Saleha Shaikh, a class 10 student, said, “We were relieved to not have an online sessions today. It was easier to understand the Math class and I could clear my doubts immediately. It was easier to take notes during the class as well.” Students attended three hours of school on the first day. “We have asked both students and parents to ensure that the children reach home immediately after school and should not be found loitering anywhere outside,” said Pramod Sawant, Trustee, Shreerang vidyalaya and junior college. Every evening the school premises will be sanitized completely and kept prepared for classes on the next day, said the school staff. Saraswati secondary school welcomed students with shower of flowers and all teachers and staff were given a rose each as part of their welcome. Along with students and parents, officials from Thane were also excited for school to reopen. Thane Mayor, Naresh Mhaske, visited his alma mater, Saraswati secondary School, Thane on Monday morning. “As a student I always wanted to ring the school bell, today I got an opportunity to ring the morning bell in school and start classes,” said Mhaske. In the rural areas of Thane district, classes for grade 5 to 8 began today, from mid-July classes had resumed in rural areas gradually and 88 schools were functioning. From among 1131 school within rural areas of Thane district, 963 reopened on Monday, from among 1.46 lakh students around 79,130 students attended school for class 5 to 12 in the rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-students-excited-to-head-to-school-after-19-months-101633371069003.html
05-10-2021||Noida||Noida authority files FIR against 32 in Supertech twin towers case||The Noida authority filed an FIR on Monday against 26 former and current officials of the Noida authority, four Supertech Limited directors, and two architects for their involvement in violating building regulations and giving map approval to Supertech’s twin towers in Sector 93A. Of the Noida authority officials named in the case, 20 have retired, two are dead and four are still serving.The move comes a day after an Uttar Pradesh government-constituted special investigation team (SIT) submitted its report to the state for further action in the case.On August 31, a Supreme Court bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud directed the demolition of the twin towers part of Supertech’s Emerald Court project, over grave violations of building norms, which, the court said, was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the real estate developer. Further, the bench asked Supertech to refund money to all the existing home-buyers in Emerald Court’s Apex and Ceyane towers within two months, along with an interest of 12% per annum from the date of their deposits.Noida authority town planner Vaibhav Gupta filed the FIR with the vigilance department in Lucknow against everyone found involved in the case. For the first time, two former chief executive officers of the authority have been named in such an FIR.“We have filed an FIR against everyone named in the SIT report. Now, further action will be initiated by the vigilance department,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Meanwhile, Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain an application of Supertech Group requesting a modification in its August 31 demolition order. The company had asked the court to allow it to only partially demolish 224 flats of one tower, along with its community area on the ground floor, to conform with the building norms. However, the Supreme Court rejected the application.The spokesperson of Supertech was unavailable to comment on the issue.However, according to Noida authority officials in the know, Supertech could file a review plea.“We have asked the CBRI, which is an expert agency in demolition and construction matters, to plan the demolition. We are likely to meet with them to discuss this on Tuesday,” said Maheshwari.The SIT said in its report that Supertech encroached a “green belt” which was part of the layout plan, measuring 7,000 square metres as “land plots”, for which a departmental inquiry against Noida authority officials is already in progress.“We will start fencing of this green belt at the earliest. And we have formed a committee that will probe and act against those involved in grabbing the green belt space,” said Maheshwari.Vimla Singh, one of the 26 authority employees named in the FIR, was suspended, but she reported to work on Monday, left the office in the afternoon, and could not be reached for comment. Rituraj Vyas, a Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority employee, has also been suspended as he did not carry out his duties as an assistant town planner in 2009 when the construction took place. Vyas was unavailable for comment as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-files-fir-against-32-in-supertech-twin-towers-case-101633370951656.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||South Delhi body writes to PWD, wants cooperation in installing EV charging hubs||South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) officials on Monday wrote to Delhi government’s Public Works Department to facilitate installation of electric vehicles charging stations on roads maintained by the agency after the latter removed equipment from two locations in Bhikaji Cama place and Lajpat Nagar on Sunday, officials aware of the matter said.A senior SDMC official overseeing the project said the installation process has been suspended for now. He added that the public sector undertaking Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL), which has been tasked with installing 35 e-charging stations, has reported that it is facing resistance from PWD in carrying out the work.“Charging stations have been removed at two locations and equipment from Lajpat Nagar has been confiscated. It is a loss of public money. The local PWD officials said that the road comes under their jurisdiction. Inter-departmental co-ordination will be necessary to make the electric vehicle policy successful,” the official said.The PWD officials, however, said that the stations were removed since the contractor did not take prior permission for the work.The remunerative project cell of the south corporation wrote the PWD on Monday for intervention to facilitate the installation work. Civic officials also argued that the roads wider than 60 feet were only transferred to the PWD for maintenance purposes, and the actual ownership of land still lies with the three municipal corporations.SDMC is installing e-charging stations at 109 locations of which installation work for two-wheeler specific modules will be carried out at 35 locations by TCIL, official said. “41 charging stations will be installed by EESL, 6 sites by BSES power discom, and 17 sites will be covered by another PSU,” the official said.A senior PWD official said the charging station Bhikhaji Cama was removed since no prior information was provided to the agency about the work. “It was not considered an encroachment, but the contractor appointed by the south corporation did not prior permission. We are now in touch with the civic body and details about all the locations will be submitted to us. All the locations will be considered on case-to-case basis so that the installation does become obstructions on the roads,” the PWD official said asking not to be named.The Delhi Electric Vehicles policy, announced in August last year by the Delhi government, envisages that 25% of all new vehicle registrations should be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-writes-to-pwd-seeks-cooperation-in-installing-ev-charging-stations-101633370949104.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board says petition over accounts audit is ‘politically motivated’||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Monday told the Delhi high court that BJP leader Harish Khurana’s petition alleging that its accounts have not been audited in the six years was “politically motivated” and “without any research”.Khurana sought directions to the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts of DJB, and alleged that the accounts have not been audited for the last six years. He also demanded proper accounts, other relevant records and sought preparation of an annual statement of the profit and loss with balance sheets from 2015 onwards as prescribed under the law.Opposing the plea, the DJB, in an affidavit, informed a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said that the allegations are false, frivolous and vexatious.It said that the water utility is making every effort to ensure that all final statements and balance sheets are duly prepared and audited in the interest of transparency and compliance with the law.DJB said that all its accounts are being maintained presently on a double-entry system of book-keeping and all accounts are regularly maintained in accordance with the provisions of the Delhi Water Board Act, and other relevant laws.It added that it would be incorrect to state that no accounts were maintained or no audits were conducted in the past six years, adding that the petition was filed with oblique motives and was not maintainable and liable to be dismissed with costs.The CAG said that it made “several correspondences” for seeking accounts for audit from DJB and the Delhi government but as accounts were not made available for audit, the audit could not be accomplished.The petition has said that in response to the RTIs of May 11, May 24, and July 22 this year, it has been clearly stated that the copy of the balance sheet for the year 2015-16 and onward is under preparation.The plea said since the authorities have failed to perform the functions laid down under the law, the petitioner was approaching the court with the petition.“It is mandatory to maintain financial accounts and conduct an annual audit of the accounts, in order to ascertain effective functioning of the state and local bodies. Maintaining financial accounts and conducting an annual audit of the accounts, help to secure accountability, transparency of the state and local bodies functioning towards the general public,” the plea said.The court posted the matter for further hearing on November 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-says-petition-over-accounts-audit-is-politically-motivated-101633370829018.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||HC tells Supertech to give buyer ₹40 lakh to repay loan||The Delhi high court on Monday directed real estate developer Supertech to give an additional ₹40 lakh by October 31, to a home buyer for repayment of loan. On September 20, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) ordered Supertech to pay ₹1.79 crore to the same homebuyer while also issuing an arrest warrant against the firm’s managing director (MD) Mohit Arora. In its order, the NCDRC said its order shall come into effect after seven days if the builder fails to deposit around ₹1.79 crore by then.The NCDRC order came on a petition by Brigadier (retd) Kanwal Batra and his daughter Aakriti Batra, who jointly purchased a villa in Supertech’s Upcountry project, offered by the builder in December 2013 at a cost of approximately ₹1.03 crore, which the builder promised to deliver in August 2014.Supertech challenged the NCDRC order in the high court, arguing that the commission acted out of its jurisdiction and also did not give the company a chance to present its case.On Monday, Justice Amit Bansal said ₹40 lakh will be utilised by the petitioner, Brigadier Kanwal Batra (retired), for repayment of the loan. The court asked the company to give a payment plan on the next date of hearing while also recording the statement of Supertech’s counsel that a further sum of ₹17 lakh would be paid by November.The high court also extended its stay order on Supertech MD Mohit Arora’s arrest till November 11.During the last hearing on September 24, the high court stayed Arora’s arrest, after Supertech agreed to give ₹50 lakh to Batra.On Monday, initially, Supertech’s advocate Vikas Sethi submitted that the company proposes to pay the whole amount in monthly instalments of ₹10. The court, however, said the amount has to be substantial.Advocate Shailesh Madiyal, representing Batra, said the firm shall pay at least the principal amount in the near future so that he can repay the loan and get some money for his daughter’s marriage.To this, the court said, “You must be reading newspapers that how difficult it is nowadays in these matters. He (Batra) should be grateful for whatever he is getting now. Rather than seeing the glass half empty, see it as half full. The bottom line is that you get back your money.”The matter will now be heard on November 11.A Supertech spokesperson refused to comment on the matter, saying the court is seized of the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hctells-supertech-to-give-buyer-40-lakh-to-repay-loan-extends-stay-on-md-s-arrest-101633370710396.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Supreme Court dismisses Supertech plea to avoid demolition of 2 towers in Noida||The Supreme Court on Monday turned down an ambitious plan by real estate major Supertech to save one of its 40-storey residential towers in its Emerald Court project in Noida that was ordered to be demolished for flouting laws and fire safety norms.An application filed by the realty firm for modifying the top court’s August 31 order directing demolition of the two towers – Apex and Ceyane – was dismissed as the court was of the view that the application seeking clarification/modification was “in the guise of a review” and the only remedy for Supertech was to file a review petition.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said, “In essence what the applicant seeks is that the direction for demolition of towers T-16 and T-17 be substituted by retention of T-16 and slicing of T-17. The grant of such relief is in the nature of review. In successive decisions, this court has held that filing of applications styled as miscellaneous applications or application for clarification in the guise of review and cannot be countenanced.”Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for Supertech, said, “I am not seeking review but have come out with an alternate proposal to meet with the distance and green area criteria. It may be considered by the court after the same meets the approval of the concerned authorities.”As per the plan, the company proposed to partially demolish 224 apartments in tower T-17 along with the community area at the ground floor without touching tower T-16. By doing so, the minimum distance between T-1 and T-17 will be 16 metres as per the requirement under the National Building Code 2005. On the land cleared by demolishing the portion of T-17, the company promised to provide a landscape green area. The flat owners who have opted to keep their apartments could be allotted apartments in the remaining portion of T-17, the firm said.The application filed by Supertech said that the modification will not only comply with the Building Regulations but also satisfy the fire safety norms -- the grounds formed by the court to order the demolition of the twin buildings.Earlier, the Allahabad high court too had directed the demolition of the two towers in 2014, against which Supertech had approached the top court.Representing the home buyers, senior advocate Jayant Bhushan said, “What they are seeking is in the nature of review. The top court had held on August 31 that the common garden area in front of T-1 was eliminated by the construction of T-16 and T-17. This was done in violation of the Uttar Pradesh Apartments Act 2010 which requires the consent of the flat owners before modifying the project plan promised to them.”He further stated that each homebuyer has an undivided stake in the project that was recognised by the Supreme Court decision and any addition to it by permitting more flats will be impermissible under the Court order.The company stated in its application, “The construction of the said towers has consumed steel and cement in huge quantities apart from various other materials including human labour amounting to several crores of rupees which shall be rendered to complete waste in the form of scrap.”The court reiterated, “The attempt made by the application is clearly to seek substantial modification of this court’s order. Such an attempt is not permissible in a miscellaneous application to bypass review procedure. There is no substance in the application and the same is accordingly dismissed.”The construction of the two towers situated at Noida’s Emerald Court project belonging to Supertech was challenged by the residents before Allahabad high court earlier. The HC order directing demolition got a stamp of approval from Supreme Court, which said, “The illegal construction of T-16 and T-17 has been achieved through acts of collusion between the officers of NOIDA and the appellant (Supertech) and its management.”The court had ordered the company to refund the money to people who purchased flats in Apex and Ceyane towers within two months, along with 12 per cent per annum interest from the date of their deposits.The two towers facing demolition have 915 flats of which 633 were booked. Of them, only 252 flat buyers still remain as 133 homebuyers have re-invested in other Supertech projects while 248 have taken a refund.Following the SC order, the UP government has ordered a probe by a special investigation team (SIT), to probe the unholy nexus between the builder and bureaucrats that led to the two buildings being approved in violaton of existing norms. Based on the enquiry report, the SIT has recommended for filing a criminal case against Noida Authority officials and persons associated with Suptertech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-dismisses-supertech-plea-to-avoid-demolition-of-2-towers-in-noida-101633370529015.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||CAA protests: Sharjeel Imam says his prosecution is ‘whip of monarch’||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam on Monday told a city court that his prosecution for alleged inflammatory speeches made during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens is the “whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law”. Advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir informed additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, during a hearing on Imam’s bail application, that his client’s criticism of the government cannot be the cause of sedition. “He is not a terrorist or associated with some terrorist outfit. He has no criminal antecedents, he does not have any political agenda,” he told the court.“This prosecution of Sharjeel Imam is more of a whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law. This is not how the government or executive has to respond. At the end of the day, a dispensation will change. Nothing is permanent,” he said.Imam was booked for his allegedly provocative speeches given during protests against the CAA and the NRC, wherein he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and other northeastern states from the rest of the country.The alleged inflammatory speeches for which Imam was arrested were made in Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and in Aligarh Muslim University on January 16, 2020. He has been in judicial custody since January 28, 2020.Citing the example of a recent Bharat Bandh called by farmers against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws, Mir, asked whether those protesters could also be booked for sedition.“Will we call for sedition in all those cases? Asking for rail roko, blocking of roads, etc, is that a constitutional means of protest or not?”Mir said it is the duty of every citizen to be critical of the government and added, “It is only the monarchs, kings who need the affection of people. We are not here to bow down before the government.”The lawyer said that there were many prosecutions against Imam just because he had criticised the government’s policies.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad said the fundamental right to protest cannot cause problems to the public at large. He told the court that violent riots took place pursuant to Imam’s speech. “He tried to create anarchy by saying that there is no hope left for the Muslim community and that there is no other way left,” Prasad said, opposing his bail and discharge in the case. Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.In a charge sheet, the Delhi Police has alleged that Imam gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the central government and instigated the people which led to the violent protests outside Jamia Millia Islamia in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/caa-protests-sharjeel-imam-says-his-prosecution-is-whip-of-monarch-101633368909096.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||Prepared to implement Delhi govt’s winter action plan, say agencies||The three municipal corporations and the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday said they were committed to take all necessary steps to ensure that the 10-point anti-pollution Winter Action Plan unveiled by the Delhi government is fully implemented.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday released the city’s winter action plan, which will be a guiding document to manage the pollution levels in the Capital this winter. Kejriwal set a 10-point agenda, which details tasks to be performed by various agencies, to control pollution at source.Delhi government officials said that while it is a state-level action plan, and the Delhi state pollution control board along with other agencies will continue to act simultaneously on the emergency measures laid down under the SC-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).Every winter, Delhi experiences a huge spike in air pollution due to a combination of several local, external and meteorological factors such as crop stubble burning in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, burning of garbage, road dust and low temperatures and poor wind speed trapping pollutants in the air closer to the ground.In fact, in the run-up to the formulation of the action plan, the Delhi government had asked all agencies, including the PWD, the civic bodies, the traffic police and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to come up with their own plans to ensure that air pollution could be prevented from slipping into emergency levels.On Monday, several senior functionaries in the three municipal corporations of Delhi stated that most of the pollution countermeasures mentioned in the Delhi government’s winter action plan are already covered under the Supreme Court-mandated Grap, and the municipal bodies will replicate the measures taken last year with a few modifications.Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor, said a “three-pronged strategy” will be undertaken in the form of using water sprinkler tankers, pressing 10 mechanical road sweepers in service for controlling dust on roads and deploying enforcement teams for checking waste burning in trans-Yamuna areas.“Most of the measures in the action plan were already being undertaken last year under Grap. Even if some additional steps have been directed which are for public welfare, we are committed to execute them,” a senior EDMC official said.Road dust is one of the major contributors to the particulate pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) in Delhi -- the primary pollutants in Delhi’s air.Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India, appreciated the efforts by the Delhi government and added that air pollution crisis should not be seen as just seasonal and the action plan must provide long-term solutions, PTI reported.“It’s good to see the Delhi government preparing for the winter’s air pollution crisis but it should also adopt a holistic and long-term solution to improve the air quality. The plan needs to address the consistent major contributors like emissions from vehicular, power, industry, waste and other sectors which exist throughout the year,” he said.A senior civic official said changes in operation of mechanical road sweeping machines, which have been ordered under the state action plan for the season, will be undertaken as per the audit carried out by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Among other changes, the audit recommended that each mechanical sweeper should cover 80-100 kms by working in double shifts. The three corporations and New Delhi Municipal Council together operate 59 road sweepers. The north DMC has also decided to set up a separate dust control and management cell headed by the engineer-in-chief.Besides these 59 mechanical sweepers, additional 10 such machines will also be operated by the Public Works Department (PWD) on all arterial roads.Municipal officials said that the civic bodies will together deploy 102 teams for 24x7 monitoring of waste burning cases. Fines for waste burning related violations are one of the ten actions mentioned in the government’s winter action plan.“In the past, we have noticed that the levels of recovery of these NGT-mandated waste burning fines have been low. We will be working with sub-divisional magistrates to issue FIRs in major cases of non-payment of challans. The teams will also be working on a 24-hour basis instead of just carrying out night patrolling,” a senior north DMC official said.He added that the project to set up e-waste parks, where electronic waste will be safely dismantled and recycled, is already being monitored by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.Inderjeet Sehrawat, the leader of the house in South Delhi Municipal Corporation, said the steps being taken for controlling pollution during winter will be replicated from last year. “We will try to improve the efficiency of the measures stated in Grap,” he added. The south body operates the largest fleet of 24 mechanical road sweepers among the local bodies.The Delhi traffic police said they are already working towards decongesting the list of 64 stretches that they have submitted to the government. Traffic jams amplify pollution due to vehicular exhaust in particular areas.“These 64 stretches are among the 120 roads which witness consistent traffic snarls in the city, and need to be decongested. We have in the past worked with governments and other agencies, and we will be taking steps to manage the traffic in these areas,” a senior traffic official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/prepared-to-implement-delhi-govt-s-winter-action-plan-say-agencies-101633367108906.html
05-10-2021||Pune||Lukewarm response to reopening of junior colleges in Pune||There was a lukewarm response to the reopening of junior colleges on Monday in Pune city.Prominent colleges like SP College, Modern College, Shivajinagar, BMCC College and others didn’t start offline lectures for students.Along with all the Covid protocols, junior college administration must take permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) committee who will check the preparations done by the colleges.“Our preparations for starting offline classes are going on well. We have vaccinated our staff and all the classrooms are sanitised daily. Also, to maintain the social distancing of students in the college, we have made arrangements of the benches accordingly. In each division, only 50 per cent of students will be called on a day and the rest will study in online mode. We will start the offline classes within the next four to five days,” said Savita Datar, principal of SP College, Pune.“We are preparing to start offline lectures at our junior college in a phase-wise manner and all the necessary arrangements of social distancing and Covid protocols are in place. As of now Class 11 admission process is still in process, also we are conducting online lectures for both Class 11 and 12,” said Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar.Similarly, Ferguson College also didn’t start Class 11 and 12 offline lectures, Ravindra Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said, “We are taking extra precautions about arrangements to start offline lectures for the junior college. Also, the consent from parents to send their children to college is important, as without consent students won’t be allowed to attend the classroom lectures.”Namrata Badami, a Class 11 student, said, “I am excited to return to the college campus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lukewarm-response-to-reopening-of-junior-colleges-in-pune-101633366629189.html
05-10-2021||Chandigarh||New posters in Ludhiana underscore change of guard in Punjab government||In the run up to the assembly polls, the familiar face of former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has been replaced by that of his successor Charanjit Singh Channi to reflect the change of guard at the state level. Flex boards have been installed at around 150 unipoles and other advertisement sites in the city over the last few days. Apart from familiarising the people to the new chief minister, the boards also advertise the Cabinet’s recent decisions such as waiving off pending arrears of power bills. In a bid to woo the farming sector, the government has extended support to their demand to repeal the farm laws and have published details of a loan waiver for farmers. The hoardings have been installed at different locations such as Mall Road, Ferozepur Road, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Haibowal, Jagraon Bridge, Gill Road, BRS Nagar, and Rajguru Nagar. Hoardings featuring Captain Amarinder Singh had been removed from the Unipoles on September 20 amid political turmoil in Congress. Former Congress district president Ashwani Sharma said the posters had been changed as MLA Channi was the incumbent CM. “Every ruling party promotes the work done by the government and the Congress, which has taken historic decisions recently, is raising awareness among the public.” An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the MC had allotted the contract for outdoor advertisement to a private company in the city and the state government had directly approached the contractor for placing flex boards and payment was also being made directly. “The MC receives monthly instalments from the contractor and the civic body has nothing to do with the flex boards promoting government schemes and decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-posters-underscore-change-of-guard-in-state-govt-101633364107766.html

Out of the 395 confirmed dengue cases, Dhole Patil road ard reported 71 confirmed cases and Hadapsar-Mumdhwa ward reported 57 cases.Dhole Patil road and Hadapsar-Mundhwa wards have always reported the highest count of malaria borne ailments and DP road was one of the first wards to also report the surge in Covid-19 cases in April-May 2020.The surge of dengue cases in the city has become a new worry for the administration as the number of serious complications in dengue cases is rising. City hospitals are witnessing a surge in dengue cases since September when the highest number of dengue cases were reported. Out of the 392 confirmed dengue cases reported, 192 were reported in September alone, as per the PMC data.The ward with the least number of confirmed dengue cases is Wanawadi-Ramtekdi and Kondhwa-Yewalewadi which also house a lot of the populations living in slums or congested pockets but has only 6 confirmed cases in each of the wards.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health officer, said, “Dhole Patil road is one of the most congested areas and has a lot of slum pockets and so the number of cases is likely to be higher here. This was also one of the reasons why Covid-19 spread faster and earlier in this ward than any other wards back during the initial months of the pandemic.”“On the other hand, Hadapsar-Mundhwa is the largest ward not only area-wise but also population wise and so in proportion, the ward has the highest numbers. Also, the ward is located on the border of the city and has major hospitals and so people who live in nearby areas also get registered in the city records,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dhole-patil-road-hadapsar-mundhwa-wards-account-for-32-of-dengue-cases-in-pune-101633359668410.html

Because the order was amended by the PMC, many schools reopened on Monday,” said Gaikwad.He added that teachers, students and parents were elated to be back to school.“All schools followed the Covid protocols and used temperature checks, compulsory wearing of masks and hand hygiene was followed. Only 50 per cent attendance was made mandatory in each class to ensure social distancing,” said Gaikwad.He added that teachers and non-teaching staff are taking all necessary precautions to ensure that students are safe.“There has been a lot of learning loss of students and we want to continue teaching offline. And so each member of every school is taking all necessary precautions to ensure safety,” said Gaikwad.However, some schools will gradually open this week.Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, also shared that their school will reopen from October 5.“We shall reopen on Tuesday. Our first agenda will be to accustom students to offline classrooms. From next week, we are starting the revision of important topics from the last academic year. And after the holidays, we will start afresh with this academic year syllabus,” said Sinnarkar.Jayshree Venkatraman, principal, SNBP international school, Rahatani, said that school will start next week.“Unit tests are ongoing in the school right now. And so we have decided to reopen offline classes from next week,” said Venkatraman.Dnyaneshwar Molak, PMC joint municipal commissioner, said that teaching and non-teaching staff with symptoms of Covid will have to get tested.“Otherwise, school staff members with both vaccination doses, may not undergo an RT-PCR test. As of Monday, there are 84 primary schools with Class 8 and above and 40 higher secondary schools with the PMC. Many of them have started classes from Monday,” said Molak.“About 120 PMC schools reopened. For Class 8, 14 per cent attendance and for secondary school, there was 19 per cent attendance on Monday,” said Molak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-withdraws-mandatory-covid-rt-pcr-test-for-staff-as-schools-reopen-amid-enthusiasm-101633358348419.html
05-10-2021||Delhi||SDMC to launch parking application, give real-time info on slot availability||South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will soon launch its new parking application which is expected to encourage digital payments and facilitate access to information regarding parking slots availability.A senior official overseeing the project stated that the beta version of the mobile app is being tested, and it may be launched this week during the Navratras. “We will link all the 153 parking facilities being operated by the municipal corporation with this application and the geo-tagging of the parking slots is being carried out. Users will be able to see in real-time the availability of parking slots. Since the parking time and charges will be calculated digitally, we will be able to weed out any possibility of malpractices,” the official said.Of the five local bodies in Delhi, only New Delhi Municipal Council currently operates a parking management application. The south corporation operates 145 surface parking sites and 8 multilevel parking sites --6 underground multilevel parking sites and 2 tower parking systems.The SDMC official said they were currently managing around 25,000 parking slots across 104 municipal wards. “We will discourage use of paper slips and they will be provided only in cases where users demand it. In the second phase, there is also a proposal to link the mobile application with Delhi Traffic Police and Vahan digital database of vehicles managed by the ministry of road transports and highways. The application will enable us to issue challans to vehicles parked in no-parking zones,” the official explained.The New Delhi Municipal Council uses a sensor-based system to assess the parking slot availability, the south body is going to use geo-tagging-based system. “The sensor-based system to check the availability of each slot would have been too expensive. In our system, we will enable users to link the mobile phones with the registered vehicles. The new system will benefit both users and the civic body as we will be able to plug any revenue loss at the contractor level with more transparency,” the official stated.On September 30, the civic body operationalised its first RFID-based parking lot in Dwarka Sector-14 with the help of NHAI.Official said that these two IT based projects will help the corporation in getting better understanding of parking demand-supply and patterns of usage at particular locations.Inderjeet Sehrawat, leader of the house in SDMC, said the new application will benefit the users in terms of more transparency and access to real time parking availability. “NDMC is already using similar system which will be made available online in the south corporation’s parking lots,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmcto-launch-parking-application-give-real-time-info-on-slot-availability-101633358228234.html

During these ten days, only essential services will be allowed to operate.As per the state health department on October 3, 436 Covid patients were found in Ahmednagar district and there were 5,173 active cases in the district.Rajendra Bhosale collector of Ahmednagar mentioned in the order that the positivity rate in the district was above five per cent and hence it was essential to contain the spread of the infection.Rajendra Kshirsagar, CEO, Zilla Parishad Ahmednagar, said, “The lack of Covid appropriate behaviour could be the reason behind rise in cases. We are aiming to vaccinate all of its eligible population in these ten days at least with one dose. We have already stopped the home isolation. Institutional quarantine is mandatory for the covid patient.”The convening Covid situation had come up in the weekly Covid review meeting of Pune district, as it was observed that at least 40 per cent of Covid patients in the Sassoon hospital are from Ahmednagar district.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that it was essential to contain the Covid surge in the district before it impacts the neighbouring districts such as Pune and Nashik.“The situation is serious in the tehsils such as Sangamner and Parner. Pune district shares boundaries with Parner and Nashik district with Sangamner. These are big cities. If the situation is not controlled then we would have to pay a heavy price,” said Pawar while speaking in Satara.“When we noticed that 40 per cent of Covid patients in Sassoon hospital were from Ahmednagar, we decided to impose restrictions until the situation comes under control,” said Pawar.Out of the 61 villages where restrictions are imposed, 24 are in Sangamner tehsil, nine in Shrigonda, six in Parner and seven are in Rahata. Others belong to Akole, Karjat, Kopargaon, Nevasa, Pathardi, Shevgaon and Shrirampur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdownlike-curbs-imposed-in-61-villages-in-ahmednagar-as-covid-cases-surge-101633354507877.html

The 2,189-square meter plot is located on survey number 46/1.The plot is reserved for amenity space which will be used for a multi-speciality hospital.The city improvement committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given a nod for the proposal to use amenity space plots for healthcare purposes.Local corporator Shewta Khose-Galande has submitted the proposal.She said, “The plot is surrounded by many working-class and economically weaker section of society who take advantage of PMC-run hospitals. But as there is no civic body run hospital nearby, they have to travel for long distances to take treatment. If PMC approves the multi-purpose hospital, it would benefit the citizens.”As Covid-19 has exposed the sorry state of civic healthcare infrastructure, there are chances that the standing and general body would give a nod for the proposal.

05-10-2021||World||Russia presses bid for WHO approval for Sputnik V vaccine||The World Health Organization is still reviewing data about Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine as part of hopes that it can be approved by the UN health agency for emergency use against coronavirus, but said Tuesday that no decision is imminent.The clarification comes after Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko in recent days said that administrative issues were among the main holdups in WHO's decision-making process about whether to grant an emergency use listing to Sputnik V, as it has for a half-dozen other vaccines.Such approval would be a show of international confidence in the vaccine after a rigorous review process, and could pave the way for its inclusion into the COVAX program organized by WHO and key partners that is shipping Covid-19 vaccines to scores of countries around the world based on need.“As with other candidate vaccines, WHO continues to assess Sputnik V vaccines from different manufacturing sites and will publish decisions on their EUL (emergency use listing) status when all the data are available and the review is concluded,” WHO said in a statement. “The EUL assessment process aims to speed up equitable access to vaccines in order to save lives and bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control.”The vaccines WHO has approved are Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Sinovac and Sinopharm.After a meeting with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Murashko on Saturday said “all barriers have been removed” for further review of Sputnik V, as quoted by Russian news agencies and the official Twitter page of the Sputnik V vaccine.“Today we see no obstacles to further work,” and this was confirmed by Tedros, Murashko said. Some administrative procedures remained to be completed but the issues were not about the vaccine itself, he said.On Monday, Murashko added that “disagreements” with WHO had been resolved, and the production sites and registering company in Russia “should submit the entire package of documents within a week or a week and a half, and the further process will begin.”In a phone interview, WHO spokeswoman Daniela Bagozzi said Tuesday that only the WHO’s technical advisory group on emergency use listings — not the WHO director-general himself — has final say about whether a vaccine obtains emergency approval.Once WHO receives the full amount of data that it needs, when production sites have been inspected, and when the data is deemed to meet WHO criteria, the group can schedule a meeting to validate a candidate vaccine for an emergency use listing.No such meeting has been set for Sputnik V. The next vaccine on the group’s agenda is one from India’s Bharat Biotech, which is expected to be discussed this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-presses-bid-for-who-approval-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-101633455167466.html

They gave battle at a strategic point 80 miles north of the line.In the central sector, where Gen. MacArthur was assembling his main forces, North Koreans were reported manning their old positions a few miles above the Parallel. In South Korea Communist guerillas, operating in groups of ten to 1,000, have increased their activity in the last 48 hours, according to U.S. intelligence officers.A U.S. petrol van ran into a well-prepared ambush near the west coast recently. It was rescued by a column of infantry and tanks which fought off 300 Communists. Sabotage is continuing near the front lines, and mines have been placed on roads.British infantry were flown north to just below the Parallel during the day, while the rest of the British Commonwealth Brigade in Korea which consists of two British battalions and one Australian—moved up by road.Observers believed this hasty and expensive movement indicated that Gen. MacArthur was planning to order a composite force over the North-South Korean border soon. These would include the British Commonwealth troops, U.S. forces, already regrouped near the Parallel, and Fillipino troops who are expected to be moved up shortly.The North Koreans, who have put up little opposition till now to the South Koreans’ advance into their territory, picked a point three miles north of Changjon to stand and fight today.At this point the East Coast road is skirted by the sea and high mountains and the North Koreans had strong defence positions behind.Frontline reports said about 2,250 Communists gave no ground on the East Coast road to Wonsan, through the Southerners brought up reinforcements and called in powerful air strikes.The South Koreans were blocked by road mines and barbed wire in front of an extricate network of trenches in depth. The North Koreans were fighting bitterly.The Southern Third Division which yeaterday captured Kosong, 55 miles north of the Parallel, almost unresisted, had exxprected a Communist stand another 30 miles on at Wonsan, one of the few major towns of northern Korea.Some groups of well-equipped Communist troops up to 2,000 strong are reported still roaming the countryside, trying to break through to the North. But most of the fleeing Communists are without rifles, the intelligence officer said. –P.T.I.- Reuter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-october-6-1950-decisive-battle-in-north-korea-imminent-101633455504007.html

Taliban fighters also damaged the CCTV cameras. #KarteParwan pic.twitter.com/pvdC2rSPTuThere was no official word from the Indian side on the incident.Soon after the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15, hundreds of members of the Sikh and Hindu minorities had taken refuge in Gurdwara Karte Parwan. Taliban commanders visited the gurdwara soon after the takeover of the country and assured Sikh leaders about the safety of members of the community.Nearly 240 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were, however, barred from entering Kabul airport to board the last military evacuation flight from the Afghan capital.The Indian government has said it will take all steps to facilitate the evacuation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who want to leave Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-taliban-fighters-vandalise-kabul-s-gurdwara-karte-parwan-breaks-locks-101633448235434.html

Democrats so far are refusing, accusing the Republicans of taking the nation's financial standing hostage.President Joe Biden on Monday called Republican opponents "reckless and dangerous" for refusing to join Democrats in raising the debt limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-secy-yellen-says-us-debt-default-could-trigger-recession-report-101633440098714.html

It has also improved its ability to block platforms that break its rules.Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said during the near six-hour outage of Facebook services on Monday evening that this "answers the question of whether we need our own social networks and internet platforms".Facebook blamed its outage, which kept its 3.5 billion users from accessing services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, on a faulty configuration change.Russia's largest home-grown social network, Vkontakte, has far more daily users in the country than Facebook and reported a spike in messages and users after Facebook's services dropped."The number of Vkontakte video views increased by 18% and the number of messages sent in messenger by 21%," the Izvestia newspaper cited Marina Krasnova, head of the social network, as saying.She said the site's audience had jumped by 19% in comparison with the day before.Odnoklassniki, another popular social network, said activity on its site had increased during the Facebook outage, the RIA news agency reported.Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki are owned by Russian tech firm Mail.Ru.Russia disconnected itself from the global internet during tests earlier this year, part of a push to shield the country from being cut off from foreign infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-outage-shows-why-we-need-our-own-social-networks-russia-101633438387839.html
05-10-2021||World||Russian actress, director blast off to film first movie in space||A Russian actress and director blasted off to the International Space Station on Tuesday in a historic bid to best the United States to film the first movie in orbit.The Russian crew is set to beat a Hollywood project that was announced last year by "Mission Impossible" star Tom Cruise together with Nasa and Elon Musk's SpaceX.Actress Yulia Peresild, 37, and film director Klim Shipenko, 38, took off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan at the expected time of 0855 GMT, with docking scheduled for 1212 GMT."Launch as planned," the head of the Roscosmos space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, said on Twitter.Led by veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, the film crew will travel in a Soyuz MS-19 spaceship for a 12-day mission at the ISS to film scenes for "The Challenge".A live broadcast on Russian TV showed the Soyuz spacecraft ascending into a cloudless sky."The crew is feeling well," Shkaplerov was heard saying in the broadcast several minutes after take-off.The movie's plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by Roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save a cosmonaut.Shkaplerov and two other Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS are said to have cameo roles in the film.The ISS crew, which also includes a French, a Japanese and three Nasa astronauts, will welcome the newcomers when the hatch opens at around 1410 GMT.- 'It was difficult' -"It was difficult psychologically, physically and emotionally... but I think when we reach our goal all the challenges won't seem so bad," Peresild -- who was selected out of 3,000 applicants for the role -- said at a pre-flight press conference on Monday.True to a pre-flight tradition religiously observed by cosmonauts, the crew said that on Sunday they watched the classic Soviet film "The White Sun of the Desert".Shipenko and Peresild are expected to return to Earth on October 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who has been on the ISS for the past six months.If successful, the mission will add to a long list of firsts for Russia's space industry.The Soviets launched the first satellite Sputnik, and sent the first animal, a dog named Laika, the first man, Yuri Gagarin, and the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, into orbit.But compared to the Soviet era, modern Russia has struggled to innovate and its space industry is fighting to secure state funding with the Kremlin prioritising military spending.Its space agency is still reliant on Soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches.Russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the United States and China, with Beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry.- Russians 'lost interest' in space -Roscosmos was also dealt a blow after SpaceX last year successfully delivered astronauts to the ISS, costing Russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station.For political analyst Konstantin Kalachev, the space film is a matter of PR and a way to "distract" Russians from the "problems" that Roscosmos is facing."This is supposed to inspire Russians, show how cool we are, but I think Russians have completely lost interest in the space industry," Kalachev told AFP.In a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, Russia's space programme revealed this year that it will be reviving its tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the ISS.After a decade-long pause, Russia will send two Japanese tourists -- including billionaire Yusaku Maezawa -- to the ISS in December, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel.Last month, SpaceX completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the Earth's orbit.The trip followed the missions of billionaire Richard Branson, who spent several minutes in weightlessness in July, and of Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos completing a similar mission just days later.Later this month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, known for his portrayal of Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series, will fly to space on a mission with Bezos's Blue Origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/russian-actress-director-blast-off-to-film-first-movie-in-space-101633432597628.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid took to Twitter to inform about the decision related to the issuance of passports. "Council of ministers of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in its meeting on Monday instructed the Ministry of Interior to resume the issuance of passport and Tazkira or national ID card," Mujahid tweeted.The issuance of passports and national identity cards were halted after the Taliban took control of Kabul on August 15, hampering the plans of many Afghan citizens to flee the war-torn country in the wake of the return of Sunni Pashtun militants to power after two decades. The process had slowed even before the Taliban's return since the bloody conflict between the Afghan defence forces and the insurgents disrupted most of the government services. According to an official, the applicants will be provided with documents physically identical to those issued by the previous government, reported Reuters.Alam Gul Haqqani, acting head of the passport office, said that between 5,000 and 6,000 passports will be issued every day.  The official stressed that women employees will process the passports meant for female citizens, underlining the Taliban's plan to strictly enforce gender segregation as per their harsh interpretation of Sharia law.Meanwhile, Afghanistan's interior ministry spokesperson Qari Sayeed Khosti informed a media briefing that 25,000 applicants are in the final stage of payment for their passports. About 100,000 applications are pending in the earlier stages of the process, reported Reuters citing the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-to-resume-issuance-of-passports-id-cards-after-months-of-delay-101633428274954.html

The White House in a statement said that it remains concerned regarding the recent incursions made by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army air force into Taiwan’s airspace.“We remain concerned by the People's Republic of China's provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilising risk miscalculations and undermines regional peace and stability,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during the daily press briefing.Washington asked Beijing to cease military, diplomatic and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan. “We have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Psaki further added.Beijing marked the founding of the People's Republic of China on Saturday by making the largest-ever incursion into China as it flew 38 Chinese aircraft in two waves on Friday, news agency Reuters reported citing Taiwanese defence ministry.Psaki said the Biden administration will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability. “We maintain our commitments, as outlined in the three communiques, Taiwan Relations Act, and the Six Assurances,” Psaki said.The Biden administration said that it has made its concerns regarding Taiwan and its opinion regarding China’s coercive tactics clear earlier on many occasions and will continue to watch the situation very closely. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the Chinese actions undermine regional peace and stability. “Our commitment to Taiwan is rock solid,” Price said.In a separate statement, Republican senator Marco Rubio said at least 145 Chinese warplanes flew into Taiwan’s airspace since Friday. The incursion occurred a few days ahead of the Taiwanese National Day celebrations. Rubio also asked Biden to work with allies to curb China’s recklessness in the region.“If Beijing’s recklessness is not met with international condemnation, Xi Jinping will think he has a green light for further aggression. President Joe Biden must work with our allies to ensure the People’s Republic of China respects the status quo and the sovereign territory of Taiwan and its neighbours,” Rubio said, according to news agency PTI. Rubio further added that these were messages Xi wanted to send to the rest of the free world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-commitment-to-taiwan-rock-solid-us-warns-china-after-airspace-incursion-101633430641068.html

We are fully deployed and prepared on our side."On being asked about Chinese Air Force capabilities near Ladakh, he said China's capability to launch multiple high altitude missions would remain weak.Chaudhari also said that the induction of Rafale, Apaches have significantly added to our combat potential.He said that the IAF is in the process of new combat systems to ensure that we retain an edge over our adversaries"The induction of Rafale, Apaches have significantly added to our combat potential. Our offensive strike capability has become even more potent with the integration of new weapons on our fleets," said IAF Chief.He further added that we have hardened our networks to avoid cyber attacks. Adequate safeguards are being taken to protect our critical infrastructure.IAF is keen on integration amongst the Armed Forces. The joint planning and execution of operations by the three Services will result in a maximum increase in our net combat capability, he added.Chaudhari took charge as the Chief of Air Staff from Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on September 30, 2021.An ace fighter pilot, he was earlier in charge of the Ladakh sector during the peak of the crisis with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-air-force-present-across-lac-we-re-fully-deployed-prepared-iaf-chief-101633428303846.html

The aerial intrusions came at a time when aircraft carriers USS Ronald Reagan, USS Carl Vinson, HMS Elizabeth along with Japanese, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian ships are exercising between Taiwan and the coast of Okinawa.While the region appears to be on the edge, top diplomats see the provocative maneuvers by China against Taiwan directed at the domestic audience rather than serious war threat to Taipei. With China facing a slew of domestic challenges, including a biggest real estate company drowning in debt to power crunch, inflation, and slowdown in manufacturing sector, the military response is aimed at diverting attention of the public and fire up nationalistic sentiments.Beijing watchers believe that the aim of the recent aerial intrusions is to wear down the Taiwanese by conveying the signal that no one will come to support of Taipei if China decides to militarily take over the strategic islands. The ramping up of aerial intrusions - 27 per cent increase from the number of flights in the previous month - is also a message to US allies in the region particularly Japan and Australia, who are key partners in Quad grouping.While Taiwan has not responded to the Chinese aerial aggression, time is really running out for the principal players in the South China Sea. The rising military clout of PLA, particularly in the sea dimension, is posing a threat to the US domination of Indo-Pacific as well as forcing Japan to move towards shedding of its pacificist doctrine. The window for China to seize Taiwan is also limited by the Japanese desire to match Beijing militarily. If China outmaneuvers US on Taiwan, then the credibility of the latter will take a further hit after the withdrawal disaster in Afghanistan.With state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national reunification as part of declared Chinese core interests in 2011, it is logical to assume that Chinese Communist Party (CCP) objectives after Taiwan are Senkaku Islands and so-called South Tibet land dispute with India. These are credible threats as the Chinese position on the Indian borders has not moved an inch after the definition of the 1959 line by former premier Zhou En-Lai. Breaching of Taiwan red line by China will open the Pandora’s box. Is Quad prepared for such eventuality?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-air-intrusions-over-taiwan-challenges-us-military-might-in-indopacific-101633427905097.html

These schools that often times instil a distorted, ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam still flourish uninhibitedly in Pakistan and Afghanistan".She said, "The Taliban and the dreaded Haqqani network were born from such Madrassas in Pakistan. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other terrorist organisations continue operating such terror factories in Pakistan under the protection of the country's powerful intelligence agency".In Pakistan and Afghanistan, there are numerous illegal `madrasas' or religious schools which force the youth towards `jihad' or holy war. They teach them hatred against other religions and motivate them towards gun culture.Heckendorff told UNHRC, "The International Community must not be appeased with the Taliban's false promises of education. What is schooling worth, if instead of raising a workforce capable of leading their country onto a path of peace and development, creates foot soldiers indoctrinated into a worldview defined by misogyny and hatred?""The lack of economic independence of the Taliban and their patron State next door has a silver lining: it gives leverage to the international community. Leverage that must be used to prevent the loss of another generation of young Afghans to Madrassa-bred radicalism", she said in her speech.The research analyst concluded by saying, "Placing conditions on diplomatic and economic engagement to ensure human rights-conform education, without which the right to development can hardly be realized, is the most meaningful investment we can make in Afghanistan's future".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madrasas-in-pak-afghanistan-becoming-breeding-grounds-for-terrorists-un-report-101633423813185.html

All these are owned by Facebook and the outage caused the stocks of the social media giant to plummet.The California-based company said late on Monday that “the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change”, adding that it had "no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime."WhatsApp said on Twitter that it is back and running at 100 per cent. "Thank you to everyone around the world today for your patience while our teams worked diligently to restore WhatsApp. We truly appreciate you and continue to be humbled by how much people and organizations rely on our app every day," the company said in the tweet.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also apologised to those affected by the outage.Here's everything that happened in the dramatic day for the social media giant:• For the six hours when Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp were down, 3.5 billion users could not access the social media platforms and messaging services.• Facebook stocks plummeted almost 5% following Monday's outage.• The outage tracking site, Downdetector said it had received reports about almost 14 million disruptions in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, India and several other countries.• The New York Times reported that Facebook had deployed a team at its data centre in California to carry out a "manual reset" of the servers.• Users also flagged disruptions with service providers Vodafone, T-Mobile and Verizon in the UK, Italy, the US, Germany and other countries, according to Downdetector.• The issues appear to primarily impact internet use on cell phones or in gaming apps and other sites where Facebook is used to log-in. The ability to make phone calls or send text messages was not impacted.• Several tech experts, however, believe a DNS (domain name system) issue could be behind the crash, reported news agency DPA. The system converts website names typed out with letters into IP addresses that computers can process.• John Graham-Cumming, the chief technology officer of the cloud service Cloudflare, said that continued attempts by users to access the site have also led to overloading on DNS services.• A similar major outage hit Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram in April 2019 - but the platforms only stayed down for a few hours.• In July this year, issues at the internet network company Akamai also caused several major websites to briefly go down. At the time, the firm said the issue was due to a DNS issue that directs browsers to websites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whatsapp-facebook-return-after-outage-as-it-happened-and-where-things-stand-101633421164125.html

According to an investigation by Amnesty, the killings of the 11 Afghan national security forces and two civilians, among them a 17-year-old girl, took place in the village of Kahor in Daykundi province in central Afghanistan on August 30, a fortnight after the Taliban recaptured the country. “These cold-blooded executions (of the Hazaras) are further proof that the Taliban are committing the same horrific abuses they were notorious for during their previous rule of Afghanistan,” Amnesty's secretary general, Agnes Callamard, said, according to AP.Amnesty said Sadiqullah Abed, the Taliban-appointed chief of police for Daykundi, denied the killings and said that a member of the Taliban had been wounded in an attack in the province. Hazaras make up around 9 per cent of Afghanistan's 36 million people and are often targeted because they are Shiite Muslims in a Sunni-majority country.Also read | 3 ISIS-K terrorists killed by Taliban in Kabul: ReportAccording to the Amnesty report, the Taliban took control of Daykundi province on August 14 and that an estimated 34 former soldiers sought safety in Khidir district. The soldiers, who had government military equipment and weaponry with them, agreed to surrender to the Taliban. Mohammad Azim Sedaqat, who led the group's surrender, arranged to decommission the weapons in the presence of Taliban members. Nearly 300 Taliban fighters arrived in a convoy on August 30, close to Dahani Qul village, where the Afghan soldiers were staying, some with family members, according to Amnesty's report.Taliban fighters caught up with the leaving security force member and their families and opened fire on the crowd, killing a 17-year-old girl named Masuma. One soldier fired back, killing a Taliban fighter and wounding another. The Taliban continued to shoot as the families fled, killing two soldiers, according to the report. The report added that after nine soldiers surrendered, the Taliban took them to a nearby river basin and killed them. Amnesty said it verified photographs and video evidence taken in the aftermath of the killings.Also read | Taliban face shift from war to policing streetsAfter the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in a campaign that stunned the world, the Islamist fundamentalist group's leaders tried to assure Afghans that they will not attack those who supported the western-backed government of Ashraf Ghani and won’t impose the harsh rules followed during their last regime.

05-10-2021||World||Thousands of victims of sex abuse within France's Catholic Church: Report||Tens of thousands of people, and possibly more, are believed to have been victims of child sex abuse within France's Catholic Church over the past seven decades, according to a major report due to be published Tuesday.The 2,500-page document prepared by an independent commission comes as the Catholic Church in France, like in other countries, seeks to reckon with shameful secrets that were long covered up.The commission president, Jean-Marc Sauve, said in the French press that an estimated 3,000 child abusers — two-thirds of them priests — have worked in the church over the past 70 years.Olivier Savignac, head of victims' association “Parler et Revivre” (Speak out and Live again), who contributed to the probe, told The Associated Press that the estimated number of victims in the report reaches 216,000.“That is devastating, because the ratio between 216,000 and 3,000, it's one aggressor for 70 victims. That is terrifying for the French society, for the Catholic Church,” he said.The AP was not able to read the report ahead of its presentation and could not confirm the figure.The commission worked for 2 1/2 years, listening to victims and witnesses and studying church, court, police and press archives starting from the 1950s. A hotline launched at the beginning of the probe received 6,500 calls from alleged victims or people who said they knew a victim.Sauvé said 22 alleged crimes that can still be pursued have been forwarded to prosecutors. More than 40 cases that are too old to be prosecuted but involve alleged perpetrators who are still alive have been forwarded to church officials.The commission issued 45 recommendations about how to prevent abuse. These included training priests and other clerics, revising the Canon Law (the legal code the Vatican uses to govern the church) and fostering policies to recognize and compensate victims, Sauvé said.The report comes after a scandal surrounding now-defrocked priest Bernard Preynat rocked the French Catholic Church. Last year, Preynat was convicted of sexually abusing minors and given a five-year prison sentence. He acknowledged abusing more than 75 boys for decades.One of Preynat's victims, Francois Devaux, head of the victims' group La Parole Libérée ("The Liberated Word"), told The Associated Press that “with this report, the French church for the first time is going to the root of this systemic problem. The deviant institution must reform itself.”He said the number of victims the report was expected to list is “a minimum.”"Some victims did not dare to speak out or trust the commission,” he said, expressing concerns that the church in France still “hasn't understood” and has sought to minimize its responsibilities.The church must not only acknowledge events but also compensate victims, Devaux said. “It is indispensable that the church redresses the harm caused by all these crimes, and (financial) compensation is the first step.”The Preynat case led to the resignation last year of the former archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who has been accused of failing to report the abuses to civil authorities when he learned about them in the 2010s. France's highest court ruled earlier this year that Barbarin did not cover up the case.French archbishops, in a message to parishioners read during Sunday Mass across the country, said the publication of the report is “a test of truth and a tough and serious moment.”“We will receive and study these conclusions to adapt our actions,” the message said. “The fight against pedophilia concerns all of us ... Our support and our prayers will keep going towards all the people who have been abused within the church.”Pope Francis issued in May 2019 a groundbreaking new church law requiring all Catholic priests and nuns around the world to report clergy sexual abuse and cover-ups by their superiors to church authorities.In June, Francis swiftly rejected an offer from Cardinal Reinhard Marx, one of Germany's most prominent clerics and a close papal adviser, to resign as archbishop of Munich and Freising over the church's mishandling of abuse cases. But he said a process of reform was necessary and every bishop must take responsibility for the “catastrophe” of the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-victims-of-sex-abuse-within-france-s-catholic-church-report-101633412543217.html

What the discovery says||Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries on receptors for temperature and touch. The research done by David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian was conducted independently of each other in the late 1990s and 2000s.But, the groundbreaking work is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions, including chronic pain.Our ability to sense heat, cold and touch is essential for survival, the Nobel Committee said, and underpins our interaction with the world around us.What did they discover?The two US scientists identified receptors in the skin that respond to heat and pressure. Focussing on a field known as somatosenstation, Julius and Patapoutian decoded how the human body turns physical sensations into electrical pulses in the nervous system.Why is the discovery significant?According to experts, the discoveries show how little scientists knew about how our bodies perceived the external worlds before these discoveries - and how much there still is to learn. "While we understood the physiology of the senses, what we didn't understand was how we sensed differences in temperature or pressure," said Oscar Marin, director of the MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at King's College, London."Knowing how much our body sensed these changes is fundamental because once we know those molecules, they can be targeted. It's like finding a lock and now we know the precise key that will be necessary to unlock it," he added.What this means is that in the future, these discoveries could underpin how research into treating pain since the first heat sensor discovered (TRPV1) is also involved in chronic pain.The touch receptor, PIEZo2, has multiple roles, including regulating blood pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-in-medicine-how-we-sense-temperature-difference-what-the-discovery-says-101633412645530.html
05-10-2021||World||Climate change killed 14% of the world's coral reefs in 10 years: Study||Global warming has killed 14% of the world’s coral reefs in a decade and more will be wiped out if oceans keep rising in temperature, a study released on Tuesday has revealed.According to a report by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN), coral reefs equaling about 11,700 square kilometers — which is 2.5 times the size of Grand Canyon National Park — were lost between 2009 and 2018."Climate change is the biggest threat to the world's reefs," co-author Paul Hardisty, CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said in a statement shared by the UN."There are clearly unsettling trends toward coral loss, and we can expect these to continue as warming persists," he added.The report by the United Nations-supported global data network is the largest ever survey of coral health and covers data for 40 years, among 73 countries and 12,000 locations.The study also identifies dynamite fishing and pollution, but it is global warming that is seen as the primary reason behind the loss of coral reefs, which has left swathes of bleached skeletons in place of vibrant ecosystems.Coral bleaching accounts for much of the lossCorals in South Asia, Australia, the Pacific, East Asia, the Western Indian Ocean, the Gulf, and the Gulf of Oman, were among the hardest hit.Much of the loss was attributed to coral bleaching, as per the report.Coral bleaching is a phenomenon that takes place when corals — under stress from warmer water— expel the colorful algae that live inside their tissues, turning them white.Data in the study showed that such a bleaching event in 1998 alone was responsible for the loss of 8 per cent of the world’s corals.“Since 2009 we have lost more coral worldwide than all the living coral in Australia,” UNEP executive director Inger Anderson said.“We can reverse the losses, but we have to act now.”Some reefs ‘bounce back’During the study, scientists also found that there was about a 2% regain among coral reefs in 2019, indicating they can be resilient when given respite from the facets working against them."Some reefs have shown a remarkable ability to bounce back, which offers some hope for the future recovery of degraded reefs," Hardisty said.Coral reefs cover just under 1% of the ocean floor but support more than 25% of marine life.The reefs are responsible for approximately $2.7 trillion (€2.3 trillion) annually, in goods and services, including tourism, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-killed-14-of-the-world-s-coral-reefs-in-10-years-study-101633411407199.html
05-10-2021||World||Facebook's longest outage yet was flagged by Downdetector. Here's how it works||As Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went dark on Monday night, Downdetector, surveying the internet for online service status information, let the users know that they are not alone in experiencing the outage and that it certainly was not a result of a poor WiFi connection or broken internet. Downdetector, which analyses tens of millions of daily problem reports, makes people everywhere aware that the rest of the world is experiencing a similar issue as well. Throughout Monday night, the website's servers stood on a strict vigil and kept updating in real-time the status of the Facebook outage, which lasted for nearly six hours before the services started gradually getting back online.With Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp now ‘entirely’ back online, here's a brief review of how the Downdetector service, the world's most popular platform for online service status information, works.Downdetector, according to its official website, offers real-time status information for more than 6,000 services across 45 websites representing 45 countries. When a service provider’s customers are experiencing problems, Downdetector aggregates and analyses this data to determine the potential nature of the issue and then works to alert both the company and community of possible issues.For ease of access to users, Downdetector usually marks a certain website with a red exclamation mark icon if a large volume of users reports that are facing potential problems with the said website. If there are no such reports, the icon will be absent. Moreover, enterprise users can also directly communicate with their customers via their company's page on Downdetector. In the example image above, the Webco team has sent a message for its users regretting the inconvenience caused due to the snag.Also Read | Why Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were all down. ExplainedTo make the reporting process easier, Downdetector has a ‘problem report button’, with which users can submit a problem report about a particular website to Downdetector, choosing from a predefined list of problem indicators about the type of issue they are experiencing.The most significant part of the page is the live outage map, which shows the ‘spikes’ in reports over time; it helps users gauge the kind of response the website is getting across the world. If there are a lot of spikes corresponding to the timestamps, like in the image above, it means users all over the world are experiencing similar problems with the website. Downdetector also has a daily historical view of problem reports compared to the baseline volume.How Downdetector collects status informationAs more and more users submit problem reports directly on a company status page on Downdetector, along with an indicator of the type of problem they are experiencing, the tracking service gathers data through Twitter and uses ‘sentiment analysis’ to detect issues for a given company and its location. It also looks at other key indicators from across the web to determine if an extraordinary volume of users is having issues with a monitored company or service.How Downdetector determines if there’s an incidentAccording to Downdetector, a small number of users reporting a problem does not constitute a large-scale incident. To make sure that incidents are correctly represented, the website calculates “a baseline volume of typical problem reports for each service monitored”, based on the average number of reports for that given time of day, measured over the previous year. Downdetector only reports an incident when the number of problem reports is significantly higher than the baseline.“Downdetector only accepts the first report for a specific company from a single user. Subsequent information about the issue is collected but is not counted as a new problem report,” as per the website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-longest-outage-yet-was-flagged-by-downdetector-here-s-how-it-works-101633406548418.html

They said the failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same network in order to work compounded the error. Security experts have said an inadvertent mistake or sabotage by an insider could be possible reasons.The Facebook outage is the largest-ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector. The outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritising profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.The shares of Facebook fell 4.9 per cent, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks on Monday. "To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I'm sorry," Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer wrote on Twitter, adding that it "may take some time to get to 100 per cent".(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-blames-faulty-configuration-change-for-hours-long-outage-101633403948415.html

Extending his greetings to the newly-anointed leader, the US president vowed to work in tandem with Japan to challenge the increasing threat that Beijing poses in the East China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region. They also promised to deal with the aggravating blitz of North Korea, which has launched multiple missiles in waters just off the coast of Japan in recent weeks. Moments after the conversation, Kishida told reporters that Biden provided a “strong statement about US commitment for the defense of Japan, including… Senkaku.”New Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that he received a 'strong' message from President Joe Biden about the United States' commitment to defending the disputed East China Sea islets known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan https://t.co/oDvyluRc8r pic.twitter.com/Iuz9yZIUm9The Senkaku Islands (also known as ‘Diaoyutai Islands’ in China) are a set of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea fuelling a territorial dispute which has marred diplomatic relations between Tokyo and Beijing since at least the early 2010s. China, which continues to claim the Senkaku Islands as the country's ‘inherent territory’, has rapidly built up artificial islands with military infrastructure in the region. In phone calls with the new Japanese premier, Joe Biden reaffirmed the United States' commitment to defending the Senkaku Islands in the face of China's increasing activity in the East China Sea.Also Read | Japan lawmakers vote Fumio Kishida as new prime ministerThe 20-minute phone conversation on Monday started with Biden congratulating Kishida on taking office. The leaders called each other by their first names – Joe and Fumio – and agreed to meet for their first in-person talks at an early date.Although he acknowledged the need to continue dialogue with China, an important neighbour and trade partner, Kishida told Biden that “we must speak up” against China’s attempt to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas.Kishida, a 64-year-old former foreign minister with an image as a consensus builder, is seen as a supporter of stronger Japan-US ties and partnerships with other like-minded democracies in Asia, Europe, and Britain, in part to counter China and nuclear-armed North Korea. Kishida has also pledged to strengthen Japan’s missile and naval defence capabilities, pointing out that acquiring the ability to strike enemy bases, a controversial step backed by Abe, was a viable option and that he would appoint an aide to monitor China's treatment of its Uyghur minority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-talks-to-japan-s-new-prime-minister-kishida-a-strong-message-for-china-101633402627627.html

"After working on this for a whole year and getting one negative result after another, the 72nd candidate ... wiped out this ability," he said at a press event.Armenian-origin Patapoutian, who grew up in war-torn Lebanon and came to the US aged 18, said it was hard for him to imagine the day would come he would win a Nobel.When the Nobel committee tried calling him at 2:00 am in California, his phone was on silent."They somehow got a hold of my 94-year-old father who lives in Los Angeles, and I guess even if you have 'Do not disturb' people in your favorites can call you," he said, adding it was a "very special moment."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chili-peppers-warm-hugs-what-inspired-the-nobel-winning-duo-behind-groundbreaking-medical-advancement-101633401568062.html

A selloff sent the social-media giant’s stock plummeting around 5 per cent on Monday, adding to a drop of about 15 per cent since mid-September.The stock slide on Monday sent Zuckerberg’s worth down to $120.9 billion, dropping him below Bill Gates to No. 5 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s lost about $19 billion of wealth since Sept. 13, when he was worth nearly $140 billion, according to the index.Also Read | After longest Facebook outage, Mark Zuckerberg issues a personal apologyOn Sept. 13, the Wall Street Journal began publishing a series of stories based on a cache of internal documents, revealing that Facebook knew about a wide range of problems with its products — such as Instagram’s harm to teenage girls’ mental health and misinformation about the Jan. 6 Capitol riots — while downplaying the issues in public. The reports have drawn the attention of government officials, and on Monday, the whistleblower revealed herself.In response, Facebook has emphasised that the issues facing its products, including political polarisation, are complex and not caused by technology alone. “I think it gives people comfort to assume that there must be a technological or a technical explanation for the issues of political polarization in the United States,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-facebook-goes-dark-zuckerberg-loses-7-billion-drops-down-in-billionaire-list-101633395280628.html

According to Wired, an error in DNS records can make it impossible to connect to a website.Alex Stamos, a former chief security officer at Facebook, told Wired that the cause of the issue is “probably a bad configuration or code push to the network management system,” “This isn’t supposed to happen,” Stamos added. “Facebook's outage appears to be caused by DNS; however that's a just symptom of the problem,” Troy Mursch, chief research officer of cyberthreat intelligence company Bad Packets, told Wired. The fundamental issue, Mursch says—and other experts agree—is that Facebook has withdrawn the so-called Border Gateway Protocol route that contains the IP addresses of its DNS nameservers.Several internet infrastructure experts told Wired that the likeliest answer was a misconfiguration on Facebook’s part. “It appears that Facebook has done something to their routers, the ones that connect the Facebook network to the rest of the internet,” John Graham-Cumming, CTO of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-were-all-down-explained-101633393280540.html

The agency said its decision came after studies showed that an extra dose of the vaccines increased people’s ability to produce antibodies against the virus that causes Covid-19 in organ transplant patients with weakened immune systems.“Although there is no direct evidence that the ability to produce antibodies in these patients protected against Covid-19, it is expected that the extra dose would increase protection at least in some patients,” the agency said in a statement.The World Health Organization’s chief had urged wealthy nations not to use booster doses this year, saying there is no scientific data that proves the shots are necessary.He said Covid-19 vaccines would be put to better use in developing countries, where many people still have not received their first vaccine shots.Lowest weekly global tollThe weekly number of coronavirus deaths worldwide has fallen to levels unseen for almost a year, according to an AFP count on Monday based on official national figures.The 53,245 deaths recorded worldwide between September 27 and October 3, an average of 7,606 each day, showed that the global pandemic continues the downward trend that began at the end of August, after a peak of around 10,000 deaths per day.The new weekly death toll figure is the lowest recorded since October 31-November 6, 2020.Over the last month, the number of Covid-19 related deaths has fallen by almost a quarter, as vaccination campaigns make progress.The Kremlin on Monday implored people to get vaccinated against Covid-19, calling it the only way to stop the virus’ spread, as Russian authorities mulled reintroducing health restrictions to cope with daily cases rising to their highest levels since January.“The vaccination rate, despite the complete preparedness of all infrastructure, leaves much to be desired,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.The 25,781 new infections reported nationwide on Monday was the most since January 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-regulator-okays-3rd-dose-of-pfizer-for-over-18s-101633388334537.html

Thank you for bearing with us.Meanwhile, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said, “Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger are coming back online now. Sorry for the disruption today -- I know how much you rely on our services to stay connected with the people you care about.”The outage reports started pouring in from 8.45pm (IST) for WhatsApp on website downdetector.com. The website which reports on website traffic also reported that Facebook was also inaccessible to several users across the world from 8.57pm (IST). Instagram too was down for millions of users.WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook down for usersMicroblogging website Twitter saw social media users reporting about the WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram services being down for them.The New York Times earlier today shared a tweet where Ryan Mac, their tech reporter, in a tweet said that the internal tools and communications platforms, including Workplace were not working. In his tweet, Mac also said that no employees were able to work calling the event a ‘snow day’.Anti-Biden content, Facebook whistleblower's revelation: Tweets on global outageIt is common for websites to face outages but Monday’s event was on a global scale that affected millions of people worldwide. Twitter through its tweet ‘Hello literally everyone’ exemplified as to how major the outage was.Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for Kentik Inc, said that the ‘DNS routes that Facebook makes available’ to the ‘networking world’ were unavailable, while speaking to news agency Reuters. Akamai Technologies faced a similar problem which led to multiple websites reporting downtime in July. Security experts told news agency Reuters that the outage may have been triggered by a configuration error, which could be the result of an internal mistake. No reports of sabotage by an external element was reported.Facebook earlier in March and July also reported similar outages but the services during those instances were resolved within a short period of time. The current outage which lasted for more than several hours is by far the longest outage faced by Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp messenger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-restore-services-after-over-6-hours-of-outage-101633372093405.html
05-10-2021||World||Japan’s newly elected PM to seek fresh polls to deal with Covid-19||Newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday he will dissolve the lower house next week in preparation for October 31 elections as he seeks a fresh mandate to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the sagging economy and security threats from China and North Korea.Kishida was formally elected by parliament earlier Monday to replace Yoshihide Suga, who resigned after only one year in office. Suga’s support had plunged over his handling of the pandemic and insistence on holding the Tokyo Olympics as the virus spread.“Our fight against the coronavirus is continuing,” Kishida told his first news conference Monday night after taking office. “COVID-19 measures is the urgent and top priority, and I will handle the problem taking into consideration the worst-case scenario.” He said he will review the past virus handling and seek to set up a crisis management unit.He also pledged to push through with a large-scale recovery package to support those hit by the pandemic.“In order to take large-scale COVID-19 measures, I need to get the people’s mandate,” Kishida said, adding that he will pass up attending G-20 and COP-26 climate meetings in-person.A former foreign minister, Kishida, 64, used to be known as a moderate but turned hawkish on security and more conservative on gender equality and other issues, apparently to win over influential conservatives in his Liberal Democratic Party. His victory in last week’s vote to replace Suga as the party’s leader was seen as a choice for continuity and stability over change.Kishida replaced all but two of Suga’s 20 Cabinet members, and 13 will hold posts for the first time, according to the lineup announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno. Most of the posts went to powerful factions that voted for Kishida in the party election. Only three women are included, up from two in Suga’s government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-newly-elected-pm-to-seek-fresh-polls-to-deal-with-covid19-101633381100739.html
05-10-2021||World||Facebook chose profit over safety: Whistleblower||Facebook prematurely turned off safeguards designed to thwart misinformation and rabble rousing after Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in last year’s elections in a moneymaking move that a company whistleblower alleges contributed to the deadly January 6 invasion of the US Capitol.The whistleblower, former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen, also asserted during an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that a 2018 change to the content flow in Facebook’s news feeds contributed to more divisiveness and ill will in a network ostensibly created to bring people closer together.Despite the enmity that the new algorithms were feeding, Facebook found that they helped keep people coming back — a pattern that helped the company sell more of the digital ads that generate most of its advertising.“The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” said Haugen, who joined Facebook in 2019 after working at Google and Pinterest.“And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money.”Facebook’s annual revenue has more than doubled from $56 billion in 2018 to a projected $119 billion this year, based on the estimates of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Meanwhile, the company’s market value has soared from $375 billion at the end of 2018 to nearly $1 trillion now.Even before the full interview came out, a top Facebook executive was deriding the whistleblower’s allegations as “misleading”.“Social media has had a big impact on society in recent years, and Facebook is often a place where much of this debate plays out,” Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president of policy and public affairs wrote to Facebook employees in a memo sent on Friday.The “60 Minutes” interview intensifies the spotlight already glaring on Facebook as lawmakers and regulators around the world scrutinise the social networking’s immense power to shape opinions and its polarising effects on society.The backlash has been intensifying since The Wall Street Journal’s mid-September publication of an expose that revealed Facebook’s own internal research had concluded the social network’s attention-seeking algorithms had helped foster political dissent and contributed to mental health and emotional problems among teens, especially girls.After copying thousands of pages of Facebook’s internal research, Haugen leaked them to the Journal to provide the foundation for a succession of stories packaged as the “Facebook Files”.Haugen (37), has filed at least eight complaints with US securities regulators alleging Facebook has violated the law by withholding information about the risks posed by its social network, according to “60 Minutes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-chose-profit-over-safety-whistleblower-101633380834637.html
05-10-2021||World||How likely is a hack the reason behind Facebook, WhatsApp & Instagram’s outage ?||Popular social media platform Facebook and the company’s messaging service WhatsApp Messenger and its image and video sharing platform Instagram suffered a massive outage across the world on Monday night (IST). All three services have acknowledged the situation on Twitter and assured that they were working on solving the issues and they would be restored as soon as possible.However, the outage also comes at a time that has been particularly difficult for Facebook. The company has been the centre of a major controversy following a report by the Wall Street Journal, which said that the company did not act upon the findings of its own research teams about the ill effects its platforms had on young users, especially teenage girls.Also read | ‘Hello literally everyone’: Twitter after Facebook, WhatsApp, IG global outageMeanwhile, the exact reason behind the outage is not clearly known yet and the platforms themselves have not mentioned it too. The error message on Facebook’s website initially showed an issue with the Domain Name System (DNS) and later it said, “Sorry, something went wrong. We're working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.” The error message about DNS was displayed on Instagram’s website too.An internal configuration error could have been the likely reason behind the outage, news agency Reuters said in a report citing security experts who were aware of the situation. Further, the report also said that the outage could have been caused due to sabotage by an insider, calling the situation “theoretically possible.”Also watch | Whatsapp, Facebook, Insta down for hours in global outage; Meme fest on TwitterNotably, the report also showed that a hack or breach of the networks from outside was “less likely” as such a large-scale denial-of-service attack, which can overwhelm Facebook’s popular platforms, would require powerful criminal groups to coordinate or use very innovative techniques.The outage also came as a Facebook insider, Frances Haugen, earlier on Sunday said that the company prioritised profits over acting on hate speech and misinformation during an interview in a television show, several news reports showed.During the outage, which had affected millions of users across the world, several people took to Twitter to express their reactions. While many people shared memes about the scenario, others also shared their thoughts about moving on to other messaging platforms from WhatsApp Messenger. Also, #FacebookDown and #WhatsAppDown were trending on Twitter for a long time on Monday night (IST).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-likely-is-a-hack-the-reason-behind-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-s-outage-101633376003593.html

Meanwhile, the Pfizer booster doses can be inoculated to all adults at least six months after their second Covid-19 shot.In a statement, the European Medicines Agency cited studies showing that an extra dose of the coronavirus vaccine increases the ability to generate antibodies against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing the disease in “organ transplant patients with weakened immune systems.” “It is expected that the extra dose would increase protection at least in some patients,” the statement added.The move comes after the US authorities in August gave a go-ahead for Covid-19 booster shots, claiming that data available to them has made it “very clear” that protection against the virus begins to wear off over time after an individual is jabbed with the initial shots of the vaccine.Also Read | Joe Biden gets Covid-19 booster shot after authorisation“In association with the dominance of the Delta variant we are starting to see evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,” the country’s top officials, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky and US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, had said in a statement. Several EU member states such as Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Serbia, among others, have approved Covid-19 booster shots. Austria is going to commence a wider rollout from October 17 onwards, according to Reuters. Canada has recommended authorised mRNA Covid-19 booster shots to those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, the Reuters report added.The matter of Covid-19 booster doses have not gone down well with the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on the same, citing that several poor or less-developed countries are yet to inoculate the first dose of the vaccine to their nationals. The public health agency addressed this issue yet again recently by announcing that its Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax) will allocate vaccines to the “least covered countries only” for October – a first-of-a-kind move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-drug-panel-gives-nod-to-covid-19-booster-shot-for-immunocompromised-101633372569324.html
05-10-2021||World||‘Frank conversations’: US to resume trade talks with China||The Biden administration on Monday signalled the resumption of US-China trade talks. Katherine Tai, the top American trade official, said she plans to have “frank conversations” with her Chinese counterpart about “shortfalls” in Beijing meeting its commitments under Phase One agreement signed with the Trump administration in 2020.US trade representative Tai also made clear these talks were not intended to “inflame trade tensions” but America will be prepared and willing to “use the full range of tools we have, and develop new tools as needed to defend American economic interests from harmful policies and practices”.The resumption of trade talks comes as part of a new strategy based on a review of the bilateral trade relationship and the agreement that was signed by President Donald Trump and Chinese negotiators in January 2020 that ended months of tensions accompanied by an escalating tariff war between the world’s two largest economies.“I intend to have frank conversations with my counterpart in China that will include discussion over China’s performance under the Phase One agreement. We will also directly engage with China on its industrial policies,” Tai said in a widely anticipated speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a leading US think-tank.“Our objective is not to inflame trade tensions with China (but) durable coexistence requires accountability and respect for the enormous consequences of our actions,” she added.The official said “our objective is not to escalate trade tensions with China or double down on the previous administration’s flawed strategy” but the same time, we’re trying to continue to pursue an unfair endorser practices. We will use the full range of our tools to help ensure that the US China trade relationship works for American workers, our industries, and our supply chain”.Tai did not detail these “shortfalls” but indicated they may be in the commitments China made to purchase at least $200 billion of Americans goods and services over two years of the signing of the agreement. She also did not say when she expects to hold these conversations, except that they will be “soon”.Under the deal signed in January 2020, China had committed to buying at least $200 billion worth of American goods and services over the next two years, above the 2017 levels; stronger legal protections for patents, trademarks, copyrights, including improved criminal and civil procedures to combat online infringement, pirated and counterfeit goods; and pledged to desist from competitive currency manipulations.Tai said the 2020 agreement stabilised the market, especially for US agricultural exports, but “our analysis indicates that while commitments in certain areas have been met, there have also been shortfalls in others”.According to the Pietersen Institute for International Economics, a US think tank that runs a tracker of the Phase One deal, China has met only 62% of its purchase commitments for American goods.But the “shortfalls” will only be a part of the conversation as the US trade representative said the Phase One agreement was limited in size and scope. “The reality is this agreement did not meaningfully address the fundamental concerns that we have with China’s trade practices and their harmful impacts on the US economy.”Even with this agreement in place, China’s government “continues to pour billions of dollars into targeted industries, and continues to shape its economy, to the will of the state, hurting the interests of workers here in the US and around the world”.Katherine Tai practically ruled out a Phase Two agreement, which the Trump administration had planned to address structural issues in bilateral trade. Asked if there will be a Phase Two agreement, Tai said, “I’m not quite sure. You’ll have to ask my predecessor, and the previous administration in setting this up as Phase One, what they were thinking about as a Phase Two.”A senior Biden administration official, who previewed Tai’s speech on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said, “We are not looking to seek a Phase Two negotiation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frank-conversations-us-to-resume-trade-talks-with-china-101633369508991.html

The teacher was also arrested in this case in 2018.Geo Varghese, a physical education teacher with Jaipur’s St Xavier’s School, was also a member of its disciplinary committee.The suicide note found from the child did not name the teacher, but the police lodged the criminal case on a complaint by the parents who blamed him for causing mental harassment to the child.The Supreme Court on Tuesday quashed the criminal case registered on May 2, 2018.“Spare the rod and spoil the child, an old saying may have lost its relevance in present days and corporal punishment to the child is not recognised by law but that does not mean that a teacher or school authorities have to shut their eyes to any indiscipline act of a student,” the bench said.The student was caught bunking classes by the teacher twice on April 19 and April 25, 2018, and let off with a warning. When this action persisted, the teacher brought the matter to the notice of the Principal who called the parents the next day. No further overt act was attributed to the teacher.Justice Krishna Murari, writing the judgment for the bench said, “if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations attributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly-situated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide. Thus, what is required is an examination of every case on its own facts and circumstances and keeping in consideration the surrounding circumstances as well, which may have bearing on the alleged action of the accused and the psyche of the deceased.”A mere allegation of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself to constitute an offence under Section 306, the bench said, adding that there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of the offence of suicide.The bench also noted that a teacher is under a solemn duty to instil discipline in the students, and it is not uncommon for teachers to reprimand a student for not being attentive or not being up to the mark in studies, for bunking classes or not attending the school.“The disciplinary measures adopted by a teacher or other authorities of a school, reprimanding a student for his indiscipline, in our considered opinion, would not tantamount to provoking a student to commit suicide unless there are repeated specific allegations of harassment and insult deliberately without any justifiable cause or reason,” the bench said.Further, the teacher has a legally assigned duty under Section 24(e) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to hold regular meetings with the parents and guardians and apprise them about the regularity in attendance, ability to learn, progress made in learning and any other act or relevant information about the child, the judgment said.The court after examining the suicide note observed that the child had thanked the teacher in question, and it suggested a “hypersensitive temperament” of an immature mind, the bench said,“A criminal trial is not exactly a pleasant experience and the appellant who is a teacher would certainly suffer great prejudice if he has to face prosecution on absurd allegations of irrelevant nature.”At the same time, the court shared its sympathies with the parents of the victim but said, “Our sympathies and the pain and suffering of the complainant, cannot translate into a legal remedy, much less a criminal prosecution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teacher-booked-for-abetment-to-suicide-for-reprimanding-student-gets-sc-shield-101633457655665.html

Physically we are not allowed to go but on call we have sympathised with them,” Hooda was quoted as saying by ANI.Hooda said he along with Priyanka have been in custody along Sitapur police lines for about 40 hours, and “no one is allowed” to meet them – echoing the Congress general secretary’s statement. “If we're in police custody, we should have been produced before a magistrate within 24 hours, which has not happened,” he told ANI.Hooda further claimed that it was through media that they learnt about a First Information Report (FIR) being filed against him, Priyanka and other Congress leaders while they were en route to Lakhimpur Kheri earlier in the day. He added that police were not sharing any details with them.The Congress MP noted that under Section 151 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) – used to arrest them by Uttar Pradesh, individuals cannot be detained beyond 24 hours.Watch | Priyanka Gandhi's dare to PM Modi during his Lucknow trip amid Lakhimpur stormHooda, according to the ANI report, has demanded an investigation into the matter by a sitting judge.

05-10-2021||India||Bypolls to local bodies seats held in Maharashtra||Bypolls for the 84 seats of district councils (DC) and 141 panchayat samitis (PS) in six districts of Maharashtra reported 63% voting on Tuesday. Eyes in the political corridors are set on the results of the bypolls which are being held without reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) for the first time since the quota was introduced in the early 1990s. The counting of votes will begin at 10am on Wednesday.The bypolls to the district councils and panchayat samitis were held Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, Nagpur and Palghar. The polls were necessitated after the Supreme Court stayed OBC quota for want of empirical data and cancelled the elections of the representatives elected from the seats reserved for the community.After the voting began at 7.30 am, the election authorities received complaints that the names of voters had gone missing. In Nagpur, 16 DC and 31 PS seats went for polls, while in Dhule, votes were cast for 14 DC and 28 PS candidates. Palghar’s 15 DC and 14 PS seats went for polling on Tuesday. Washim and Akola districts have 14 seats each of councils and 27 and 28 seats of PS that went to polls. Nandurbar’s 12 DC seats saw election. One DC seat in Dhule and three PS seats in Dhule and Nandurbar were elected unopposed as only one candidate each stood from these seats.“The bypolls may prove trendsetters ahead of the massive local body elections scheduled to be held early next year. This has been the first election without reservation to OBCs and as such it could indicate an idea among the community. Most of the districts which went to polls are backward and OBC-dominated. Results many see change in power in some of these districts,” said a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader requesting anonymity of name. BJP had fielded OBC candidates on all the seats that fell vacant after the quota was quashed. In the elections held in these district councils last January, BJP had won the highest 39 seats out of 56 in Dhule council, while Congress had retained its power in Nagpur DC by winning 30 of 58 seats. In Nandurbar, BJP and Congress won 23 (of total 56) seats each, while Congress’s Seema Walvi was elected as head the body. Palghar DC is ruled by Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party.The State Election Commission (SEC) had announced the bypolls last month, immediately after SC asked it to submit the status report on the elections in six DCs and the samitis under them in six weeks. In March, the Apex court stayed the OBC reservation and asked SEC to cancel the elections of the candidates elected from the quota and hold bypolls. SEC had to put the bypolls on hold March after the second wave of Covid-19. The process for electing new candidates has now started from where it was stalled last year.Though OBC seats have been thrown open for the open category, most of political parties have fielded candidates from the community.Meanwhile, Congress has ordered an inquiry against its leader from Nagpur Ashish Deshmukh, after his audio tape – in which he has appealed voters to voter for a BJP candidate in Nagpur – emerged. Party’s working president and disciplinary committee member Chandrakant Handore will conduct the probe. Deshmukh had reportedly released the audio to appeal voters to vote for BJP’s Nileshkumar Dhote to the Nagpur DC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypolls-to-local-bodies-seats-held-in-maharashtra-101633454176630.html
05-10-2021||India||Amit Shah to spend 3 days in Jammu and Kashmir, his first visit after Aug 2019||NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah will travel to Jammu and Kashmir later this month, his first trip to the Union territory that was carved out of the erstwhile state after its special status under the Constitution was effectively revoked. Shah’s visit is part of the Centre’s continuing mega outreach campaign aimed at the Jammu and Kashmir that were formed on August 5, 2019, people familiar with the development said.Shah, who is tentatively expected to be in the centrally-administered Union territory between October 23 and 25, is also expected to review implementation of development schemes, interact with stakeholders and chair a top-level security review, a person cited above said. During the tour, the Union home minister is expected to interact with stakeholders, review important projects and take stock of the law and order situation.Shah was last in Jammu and Kashmir in June 2019, immediately after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept to power for the second term.The move to strip the state of its special status under Article 370 came a few months later. Shah had pitched the change, along with the conversion of the state into two union territories from October 31, as steps that would fast track development and end terrorism in the state.On August 5, 2019, the Centre effectively revoked Article 370, which bestowed special status to the erstwhile state, and Article 35A, which barred non-locals from buying or owning immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir, settling there permanently, or availing benefits of state-sponsored scholarship schemes. The constitutional provision acknowledged the special status of the (then) state of Jammu and Kashmir in terms of autonomy and its ability to formulate laws for the state’s permanent residents. Several members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s council of ministers have travelled to the newly carved union territory in last four-five weeks as part of the public outreach programme. These include farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar, tourism minister G Kishan Reddy, and junior minority affairs minister John Barla among others.During his tour, Shah is likely to visit remote areas of Kashmir valley and the Jammu region.Last month, he held a top-level review meeting on J&K with the Lt Governor Manoj Sinha and senior security officials including the National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval. He also reviewed various development initiatives being implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, including the ₹80,000 crore package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015.The home minister has said in the past that all-round development and welfare of the people of the Union territory are on top priority list of the government. In June this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited J&K leaders including Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti at his residence in Delhi, during which they demanded restoration of special status of J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-spend-3-days-in-jammu-and-kashmir-his-first-visit-after-aug-2019-101633454175510.html

The renewal fee will cost owners eight times more than what it costs to register new vehicles.The charge for renewing the license of a 15-year-old car would be ₹5,000 and registration of a new vehicle will cost only ₹600. The charges of registration renewal of bikes older than the stipulated age of 15 years would be ₹1,000, but registering new vehicles will cost only Rs.300.The ministry also notified that renewal of certificate of fitness for a bus or truck older than 15 years will bear a cost which is nearly eight times higher than what owners of commercial vehicles currently pay. Thus for the renewal of a fitness certificate for a bus or truck older than 15 years an amount of ₹12,500 will be charged from April while in the case of medium-sized goods vehicle or passenger motor vehicle, it would cost ₹10,000.Under the the National Automobile Scrappage Policy launched by the Prime Minister in August this year fitness tests have been made mandatory for heavy commercial vehicles from April 1, 2023. Similar measures are expected to be put in place for other vehicles from June 2024.In case of delay in renewal of fitness certificate an additional fee of ₹50 for each day of delay after the expiry of certificate of fitness will also be levied. These new rules may be called the Central Motor Vehicles (23rd Amendment) Rules, 2021, the ministry said.The ministry said the measure was adopted as a part of the vehicle scrappage policy, in order “to have a system of incentives and disincentives to nudge vehicle owners to discard old and polluting vehicles, which have higher maintenance and fuel consumption costs.” It added that there will be a waiver of the fee for issuance of certificate of registration for a new vehicle, purchased against the authority of the Certificate of Deposit (CoD) issued by a Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility for a vehicle being scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/registration-of-vehicles-older-than-15-years-to-cost-more-from-april-2022-101633448081888.html

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) also stated that a blanket order to block the sale of these products cannot be passed by the committee formed under the legal provision, according to news agency PTI.The bench headed by Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing a petition seeking to ban the re-entry of Shein products in Indian digital marketplace. The app, along with more than 50 other Chinese ones, were banned in India in 2020.In its reply submitted to the court via Centre’s standing advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, MeitY said that public access and functionality of Shein was blocked in India last year, but the app’s products being sold on other platforms is a different aspect altogether, the PTI report added.The Centre said that the Chinese app – which was blocked after being found “detrimental” to India’s security and sovereignty, was temporarily blocked on June 29 last year, and it was permanently blocked for public access in January this year. “Every incident violating the provisions of Section 69A of the IT Act related to already blocked information or content has to be reported separately by following the due process,” PTI reported quoting the government’s statement. Senior counsel Vivek Raj Singh, appearing for petitioner Ananttika Singh appealed to the court to pass an interim stay on the sale of Shein products on all platforms, saying that otherwise the app – which was prohibited as customer details were being shared to Chinese manufacturers, will continue to do so. He had earlier informed the court that Amazon publicised the sale of Shein products as part of its prime day sale. The petitioner has sought a direction to Amazon to suspend its partnership with Shein until the ban imposed by the central government is rolled back. Amazon’s advocate, however, told PTI that they are yet to receive a copy of the petition. The court has directed the petitioner to supply a copy of the PIL to Amazon’s lawyer and granted time to issue a reply. The matter will next be heard on December 1. This development comes three months after the Delhi High Court in July issued a notice to the Centre on the same petition filed by Singh. However, the bench had at that time refused to put an interim stay on the sale of Shein products on other Indian digital marketplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-put-blanket-order-centre-on-sale-of-banned-shein-products-on-amazon-101633447888525.html

The Congress general secretary further alleged that the cops didn’t serve her any order or notice and no copy of the FIR was shared with her.Gandhi was stopped from reaching Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people were killed as violence broke out after a car hit protesting farmers. Farmers alleged that the car belonged to a convoy of union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son.Narrating the series of developments since she was stopped on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday evening, Gandhi said she saw on social media that the cops have named 11 people but added that “8 of them were not even present at the time I was arrested. In fact, they have even named two persons who brought my clothes from Lucknow on the afternoon of October 4.”“I have not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer either. I have also not been allowed to meet my legal counsel who has been standing at the gate since morning. Presently I am not going into the details of the completely illegal physical force used on my colleagues and me at the time of my arrest,” she said.According to the Congress leader, she was “verbally informed” by DCP Piyush Kumar Singh, CO City, Sitapur, that she had been arrested under section 151 on October 4. “At the time I was arrested I was travelling within the district of Sitapur, approximately 20 kilometres from the border of district Lakhimpur Kheri which was under section 144, however, to my knowledge, section 144 was not imposed in Sitapur.”Arguing that she didn’t violate section 144, the Congress leader pointed out that she was travelling in a single-vehicle with four other persons and “No security car or congress workers other than the four persons accompanying me were with me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-physical-force-used-on-me-my-colleagues-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-on-up-101633448142783.html

In a series of tweets, the UN health agency said that Bharat Biotech has been submitting data on a rolling basis and submitted additional information at the WHO's request on September 27.“WHO & an independent group of experts are scheduled to meet next week to carry out the risk/benefit assessment and come to a final decision whether to grant Emergency Use Listing to Covaxin,” the health agency tweeted.WHO further stated that the assessment will be finalised next week if the additional information submitted by the manufacturer addresses all the questions raised by the experts. The Emergency Use Listing process is centred on determining if the vaccine is quality-assured, safe and effective, according to the WHO.So far, the WHO has approved Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna and Sinopharm. Bharat Biotech, the Indian biotechnology company, has been awaiting approval from the WHO for weeks, which is important for promoting its product in the global as well as domestic market. The emergency use listing also makes international travel easy.“As a responsible manufacturer with past approvals for our other vaccines, we do not find it appropriate to speculate or comment on the regulatory approval process and its timelines,” Bharat Biotech had said in a statement late last month.“We are diligently working with the WHO to obtain EUL at the earliest,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-to-decide-on-covaxin-emergency-use-listing-next-week-101633446042179.html
05-10-2021||India||‘Why the hurry, heavens won’t fall’: Supreme Court chides Centre over NEET-SS||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday described the Union government’s offer to defer the National Eligibility Entrance Test for super speciality courses (NEET-SS) from November to January as a “sop”, wondering why the government couldn’t have waited a year to introduce changes to the pattern of the entrance exam. The court also underlined that the changes, introduced by the government at the last minute, appeared to have been taken to help private medical colleges where super specialty course seats go vacant every year.“We have read your affidavit and it prima facie appears that the entire haste shown by you (government) is for filling the vacant seats. The seats that go vacant are never in government colleges. This gives a strong impression that regulation of medical education has become a business. We will hear this matter. Please put your house in order otherwise the hands of the law are very long,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna said on two petitions by over 41 post graduate doctors.The doctors complained that the examination was notified on July 23, but on August 31, the National Board of Examinations (NBE), which conducts NEET-SS, announced a change in the exam pattern for NEET-SS for admission to over 4,200 seats for DM (Doctorate of Medicine), M.Ch (Master of Surgery) and DrNB (Doctorate of National Board). The exam was to be held on November 13 and 14.The doctors said they had prepared for the exam based on the older pattern used since 2018.In its affidavit filed on October 1, the Centre and NBE declined to modify the examination pattern but said it was open to defer the examination by two months to January 10-11, 2022 to let the doctors prepare.The court wasn’t satisfied. “You have held up some sop to the court when your fundamental process of holding the exam is under question. Deferring the examination for two months will do no good,” the court told the government at Tuesday’s hearing.The bench told Centre, NBE and National Medical Commission “to apply wisdom in its decision-making process”. It will continue hearing the case on Wednesday.The post graduate doctors who filed the petition said that the existing exam pattern tested the candidate on their knowledge of the super specialty stream that they wished to pursue. The examination asked 60% questions from the super specialty of the candidate’s choice while the remaining 40% tested the candidate on a mix of broad specialty courses of which one was general medicine.Under the new pattern, 100% questions were to come from the broad specialty course of general medicineAdditional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, told the court that every year, seats in the super specialty courses ended up vacant due to the exam pattern. Last year, 805 out of 4,286 seats remained vacant while in 2019, the vacant seats totalled 545.“Heavens would not have fallen if you would have introduced the changes from next year,” the bench said, adding, “Seats falling vacant is the concern of the management of medical colleges. Tell us how many seats go vacant in government colleges. You can give us the breakup between government and private colleges where seats fall vacant.”Senior advocate Maninder Singh Singh, who appeared for NBE, said the old examination scheme tested the candidate on a subject that he was supposed to join. The new pattern allows all candidates to be tested on the same footing, he said, asserting that the board will “prove to the court that the change in pattern has not been done to fill the vacancies”.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that clinical practice was an important component for admission into super specialty courses. Due to this, many doctors practised in the super specialty stream to get admission into the course of their choice. Some even left their jobs and prepared for the examination for over a year. “This is the tragedy of our medical education,” the court said. “See how botched up our education system is. You first make them study for this super specialty course and after they have prepared for the examination of which 60% questions would come from their choice of discipline, you are privileging candidates who did general medicine at the cost of other super specialties. Have some concern for these doctors.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared in a fresh petition filed by post graduate doctors specializing in Oncology, said the largest number of seats going vacant were in private colleges. He also stressed that there was no consultation on changing the examination pattern before July 23. He further added that before 2018, when the existing pattern was introduced, 100% questions in NEET-SS test came from the specialty course opted for by the candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-the-hurry-heavens-won-t-fall-supreme-court-chides-centre-over-neetss-101633444754808.html
05-10-2021||India||‘If Opposition parties come together, BJP will lose power’: Lalu Prasad hits out at BJP, condemns Lakhimpur incident||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad claimed that if all opposition parties rally together then the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) can be defeated. “If Opposition parties come together, BJP will lose power,” the former Bihar chief minister told party workers in a video conference from Delhi on Tuesday.Lalu lamented the inability of the Congress and other political parties’ inability to forge successful alliances, attributing their failure to form a working government to this inability. “Congress and other political parties are unable to come together. We try to forge a political alternative again and again but fail due to some reasons, that is why they are ruling the country,” Lalu said.Lalu's comment comes after its former ally Congress reportedly snubbed the RJD and decided to field candidates for both bypolls to Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats on October 30, in spite of RJD wishing to contest from any one seat.The former RJD supremo who had to step down as the Bihar chief minister in 1997 due to the fodder scam has been in Delhi for treatment after he was granted bail by the Jharkhand high court in the Dumka Treasury case in April of this year."I will soon come to Bihar. Almost every day I keep asking my doctor where I can go. I suffer from a serious kidney problem and have been advised to keep my daily intake of water limited to one litre. But my health is improving and I look forward to being with you soon, " Prasad told party workers.Lalu's eldest son Tej Pratap Yadav had earlier alleged that he was being "held captive in Delhi and prevented from visiting Bihar", which was largely seen as an attack on his brother and heir apparent of Lalu's political legacy Tejashwi Yadav.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar hit out at Yadav earlier on Tuesday, downplaying reports of the latter’s plans to campaign for the bypolls. “It is up to him what he wants to do, whether he wants to address rallies or do anything else. He was working from the jail anyway," Kumar told reporters.Lalu strongly condemned the Lakhimpur Kheri incident during the video conference, reported PTI, adding that "the country is reeling under joblessness and soaring prices. But the BJP has no interest in resolving these problems. It has tasted blood, (munh khoon lag gaya hai) having come to power by pitting the followers of Ram and Rahim against each other."Lalu also predicted an early fall for the ruling Janata Dal (united)- BJP government in Bihar, and reaffirmed his party’s commitment to conducting caste based census, stating "We will fight and see to it that caste census is undertaken and policies are formulated taking population of different castes into account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-opposition-parties-come-together-bjp-will-lose-power-lalu-prasad-hits-out-at-bjp-condemns-lakhimpur-kheri-incident-101633442692297.html

PM Modi was in Lucknow to inaugurate ‘Azadi@75 – New Urban India: Transforming Urban Landscape’ Conference-cum-Expo. He also digitally handed over keys of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) houses to 75,000 beneficiaries in 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh.Addressing the event, PM Modi highlighted the increase in the number of houses constructed under the PM Awas Yojana, informing that over 1.13 crore housing units have been built in the cities and more than 50 lakh houses have already been handed over to the poor. Taking potshots at critics, PM Modi said that those who spend “their energy day and night opposing” the government will sharpen their attack after listening to his speech. He added that three crore urban poor families who earlier lived in slums have effectively become millionaires.“Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, about 3 crore houses have been built in the country, you can guess the cost of them. These people have become lakhpatis”, he said.The slew of inaugurations and announcements come ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and the BJP-led government is trying to retain power in India’s most populous state. Political analysts believe that the results of the UP polls could also set the tone of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections since the state represents 80 Lok Sabha constituencies.“Our government has made a very serious effort to overcome the problems and challenges of the urban middle class. Real Estate Regulatory Authority i.e. RERA Act has been such a big step. This law has helped in getting the entire housing sector out of mistrust and fraud,” PM Modi told the gathering.“Urban bodies are also saving about ₹1 thousand crore every year by installing LED street lights,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-3-crore-poor-families-became-lakhpati-under-modi-govt-pm-explains-during-lucknow-visit-101633443699150.html

The company has, however, not released details of the study or submitted it for a peer-review.Zydus Cadila had started testing a two-dose regime of the vaccine with 3 milligrams in each dose soon after being granted an EUA.All vaccines go through three phases of trials, in the first phase the vaccine is given to a small number of people to test safety and dosage, and to see if it triggers an immune response, in the second phase the vaccine is tested in different groups such as children, the elderly et al to see if it affects people differently, and in the third phase the vaccine is tested in thousands of people to check how many are infected with the virus in comparison to the placebo group. The second phase tests the safety of the vaccine while the third tests the efficacy rate of a vaccine.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mentioned India was producing the world’s first DNA vaccine while addressing the 76th United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 25. “I want to inform UNGA that India has developed the world's first DNA vaccine, which can be administered to all people above the age of 12 years," he said.The Ahmedabad-based healthcare manufacturer expects a roll-out of its three dose regime from October but pricing of the vaccine has remained an issue. The company is said to have proposed a price of ₹1,900 for its three-dose jab, but the Union government is negotiating for a reduction in price, and a decision on the same is likely to be taken later this week, news agency PTI reported on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-gets-dgci-nod-for-phase-iii-trial-of-two-dose-covid-19-vaccine-101633436206084.html

05-10-2021||India||BJP to focus on delinking agitation from farm issues||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has redoubled efforts to distance the farmer protests from the farm issues ahead of elections in states such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, where the demand from a section of farmers’ for repealing the farm laws enacted last year has dominated the discourse and is expected to sway the electoral outcome.Functionaries aware of the matter said the BJP leadership has explicitly instructed the cadre to reinforce that the ongoing farm protests are “motivated” and an attempt to “destabilise” the country. The party has consistently tried to attribute the opposition to the three farm laws to “provocation” by politically motivated groups. It has alleged the protestors, who have been camping near the Delhi borders since December last year, have been “infiltrated by anti-national elements.”BJP general secretary Dushyant Gautam last year cited alleged pro-Pakistan and pro-Khalistan slogans shouted at a protest site as examples of the agitation having been “hijacked by terrorists and anti-national forces”. Similar sentiments have been expressed by other BJP leaders at various public events.After Sunday’s violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri during a protest by farmers that left eight dead, BJP’s national secretary Y Satya Kumar tweeted, “…The manner in which the goons posing as so-called farmers are carrying out violent agitations in Uttar Pradesh, seems to be not a coincidence but a well-planned experiment. Jihadi and Khalistani chaotic elements want to spread unrest in the state.”BJP leaders in Delhi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, asserted Sunday’s violence was an indication of farmers being used “as surrogates” by those who “want to destabilise the nation.”“The government has held 11 rounds of meetings with the farmers and tried to address their concerns. However, a section of the so-called farmers has been protesting and creating a false narrative about the laws. The protests are limited to Punjab, parts of Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Sunday’s violence is a conspiracy by those who want to create trouble,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity.Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni has been in the eye of the storm after farmers alleged that his son’s car mowed down some cultivators protesting against the laws and triggered the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. Teni has also demanded a probe into the violence. In a statement, the minister said his son was not involved and blamed farmers for stoking violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. He called the incident a conspiracy and said that some “miscreants” from among the agitating farmers started throwing stones and injured the driver, causing the car to lose its balance.The opposition has demanded Teni’s dismissal. Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who was detained by the police in Lucknow on Monday as he sat on a protest outside his residence after being stopped from going to Lakhimpur Kheri, has demanded the resignation of Teni. Yadav said atrocities on farmers have exceeded what happened during the British rule. The Congress too has criticised the government for Sunday’s violence.BJP’s Uttar Pradesh spokesperson Chandra Mohan blamed the opposition for provoking the farmers. “When one examines the events that led to the farmers’ protest, it becomes clear that this is a political conspiracy. Our government has been sensitive to the concerns of farmers. We have cleared the dues pending for years, increased the price of sugarcane among several other measures. But the opposition is misleading the farmers and using them.”Also Read: Petition filed in SC seeking CBI probe in Lakhimpur Kheri violenceNot all in the BJP see the agitation as motivated. A few lawmakers from Uttar Pradesh, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government needs to make more efforts to break the logjam with the farmers. “The use of force against farmers will have far-reaching consequences…the government has to be sympathetic to the farmers,” said a lawmaker.Varun Gandhi, the BJP Member of Parliament from Pilibhit, has demanded action against the perpetrators of Sunday’s violence. He cautioned against using “derogatory and pejorative terms” for farmers. In an interview with HT, he said: “…The farmers need to feel that they are equal stakeholders in the government, in shaping the national agenda and in setting the narrative on issues that concern them. Today, if they feel they are not equal stakeholders, then we must work doubly hard to reinvigorate this relationship.”The BJP is also banking on the Uttar Pradesh government’s announcement that it would pay ₹45 lakh and offer a government job each to the kin of the eight people who lost their lives in Sunday’s violence to prevent the situation on the ground from worsening.Ajay Gudavarthi, a political science professor at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the tendency to dub all opposition as anti-national may not work for the party anymore. “There is a core constituency that will buy the anti-national justification, but a larger group of people have now begun to see through the pattern of labelling anyone who opposes the BJP as anti-national.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-focus-on-delinking-agitation-from-farm-issues-101633432334614.html

India is the second-largest troop contributor to the 18,300-strong peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, having provided nearly 2,400 soldiers.The civilian, police and military personnel from 73 countries serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) are responsible for protecting civilians, creating conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian aid, supporting the implementation of a revitalised peace agreement, and monitoring and investigating human rights.UNMISS force commander, Lt Gen Shailesh Tinaikar of the Indian Army, lauded the Indian battalion for successfully completing its tour of duty.“When all of you arrived in Upper Nile state, it was a time of great flux,” he said at the event where the troops were awarded the medal. “You had to assume operational responsibility immediately with the threat of imminent inter-communal clashes looming over you. Your presence and patrolling acted as a much-needed deterrent at the time, enabling civilians to go about their daily lives without fear,” he said. Tinaikar also lauded the Indian peacekeepers for rescuing and sheltering 32 humanitarian colleagues at Renk and ensuring their safe evacuation to the country’s capital, Juba. Vishnu Sharma, India’s ambassador to South Sudan, was the guest of honour at the medal parade. “Your courage, commitment and sacrifice to the cause of durable peace in South Sudan is a beacon of hope for the communities you are on the ground to serve. You have done the United Nations and your country very proud,” he said.Sharma noted the contributions of Indian veterinarians who treated thousands of animals and built capacities among livestock owners on animal management, boosting their economic stability.Christian Mikala, the acting head of the UNMISS field office in Malakal, acknowledged the peacekeepers’ engagements with local communities.“You have been instrumental in extensive patrolling in your area of responsibilities and have built a relationship of trust and confidence with communities across Upper Nile,” he said. Col Neeraj Tiwari, the commander of the Indian battalion, said the troops had gone the extra mile for the communities they were serving. “We wish the South Sudanese the very best as they progress in building a sustainable peace from the grassroots to the very highest levels of society,” he added. Tinaikar was appointed the force commander of UNMISS by UN Secretary-General António Guterres in May 2019. Tinaikar earlier served as commandant of the Infantry School since July 2018, and as the additional director general of military operations at Army Headquarters during 2017-18. He also served in the UN Angola Verification Mission III during 1996-97and in the UN Mission in Sudan during 2008-09.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/836-indian-troops-in-peacekeeping-mission-in-south-sudan-awarded-un-medal-101633431460298.html

The move comes after the Delhi high court on September 27 allowed the government to stop supplying food grains to fair price shops (FPS) for those who have chosen doorstep delivery over the physical collection. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh took note of submission by the Aam Aadmi Party government that supplies being made under the existing public distribution scheme will have to be curtailed so that food grains could be distributed door-to-door for those who want it.Since the government said that “an overwhelming majority has opted for the supply of rations at their doorstep”, the bench said authorities could supply only such quantities of ration to FPS that are required for those who want to collect it from shops. The rest can be held back by the government for door-to-door delivery, it added.Nearly 7.2 million people in Delhi are eligible for subsidised food. They include 1.7 million ration card holders and nearly 3 million priority households.

The Centre also said that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi Cabinet on March 24 decided to change the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFSA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-sends-file-on-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-to-l-g-for-approval-101633429093924.html

05-10-2021||India||Pawar likens Lakhimpur Kheri violence to Jallianwala Bagh massacre||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led governments in Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre for “misuse of power” over the violence that erupted in Lakhimpur Kheri during a farmer protest and left eight people dead. He demanded a probe by a Supreme Court judge into the violence while likening it to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during India’s freedom movement. Pawar assured the farmers that they are not alone, and the opposition is with them.“Our country gives the right to protest. Accordingly, farmers gathered at Lakhimpur Kheri and were holding a silent protest. At that time, people related to those who are in government--be it Uttar Pradesh or at the Centre tried to suppress their voice and were mowed down by a jeep which led to the loss of lives of six to eight farmers. Those who are in the BJP government at Centre and in Uttar Pradesh are responsible for this act.” Pawar’s comments came a day after Ashish Mishra, the son of India’s junior home minister, Ajay Mishra Teni, was booked for murder and criminal conspiracy in connection with the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. The farmers have claimed Ashish Mishra mowed down four cultivators with his SUV during the protest on Sunday and triggered the violence.Also Read: Families of 2 Lakhimpur farmers stop funerals, demand post-mortem reportAshish Mishra denied the charges, saying he was not in the car. He blamed the farmers for torching vehicles and thrashing other people to death, including the car’s driver and two BJP workers. A local journalist also died in the violence. Four of eight, who died in the violence, were farmers. It was the bloodiest clash since protests against three Central laws erupted last year.Pawar said he has heard the UP government was ready to get the incident probed by a retired judge. “But I want the investigation to be conducted by a sitting Supreme Court judge and allow the truth to come out.” Pawar said the Uttar Pradesh government has created a situation similar to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and it will have to pay its price one day. He added the attack on farmers protesting silently “shows the intention of the BJP- led central government”. “I want to tell them (BJP), today you are in the government and are trying to muzzle farmers’ voices by misusing power. But you will not succeed. You will get a befitting response not only from the farmers in Uttar Pradesh but from the entire country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-likens-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-to-jallianwala-bagh-massacre-101633425853682.html

His wife Bidya Bharati, who was present in the next room, has been named as one of the accused along with the divisional forest officer (DFO) Sangram Behera. Mohapatra, an Odisha Forest Service officer of 2020 batch, was rushed to MKCG Medical College and hospital in Berhampur town from where he was shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital of Cuttack. He succumbed to his burn injuries on July 13.Now his father Abhiram Mohapatra has alleged that neither Odisha Police nor the Crime Investigation Department (CID) can deliver justice in his son’s death case and has made top police officers of the state, CBI director and state home secretary parties in his petition.Abhiram alleged that CID made no efforts to arrest daughter-in-law Bidya Bharati, Gajapati DFO Sangram Keshari Behera and cook Manmatha Kumbha despite they being accused in the FIR. “A video has surfaced which shows on the day of the incident, inspector Bibekananda Swain and officer-in-charge Mamatarani Panda were collecting some articles from my son’s residential quarters. What have they been investigating for the last 81 days? We suspect the role of Odisha Police. ... So, therefore, we are applying to the high court for a CBI enquiry,” he said.Also Read: Odisha govt will provide free medical, engineering coaching to SC, ST students Abhiram had alleged in the FIR that DFO Sangram Keshari Behera had an illicit relationship with his son’s wife Bidya Bharati. He now says that the investigating agencies have been suppressing several facts regarding his son’s “pre-meditated killing”.After the then Gajapati police chief Tapan Patnaik gave a clean chit to DFO, the probe was handed over to CID on August 14.

The results have been a major setback for Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that won two and one seats respectively.BJP and Congress had fielded their candidates on all 44 seats while the AAP contested from 40 seats. The GMC recorded a voting percentage of 56.24% out of 2.8 lakh registered voters.In the previous Gandhinagar municipal corporation elections, Congress gave a tough fight to the BJP as both parties bagged 16 seats each. However, a surprise defection from Congress councillor Pravin Patel and his aide helped BJP form the body in the corporation, with Patel becoming the mayor of Gujarat's capital city.After the AAP won 27 out of 120 contested seats in the Surat municipal corporation election held earlier this year, all eyes were on the new entrant. The AAP's vote share in the GMC elections stands at nearly 17% but the three-pronged contest seems to have worked against Congress.Apart from GMC, three other municipalities - Okha, Bhanvad, and Thara - went to the polls on Sunday.The voter turnout in Okha and Bhanvad (both in Devbhumi-Dwarka district) was 55.07% and 62.27% respectively, while Thara (Banaskantha district) recorded 73.55% voter turnout.The local body elections were earlier scheduled for April but the disastrous second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic forced the state election commission to postpone them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhinagar-municipal-corporation-election-result-bjp-wins-41-out-of-44-seats-101633423505696.html

Not even 18 houses were constructed against a sanction of 18,000, he said. Also read | 'Why is this man free?'

It may not be a man-eater tiger,” the Madras High Court told the forest department, which is making efforts to capture the big cat identified as Mudumalai Division Tiger-23 or MDT-23, according to news agency ANI. The court also said there are only a few tigers left in our country as it was hearing two petitions challenging the forest department’s order to hunt down the big cat.According to news agency PTI, one petition has been filed by Uttar Pradesh-based animal activist Sangeeta Dogra and another by the People for Cattle in India in Chennai. Meanwhile, the forest department clarified that their task was to capture the injured male tiger alive and not to kill it. Last Friday, Tamil Nadu chief wildlife warden Shekar Kumar Niraj issued an order to hunt the tiger under Section 11 (1) (a) of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The tiger has not been declared as a man-eater but as “problematic” and as an animal that has “become very dangerous to human life in the area”. The tiger has been present in the human habitation of Gudalur and has been preying on livestock too since July this year. According to the standard operating procedures for dealing with emergency arising due to straying of tigers in human-dominated landscapes laid out by the National Tiger Conservation Authority in January 2013, these declarations require field evidence.Also read | Plan to catch Mudhumalai tiger alive even as it evades trapsThe forest department continued their search for the tiger said to be over 12-years-of age in the Masinagudi area for the 10th day on Monday.

As many as 120 personnel from the forest department and special task forces from Kerala and Karnataka are also part of the search.

05-10-2021||India||Sena questions Modi’s silence over Lakhimpur violence||Two days after eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the violence that erupted during protests in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh (UP), the Shiv Sena on Tuesday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over the issue. Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at the latter’s residence in New Delhi over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Before meeting Gandhi, Raut said there is a need for a “joint Opposition action against the oppression by the government in UP.” This is Raut’s second one-on-one meeting with Gandhi in around three months. The meeting between the two leaders lasted around 20 minutes. Raut refused to divulge the details of the discussion between him and Gandhi. Afte the meeting, Raut said, “We discussed the political developments in the country. Let things remain between us and our two parties.” Taking on the Centre, Raut questioned if there are any democratic values left in the nation.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana remarked that PM is a “very sensitive and emotional person” but it was “surprising” that he has not expressed condolences to the family of the victims of the violence.“Our dear PM Narendra Modi is a very sensitive and emotional person. There have been many occasions when PM was seen getting emotional over the issues of the poor. It is surprising that the sensitive Modi has not expressed his condolences to the farmers who were crushed to death in the incident,” the editorial said.The editorial also slammed the UP government over sealing the district borders and not allowing Opposition leaders to enter Lakhimpur Kheri. Earlier in the day, Raut called the development in the past two days as an “undeclared emergency”, asking why is the UP government scared if Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Gandhi or other Opposition leaders want to meet the families of the dead farmers.“The manner in which Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the granddaughter of Indira Gandhi, was arrested and manhandled is shameful. You may have differences with the Congress but Indira Gandhi gave the biggest sacrifice [for the country], she divided Pakistan in two parts. This incident needs to be condemned. There is an undeclared emergency in the country now. It has come silently to muzzle our voices,” Raut said while speaking to mediapersons in the national capital.Also Read: Lakhimpur Kheri: The cauldron boils overDrawing parallels to BJP leaders in Maharashtra touring flood-affected parts to “wipe the tears” of the affected farmers, Raut asked why is UP government scared if Opposition party leaders want to meet families of the dead farmers. “In Maharashtra, BJP leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar are wiping tears of farmers and giving ultimatum to the state government. In a democracy, the voice of Opposition party cannot be suppressed. They must get a chance to speak what they wish to and it must be heard. But what’s happening in UP? If Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Rahul Gandhi, (Samajadwadi Party’s) Akhilesh Yadav and Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh are going to meet family members of the dead farmers why is the government scared?” he asked. The state BJP had not reacted to the remarks in Saamana or on Raut’s statements till the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sena-questions-modi-s-silence-over-lakhimpur-violence-101633421233492.html
05-10-2021||India||Indian power plants on alert for outages. Here's why||The worsening squeeze on India’s coal supply is triggering a power crisis that’s threatening to stall the world’s fastest-expanding major economy.Coal-fired power stations had an average of four days’ worth of stock of the fuel at the end of last month, the lowest level in years, and down from 13 days at the start of August. More than half the plants are on alert for outages. With coal used to produce almost 70% of electricity, spot power rates have surged, while supplies of the fuel are being diverted away from key customers including aluminum smelters and steel mills.Like China, India is contending with two key challenges: soaring electricity demand as industrial activity rebounds after pandemic curbs were lifted and a slump in local coal output. The country meets around three-quarters of its demand locally, but heavy rains have flooded mines and key transport routes.Operators of coal-fired plants are facing a dilemma -- pay large premiums at domestic auctions to secure any available local supply or wade into a seaborne coal market where prices have soared to the highest on record. Already, the nation’s government is drawing up guidelines in case it needs to bring idle power stations back into action.“Until supplies stabilize completely, we are likely to see power outages in some pockets, while customers elsewhere may be asked to pay more for power,” said Pranav Master, director for infrastructure advisory at credit ratings firm Crisil Ltd. “Because of imported coal prices shooting through the roof, plants running on domestic coal have had to do a lot of heavy-lifting. Things are expected to get better as the rains abate.” The impact on consumer prices would show up a few months later, when distribution utilities get regulatory approvals to pass on the cost, he said.Coal inventories at Indian power plants fell to around 8.1 million tons at the end of September, about 76% less than a year earlier, according to government data. Average spot power prices at the Indian Energy Exchange Ltd. jumped more than 63% in September to 4.4 rupees ($0.06) a kilowatt hour. Aluminum producers are among major power users that complained after state-run miner Coal India Ltd. curbed supplies of the fuel to heavy industry to prioritize deliveries to electricity generators. The rising electricity bills are likely to put a dent in India’s stellar growth rate. The economy is forecast to expand 9.4% in the year through March 2022, which would be the fastest pace among major global economies, according to a Bloomberg News survey.The energy crunch is a reminder of the vital role coal plays in India’s economy, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi targets a huge increase in renewables and the nation’s top billionaires rush to add green investments. Consumption of the fuel is forecast to increase in the next few years and India, among the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters, is yet to set a target to get to carbon neutrality. Supplies to power plants are currently short by between 60,000 and 80,000 tons a day on the impact of the prolonged rains that have drenched coal pits, said Anil Kumar Jain, India’s coal secretary. Unusually heavy downpours last month in Dhanbad, a major coal mining center in the east of the country, have worsened the situation, he said. Coal India should be able to increase supplies enough by the second week of October to cover the deficit at power plants, although that will depend on the weather, Jain said. However, it will take much longer to replenish the badly depleted stockpiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-power-plants-on-alert-for-outages-here-s-why-101633418317240.html
05-10-2021||India||Shakti Sinha: The liberal who found home in Vajpayee’s BJP||Shakti Sinha was a political liberal. He believed that the State must be restrained in its use of power; individuals must be free to choose their life partners, eating habits, political parties, and friends and that social liberalism was an integral part of a civilised society; that markets must be encouraged and the government should largely be a facilitator and regulator and provide a helping hand to those on the margins; and that religion should not be a key determinant of any decision of the State.Shakti Sinha was also a foreign policy realist. He had a clear-eyed view of Pakistan and China as India’s adversaries — the first because of the very nature of its statehood, the second because of the structural nature of great power competition. But he was also a pragmatist, who believed in the power of engagement. So be it talking to the Nepali Maoists when sections of Indian establishment were reluctant to do so, or engaging with the Taliban when it became clear that Afghanistan would eventually fall into their hands, Sinha believed that the Indian State must do what it had to do to secure India’s national interest — ideology was secondary.And, perhaps most importantly, Shakti Sinha was a deeply democratic man in his everyday personal interactions. He did not grudge someone for sharply differing with him in political beliefs. He barely expressed resentment even when he felt like he had been dealt an unfair hand. He lived in proximity to power, but his instinct was to spend time with those on the margins of power — because he wanted to understand all points of view before arriving at his own. He understood viewpoints were a result of socialisation, beliefs, and life — and he respected it. He was also deeply humble, and this reflected most deeply in his respect for scholarship — he kept feeling, till he wrote his book, that he was a pretender who did not have a book to his credit and therefore was a bit of a lesser man.So how was such a man — who grew up in the diverse and plural environment of the Darjeeling hills, who studied in a missionary school in Patna and admired his Christian teachers (he never saw them as Christian, just as his teachers — Father Murphy of St Xaviers’ Patna remained his favourite teacher), who went to Hindu College in Delhi University in the 1970s at a time when young students pushed the boundaries of what was permissible, and who enjoyed both his meat and evening drink (he was partial to whiskey) — sympathetic to the Bharatiya Janata Party?In his story lies a clue into why a generation of India’s social liberals moved to the Right in the 1980s and 1990s. Sinha detested the Congress, especially the dynastic nature of the party. He grew sympathetic to the identity-based mobilisation of the majority as a natural byproduct of distortions in the politics of secularism. And having been a part of the State, he knew that the only way out for India’s prosperity was not a greater role for the State but reducing its discretionary powers. And in his case — like in the case of so many political individuals, whose choices are often personal and sociological as much as ideological; analysts often underestimate this factor when they seek to understand politics — the link to a leader changed his life and politics.Sinha knew Atal Bihari Vajpayee intimately. His wife was a relative of Vajpayee’s foster family. He met the man who would become India’s first prime minister from a non-Congress political tradition in the 1970s, and eventually, through a career in the bureaucracy, landed up in Vajpayee’s prime minister’s office, as the first and last man Vajpayee would see in the day through much of the mid 1990s — during his 13-day tenure in 1996, his stint as leader of opposition between 1996 and 1998, and then during the critical 1998-99 years when India went nuclear, embarked on ambitious reforms, and fought and defeated Pakistan in Kargil.Also Read: The Mahatma and his economic worldviewAnd this is why Sinha merits understanding, for his understanding and worldview ended up shaping Vajpyayee’s prime ministership. The modest and understated man that he was, Shakti Sinha would never admit it — but in the silent lunches he had with Vajpayee (the two often ate quietly without a word exchanged), in his everyday interactions, in who he allowed Atalji to meet, in how he discussed books and ideas, in how he interacted with other colleagues, Sinha shaped the worldview of one of India’s most consequential prime ministers. And this worldview, rooted in a controversial certain view of Indian civilisation — Sinha always said that New Delhi mistook Vajpayee; there was never any doubt of his commitment to Hindutva — he shaped a world of power.The specifics of Vajpayee’s prime ministership are best captured in Sinha’s book — and it is such good news that Sinha was able to actually pen his memories. Sinha went on to become a World Bank bureaucrat in Washington DC, a leading bureaucrat in Delhi government as a part of his administrative career, head of Nehru Memorial and Museum Library, an academic heading an important centre at MS University in Baroda, and an intellectual-at-large (including as an occasional columnist with HT). But he never forgot his roots, his liberalism, his commitment to India, and his loyalty to a worldview he had owned.I cannot but end this on a personal note. Shakti Sinha organised the launch of my book on BJP — in which, on his platform, I criticised what I saw as the party’s bigotry. He called me later that evening and laughed, saying, “Kahan phasa diya yar! Acha tha par. Where did you trap me! But it was good. My aim is to make NMML a truly liberal space.” Or when we went for a drink to Kathmandu’s most hip area, Thamel, when he narrated stories about the intricacies of running a prime minister’s office. There are too many anecdotes to narrate, there are too many secrets to keep, there are too many tales that only Shaktiji had a right to tell, but Indian politics, public life, scholarship is a lot richer because of a man who believed that his most important contribution was being a silent adviser — silent being the operative word — foil to one of India’s most important PMs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shakti-sinha-the-liberal-who-found-home-in-vajpayee-s-bjp-101633420333520.html

The commission gave the name Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and the election symbol of a helicopter to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) faction led by Chirag Paswan. The ECI also allotted the name Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party and the election symbol of a sewing machine to the faction of the LJP led by Union minister Pashupati Nath Paras.The commission asked both the factions to choose three free symbols in order of preference before 1pm on October 4 and said it will then allocate the symbols to each faction.Both factions of the LJP have been feuding for the control of the party since the beginning of this year. Chirag, the son of late party supremo Ram Vilas Paswan, was ousted from the party by his uncle Paras, who claimed that the outfit was now run by him. Paras, with the help of Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser, ousted Chirag from the position of party chief. Paras also met with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, who recognised him as the party chief.The ECI froze the party name and symbol earlier this month in view of the bypolls in Bihar’s Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur, scheduled for October 30. The poll paneI informed both factions that they will not be allowed to use the party name unconditionally, nor can they use LJP’s election symbol of a bungalow. Both factions claimed the exclusive use of the party name LJP and the symbol. Paswan said earlier that he was ready to adopt legal means in order to regain control of the party.“Neither of the two groups led by Pashupati Kumar Paras and [the] other led by Chirag Paswan shall be permitted to use the name of the party Lok Janshakti Party and neither of the two groups shall also be permitted to use the symbol bungalow,” the commission said in its order on October 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-issues-new-names-symbols-to-ljp-factions-amid-chirag-paswan-paras-feud-101633418842689.html

05-10-2021||India||What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri: Sequence of events according to both sides||The violence in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri has opposition parties up in arms. They have been attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the state and at the Centre, demanding justice for the farmers who were killed during Sunday's violence.The farmers claim that a a car from convoy belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish ran over the protesters in Tikonia area who were coming back after holding a demonstration against Centre's three farm laws. The minister has denied these allegations and instead claimed that the protesters started pelting stones due to which the driver of the car lost balance and this incident happened.Here is the sequence of events and the two versions of the incident:8am: Around 300 farmers reach Tikonia, a village in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district roughly 70km from the district headquarters, to protest against a visit bydeputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.10am: Protesters said they entered the local playground and attempted to take over the helipad. They claimed that Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni, was present at the spot.Ashish, however, said he was not present at the site of the incident and was attending another event in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri town, roughly 100km away.2.30pm: Protesters claimed that a convoy of three SUVs linked to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders made their way from Lakhimpur to Tikonia. The farmers say that an SUV being driven by Ashish Mishra knocked down four protesters.Union minister Ajay Mishra said his son was nowhere near the site of the incident. He said that farmers started pelting stones at the cars, one of which hit a driver and he lost control of the car, and it overturned.4pm: Violence erupted in Tikonia by this time. Farmers said that supporters of Ashish Mishra shot dead one person. They claimed that the others were mowed down by SUVs in Ashish Mishra's cavalcade.Ajay Mishra, however, denied all charges and said his son was not present at the spot. "Neither I nor my son was present at the spot when the violence broke out. Our car was diverted to a different route," he told reporters.Eight people were killed in the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. Protests began after that, following which the state government started negotiations with the farmers. The two sides reached a conclusion after the government agreed to listen to all the demands of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-happened-in-lakhimpur-kheri-sequence-of-events-according-to-both-sides-101633416583402.html

Priyanka Gandhi was on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the families of those killed in violence during a farmer protest on Sunday when she was put under detention.Kapil Sibal, who is among the leaders of the grouping, called the detention illegal while calling lawlessness a norm in Uttar Pradesh. In a tweet, he added there is a perception that “in such situations violation of personal liberty is guaranteed” in the state. “Instead of prosecuting those responsible, you detain those who seek justice.”Sibal’s house was vandalised last week after he demanded an open dialogue in Congress. The vandalism sparked criticism from senior Congress leaders.In a statement, Anand Sharma, who is a part of the grouping, condemned Priyanka Gandhi’s detention and “repressive manhandling”. “Such repressive actions cannot suppress the voice of farmers and call for justice...Justice must prevail.”Also Read: ‘Why this man is free?’ Priyanka Gandhi poses question for PM Modi on LakhimpurIn a tweet, Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was among the signatories of the letter to Sonia Gandhi last year, said, “I strongly condemn the high handedness of UP (Uttar Pradesh) police by stopping Mrs Priyanka Gandhi on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri to pay condolences to the family members of kisans (farmers) killed. A judicial probe should be conducted to find out the truth behind the incident in which kisans were killed.”Congress Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor said the video of Priyanka Gandhi and Deepender Hooda standing up to police intimidation “stirs the blood”.

05-10-2021||India||Video showing cars running over farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri goes viral||A video purportedly showing two vehicles, including a sports utility vehicle (SUV), running over a group of people at Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri, the scene of the violence during a farmer protest that left eight people dead on Sunday, has gone viral with farmers saying it has vindicated their version of the incident. The vehicles that follow can be seen passing blithely on. The source and the veracity of the video could not be ascertained. But the visuals are in sync with the version of the protesting farmers about the incident even as the identity of the individuals in the vehicles is unclear.One version of the incident is that the vehicles came under attack and lost control. Nothing of that sort can be seen in the video. The lead vehicle appears to deliberately run over the farmers — and from behind. To be sure, the video is only 29-second-long and is playing on a smartphone. The exact spot in the video appears to be of Tikunia road leading towards Lakhimpur and around 100 metres from the playground where the farmers were staging the protest on the day of the incident.If authentic, the video is likely to inflame sentiments against the Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni and his son Ashish Mishra. Farmers maintain that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles and escaped even as others were allegedly lynched by farmers after the incident. The minister and his son, who was on Monday booked for murder and criminal conspiracy in connection with the violence, have denied the allegations.Hardeep Singh, who was at the spot at the time of the incident and has seen this video, said: “The video confirms what we have been saying all along. And we say that Ashish Mishra was present in one of the vehicles and is responsible for the killing of the innocent farmers.”Also Read: ‘Why this man is free?’ Priyanka Gandhi poses question for PM Modi on LakhimpurIn a tweet addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said she has been kept under detention without any order or first information and asked why the one who “crushed” the farmers was still not arrested.

The health department on Monday launched an intensive three-day state-wide programme between October 4 and 6 and on October 8, 9 and 11 with polio supervisors tasked to lead vaccination teams in their areas. The polio supervisors, who are generally auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), had also undertaken a house-to-house survey on extent of Covid vaccinations during the pulse polio drive in the state between September 26 and October 1. “Their reporting format, during the recently culminated pulse polio campaign, had an additional column on eligible people in a household due for their second dose of Covid vaccine or still to take their first jab. The polio supervisors have marked all such households in their respective area,” said an officer privy to the programme. “Besides, they are familiar with almost all family members residing in households in their area, as they reach out to every nook and cranny of a village to administer polio drops to children as part of the recurring polio eradication campaign. They are now expected to know the households and the exact number of occupants who are reluctant to take the Covid jab,” he added. As part of the strategy, the polio supervisors will give names of all such adults to the accredited social health activists (ASHA) and anganwadi sahayika (workers), who will then persuade them to come to the Covid vaccination sites for the jab, the officer added.

Bihar administered over 3.040 million doses of Covid vaccine on October 2. It revised its day’s provisional figures of 27,96,173 doses after some data were uploaded on the CoWIN portal past midnight. Bihar has administered over 57.5 million Covid shots to beneficiaries including 45.2 million first doses and 12.3 million second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/polio-supervisors-identify-people-reluctant-to-get-vaccine-jab-in-bihar-101633407912680.html

Officials say the body has drawn lessons from the last five assembly elections held in March and April when the second wave of the pandemic peaked.“The commission reviewed the extant guidelines implemented in the last round of elections, post which it undertook a review to see the lacunae in planning,” said an EC official familiar with the matter. “As a result, the commission has decided to further restrict campaigning and place a permanent ban on violators.” The commission was severely criticised during the last round of assembly elections held in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry for not doing much to ensure election related activities didn’t lead to a spike in Covid cases. The Madras high court even went so far as to orally observe that EC officials should be held liable for “murder” after largely unregulated electioneering was widely seen as a major contributor to the second Covid wave.ECI on Tuesday announced by polls to three Lok Sabha and 30 assembly seats on October 30, saying the schedule was finalised after reviewing the pandemic situation, floods, festivals, cold conditions in certain regions and feedback from local authorities. The Lok Sabha by-polls will be held to one seat each in the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Madhya Pradesh (Khandwa) and Himachal Pradesh (Mandi). Assembly by-elections will be held to one constituency each in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Mizoram, Maharashtra, Nagaland, and Telangana; two each in Karnataka, Bihar, and Rajasthan; three each in Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Madhya Pradesh; four in West Bengal; and five in Assam.The commission, led by Sushil Chandra and comprising Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, has reduced the maximum permitted attendance for political events at indoor venues to 200 as long as it is less than 30% of the full capacity. For outdoor campaigns, the limit is set at 50% of the venue’s capacity but not more than 1000 attendees for events featuring star campaigners and at 500 attendees for all others. Earlier, the commission had decided to allow 50% attendance at outdoor meeting points and had to cap it at 500 after the number of infections in West Bengal increased manifold in April. “In either case, the allowed number is whichever is less. The entire area will be cordoned off and guarded by the police. The count of people entering the ground will be monitored. Expenditure for cordoning/barricading will be borne by the candidate or the political party. Only those grounds which are cordoned or barricaded completely will be used for rallies,” the commission said. The poll body has further reduced the number of star campaigners allowed for registered political parties to 20 from 30 for the upcoming by polls. Also Read: Tripura BJP MLA calls Mamata Oppn’s face for 2024 polls; BJP says he’s confusedIt has warned that candidates and campaigners may be banned permanently in case of violations. “If a candidate or political party violates any of the above guidelines, no more permission shall be given to the concerned candidate/party for rallies, meetings etc. If any star campaigner violates the Covid protocols, he shall not be allowed to campaign further in that constituency/district,” the notification states. The poll body has been requested by the Bharatiya Janata Party in Telangana to relax the guidelines and allow candidates to better interact with the electorate. “The entire country to trying to avoid a third wave in this pandemic, the commission has taken steps in keeping with that ethos,” said an official, aware of the developments. Telangana BJP party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s office declined to comment on the matter. Himachal Pradesh Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore appreciated the measures announced by the commission and called for its strict implementation, especially if those in power violated the guidelines. “There is an apprehension that there may be a third wave,” he said. “We definitely will adhere to all guidelines. But those in power must also adhere to them, the commission must ensure this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-tightens-campaigning-rules-after-review-of-last-5-assembly-polls-101633403172240.html

That, which is so easy to understand, and that which doesn’t require too many interpreters,” she said. A CS should make things so simple and easier for the company that it would be “tempting” to comply, she added.Sitharaman said Prime Minister Modi has been very clear about ease of doing business from 2014, and also before, when he was in Gujarat. “The attempt is to make it easy, make it simple for law abiding wealth-creators to do their business and to prosper,” she said.She said “well managed companies” which are more transparent in their functioning, and have good governance principles, are attracting investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-easing-compliance-burden-for-biz-fm-101633398574584.html

An expert panel of the global health body is meeting on Tuesday, October 5, to decide on, among other things, Bharat Biotech's Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin getting the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) authorisation, according to documents detailing the committee's agenda for the meeting and the assessment status of pending applications for vaccine candidates. Top health experts say the approval of the vaccine shouldn't be delayed after reviewing the data this month.Also Read | WHO's nod for Covaxin delayed again over technical queries: ReportsThe Strategic Advisory Group of Expert on Immunization (SAGE) will be conducting a meeting on Tuesday regarding the EUL to Covaxin. The expert panel started its four-day meet on October 4 to decide on policy guidance. This is especially important in light of the fact that all vaccine dossiers submitted to the WHO must go through both SAGE and a technical advisory group, which is also meeting this month, for EUL or pre-qualification.So far, the World Health Organization has only included six Covid-19 vaccine candidates in its EUL. These are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine—which is being manufactured as Covishieldby the Serum Institute of India—the Moderna jab and the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.According to reports, the EUL is a risk-based procedure that considers each unlicensed vaccine for assessment and listing. The process also includes therapeutics and in-vitro diagnostics to expedite vaccine availability to people affected by a certain public health emergency. If Covaxin is included in this list, India's indigenously-developed Covid-19 vaccine will expectedly gain a wider global acceptance.Also Read | Court seeks Centre’s stand on cancer patient’s plea to take Covaxin as 2nd dose“Globally, the world is in need of vaccines and we have to ensure that this is a global war, and many countries are still not getting vaccinated,” Dr Naveet Wig, chairperson of the Covid-19 task force at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, told the ANI news agency. “So we have to ensure that our vaccines should get the approval timely.”Last Friday, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said that the delay in Covaxin receiving EUL from the WHO would translate to more inconvenience for Indians, especially students, who have international travel plans. “The EUA is important because, without it, Covaxin will not be considered and accepted around the world by most of the countries,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-expert-panel-on-covid-19-vaccines-to-meet-today-covaxin-on-agenda-101633392437410.html

05-10-2021||India||Tripura BJP MLA calls Mamata Oppn’s face for 2024 polls; BJP says he’s confused||AGARTALA: On a visit to West Bengal for the last two days, Tripura’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ashish Das on Monday showered praises on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who, he said, has become the face of the opposition for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after her emphatic win from Bhabanipur.Ashish Das, who is known to have been a critic of Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb back home in Agartala, visited the Trinamool Congress (TMC) office in Kolkata on Saturday triggering speculation that he might be on his way out of the BJP.The BJP MLA’s visit to Kolkata was earlier described by his party leaders as a personal trip.Asked on Tuesday whether he is joining TMC, Das said that he cannot clarify anything till he completes some rituals at Kalighat on Tuesday.“Mamata Banerjee has been a choice of many people for the post of Prime Minister. We have not seen any Bengali become Prime Minister till now,” Ashish Das told reporters in West Bengal.He also launched a sharp attack on his party leaders, alleging that BJP-ruled states such as Tripura, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh were being ruled like dictatorships.“I wish to see a mother ruling the country and all evil forces will be destroyed by matri-shakti (women power,” he added.Tripura BJP chief spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said the party was keeping a watch on party leaders and will take action whenever it is required. As for Mamata Banerjee, he said, there was no reason to praise the TMC boss as people in West Bengal have started realising their mistake in voting for her party after the poll-related violence there. “We feel that he (Ashish Das) is confused,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-bjp-mla-calls-mamata-oppn-s-face-for-2024-polls-bjp-says-he-s-confused-101633379590038.html
05-10-2021||India||162 UK nationals sent to mandatory home quarantine||New “reciprocal” Covid-19 rules for UK nationals arriving into India came into force on Monday, with authorities sending 162 of 539 people who arrived in three flights from the country to mandatory home quarantine after making them sign affidavits.The rules have been seen as a tit-for-tat response to UK’s decision not to recognise Indian vaccine certificates. When heading to the other country, people of either nation now need a pre-departure Covid-19 test, a test on arrival (in the UK, this needs to be taken on Day 2), and a test on the eighth day after their arrival – irrespective of their vaccination status.Such rules do not apply to arrivals from other low-Covid countries in either UK or India.“We are strictly following the guidelines issued by the Central government according to which only UK nationals are being subjected to mandatory home quarantine. Of the 539 passengers from the UK, 162 were marked for mandatory home quarantine for 10 days. Rest of the passengers, non-UK nationals, will not be put under surveillance,” said a senior revenue official deputed at the airport for handling UK passengers.To be sure, home quarantine was mandatory for arrivals from UK due to the prevalence of the Alpha variant there, but it was not strictly enforced.According to senior government officials, who asked not to be named, no passenger from the flights that arrived on Monday tested positive for Covid-19 during the mandatory RT-PCR test at the airport. This is in addition to the RT-PCR test which they have to take before boarding the flight from the UK.According to the official quoted above, those sent to mandatory home quarantine are being monitored by respective district administrations. Delhi has 11 districts and in each, there are dedicated teams that follow-up on those under home quarantine and check for violations. Violating a mandatory home quarantine is an offence under the DDMA Act and attracts penal action.“These passengers are made to sign an affidavit at the airport which also asks them to mention their place of stay for the next 10 days. Once they are done with the RT-PCR test at the airport and the result is negative, the affidavit having the addresses, contact numbers of these passengers are sent to the respective district magistrates so that they can initiate Covid-19 surveillance on them,” said a second government official.On day eight of the 10-day quarantine such passengers will have to take a Covid-19 test at their own cost. “By the time the result of the RT-PCR test comes, it will be the 10th day of home quarantine since their arrival in India,” said the official.A senior airport official said that there were three flights that came from the United Kingdom by Monday evening. “The first flight that came from London was UK-018 at 12.30 am and this flight was carrying 114 passengers. The second was British Airways 257 at 9 am, which was carrying 250 passengers, and 45 of them were transit passengers. The third flight arrived at IGI airport an hour later at 10 am. The Air India 112 flight was carrying 175 passengers, of which 65 were transit passengers,” this person said.“There are separate immigration counters made especially for the passengers coming from the UK. This setup was made so these passengers don’t merge with ones coming from other places. Once they land, they are taken to these counters in batches of at most 25 people and their RT-PCR test is conducted here. For those who turn up positive, they are shifted to a hospital,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/162-uk-nationals-sent-to-mandatory-home-quarantine-101633378207091.html

The UP district has turned into a political battleground, with leaders across parties attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the violence and making attempts to reach the spot to meet families affected by the violence. “The Opposition will try to take advantage of the Lakhimpur Kheri issue in the 2022 assembly election. The unfortunate incident has taken place before the state goes into poll mode. The Lakhimpur Kheri issue is likely to remain the centre stage of politics till the assembly polls,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and other leaders were stopped as they headed to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet people in the area. “A section of farmers is not happy with the BJP government, mainly in the west UP region. The state government has tried to pacify the sentiments of farmers by making certain promises and providing financial assistance,” said AK Singh, former director, Giri Institute of Development Studies, Lucknow. UP BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said the state government has taken necessary action and brought the situation under control following the violence. He said the BJP has undertaken a number of programmes for the welfare of farmers. The Congress’s spokesperson in the state Ashok Singh said the BJP was fast losing ground in the state and this was reflected in the way the BJP government handled the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-opposition-will-try-to-keep-up-political-heat-in-up-101633376589838.html
05-10-2021||India||My son was not there... else he would not have survived attack, says Ajay Mishra||As the political row over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence intensified on Monday, Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni dismissed allegations that his son was allegedly driving a vehicle which mowed down several people, including four farmers, a day ago.The minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, who is facing murder charges, also claimed that the allegations against him are baseless and that he was not present at the scene of the incident.“My son was not there. In the programme, there were thousands of people, including police and administration. My son was present at the programme venue from 11 am and continued to stay there till the conclusion of the programme. So there is no chance of my son being present at the spot,” he said.The Union minister was referring to a programme which was organised to welcome Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in the district.Violence broke out after two vehicles belonging to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, en route to the event, allegedly ran over four cultivators who were demonstrating against Maurya’s visit at Tikonia-Banbirpur road in Lakhimpur Kheri.Angered by this, the protesters then allegedly went on a rampage and lynched two BJP workers and a driver. Two vehicles were also set on fire by the mob.A murder case was filed against the minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, on Monday after protesters alleged that he was driving the vehicle that ran over protesting farmers on Sunday.“I was neither present in the car nor at the spot (of the incident)... I was in Banbirpur from 9am in the morning till late evening, supervising arrangements for the visit of the deputy chief minister,” Ashish said.“Allegations against me are completely baseless and I demand judicial inquiry of this matter and culprits should get punished,” he added.The Union minister claimed that protesters first pelted stones due to which the driver lost control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.“Some elements in farmers, who were protesting, showed black flags and pelted stones on the car which turned turtle. Two farmers came under the car and died,” he said.Besides this, Teni also denied making any remarks against the farmers which allegedly led to the protests on Sunday.“I myself am a farmer and how can I say anything against them. What I have referred to in my statements is the unlawful elements penetrating into farmers’ agitation,” he said.The minister’s clarification came after a purported video of him telling farmers that he would “discipline” them in “two minutes” was believed to have triggered the protests which ultimately led to violence.“Face me, it will take just two minutes to discipline you fellows,” the two-time BJP MP from Kheri was heard purportedly saying in the video, which went viral on social media before Sunday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-my-son-was-not-there-else-he-would-not-have-survived-attack-says-ajay-kumar-mishra-101633376411377.html
05-10-2021||India||Tropical storm over west Pacific travelled upto Oman||Cyclone Shaheen, the offspring of Cyclone Gulab, severely battered Oman and parts of Iran on Monday morning, killing at least 10 people. Cyclone Gulab had ravaged India’s east coast on September 26, causing damages worth ₹2,000 crore. Interestingly, the genesis of the serial cyclones was with tropical storm Dianmu, which started in the western Pacific Ocean and crossed Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar to emerge as a feeble system in the Bay of Bengal, which then strengthened into Cyclone Gulab. Gulab’s remnant brought widespread heavy rains to central and western India at the fag end of the monsoon, damaging standing crops. The economic impact of Cyclone Gulab is estimated to be around ₹2,000 crore, with much of it being borne by farmers, according to RMSI, a global disaster risk management firm.As forecast by the India Meteorological Department, Gulab’s remnant emerged as a well marked low pressure area over south Gujarat and the adjoining Gulf of Khambhat. The storm gained in strength over the Arabian Sea and transformed itself in the severe Cyclone Shaheen. The Met department had correctly predicted that after landfall, Gulab’s remnant may revive into the next cyclonic storm over the Arabian Sea. Meteorologists are intrigued by the long life of a stormy weather system from the western Pacific that had three lives — Dianmu, Gulab and Shaheen – and did not weaken despite its long travel over the Indian subcontinent.“Shaheen is unique because it emerged from remnant of Gulab, which had emerged from a tropical storm over west Pacific,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge, cyclones, IMD. “There have been few such tracks in the past. There was one in 1948, for example. It is also unique because Gulab formed towards the end of the monsoon. Cyclones normally form during the post-monsoon season starting October. Over land, Gulab and its remnant behaved like a monsoon system, bringing widespread rain over central India and over Telangana and Odisha.” IMD’s list of unique cyclone tracks lists a storm in 1921 that moved from the Pacific Ocean all the way to Oman. “Gulab weakened to a well-marked low before intensifying into Shaheen, otherwise it would have one name, which would make it even more unusual. It’s unique, but as you can see, in 1921 also there was a similar track,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.IMD continued to issue warnings for cyclone Shaheen even when it moved away from the Indian coast because it is the regional specialised meteorological centre for north Indian Ocean and advises all countries in the region on cyclones. “India being a specialised centre issues warnings for 13 countries as part of an advisory role under the World Meteorological Organisation,” Mohapatra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tropical-storm-over-west-pacific-travelled-upto-oman-101633376357693.html
05-10-2021||India||UP Police manhandled me, tried to force me into their vehicle: Priyanka Gandhi||In police custody in Sitapur after being stopped from going to Lakhimpur Kheri, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spoke to HT on the phone about the farm agitation and the incident in which eight people were killed. Edited excerpts:Where are you speaking to us from?I’m technically in custody. I arrived in Lucknow at night with the intention of going to Lakhimpur Kheri in the morning. I thought I would go to the Congress office, but as I was coming out of the house, there were two rows of police people who surrounded my car and said that you cannot go forward. After their altercation, I got out and asked why they were stopping me but no one seemed to have any answer. I started walking, and then somebody got a car and we drove, intending to go to the party office but when I saw so much police deployment, I decided to go straight to Lakhimpur Kheri.At three toll gates, they had parked trucks so that we could not go across. We managed to, however, cross two of them and then we decided to go via the dirt tracks and village roads. For the next 3-4 hours, it was just one car with five of us in it, and we eventually ended up about 10km from the Lakhimpur Kheri border in Sitapur. At which point, we were again surrounded by police people, and they took the key of our car and refused to let us move. Again I got out and a cordon was made around me of policewomen so that I couldn’t move.I tried to walk but they were pushing and shoving. Then they started beating my colleagues, punched one of them several times in the stomach and lifted him up and tried to stuff him into a jeep. They also pushed and shoved Deepender Hooda, and manhandled him a lot. At which point, I fought with them and told them they had absolutely no basis for what they were doing. As I was trying to stop them from hitting my colleagues, they manhandled me quite a bit as well. They tried to force me into their jeep, but I told them there was no legal basis for this. Even if Section 144 was there, I told them that four of us will go and in no way are we breaking the law. That point a senior officer told me that they are arresting me under section 151 (preventive arrest) but they had no answer as to what crime I was going to commit. Then they brought me here without my security or any of my colleagues, to this rest house.That’s the place we saw images of you sweeping the floor?Yes, I was. I like my room to be clean.What’s the plan now?Issue isn’t of my arrest. I have come here to see those families and to raise my voice in their support. There is absolutely no legal basis for detaining me and I haven’t been given any reason for my arrest. I don’t intend to leave until I can meet the families. It’s up to them, they have 24 hours to give me a formal order for my arrest.The police say that they allowed farm leaders to go in but it’s a fragile situation and that’s why no politicians allowed inThey said the same thing when I wanted to go to Hathras, the same thing when I went to each and every household of those killed in the CAA [citizenship amendment act] protests, the same thing when I went to Sonbhadra and many other places. I want to ask you since I eventually ended up going to all those places -- can you name one place where I made an inflammatory remark or encouraged people to be violent with each other? I didn’t. In UP, despite all those beautiful posters in Delhi, there’s a complete breakdown of democracy and complete breakdown of the law-and-order situation. It’s a virtual dictatorship where all the institutions are meant to safeguard democracy are engaged in safeguarding the propaganda and machinery of the BJP government.Has the Opposition been successful in this case? Police have named the BJP leader’s son in the FIR and also announced compensationThe UP government usually takes action when political pressure is put on them, which is why it is extremely important for Opposition parties to raise their voice and create pressure. Otherwise, the last vestiges of justice and law and order are also not going to remain if we all just keep quiet. However, the action they take in that moment isn’t complete. So, for example, they have arrested me but why have they not arrested a man who is accused of mowing down farmers and of whom there are videos, ground reports and all sorts of evidence? What moral authority does the government have to remain in power when a minister of the government openly threatens the public? Three-four days later this happened, so what moral authority does this man have to remain a minister and what moral authority does the CM have to remain in power? Please see this man’s criminal history and antecedents which haven’t been highlighted yetAre you planning a concerted effort with other opposition leaders?If you look at the last two years, when have you seen Mr Akhilesh Yadav come out on the street for any agitation? Did you see him during the NRC-CAA protests or during the Hathras incident? Did you see him on the street representing the farmers? You did not. Did you see Mayawati ji? You did not. Did you see the Congress party? Yes, you did. Especially in the last 1.5 years including the time there was corona, the Congress party did the maximum work on the ground, maximum issues and maximum relief for corona. We have been working and raising issues and slowly building our organisation. I am open to anybody as objective is to defeat the BJP and prevent UP from falling even more into this quagmire of extremely terrible law and order.But is there a paucity of faces in the Congress as many like Jitin Prasada have left?It’s not a question of faces but what you have on the ground. There are people who have left the party, who have probably switched sides because they felt they couldn’t win an election. Our party has to slowly build from the ground and those who don’t have the heart for this fight, who don’t have the courage to deal with the kind of things visited upon them when they do fight (legal cases, harassment etc.), actually should leave. I am not worried about those who are leaving or left, I am more concerned that what we are building on the ground, throwing up new leaders who are connected to the ground and win their elections.So building from the ground, do we expect Congress to dent Yogi’s chances in 2022 or are you more realistic and know it’s a long fight?Either way for the Congress it’s a long fight. The Congress has been out of power for 32 years. Whether we make a huge impact or a lesser impact, ours in UP is a long haul and that’s what we’ve done in the last few years. We have initiated the process which should yield something in 2022 and something in 2024 and something else five years later.Is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra the CM face?At this point, considering the circumstances we are speaking to each other, it’s a bit frivolous to be speaking about these things. At another time when you come during the election campaign, you will have your answer to that question.Finally, is the farmers’ issue going to be factor only in western UP or across the state?This is a factor in the whole of India because it is not just about the farmers. It’s a factor where the whole of India is watching to those who are asking for justice. These are the people who have built the country, whose sons are standing on the border defending your country, on whom your country is dependent for its entire agricultural production. Everybody in the country is watching this and is seeing how in a democracy, the voices of those who are suffering are completely squashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-vadra-interview-up-police-manhandled-me-tried-to-force-me-into-their-vehicle-101633376169616.html
05-10-2021||India||SC to examine if protest can be permitted with farm laws under judicial scrutiny||Contemplating restrictions on the right to protest, the Supreme Court on Monday observed that “nobody takes responsibility” when damage to property and physical injuries take place during protests, as it referred to the incident in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri where violence claimed eight lives during a farmers’ protest a day ago. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar wondered why farmers are protesting when the operation of the three contentious farm laws has already been suspended by the apex court this January, while calling it a “principal question” to be determined as to whether protests should be allowed when the issue is sub judice (under judicial consideration). The Union government, through Attorney General KK Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, asserted that parties should not be allowed to protest on the streets when a constitutional court is already examining the subject matter of agitation. “When such incidents happen, nobody takes responsibility. Damage to properties, physical damages... deaths too. But nobody takes responsibility,” remarked the bench when Venugopal spoke out about the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. “Why should a person be allowed to protest by the executive after he has exercised his right of going to the court? This is the principal question before us... Once you have gone to the court against the action of the executive, how can that person ask for a permission to protest? Protest against whom? It is now only the court that can pass orders,” commented the bench. “When you have already challenged the law, why should you be allowed to protest? You choose only one option. Either you appeal to the parliament or you come to the court. You cannot be doing everything... How can there be a protest when the matter is sub judice? We will decide this issue,” said the bench. The top court was hearing a petition by farmers’ outfit Kisan Mahapanchayat, seeking permission to hold a peaceful satyagraha against the farm laws at the Capital’s designated protest site of Jantar Mantar when it questioned if there can be an “absolute right to protest”, especially when the party concerned has already moved court against the policy or legislation against which it seeks to hold demonstrations. Meanwhile, another SC bench, comprising justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh, issued notices to 43 leaders of farmers’ organisations which have been leading protests under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) against the three farm laws passed by Parliament last year. These leaders include Rakesh Tikait of Bhartiya Kisan Union and Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan – two prominent leaders associated with the ongoing protests. On a request made by the Haryana government through Mehta, the court sought replies from the farm leaders, who have been sought to be included as parties to a petition by Monicca Agarwaal, a single mother working in an information technology firm who has said her travel from Noida to Delhi has become a nightmare due to these protests.According to the application moved by the Haryana government, it is imperative to hear the farm leaders if issues arising out of the agitation on public roads causing inconvenience to others are to be resolved. This bench said that it would hear the case next on October 20 after the farm leaders are served with the notices. Thousands of farmers are camping on the borders of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and on highways along these states since November last year, protesting three controversial laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy. Traffic at many points have been diverted, adding to commuting times, besides affecting commercial activities along these routes. Meanwhile, Kisan Mahapanchayat assured the bench, headed by justice Khanwilkar, that is not a part of SKM and is not protesting in public spaces but wishes to carry out a peaceful protest at Jantar Mantar to raise several pertinent issues in farmers’ interest. The bench, however, expressed its reservations in entertaining such a request since the outfit has already challenged the validity of the farm laws before the Rajasthan high court through a writ petition. The court requested Venugopal to assist with regard to the question if a party can be allowed to protest when it has already exercised the option of going to the court. “You want to protest against what? This court has already stayed the law. The government has assured they are not implementing the law. So, what are you protesting? If the validity of the laws has to be decided by this court, where is the question of protest?” the bench asked advocate Ajay Chaudhary, who represented the Mahapanchayat. Chaudhary tried to persuade the bench that the outfit is not only protesting against the validity of the farm laws but is also raising other relevant issues. The court, however, remained unimpressed and remarked that when the Mahapanchayat has chosen to move a petition before the high court, why it should be given permission to protest raising the same or similar issues. Venugopal and Mehta submitted that protests should not be allowed when the issues are already pending before a constitutional court. “There should not be any protest when the issue is pending before this court. They cannot exercise both rights. Please, make it clear they cannot continue the protests. Unfortunate incidents happen...see what happened in Lakhimpur yesterday,” Venugopal told the bench. At this, the court said that it is willing to determine the contours of the right to protest after transferring the Mahapanchayat’s petition before the Rajasthan high court to itself. The court, in its order, recorded that the principal question involved is whether the right to protest is a fundamental right, particularly where a party has approached a constitutional court on the same issue. The court fixed the next hearing on October 21. When the Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the operation of the three farm laws, it had desisted from issuing any order against the protests, saying it is not against peaceful agitations. “While we may not stifle a peaceful protest, we think that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others,” the court order had then recorded in its order.While staying the laws, the top court had formed a committee to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court. The committee submitted its report in the court on March 19 but the case has not been taken up ever since. Former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B Lokur, said that the suggestion by the court that nobody should protest against the farm laws when the issue is pending consideration before it is ridden with dangers.“Supreme Court has no power to restrict Fundamental Rights - it has to protect them for the benefit of citizens. If peaceful protest is prohibited, there is a violation of the right to assemble peacefully without arms, which is a constitutional right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(b),” he said. “There is also an issue of freedom of speech and expression, another fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) that will seriously and adversely affect journalists, commentators, media persons and just about everyone else. The Hon’ble Court has not defined what kind of protest is prohibited. Protesting on the streets is one form of protest. Hunger strike is another while writing critically against a law or an issue is also a manner of protest,” he added.He pointed out yet another flaw with the court’s suggestion. “The Supreme Court does not indicate by what time it will decide the issue of farm laws. One can understand if at all, that the matter will be decided within a week, till then it can request the people not to protest. Such an appeal has been made in the past. There is a precedent for it. But if a case is not to be decided for next five years, it is crazy to say you cannot protest. This can have a bearing on many other issues pending before the court such as electoral bonds, Citizenship Amendment Act, Article 370, etc. So if a labour law is challenged in court, the suggestion would mean that no trade union or labour union can go on strike. Nobody supports burning of buses or public transport, but peaceful protest and free speech is guaranteed by the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-examine-if-protest-can-be-permitted-with-farm-laws-under-judicial-scrutiny-101633376170168.html

Enraged local residents then set fire to vehicles and allegedly killed four others, said police.On Sunday night, the state government deployed police and issued orders under section 144 of the Indian Penal Code – which restricts the movement or assembly of four or more people – and stopped Opposition politicians from moving from Lucknow to Lakhimpur Kheri. This included Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Satish Chandra Mishra. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra later defied the police cordon left for Lakhimpur, only to be detained outside the district border at Sitapur by a large police force. She was detained and sent to Provincial Armed Constabulary guest house in Sitapur, along with party leader Deepinder Hooda and UP Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu. “The leaders of various political parties were stopped from going to Lakhimpur Kheri in view of the prohibitory orders imposed by the district magistrate,” BD Paulson, secretary, home, said. In Tikuniya – where the violence first broke out at 3pm on Sunday – the police also enforced section 144 and suspended phone internet services at 8.30 pm on Sunday. The suspension continued on Monday. The state government also issued a set of controversial orders and letters, prompting the Opposition to allege that the administration was trying to throttle democratic protests. First, UP additional chief secretary for home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi, asked Lucknow airport authorities to not permit the flights of Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder S Randhawa to land at the airport. “In view of the incident on October 3, the district magistrate of Lakhimpur Kheri has imposed section 144 in the district to maintain law and order... in view of the prohibitory orders kindly do not grant permission for arrival to Chief Minister, Chhattisgarh and Deputy Chief Minister, Punjab,” read the letter from Awasthi to the director of the airport, dated October 3. Both Baghel and Randhawa are Congress leaders and were planning to visit Lakhimpur Kheri. “Are all citizen’s rights over in Uttar Pradesh? Do we now need a visa to go there? Don’t BJP leaders go to other states when there are incidents there?” Baghel asked. Calling it a “murder of democracy”, Randhawa said: “We will go and meet the families of farmers who lost their lives and ensure justice for them,” he said. Later in the evening, Randhawa and Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Nagra were detained at Saharanpur while they were on their way to Lakhimpur Kheri. “Why are Congress leaders not being allowed to enter UP to visit the bereaved families in Lakhimpur? Our deputy CM and MLAs have been detained at the UP Haryana Border. I condemn such tyranny being done by the UP Govt,” Channi said in the evening. Second, the UP state government shot off a letter to the Punjab chief secretary Anirudh Tewari, urging him to not allow any one from the state to go to Lakhimpur Kheri.Third, the Punjab director of civil aviation wrote to Awasthi, requesting permission for Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s helicopter to land in Lakhimpur. Around 2pm, the UP home department wrote back, denying permission. “’Due to imposition of Sec 144 in Lakhimpur Kheri, it’s not possible to grant permission for the visit of Punjab CM & deputy CM,” said the letter signed by BD Paulson, UP home secretary. The government also took steps to restrict vehicular movement in the area, and the railways cancelled several trains to the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-section-144-police-cordon-bar-on-landing-up-stops-opposition-101633375811460.html
05-10-2021||India||Private sector will play key role in achieving self reliance in defence: Rajnath||NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said the Union government was committed to strengthening the private sector and priming it for its new role in developing India’s defence capabilities, stressing that private participation was crucial to achieving the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat or self-reliant India.Singh said the government had taken a raft of reform measures to increase the participation of the private industry in the defence sector, with focus on providing a boost to indigenous defence capabilities. “Developing new technologies indigenously is the need of the hour. Our vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ is to ensure that advanced technologies are developed domestically. It is extremely important not just for strengthening national security but also ensuring overall development of the country,” the minister said while addressing a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) function to felicitate young scientists and other achievers. The government has taken several steps to boost self-reliance in the defence sector, including the raising of foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing, creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying two lists of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported. India has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases. The government will take all measures to modernise the armed forces and equip them with latest weapons and systems to deal with any challenge, the minister said. Singh lauded DRDO for its contribution to the government’s efforts to achieve self-reliance in defence manufacturing and its role in enhancing military capabilities at a time when the geo-political situation is changing rapidly. “DRDO is not only trying to match the capabilities of technologically advanced countries, but it is also equally engaged in innovation of new technologies. The new generation programmes of DRDO will upgrade our armed forces in future as well,” the minister said. Singh also released two policy documents of DRDO: Directed Research Policy and Records Management Policy 2021. The first policy seeks to set up advanced technology centres and research cells in academic institutes for focused research on futuristic surveillance, defensive and offensive capabilities. In a major push to the self-reliance campaign in the defence sector, India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹54,000 crore in less than a month to boost the military’s capabilities with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons, as reported by HT on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-sector-will-play-key-role-in-achieving-self-reliance-in-defence-rajnath-singh-101633375511040.html
05-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: College student, farmers among 8 killed in clashes||Eight people, including four cultivators, were killed in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday, in the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws started last year. The farmers were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers travelling to welcome deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to the area. The remaining deceased -- two BJP workers, a journalist and a driver -- were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and then lynched by angry protesters. A look the victims:A resident of Parsehra Khurd village under Phardhan police limits, Hariom was a driver and employed with Union minister of state for home, Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni, for several months. He is survived by his parents, a younger brother and a younger sister. Shubham was a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker and booth president. A resident of Shivpuri locality in Lakhimpur Kheri town, he was travelling in one of the SUVs to receive Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya when he was killed in the violence. He is survived by his parents, wife and a child. Raman Kashyap was a local journalist who contributed to several media houses. A resident of Nighasan town under the same kotwali limits, Kashyap had gone to the spot to cover Maurya’s visit amid the farmers’ agitation when he was caught in the violence. He remained unidentified for several hours and was untraceable by his family after the incident. He is survived by his parents, wife, brother and daughter. Sundar, who hailed from Singha Kalan under Singahi kotwali limits, was a BJP worker and party president of Bhedaura sector. He had also gone to attend the programme in one of the vehicles and was allegedly brutally thrashed to death by the protesters. Daljeet was a farmer from Nanpara area of Lakhimpur. He was the first one to be hit by a vehicle, according to eyewitnesses. He is survived by his wife, 17-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son. Singh, a resident of Nanpara area of Lakhimpur, was the youngest among four siblings -- all farmers. He quit studies after Class 12 and began helping his family in the fields. He would volunteer at the local gurudwara and had reached Tikunia to distribute water and food to protesters when the violence erupted. A resident of Dhaurara in Lakhimpur Kheri, Singh’s youngest son Mandeep is a Shashatra Seema Bal jawan. Lovepreet was a resident of Mashghania and youngest among three siblings. He had enrolled in a college to pursue commerce this year and had reached Tikunia on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-college-student-farmers-among-8-killed-in-clashes-101633375509773.html
05-10-2021||India||UP turns battleground as admin bars Opposition leaders||Battle lines were drawn between the Uttar Pradesh government and Opposition parties on Monday after the administration stopped several politicians from reaching Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people died and 10 were injured in violence a day before.Hours after news broke of the clashes on Sunday evening, several Opposition leaders attempted to make their way from Delhi and Lucknow to Tikunia village, roughly 70 km from Lakhimpur district headquarters. But barring some farm leaders and Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad, most were stopped by the police, citing prohibitory orders in the district. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Dal president Jayant Chaudhary and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Satish Chandra Mishra were all stopped at various points on Sunday night and Monday. Separately, the state government refused to allow the flights of Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder SIngh Randhawa to land in Lucknow, triggering criticism by Opposition politicians. “The BJP government is doing the politics of crushing the farmers and finishing them,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted.Opposition politicians blamed the BJP and Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra, who owned the car that allegedly ran over four farmers. Farmers alleged that Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra was in the car, but the minister denied the charges, and said farmers torched three cars and thrashed other people to death, including two BJP workers and their driver. A local journalist was also killed in the violence. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra landed at Lucknow late Sunday evening, and attempted to head to Lakhimpur Kheri with a large contingent of party workers but was detained at her Lucknow residence. Late at night, she broke the police cordon and walked out, boarded her car and proceeded towards Lakhimpur Kheri. Police stopped her at several spots, and finally detained at Hariya in Sitapur district near Lakhimpur Kheri around 2am on Monday. She was sent to Provincial Armed Constabulary guest house in Sitapur but the leader later alleged that police manhandled and shoved her and Congress leader Deepinder Hooda.“I tried to walk but they were pushing and shoving. They also pushed and shoved Deepender Hooda, and manhandled him. As I was trying to stop them from hitting my colleagues, they manhandled me. They tried to force me into their jeep, but I told them there was no legal basis,” she told HT. Police denied the charges. Congress workers sat vigil outside the guest house she was detained in and shot videos that showed her sweeping the floor of the room with a broom. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi, “Priyanka, I know that you will not retreat. They fear your courage. We will ensure that the country’s ‘annadatas’ win this non-violent fight for justice.” The Congress also staged protests in the national capital. Satish Chandra Mishra made an abortive attempt to leave his house around 8 pm on Sunday but was quickly stopped by police. Aam Aadmi Party MP and UP in-charge Sanjay Singh, too, made a bid around midnight but was detained in Sitapur at around 1 am.“This is very sad and condemnable,” BSP chief Mayawati tweeted.Around midnight, police began barricading Lucknow’s Vikramaditya Marg that houses Yadav’s residence and the Samajwadi Party headquarters. Trucks were seen parked across the road and left after a large posse of policemen were deployed in the area. Yadav made an attempt to drive off at around 8 am on Monday, but was stopped. Soon afterwards, some unidentified people set a police jeep on fire. The police held SP workers responsible but the party blamed the police for the fire. Around 10am, a large crowd of SP workers with party flags gathered in the area. Yadav, along with SP national general secretary Ramgopal Yadav, sat on the road outside his residence and shouted anti-government slogans. Within 30 minutes, police detained him. He was released around 5pm.“Vehicles are being run over those who raise their voices. We want the arrest of the minister and his son in the Lakhimpur incident,” Yadav told reporters.Chandrashekhar Azad, who did not have a convoy, managed to sneak into Lakhimpur Kheri and reached the spot by dawn.“It is a sad moment for the farmers of the country. The killing of these farmers shows that the government has crossed all limits,” he said. SP and Congress leaders protested in almost all the districts across the state. The RLD protested largely in the western UP districts. Around two dozen RLD leaders, including its state president Masood Ahmad, were detained on the outskirts of Lucknow.Randhawa, who took the road route to Lakhimpur Kheri from Punjab, was detained by UP police immediately on entering Saharanpur. Earlier in the day, he was denied permission by the UP government to reach Lucknow by air.UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh blamed the Opposition for politicising the event. “We are taking the matter seriously and it is under investigation.

The vaccine was granted an emergency use authorisation by India’s drug regulators after interim clinical trial data showed was 66% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, although the company has not released details of their studies or put them through peer review. The trial included volunteers in the 12-18 age group.The government last Thursday said that the indigenously-developed needle-free vaccine will be introduced in the nationwide anti-coronavirus vaccination drive “very shortly”.The vaccine is administered through a needle-free jet injector and a special applicator that is likely to cost around ₹30,000.Since the vaccine has been tested in 12-18 year-olds, it is likely to be included in the porgramme to inoculate children with priority being given to those children who suffer from specified comorbidities.The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is working on the protocol and framework for the inclusion of this vaccine in the programme.The vaccine is to be given on day zero, 28 and 56 as per the schedule shared by the company.Globally, at least 50 countries have begun giving doses to children. In most cases, children above the age of 12 are being inoculated. The shots being used for these ages are typically the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna doses.In India, makers of Covaxin and the Novavax vaccine are carrying out supplementary – also known as bridging -- trials in children.Nearly three rounds of meetings have taken place so far between the Centre and the company, the recent one being on September 30.“The discussions are on, and there should be some resolution soon,” added the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-covid-vaccine-price-continues-to-be-key-hurdle-in-centre-nod-101633374609599.html
05-10-2021||India||BJP includes Yediyurappa’s son in bypolls team||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday included BY Vijayendra, son of former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, as one of the nearly two dozen in-charges for the October 30 bypolls to two assembly seats, a day after the party faced backlash from his supporters for announcing the list without the young leader’s name in it, people aware of the developments said. After the BJP first announced its in-charge list on Sunday evening, Vijayendra’s supporters lashed out at senior party leaders for “sidelining him”. The uproar forced Vijayendra, the vice-president of BJP’s Karnataka unit, make a public appeal against posts or statements against the party or its leaders. On Monday, Vijayendra’s name was included as one of the 13 in-charges for Hanagal constituency. “Some of our karyakarthas (party workers) have expressed their anger and anguish about my non-inclusion in the list of in-charge for Sindgi & Hanagal by-elections. My appeal to them: please refrain from making comments that embarrasses our party, leaders, or me,” Vijayendra on Monday said in a post on Twitter. He tagged BJP national president JP Nadda and party’s national general secretary in-charge Arun Singh in his tweet. “As the @BJP4Karnataka Vice President, I will actively campaign for the party candidates in both constituencies. Let us focus all our energies on ensuring victory in both the seats and further strengthen the party,” he said in a second tweet. Vijayendra has had a turbulent relationship with several BJP leaders, who had repeatedly targeted him during his father’s term as the chief minister between 2018 and July this year.On Sunday, the BJP entrusted the responsibility of the two assembly constituencies — Hanagal and Sindgi — to 24 leaders, including ministers and legislators, but left out Vijayendra’s name. Even Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator from Bijapura city and staunch critic of Yediyurappa and his family, was included in the list for Sindgi bypoll. Vijayendra had been in the thick of at least three assembly bypolls —Sira, KR Pete and Maski—in the past two years, helping the party candidates win two seats. Vijayendra was credited with helping BJP’s KC Narayana Gowda win the KR Pete seat in Mandya district, about 99 km from Bengaluru, in December 2019. This was the BJP’s first ever victory in a region that is considered a stronghold of the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S). This was followed by a victory in Shira (Tumakuru district) in November last year. The outcomes bolstered the confidence of his supporters, who started demanding bigger responsibilities for the former CM’s son by the party. The BJP, however, suffered defeat in Maski bypoll in May this year, in which Pratap Gouda Patil lost even with Vijayendra at the helm of affairs in the constituency. The developments added to the tense state of affairs within the BJP that is trying to find a middle ground to Yediyurappa’s proposed statewide tour to help the saffron outfit in the yet-to-be announced zilla parishad and panchayat polls as well as the 2023 assembly elections. The decision to include Vijayendra as one of the party in-charges for the upcoming by-elections also put to rest speculations of his contesting the bypoll from Hanagal seat and get accommodated in the chief minister Basavaraj Bommai-led state cabinet, people aware of the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-includes-yediyurappa-s-son-in-bypolls-team-101633374129405.html

05-10-2021||India||SC asks states to roll out scheme to pay Covid ex gratia within a week||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday directed states and Union territories to roll out within a week the central scheme of ₹50,000 ex-gratia compensation for families of those whose deaths have been certified as Covid-19 fatalities and added this amount shall be over and above the entitlement of these persons under the financial schemes already provided by Centre, states and UTs. A bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna said, “The next of the kin of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 shall be paid ex-gratia assistance of an amount of ₹50,000, which shall be treated as ex-gratia payment under Section 12(iii) of the DMA, 2005 and which shall be minimum and which shall be over and above the compensation/amount to be paid by the Union of India/State Governments/Union Territories to be declared/provided under different benevolent schemes.” The compensation shall not be limited to deaths that have taken place so far but will be available for those who die in future phases of Covid-19 as well, the court said. The central scheme was formulated under the Disaster Management Authority Act, 2005 by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment of June 30. Making the scheme binding upon all states and UTs, the bench held, “The NDMA, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and Union of India are directed to issue guidelines to the concerned States and Union Territories incorporating the directions issued hereinabove which shall be binding to all the States/UTs.” As per the scheme, the amount shall be payable out of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). As a first step, the states/UTs shall identify an officer at the district level within a week to receive applications and give wide publicity of the same in print, electronic media and in all offices at village, taluk, district levels. The compensation claim shall be decided within 30 days of receipt of application, the court held. The states/UTs were further directed to set up a Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) within a week where applicants can approach on being denied the claim for compensation or in cases where death certificate showing cause of death as “due to COVID-19” is not issued to them. The bench said, “All endeavours shall be made by the District Disaster Management Authority or District Administration and even the Grievance Redressal Committee to avoid any technicalities and all concerned authority shall act as a helping hand, so as to wipe off the tears of those who have suffered due to loss of a family member died due to Covid-19.” While a death certificate showing cause of death as “Died due to COVID-19” will be necessary to claim the ex-gratia amount, it shall not be conclusive, the court held, adding that if other documents are available to show that death occurred within 30 days of testing Covid positive at home or in hospital or even beyond 30 days of admission at the hospital, the family members will be entitled to compensation. “No State shall deny the ex-gratia assistance of ₹50,000, to the next of the kin of the deceased died due to Covid-19 solely on the ground that in the death certificate issued by the appropriate authority, the cause of death is not mentioned as “Died due to Covid-19,” the court observed. The court also extended the benefit of compensation to persons who died due to suicide within 30 days of suffering Covid-19. Earlier, the Centre had excluded deaths occurring due to “poisoning, suicide, homicide, deaths due to accident” from the ambit of the ex-gratia scheme. But after the PIL petitioner Gaurav Kumar Bansal objected on the exclusion of suicide deaths and the Court insisted, the Centre had left it to the court to include suicide deaths within the list of beneficiaries. In cases where hospitals have showed cause of death as Covid-19 in the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) issued to the authority issuing death certificate, it shall be treated as Covid-19 death, the top court said. The bench also directed hospitals to cooperate with the applicants in providing all relevant documents to the kin of those who died due to Covid-19 in establishing their claim under the scheme. “All concerned hospitals where the patient was admitted and given treatment shall provide all the necessary documents of treatment etc. to the family member of the deceased, as and when demanded,” the bench said, adding, “it will be open for the Grievance Redressal Committee to call for such information and the concerned hospital/institution…. shall have to furnish such particulars as required for the purpose of establishing that the death was due to Covid-19.” The GRC would consist of additional district collector, chief medical officer of health (CMOH), additional CMOH/principal or HOD Medicine of a medical college (if one existing in the district) and a subject expert. If the committee is satisfied about the cause of death due to Covid-19, it shall take remedial measures including issuance of amended official document for Covid-19 death. If the GRC is not satisfied with the applicant, it shall record reasons in its order, the bench added. In municipal corporation areas, the committee shall be headed by deputy commissioner, the bench said, adding that wide publicity shall be given about the committee and its place of operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-states-to-roll-out-scheme-to-pay-covid-ex-gratia-within-a-week-101633373769408.html
05-10-2021||India||NCB custody of SRK’s son Aryan Khan extended till Oct 7||A metropolitan magistrate court on Monday extended till October 7 the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) custody of Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, and two others arrested with him for alleged drug abuse on board a cruise ship.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate RM Nerlikar extended the NCB custody of the three primarily in view of the fact that the agency has recovered intermediate quantity of drugs from one of them, and Aryan Khan was accompanying them.Besides, the court also took into consideration that the investigation was at a preliminary and crucial stage.Acting on a specific tip-off, NCB on Saturday night raided a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and busted a party where drugs were allegedly being used. The agency on Sunday afternoon arrested Aryan, the eldest son of Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan, for alleged possession and consumption of illegal drugs.The two others arrested with him are Arbaaz Merchant, a resident of Bandra and a friend of Aryan, and Munmun Dhamecha, a fashion designer from Madhya Pradesh.At about 1.30pm Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha were taken to JJ Hospital for a medical checkup, in which doctors also took their swabs for RTPCR tests. They were taken back to the NCB office and produced before the Esplanade court around 3.15pm.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Advait Sethna, who appeared for NCB, submitted that the agency seized Aryan Khan’s mobile phone and found several chats which showed his connection with drug dealers. “It is necessary to confront all accused in the custodial remand,” Singh asserted.He said the chat clearly showed the nexus, containing discussions of cash transactions. There were international transactions and further probe was on, Singh submitted.The ASG showed some chats to the court to point out that Aryan Khan had conversations with unknown persons about buying charas and the NCB needed to find out who those unknown persons were.Advocate Satish Maneshinde, appearing for Aryan Khan, opposed the prayer for extension of custody. Contending that Aryan was not involved in any drug sale, purchase or consumption, he said nothing incriminating was recovered from the 23-year-old or anybody related to him from amongst the people on the ship. He submitted that Aryan only knows Merchant, from whom 6 grams of charas has been allegedly seized.“The agency can’t simply rely on WhatsaApp chats to seek more custody, as there was no other material on record found from me or people related to me,” said Maneshinde.He said Aryan was invited as a guest and therefore he did not have a boarding card and ticket and the best suite on the ship was allotted to him because of being an invitee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-custody-of-srk-s-son-aryan-khan-extended-till-oct-7-101633373529298.html
05-10-2021||India||Rajasthan guv stays child marriage registration||Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra on Monday put on hold for further legal examination a bill to amend the law regarding mandatory registration of all marriages, after objections were raised by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and social activists.The Rajasthan assembly last week passed a bill to amend the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2009, providing a mechanism for the registration of all marriages in the state, irrespective of age of the bride and groom. The contentious amendment, which is yet to be notified, states that “if the bride is under 18 and the groom is under 21”, the parents or guardians must submit a memorandum for registration of marriage within 30 days from the date of marriage.Social activists and civil society members argued the new provision was retrograde because it effectively legalised child marriage.Though the practice has been a major social ill in Rajasthan for decades, official data does not reflect this -- a problem that activists allege is more to do with recording of the data than the ground reality. According to the state government, only four child marriages were reported in Rajasthan in 2016, 10 in 2017, and 17 in 2018. There is no data on child marriages available for 2019 and 2020.The National Family Health Survey (NFHS), however, showed that the share of child marriages in total marriages in the state per year came down from 65% in 2006 to 35% in 2016, suggesting that it was still a matter of grave concern.While the BJP staged a walkout in the assembly when the bill was passed in the assembly on September 17, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in the last week of September asked the state government to review the new law because its enactment, it said, would have a “serious impact on the physical, psychological, and social state” of minors. A public interest litigation (PIL) has also been filed by Jodhpur-based Saarthi Trust in the Rajasthan high court’s Jaipur bench challenging the constitutional validity of the bill.A senior official familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity that looking at the objections, and concerns raised by several sections and the Opposition, the governor has decided to get the bill examined more minutely.The controversy The legal debate centres around a 2006 Supreme Court judgment in “Seema vs Ashwani Kumar”, which directed states and the centre to notify procedures for registration of all marriages.“If the record of marriage is kept, to a large extent, the dispute concerning solemnisation of marriages between two persons is avoided. As rightly contended by the National Commission, in most cases non-registration of marriages affects the women to a great measure. If the marriage is registered it also provides evidence of the marriage having taken place and would provide a rebuttable presumption of the marriage having taken place. Though, the registration itself cannot be a proof of valid marriage per se, and would not be the determinative factor regarding validity of a marriage, yet it has a great evidentiary value in the matters of custody of children, right of children born from the wedlock of the two persons whose marriage is registered, and the age of parties to the marriage. That being so, it would be in the interest of the society if marriages are made compulsorily registrable.”NGOs have argued that the apex court order made no mention of registration of child marriages, and that the state government should have taken the court’s opinion before bringing in the new bill. “It seems that government has wrongly interpreted a Supreme Court order, which does not state that child marriages should be registered. If the government has doubts on how the order should be interpreted, they should approach the court for clarification,” said Kriti Bhati of Saarthi, an NGO working against child marriages in Rajasthan.Bhati, who has prevented over a thousand child marriages in Rajasthan and annulled 43, said the court order said that public opinion should be taken before amending the law. “The registration certificate will also make annulment of child marriages difficult as the court will ask for a certificate. This, the parents will not be have, as getting one for a minor will bring legal action on them,” Bhati said.Kavita Srivastav, general secretary of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said allowing marriage registrations for people below legal age “directly approves” child marriages, and reiterated the need for pre-legislative consultation. “As per the amendment, every marriage is legal. The marriages annulled so far happened as the girls raised their voice but now this right would also end as the parents will not get the marriage registered fearing legal action,” said Srivastav.“The government should immediately withdraw the changes or else a massive movement will be started against it.”What the government saysThe government said in a statement on September 18that registration of marriage does not in any way give validity to the union, and nor is it a hindrance in the court to declare a child marriage void.“All marriages are being registered in the state since 2006 as per the order of the Supreme Court. This amendment bill 2021 has also been passed to facilitate the process of registration of all marriages in compliance with the order of the Supreme Court,” the statement said.The government stressed the new provision would enable registration of marriages of unregistered deceased couples, so that their children and family members do not face legal hurdles. With the registration of marriage, children will be able to get government jobs, succession, compassionate appointments, domicile certificates, benefits such as a pension, and other legal rights, it added.The government also refuted the charge that the new provision is in contradiction to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.“The new bill does not in any way dilute the stringent provisions of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The registration of child marriage will not infringe the right to void the marriage given to the bride and groom in the Act,” the statement added. “In Rajasthan, 523 child marriages have been stopped in the state in the year 2019-20 and 160 in 2020-21,” it said.21-year-old Roopa Choudhary, who resisted marriage when she was 15, backed the new amendment as a means to prevent child marriages. “The new amendment is welcome.Compulsory registration will prevent child marriages and legal action can be taken against those who are getting it done,” she said.Now married, and working as a nurse in Jodhpur, Choudhary said: “If parents getting a minor married approach the authorities for a certificate, they will face legal action instantly.”BJP MLA and former state minister Vasudev Devnani said the child marriage bill is a violation of child rights. “The provisions in the bill will encourage child marriages. It is like legalising a crime. Only because they have mandate they cleared the bill but the governor has stopped it for further examination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-guv-stays-child-marriage-registration-101633372809890.html
05-10-2021||India||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal unveils plan to combat winter pollution||The national capital has drawn up an action plan to tackle the severe air pollution in the winter months, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday, announcing alternatives to stubble burning, measures to control road dust and vehicular emissions, and urging governments of neighbouring National Capital Region (NCR) states to adopt similar steps.As part of its 10-point plan, the Delhi government will help spraying a bio-decomposer -- developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR -- also known as Pusa Institute) -- which converts paddy stubble into manure without burning, in rural areas in the Capital. The burning of farm residue in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh ahead of sowing the winter crop releases large amounts of smoke, leading to an annual air emergency in the NCR. Kejriwal said these states must use the bio-decomposer as well.Except November, December and January, Delhi’s air quality is usually under control, Kejriwal said. “But this will change in a few days because the Centre and the neighbouring state governments have not done anything to prevent stubble burning in the region,” he added. “This will lead to Delhi’s air quality deteriorating in the coming days.”Besides steps to prevent stubble burning, authorities in Delhi will ensure dust from construction sites is kept to a minimum. There will be increased vigilance to keep vehicular emissions in check, the CM said.The action plan details steps such as forming pollution-monitoring teams and increased checks at hot spots. The government has formed 75 teams to ensure dust control at construction sites, 250 teams to prevent open burning of waste and leaves, and nearly 500 teams to ensure all vehicles comply with pollution under control rules. No diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years will be allowed to ply.The action plan has also identified 64 congestion-prone stretches in the Capital, where long traffic snarls resulted in a spike in pollution levels.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai early last month promised the city will have a detailed winter action plan. To formulate it, multiple agencies such as the municipal corporations, the public works department, and Delhi traffic police, were asked to submit their proposals to manage air pollution.The winter action plan will be implemented in tandem with the Supreme Court-mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).“The Grap measures will be enforced strictly this season across Delhi NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) will be the overarching body that will monitor the situation and will call in the measures listed under the Grap,” Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said.Delhi is on the right track in its strategy to control air pollution, but it needs concerted efforts to show results, an expert said.“In addition to the sources that the winter action plan tackles, the government should also ensure that Delhi’s urban poor have access to alternatives to using biomass for their space heating requirements,” said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a think tank. “One way could be through the creation of clean and warm night shelters.”“Given that Delhi now has a functional decision support system to pinpoint sources of pollution, the government should ensure that insights provided by it are used to plan and roll out actions in advance to prevent severe air quality levels in the city,” Ganguly said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), said that such focus on pollution will help Delhi bring down winter season emissions but there needs to be year-long action for noteworthy results. “The focus areas that the government has laid out are on-point, but we have discussed this before that Delhi needs action. We will have to ensure that not only do agencies in Delhi work but even other states in the region work together to find a lasting solution for the pollution problems,” Roychowdhury said.Air pollution has been a stubborn crisis for the Capital and adjoining areas. Meteorological parameters typical for pre-winter months, when wind speed slows down and colder, heavier air drifts settles closer to ground-level, stops tailpipe emissions, road and construction dust, and industrial gases from dispersing.To add to it, smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana catches the north-westerly winds to reach Delhi and other NCR towns, where they push the air quality index into dangerous levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-unveils-plan-to-combat-winter-pollution-101633372751016.html
05-10-2021||India||No ‘legal post-mortem’ into shortage of O2: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to order a nationwide investigation into the shortage of medical oxygen that reportedly led to several deaths during the second Covid-19 wave, emphasising that it may be convenient for some to criticise the government, but the top court will not conduct a “legal post mortem” of past events to “demoralise the authorities”.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna was emphatic that the role of the Supreme Court is to push for positive changes to deal with contingencies in the future, and that it was not interested in blaming the authorities, which have a very difficult task at hand in dealing with several crises.“It is very easy to criticise the government because they are in the hot seat and you are not... or for that matter even to criticise the court. At this point, should we do a legal post mortem of a particular scheme or past events, or do we bring about some positive things... like we have done by setting up a national task force (NTF)?” the bench asked advocate Medhanshu Tripathi.Tripathi was representing Delhi resident Naresh Kumar, who demanded a commission of inquiry, to be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, or a former chief justice of a high court, to inquire into various aspects of lack of medical facilities during the second wave of the pandemic. The plea also asked for a court-monitored investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), or a special investigation team to specifically probe the alleged lack of adequate availability of medical oxygen during the second Covid-19 wave in April-May this year.Of the total 25,088 confirmed deaths reported in Delhi due to Covid-19 since the start of the outbreak, a total of 13,210 or nearly 53% of the total tally, lost their lives in just April and May this year, during the peak of the second wave. In contrast, during August-September 2020, the two months when the first wave was at its peak, nearly 10 times fewer people died (1,398 in the two months).But the bench remained unequivocal that such an exercise at this point in time will only result in a blame game. “We don’t want this court to be used as an instrument to aim at someone else or to aim at some other plea. We are sceptical about entertaining such petitions under the garb of a PIL (public interest litigation). Health infrastructure has been inherited by governments in the last 100 years. It is very easy to blame those who are in positions of power today. But we can’t be acting on such assumptions,” the bench told Tripathi.The court regretted that doctors are often assaulted in various parts of the country because there is an assumption that if a patient dies, it is the doctor’s fault. “Your petition begins with similar assumptions and therefore, we cannot entertain it,” it said.The court remarked: “Let’s do something positive for the society like we tried to do through our orders on vaccination and on distribution of oxygen. We pass orders so that we are better equipped to deal with the contingencies in future. At this point when there are several important issues to be taken care of, we don’t want to demoralise the authorities.”As Tripathi argued that the court should ask NTF to also look into the shortage of medical oxygen, the bench retorted that the remit of the task force is very wide, and that the objective to constitute it was for preparing the country in a better way. “We don’t think any retired judge can do anything better than what eminent doctors can do as part of the task force,” it told the lawyer.The court dismissed the petition after recording that NTF, consisting of eminent doctors drawn from various institutions of the country, is already examining a spectrum of issues, including the supply of medical oxygen during the pandemic. About a CBI probe, the bench said the petitioner is at liberty to avail of remedies available under the Criminal Procedure Code to initiate a criminal investigation, but the court will not act just on allegations.On May 6, the Supreme Court set up a 12-member NTF to revamp the Centre’s formula for allocating medical oxygen to states, noting that the deficiencies in the oxygen allocation formula required to be rectified by devising a new method on a “scientific, rational and equitable basis”.The task force, which consists of 10 medical experts from across the country, was asked to devise a “public health response” mechanism, and to come up with a new formula of oxygen allocation; recommendations for augmentation of oxygen; measures necessary for ensuring the availability of essential drugs; best practices for management and treatment of Covid-19; measures to ensure adequate health care professionals; and outreach of expert medical care to rural areas.The task force was asked to submit its recommendations to the Supreme Court and to the Centre, which has to then take appropriate decisions. The apex court may also pass suitable orders based on these recommendations.The order was issued at a time when India was battling its worst wave of Covid-19 infections, overwhelming health care facilities across the country. The demand for medical oxygen was soaring, and several states were demanding more oxygen from the Centre, which was in charge of allocating what became the most precious medical commodity at that time.By a separate order on June 2, a Supreme Court bench, led by justice Chandrachud, also held as “prima facie arbitrary and irrational” the Union government’s coronavirus vaccination policy that put the onus of giving doses to adults in the below-45 years age group entirely on the states and private hospitals.Less than a week later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a major shift in the vaccination policy, stating that the Central government will resume procuring 75% of vaccines made in the country and will give them for free to the states from June 21 to vaccinate all adults in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-legal-post-mortem-into-shortage-of-o2-sc-101633372750424.html
05-10-2021||India||Lakhimpur stir called off as minister’s son booked||Police booked the son of India’s junior home minister for murder and criminal conspiracy in connection with the death of eight people in Lakhimpur Kheri, and the government announced a judicial probe on Monday in a bid to defuse spiraling tensions. The administration also announced compensation and acceded to several demands by farm groups led by Rakesh Tikait, prompting protesting farmers to end their agitation and agree to conduct the last rites of the deceased.Opposition politicians on Monday attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the violence in Tikunia village, where eight people – four of whom were farmers – died on Sunday in the bloodiest clash since protests against three central laws erupted last year. The deaths stoked violent demonstrations across north India on Monday.The farmers claimed Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni, mowed down four cultivators with his SUV during an agitation on Sunday, igniting violent protests.Ashish Mishra denied the charges, said he was not in the car, and blamed the farmers for torching vehicles and thrashing other people to death, including the car’s driver and two BJP workers. A local journalist also died in the violence.“The incident of running a vehicle over farmers protesting peacefully shows the state of lawlessness in the state. The farmer’s protest will not be deterred because of this incident,” said Tikait in a joint press conference with Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi and additional director general (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar.Lakhimpur Kheri superintendent of police Vijay Dhull said the FIR was filed against Ashish Mishra and 20others under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 302 for murder, 304-A for causing death due to reckless driving, 120-B for criminal conspiracy and 147 for rioting at the Tikunia police station.The complaint was filed by Jagjit Singh, a farmer. A second FIR booked unidentified people. Ajay Mishra was also mentioned in the first FIRbut as part of the narrative of the incident, not as an accused, added police.The government also announced that a retired high court judge will probe the violence and that the administration will give ₹45 lakh and a job to families of those killed and ₹10 lakh each to the injured.“We have assured them of strictest action against those involved behind the violence and deaths,” said Kumar. “The officials will be in touch with a committee of farmers to address other issues, if any,” he added.Violence broke out in the village of Tikunia – roughly 70kmfrom district headquarters Lakhimpur Kheri and barely 10km fromthe India-Nepal border – around 2.30pmon Sunday, minutes before Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya was to visit the area.Farmers assembled to oppose Maurya’s visit toBanbirpur, the hometown of Ajay Mishra, alleged that the minister’s son was driving a car that ploughed down four cultivators. The protesters then allegedly went on a rampage.Stating that farmers from across the country have lent support to them, farm leader Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), asked protesting farmers to clear the road after the government acceded to the demands of the farmers. “The government has agreed to our demands. This is a victory for all the farmers of the country. It is the first time that an FIR has been lodged against a Union minister in this government,” Tikait said.Late in the evening, Opposition leaders put out a video showing a vehicle ploughing into protesters.But Ajay Mishra denied all charges and said his son was not present at the spot. “Neither I nor my son was present at the spot when the violence broke out. Our car was diverted to a different route,” he told reporters in Lakhimpur Kheri.Ashish Mishra said farmers pelted stones at the convoy of three cars, which made the driver of one of the vehicles lose control. Farmers then set fire to two cars, pulled out two BJP workers and their driver from the vehicle and lynched them, he added.“BJP workers were attacked & killed with sticks & swords. Videos show some attackers asked our workers to say that I had asked them to mow down farmers. Allegations against my son are totally baseless. Had he been there, he would have been killed,” said Ajay Mishra. He urged chief minister Yogi Adityanath to conduct a “fair probe” by the Central Bureau of Investigation, Special Investigation Team or a retired or sitting judge.“I am ready to depose before any inquiry panel,” he added.The violence marked a deadly escalation in the nearly year-long agitation against three central laws that farmers say will erode state-support prices – a charge denied by the government. Farmers also vowed to widen their movement.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha – the umbrella body coordinating the protests – said demonstrations were held in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, West BengalSeveral Opposition politicians attempted to go to Tikunia village but were stopped by the state government, which clamped prohibitory orders, detained senior leaders and refused permission for other politicians to land.In Lucknow, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav said that not letting opposition leaders go to the district to meet the grieving families of farmers was nothing short of a fascist attitude. “We want the arrest of the minister and his son in the Lakhimpur incident,” he said.“The BJP government is doing the politics of crushing the farmers and finishing them,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted.Officials said political leaders such as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Akhilesh Yadav were not allowed in Lakhimpur Kheri because prohibitory orders were in place, adding that Tikait and other farmer leaders were allowed for negotiations. Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh termed the Opposition move to go to Lakhimpur a “political stunt”.Singh in a statement said: “We are taking the matter seriously and it is under investigation. CM has said the culprits will be punished. Opposition is using the incident for political tourism and political competition as polls are around the corner”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-stir-called-off-as-minister-s-son-booked-101633372748591.html

Naidu was in Meghalaya capital Shillong to address a workshop organised by the North Eastern Council (NEC) on “Changing Role of North-Eastern Council in the Development of North-Eastern Region”.Police said the bag was spotted near the NPP office; wires jutting out. The Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) was promptly summoned.The bag contained about 5kgs of gelatin sticks neatly packed in a paint container. It did not explode due to faulty wiring. The East Khasi Hills Crime Scene Unit (CSU) later took over the area to gather forensic evidence.“On searching the bag, it was found that it contained crude improvised device which was instantly defused by the BDDS team,” a police communique said. A First Information Report (FIR) was filed at the Laitumkhrah police station against members of the proscribed outfit who claimed responsibility for planting the explosive in front of the NPP office.In a Facebook post, Saiñkupar Nongtraw, a self-styled acting general secretary and spokesperson of the outfit, claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing.Nongtraw blamed the ruling dispensation for the death of its former founding general secretary Cherish Starfield Thangkhiew in an encounter, and claimed the failed attempt was designed to avenge his death which he described as “a complete political conspiracy by some ministers of the state of Meghalaya”.The rebel leader also asked NPP members and party workers in Khasi and Jaiñtia hills to resign immediately within a month.The Meghalaya government had earlier ordered a judicial inquiry into Thangkhiew’s death., who was allegedly killed in an encounter last week, said a government order.Meghalaya home minister Lahkmen Rymbui asked chief minister Conrad K Sangma to relieve him from the responsibility to oversee the Home (Police) Department from his post on August 15. “I hereby express shock to the incident where (L) Chesterfield Thangkhiew was killed following the raid of police at his residence exceeding the lawful tenets of the law,” Rymbui, who also holds charge of education, border areas development and district council affairs, said in his letter to the chief minister. The offer to resign from the home portfolio has not been accepted yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5kg-gelatin-sticks-found-in-bag-near-shillong-s-npp-office-fir-against-hnlc-101633368188757.html
05-10-2021||India||Reading another set of high frequency numbers on the Indian economy||What is the state of the Indian economy as it enters into the second half of the fiscal year 2021-22? One set of high frequency numbers on economic activity, such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index, Nomura India Business Resumption Index, etc., look good (see bit.ly/2YkH8E0).But these numbers might not be telling us the entire story for two reasons. One, they are skewed towards the formal sector of the economy. And two, they do not take into account headwinds to growth from avenues such as external trade. This is why it makes sense to look at another set of statistics, which look at India’s external trade, capital investment, etc. Here are four charts that explain this argument.Can exports lead the post-Covid growth story?When the June quarter GDP numbers were released in August, there was a lot of enthusiasm about the role of exports in India’s post Covid-19 growth trajectory. There was a valid reason for this. India’s exports, at ₹7.68 lakh crore (in 2011-12 prices) in the June quarter were not just above the pre-pandemic level of ₹7.07 lakh crore of the June 2019 quarter, but also almost at par with the all-time high figure of quarterly exports (March 2019 quarter). That exports increased between the March and June quarters despite the disruption inflicted by the second wave of Covid-19, which led to a quarter-on-quarter decline in other macroeconomic aggregates, generated a lot of optimism around tailwinds from exports to overall growth.A June analysis in these pages looked at the promise of export-driven growth in India and argued that any assessment about the net impact of foreign trade on GDP growth must include the role of imports as well (see bit.ly/3Fed6Tc).The latest trade numbers underline this point. India’s trade deficit in September reached an all-time high of $22.9 billion, thanks to a sharp rise in imports, which jumped to a record $56.4 billion. While a rise in oil prices has played a big role in the rising deficit, it is not the only reason. Exports have stalled as well, triggering an increase in the non-oil deficit.“The increase in oil imports was not due to price effects but rather reflects a sharp jump in import volumes, despite a more gradual domestic recovery. We believe this may have been due to lagged/bunched up oil import contracts or inventory restocking and see this as anomalous. However, the underlying trend of the widening trade and current account deficit is likely to continue, driven by higher oil and other global commodity prices, the domestic growth upcycle and an overhang on exports due to global supply bottlenecks in the near term and softer demand next year,” said a note by Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi, economists at Nomura Global Markets Research. “We expect the current account to swing from a surplus of 0.9% of GDP in Q2 to a deficit of 1.8% of GDP in Q3 2021 (July-September).”Is private investment finally picking up?The biggest question around economic recovery is whether the investment cycle has picked up. This is especially relevant because fiscal policy, at least at the level of the union government, has clearly adopted a pro-capital expenditure rather than an income-support approach. The latter could have given a cushion to consumption demand.Latest investment numbers from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) do not inspire confidence on the capex or investment front. The value of new investment announcements was just ₹1.1 lakh crore in the quarter ended September 30, which is not just a sharp fall from ₹2.5 lakh crore in June 2021 quarter, but also a significant slump from the ₹2.6 lakh crore for the September 2020 quarter. The value of investment projects completed was ₹0.8 lakh crore, which is only marginally higher than ₹0.7 lakh crore in the June 2021 quarter. Fall in new private investment announcements is much larger than the headline number. The number went down from ₹2 lakh crore to ₹0.9 lakh crore between the June and September quarters.The fact that private investment and investment announcements – the latter are a good indicator of business sentiment – are not picking up underlines the lack of momentum for economic growth.Recovery in consumer sentiment is the most crucial factorTo be sure, one could argue that the third fiscal quarter (October-December) might turn out to be different. Not only is there likely to be increased festive demand, but India’s vaccination programme has also been doing well. As of 7pm on October 4, India fully vaccinated 27% of its adult population and another 44% of the population had received the first dose. It can be argued that neither a higher trade deficit nor sluggish capex numbers will pose a challenge for growth. Indian businesses have high levels of excess capacity and trade has not been a significant driver of economic growth in the recent past.However, positive sentiment is essential for a festive, demand-driven growth story to materialise. This is where consumer confidence comes into play. The Reserve Bank of India’s Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) shows that there was hardly any recovery in consumer sentiment between May and July. The September round CCS figures will be released on October 8, along with the Monetary Policy Committee resolution. However, the CMIE consumer sentiment index does not show a significant improvement even in September. If RBI’s CCS findings are in sync with that, there is good reason to be circumspect about any pleasant surprises on the economic front even in the December quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reading-another-set-of-high-frequency-numbers-on-the-economy-101633359728172.html

05-10-2021||India||Bengal governor withdraws assembly speaker’s power to administer oath||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has withdrawn assembly speaker Biman Banerjee’s power to administer the oath of office to the members of the state legislature, potentially opening up another front in the long-running battle between the state’s top constitutional authority and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government.“A note from Raj Bhawan reached the office of the speaker some days before the assembly bypoll to Kolkata’s Bhabanipur and two seats in Murshidabad district on Sunday. The letter cited Section 188 of the Constitution, which empowers the governor to administer the oath,” said a state assembly official, requesting anonymity. A Raj Bhawan official who asked not to be named confirmed that such a note was sent in mid-September. The by-elections were held on September 30.To continue as chief minister, TMC president Mamata Banerjee, who won the Bhabanipur seat by a record margin on Sunday, needs to be sworn in as a member of the assembly by November 4. TMC leaders said she wants the formalities to be completed before the Durga Puja festival which is a week away. Banerjee, who was defeated in the March-April assembly polls from Nandigram, was sworn in as chief minister on May 5, giving her six months to be elected to the legislature.Because of the governor’s decision, the TMC government could not carry out its original plan to hold Banerjee’s oath-taking ceremony on Monday. On October 1, the government wrote to the governor, asking him to authorise the speaker to conduct the programme, but he sought a gazette notification on the Bhabanipur bypoll results.Bengal’s parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee and minister Tapas Roy, the assembly’s deputy chief whip, met the speaker on Monday and decided to send a formal request to the governor to come to the assembly on October 7 and administer the oath of office to Mamata Banerjee and the two other legislators, Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam.They also decided to issue a gazette notification on the Bhabanipur results.“We have formally requested the governor to administer the oath before noon on October 7. We hope that once the notification is issued, he will come to the assembly house and administer the oath of office to the chief minister and the two legislators,” Chatterjee said on Monday afternoon.At 7.30 pm on Monday, the governor issued a statement on Twitter.Saying that he had gone through the note the government sent to him on October 1, Dhankhar wrote: “The practice and the proceedings at the level of the assembly and the government have apparently emanated under misconception of law. Once in terms of the legal regime applicable, the result of the by-election is gazetted, the matter would, through appropriate channel be brought to my notice where under a call as deemed appropriate under Article 188 of the Constitution would be taken. In this premise, as and when issuance of the gazette notification by the applicable legal regime is effected, a call will be taken as aforestated.”Former principal of Presidency College and constitutional expert Amal Mukhopadhyay said, “I am surprised. The governor cannot take such a decision. Since 1952, the custom has been that governors authorise assembly speakers to administer the oath of office to legislators. The Constitution also says that the governor will place the budget or entrust someone. But according to convention, none other than the finance minister presents the budget. The same applies to the Union budget.”The acrimonious relationship between the state government and Dhankar has been in display repeatedly since he took over as the governor in July 2019. TMC leaders said on condition of anonymity that Dhankhar’s latest move may trigger a fresh row -- with CM Banerjee and the speaker.Speaker Biman Banerjee and the governor recently clashed over the latter’s request for a live telecast of his speech at the assembly. The speaker did not allow this. The speaker has also complained that Dhankhar was interfering in his work. In a strongly worded letter sent to the speaker on September 15, the governor said: “Under Article 176 of the Constitution, I addressed the assembly on February 7, 2020, and July 2, 2021. On both occasions, in an ‘emergency’ kind of situation, the address was blacked out.”“I would urge you to engage in soul-searching, believe in constitutional essence and spirit, and dictate the actions and conduct duly mindful of constitutional prescriptions and propriety demanded by the office you hold,” he addedThe assembly official cited above said the letter from Raj Bhawan noted that it is the governor who is empowered to administer the oath of office to ministers and legislators. “While the governor administers the oath of office to ministers at Raj Bhawan, the speaker acts as the governor’s representative when legislators are sworn in at the assembly. Raj Bhawan has withdrawn that permission,” said the official. “The letter said the Constitution empowers the President of India or his representative to administer the oath of office to members of the Parliament. The letter pointed out that the President delegates this power to the Lok Sabha speaker.”Article 188 deals with oath or affirmation of lawmakers. “Every member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of a State shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the Governor, or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule.”Biman Banerjee refused to comment on the issue. Officials said Mamata Banerjee called up the speaker on Monday and people from her office were in touch with Raj Bhawan regarding her swearing in as a member of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-withdraws-assembly-speaker-s-power-to-administer-oath-to-lawmakers-101633348567645.html

He was 63. An Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of the 1979 batch of the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory cadre, popularly known as AGMUT, Sinha was considered an influential member of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) during the Vajpayee regime, where he was a joint secretary in the late 1990s. Sinha was Vajpayee’s private secretary from 1998 to 2000. A career bureaucrat, Sinha took voluntary retirement from service in 2013 after stepping down as finance secretary in the Delhi government. Describing his stint in Delhi as “challenging,” Sinha had said he wanted to work outside the government. “Differences of opinions are common at any workplace and I feel it is healthy. I’m not quitting because of any differences, but because I want to do something new,” Sinha had said, remarking on his reasons for quitting on August 11, 2013. “I want to focus my energy on issues such as economic policy and governance.”Sinha was a postgraduate in history from Delhi University. At Nehru Memorial, he oversaw the Museum of Prime Ministers project, among others. He took charge of the memorial in 2016. His funeral was held at the Lodhi Road crematorium in the capital.Many condoled his passing. “Shocked to hear about Shakti Sinha’s demise. He was a member of the Governing Board of India Foundation and was scheduled to address a conference going on at Leh this afternoon. A humble and unassuming yet erudite and intellectual being… a great loss. Deepest condolences,” Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ram Madhav tweeted. “Very very sad to hear about the untimely demise of Shakti Sinha, go back into memory lane and many years of Theatre in Education Company at the National school of Drama were greatly helped by Shakti ji as he was the Education Secretary in Delhi those days,” tweeted Vani Tripathi Tikoo, a member of the Central Board of Film Certification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-nehru-memorial-museum-director-shakti-sinha-passes-away-101633345386981.html
