10-10-2021||Delhi||South Delhi open-air dining plan stays indoors as fire law confusion hits policy||New Delhi: The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) launched its open air dining policy for restaurants under the civic body’s jurisdiction in September last year. However, till date, the corporation has given out only 69 licences -- with only 12 establishments getting the licences in the past four months. Officials of the civic body aware of the matter said the policy failed to take off at the expected pace because of confusion over the fire safety certificate provision. A senior official from the public health department of the civic body explained that a fire safety certificate is a must for all establishments applying for open air dining spaces. Though most of them were able to get the no-objection certificate (NOC) from Delhi Fire Services (DFS) for eateries on the ground floor, space on open terrace remains a sticking point. Restaurant owners said that DFS doesn’t issue NOCs for open terrace, and the fire department has said that the SDMC should get third party safety rules audit for terrace areas since they do not have enough staff to get inspections done. “Fire NOC is a precondition for open-air dining licence and owners are not able to secure it which is leading to very few prospective licensees approaching us. The Delhi Fire Services has asked them to make provisions like water sprinklers, staircases, hosepipes, etc. So far, licenses have been mostly issued to establishments located on ground-floor,” the SDMC official said.The National Restaurant Association of India representatives say that the policy should be amended to resolve the confusion over fire NOC condition for terraces. Sandeep Anand Goyle, managing committee member of National Restaurant Association of India, said that several meetings have been held between DFS, industry representatives and SDMC officials to resolve the issue. “This is a technical flaw in the policy. DFS is telling us that there is no provision of issuing fire NOC for open spaces while SDMC has made it into a precondition. Either the policy should be revised or the civic body may adopt suggestion by fire officials that the existing fire NOCs can be extended to the adjacent open spaces under some conditions like 25% vacant space, two stair cases, etc,” he added. Goyle said it was not clear that who among the two departments would take this responsibility of issuing the clearance. The Delhi Fire Service, in a letter to the municipal health officer of SDMC, suggested that the enforcement of guidelines should be verified by the municipal corporation. “In a joint meeting held in March 2021, the representatives of DFS have stated that they have limited manpower, and they are not able to issue NOC to terraces for which third party inspections may be carried out,” an SDMC official said. In a response to the request from SDMC arguing that DFS should continue to issue fire NOC to terraces, the DFS director had stated in a letter dated March 11, 2021 that the safety guidelines should be verified by SDMC and no further NOC is required from the department.DFS director Atul Garg said the of open-air dining policy was sent for their consideration. “We have told the corporation that our inspection should not be made mandatory. The establishments which have taken NOC for the covered portion can extend the same safety conditions such as equipment and staircase regulations to the open space as well. Why should the fire officials visit them again,” Garg said.The zone wise distribution of open-air dining licenses shows that 29 have been granted in the Najafgarh zone, 27 in the South zone and 10 in the Central zone. The lowest number of such establishments in under the West zone where three such open air eateries are currently operational. SDMC official said that some of area and establishments where outdoor dining licenses have been issued are located in places such as Aerocity, India Habitat Center, Aurobindo Marg, outlets in Kapashera, Dwarka, Rajouri garden, Hauz Khas and Green Park.Goyle said, “The concept of open air dining policy is good and the industry has been pushing for it for the past 15 years.” According to the policy approved in September last year, open-air dining is allowed only in restaurants with a health trade licence, and where there is an open space such as a rooftop which is private property. Recently, the north and east corporation have also adopted a similar policy. The policy states that there should be no encroachments on public lands, footpaths or roadsides. No cooking is allowed in an open area and a liquor licence is mandatory to serve alcoholic beverages in open areas, officials stated. Structural safety certificates from a certified engineer and fire NOC from Delhi Fire Services is mandatory. The fee for this licence varies from Rs100-200 per sqm. Before the pandemic hit last year, south Delhi had 2,000 big and small eateries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/south-delhi-open-air-dining-plan-stays-indoors-as-fire-law-confusion-hits-policy-101633890120343.html

Therefore, he was not allowing her to visit the aggrieved families in Lakhimpur Kheir. Speaking at the Kisan Nyay Rally, Baghel said, “I believe that sadhus and saints are not afraid of anyone. But Yogi Adityanath is scared of our leader Priyanka Gandhi who fought for the rights of the farmers. Therefore, he deployed police to stop her from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri. Yogi is also scared of farmers and opposition leaders.” Baghel said that the BJP took votes in the name of cows. But the BJP-led government didn’t serve cows well. Rather, the Congress government in Chhattisgarh was serving the cows well. “We are purchasing cow dung at ₹2 per kg and making vermi-compost . Now we have started making electricity from that,” he said. Bhaghel hoped that when the assembly elections were held in UP, the government would definitely be formed under the leadership of Priyanka Gandhi. He said Kashi was the land of Baba Vishwanath. People visited this place to seek answers to their questions. UP elections would give answers to questions of people, including poor, farmers, downtrodden and youths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-sought-votes-in-cows-name-but-did-not-serve-them-well-baghel-101633889160294.html
10-10-2021||Lucknow||UP BJP chief says politics is meant for serving people, not crushing them under Fortuner||Highlighting the qualities of a good leader, Uttar Pradesh (UP) Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Sunday said politics is “meant to serve the people, not to crush them under Fortuner.”He said this while addressing cadres of the BJP minority wing at the Scientific Convention Centre in Lucknow on Sunday. The UP BJP chief’s remarks came a day after Ashish Mishra, son of union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, was arrested on Saturday night. He was earlier named as an accused in the case of killing of four farmers who were allegedly run over by a car in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. Farmer groups and Opposition leaders have claimed that the minister’s son was also there in the car that ran over people, triggering violence that left four more dead though Ashish has consistently denied the charge. Addressing the meeting of BJP’s minority cell, the UP BJP chief said: “Joining politics doesn’t mean engaging in corruption or to rob people. It doesn’t mean running people under Fortuner. Your behaviour will fetch votes. I would feel elated if people of the lane in which you live praise you. That’s why we work in the party. .. not to scare neighbours and make them hide on seeing you.” The UP BJP chief also highlighted how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has focused on clean politics, ensured the poor have a bank account and other basic amenities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-bjp-chief-says-politics-is-meant-for-serving-people-not-crushing-them-under-fortuner-101633888921723.html

10-10-2021||Noida||Noida: Drive against vehicles without HSRP begins, offenders to pay ₹5,000 fine||Days after the Uttar Pradesh government set a deadline on September 30 to ensure vehicles in the state have installed high security registration plates (HSRP), the transport department has planned to launch an enforcement drive against all such vehicles found without the device from Monday and fine them up to ₹5,000. The traffic police will also impound diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years in Noida in compliance with a Supreme Court order. The action comes after the district administration shot a letter to the police department on Wednesday asking it to work on an action plan to check pollution in winter. It also directed the police to ensure non-destined goods vehicles (those passing through Noida but having no business here) use bypasses and peripheral highways.High security registration plates (HSRPs) are a new type of number plates made of aluminium, which are tamper-proof and come with two non-reusable locks. One will have to remove the lock to remove the number plate and once broken, a new HSRP has to be purchased. The vehicle identification number is laser encoded, which is easy to scan and difficult to tamper with. HSRPs are mandatory because they primarily help in tracking stolen vehicles. Old number plates come with number stickers that can be easily removed and the vehicle identification number can be changed. Mostly, all stolen vehicles end up with replaced number plates, which makes it difficult to track them. HSRP prevents counterfeiting of number plates.  Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement), Gautam Budh Nagar, said the transport department raised awareness programme for the HSRPs in the last few months. “We held awareness drives at our office and on the roads and also gave flowers to violators. But now the deadline has lapsed. We have planned to conduct an enforcement drive and fine violators up to ₹5,000 for not installing HSRP,” he said. There are around 7.87 lakh registered vehicles in the district, of which 4.50 lakh vehicles are running without HSRPs. The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has mandated all vehicles sold in India before April 2019 to install HSRP. Those registered after the aforementioned date already come with HSRPs. Information like engine number, chassis number, and other relevant details are required to issue such number plates. Manish Shrivastava, general manager (sales) Ace Honda in Sector 11, said his agency gets 10-12 requests for installing HSRP per day. “Last year, the demand was relatively high; we got up to 150 bookings per day. It seems like most people have installed HSRP. There may be some who are yet to install it on their vehicles,” said Shrivastava. Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of Sector 51 RWA and the owner of five cars, said all his vehicles are fitted with HSRPs. “We had come to know that HSRPs have been made mandatory. This May, we organised a camp in our sector and asked residents to install HSRPs on their vehicles. Most residents have got the HSRPs installed; we are urging others to get the devices fixed onto their vehicles to avoid penalty,” said Kumar. Meanwhile, there are some people from other states living in Noida who are facing problems in getting HSRPs. Vaibhav Balodhi, a native of Uttarakhand currently staying in Greater Noida west, said, “I have a registration number of Uttarakhand on my motorcycle. I tried to book the HSRP for my motorcycle but failed as the websites only show booking slots for Delhi and UP registered vehicles. I contacted the local transport department, who asked me to personally visit them to get it done. I work in Noida and it is difficult to go to Uttarakhand by vehicle. I have not got the HSRP yet,” he said. Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha 1 in Greater Noida, said the government should extend the deadline for fitting HSRPs. “A number of people are financially and morally drained after the Covid-19 pandemic. Punishing them by slapping a fine of ₹5,000 is not logical. The HSRPs are meant to check theft and counterfeiting of vehicles. But there is no guarantee that the HSRP fitted vehicles will not be stolen,” he said.Talking about the drive against old vehicles that will also be launched on Monday, Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said old vehicles plying in Noida will be impounded. “Those non-destined vehicles using Noida roads will also be impounded if the drivers fail to provide a valid reason. “A person will be allowed to let go only if he can provide a valid reason,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-drive-against-vehicles-without-hsrp-begins-offenders-to-pay-5-000-fine-101633888380234.html
10-10-2021||Patna||Power crunch hits Bihar; govt pays ₹20 crore more a day to buy power||Bihar has been paying an additional ₹20 crore daily for the past couple of days to purchase power from open market during Dussehra but is still not getting as much to meet its peak load demand of 5,500 MW as the coal-fired utilities, supplying power to the state, are facing coal shortage, said power officials. Union power minister RK Singh, however, denied a scarcity in any state. “We have an average coal reserve (at power stations) that can last for more than four days. The stock is replenished every day. I am in touch with (Union minister for coal, mines and parliamentary affairs) Pralhad Joshi,” he said after chairing a meeting with discoms in New Delhi on Sunday, reported ANI. Bihar’s power crisis, however, has been accentuated because of multiple reasons. First, the Central sector, which supplies thermal power to the state through the NTPC, has been able to feed around 3,000-3,300 MW power against its scheduled allocation of 4,500 MW. The reduced power supply is attributed to the shutdown of the 660 MW unit 5 of the Barh Super Thermal Power Project due to maintenance and shortage of coal at the Farakka and the Kahalgaon Super Thermal Power Projects, where coal was at a critical level to last for around four days, against an average buffer stock of 7-10 days at power stations. If government sources were to be believed, the average daily availability of coal was 0.7 to 0.8 lakh metric tonne (MT) against a demand of 1.2 lakh MT at NTPC power plants supplying power to Bihar. Secondly, private players are unable to meet the increased demand of thermal power across the country, primarily due to steep hike in coal prices in the international market due to its shortage. Sample this. The power buy quantum in open market at the national level was 10,000 MW against an availability of 2,700 MW and 4,500 MW on October 8 and 9, respectively. Given the high demand and low supply, the power purchase rate had shot up to ₹20 per unit against an average cost of ₹3- ₹5 earlier. In fact, the price was hovering between ₹12 and ₹16 per unit for the last 10 days, said officials quoted above. To meet its deficit, Bihar was still bidding at a high rate and spending an additional ₹20 crore per day to purchase power through private sources. This was in addition to its average monthly bill of ₹800 crore to the NTPC for supply of thermal power from central sector. Yet, it was unable to get the required quantity of power. The state was getting only around 347 MW to 397 MW over the last couple of days against 688 MW power purchase agreement through private players, said an officer in the know of the subject. Similarly, the state was also short of hydel and wind power. It was getting 453 MW hydel power against an allocation of 762 MW. Add to it the shortfall in wind energy. Against 580 MW, the state was getting between 50 MW and 175 MW wind power over the last few days. Put together, these have led to a power scarcity, leading to an average power outage of 4 to 8 hours a day, especially in rural areas of the state. “Bihar’s power firms do not generate electricity. Instead, they buy power from central power generation institutions and supply to consumers. Given the current coal crisis, we are getting expensive power, but are supplying electricity to consumers at a cheaper rate,” the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) tweeted from its handle, quoting Sanjeev Hans, Bihar’s energy secretary, on Saturday. Another tweet on Sunday, quoting Hans said, “Power supply has been improving constantly. There has been a reduction in the open market price. We are now buying power at ₹14- ₹16 per unit. The situation is returning to normal. We will soon be able to ensure availability of power commensurate to its demand.” Bihar’s power demand goes up by 250-300 MW during the festival season of Dussehra and Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/power-crunch-hits-bihar-govt-pays-rs-20-crore-more-a-day-to-buy-power-101633888320261.html

The continuing agitation might worsen the financial situation of the corporation and also affect the power supply in the state which, he said, would not be in the public interest.He said the management always stood with employees’ reasonable demands and would do its best to resolve the same through a dialogue.Meanwhile, amid the prevailing power crisis triggered by the coal shortage, UP Rajya Vidyut Ubhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma called on energy minister Shrikant Sharma appealing him to find a solution to the coal crunch to rid consumers of load shedding.“The minister assured us that efforts were being made on a war footing to normalise coal supply to thermal plants. He also assured us that no plants will be allowed to shut because of coal crunch,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/end-stir-seek-solution-via-talks-uppcl-chairman-to-engineers-101633888263385.html

But when it comes to acting responsibly and motivating people in her village, she is a champion. Koushika has been motivating the girls of her village to go to school. She also tells them about personal hygiene and nutrition and ensures that the girls attend the Kishori Baithak (meetings held for adolescent girls in her village). Another girl Srishti, 18, is a menstrual hygiene champion. After attending numerous trainings on the subject, she now trains the girls of her village about personal hygiene and has also succeeded in breaking the taboos around periods within her family and in her village. Today, young girls contact her for all their problems and Srishti guides them about the right hygiene practices.Koushika and Srishti are SeVa Dal leaders! Natives of Sewapuri block of Varanasi, there are more than 260 similar leaders who are changing mind-set and motivating people of their villages.“Over 260 girls of Sewapuri block of Varanasi were selected by the district administration in 2020 to be SeVa Dal leaders. These girls were selected from among the 87 gram panchayats in the block. Three girls from every village are selected and trained for health, nutrition, education and hygiene. These girls are well-versed in all the government schemes and the right health, nutrition and hygiene practices,” said district magistrate of Varanasi Kaushal Raj Sharma. “A number of problems came up during the Covid times. Supply of sanitary pads remained affected and with all members of the family staying at home, girls really struggled to manage their periods and other related health issues. Education remained affected and health of adolescent girls’ too remained a concern. But these SeVa Dal leaders have really managed to ensure that adolescent girls and children do not face any such problems,” said Madhushree Pandey, director of Sarthak Foundation, a non-profit organisation working on health issues in and around Varanasi. The leaders support nutrition in a big way. They make sure that all adolescent girls get their iron supplements and also contribute to the poshan vatika. “Young girls really look up to us, even those who are prepared well in advance so that they do not panic when they get their periods. Similarly, when girls have some other health issue and hesitate to share it at home, we take them to Kishori Baithak where they get answers to all their queries,” said Arti, a SeVa Dal leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/adolescent-girls-breaking-taboo-around-health-and-hygiene-101633888261429.html

10-10-2021||Lucknow||Danish PM visits Taj Mahal, calls it beautiful||Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her husband Bo Tengberg visited the Taj Mahal on Sunday morning described it as a beautiful place. They were accompanied by a delegation and visited Agra Fort also before flying back to Delhi in the afternoon. The Danish PM, along with her husband Bo Tengberg and a film director, reached the Taj Mahal in eco-friendly vehicles at about 9.00 am and stayed there for about one-and-a-half hour. The official guide took the guests all along while detailing history and architectural importance of the seventeenth century monument. “On behalf of Danish delegation…Thank you so much,” wrote an impressed Danish PM in the visitors’ book placed by officials of Archaeological Survey of India at the Royal Gate of Taj Mahal. “This place is beautiful…. and symbol for the whole world,” she added. The VVIP cavalcade then reached Agra Fort and the guests spent about an hour there and had photographs clicked before moving back at 11.45 am on Sunday. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort remained closed for public till the VVIP visit got over. The visitors left Agra airport at about 2.15 pm. Traffic movement was diverted in city and no vehicle was allowed towards Agra Fort on Sunday morning. Three layered-security arrangements were made with the assistance of 4 IPS officers, 17 circle officers leading a team of around a thousand police personnel deployed in the VVIP security. Earlier, the Denmark PM and her spouse were welcomed at the Agra airport by UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma when they landed there at 8.30pm on Saturday night. Besides Shrikant Sharma, ADG (Agra zone) Ajay Anand; commissioner, Agra division, Amit Gupta and Agra DM Prabhu N Singh welcomed the couple accompanied by a 25-member delegation.

Kelwa Police are yet to file a first information report (FIR) into the cheating plaints made by the youths. The victims were allegedly given fake tourist visas and flight tickets and were turned away by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) at Kochi airport in December 2018.NCB has named Gosavi as a witness in Aryan’s case. It has been revealed that Gosavi, who is also a private detective, has allegedly cheated many youths, made them work abroad and embezzled millions of rupees. Four FIRS have already been registered against him in various police stations in Maharashtra.Gosavi had allegedly accepted ₹1.65 lakh from the youth – Utkarsh Tare and Adarsh Kini – through online bank transfers, for employing them in a reputed hotel chain in Kuala Lumpur. “We paid the money online to Gosavi who runs a company from Navi Mumbai,” said Tare.“We came in contact with him through social media after he posted job avenues in Malaysia and fell into the trap,” said Kini. “My parents mortgaged their gold jewellery and paid the money to Gosavi for flight tickets and visa. When we reached Kochi airport in December 2018 we were turned away by CISF as the tickets and visas were fake. We returned to Palghar and since then, Gosavi has not been accepting our calls for the refund,” said Tare.“Many young people like me are more likely to be cheated. Gosavi should be caught by the police and legal action should be taken against him,” Tare added.Assistant inspector Bhimsen Gaikwad of Kelwe Coastal police station said he joined the police station last November 2020 and has no clue about the delay in filing the FIR. “But we are investigating the case and will register an FIR against Gosavi,” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-raid-ncb-witness-whose-selfie-with-aryan-khan-went-viral-has-cheating-complaints-against-him-in-palghar-101633887719997.html
10-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: 25% cess on constructions around stations of RRTS project||Any construction, be it commercial, residential or other, will be a costly affair under the seven influence zones and special development areas (SDAs) which have been defined around the stations and the alignment of the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project. Officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) said that anyone taking up constructions in the SDAs or the influence zones along the RRTS corridor will have to pay up special cess which will be 25% over and above the regular development charges. “The proposal for the special cess/charges has been discussed at the state government level and a notification will soon be issued. In Modinagar and Muradnagar, the authority charges ₹1,200 per square metres as development fee while it is ₹3,400 per square metres for the Ghaziabad city area. So, the special charges will be 25% over and above the development rate,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner. The Centre as well as the GDA has already notified the influence zones and SDAs. According to the officials, the influence zones will be 1.5km radius zones around the seven RRTS stations being developed at Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, Muradnagar, Modinagar (South) and Modinagar (North). Likewise, the two SDAs have also been defined at Guldhar and Duhai on the Delhi-Meerut Road along the RRTS alignment and will have an area of 250 hectares and 400 hectares, respectively. Under the two types of zones, the GDA will permit mixed land use constructions with commercial and residential set-ups. “Since the influence zones and SDAs have been notified, the map clearances will be done through the permission of the authority, and any such constructions taken up alongside the Delhi-Meerut Road will need prior approval of the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) which is developing the RRTS project,” Shivpuri added. The NCRTC is using the median of the road for construction of the RRTS project. The NCRTC is developing the 82km RRTS corridor from Delhi to Meerut, and one of its parts, a 17km stretch called as priority section, is getting developed from Sahibabad to Duhai in Ghaziabad. This stretch will become operational in 2023 while the entire 82km route will be commissioned in March 2025. The entire 82km corridor of the project is pegged at ₹30,274 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-25-cess-on-constructions-around-stations-of-rrts-project-101633887663587.html
10-10-2021||Noida||Durga Puja celebration a low-key affair in Noida amid Covid pandemic||The five-day celebrations of Durga Puja in Noida will start on Monday without usual fanfare. Following the government’s guidelines in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, major puja committees in the city have decided to keep the celebration a low-key affair.Organisers said that they have restricted the number of visitors to 100 in a day and that they will be streaming puja rituals online. The muted Durga Puja festivities will start from Monday with shashthi puja and end on Friday with Vijayadashmi. In the pre-Covid times, major puja pandals in the city used to attract hundreds of visitors in a day. The Noida Kalibari Durga Puja will be held at the community hall in Sector 26. This year will mark the 38th ‘Durgotsava’ to be organised by the Noida Durga Puja Samiti. “There will be no theme for the pandal nor any food stalls this year. We have also cut down on our usual budget of ₹60-70 lakh during pre-Covid times. This year the celebrations are being organised within a budget of ₹15 lakh,” said Anupam Bannerjee, a member of the Noida Durga Puja Samiti.Sector 61’s Balaka Bengali Cultural Association is celebrating its 13th year of ‘Durgotsav’ but without any pomp and show as was the norm in pre-Covid times. “We used to get huge sponsorships and hold cultural events, but this time association members are themselves arranging the funds required to hold a simple puja. All the rituals will be streamed online and we have discouraged residents from coming to the pandal,” said a member of the association who did not wish to be named.In order to restrict entry of visitors, the Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee in Sector 34 will be issuing passes to only 100 visitors. “The Durga Puja celebrations this year will be restricted for just 100 people and in order to ensure this, we have issued passes for entry to the pandal that has been set up at the community hall of the area. The prasad will be distributed among the guests in small boxes,” said Tarun Bagchi, a member of the Sector 34 puja committee.The big Durga idols will also not be an attraction at the pandals this year as idols have been restricted to a height of five feet, as per the government guidelines. The Jalvayu Vihar Sanskritik Kalyan Samiti will be celebrating its 29th year of Durga Puja at the puja ground in Sector 25. “This time there will not be any theme associated with the puja. Besides, the idol of the goddess would be smaller in size. To make the idol, eco-friendly materials like clay, bamboo, and rice husk have been used,” said Jaya De, one of the organisers at the Sector 25 samiti.However, there is a silver lining too. According to 52-year-old Vipul Sarkar, who has been in the business of making Durga idols in Noida for the past 20 years, he is doing better business this year compared to last year.“Last year we only got about 10 orders for Durga idols. However, this time we have got around 50 orders from different organisers not only in Noida but nearby areas like Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Mayur Vihar. All the idols’ height has been restricted to five feet. We hope by next year the pandemic will be over and celebrations will be back to its pre-Covid times,” said Sarkar, whose workshop is in Nithari village of Noida.Police said that proper implementation of Covid protocols will be ensured at the pandals. “Police patrolling will take place around the puja pandals in the city to ensure Covid protocols are followed. Police force will be on alert throughout the five days of the puja, especially on the day of the idol immersion,” said Rannvijay Singh, additional DCP, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/durga-puja-celebration-a-low-key-affair-in-noida-amid-covid-pandemic-101633887660413.html
10-10-2021||Noida||City bus service to restart in Noida by year-end||The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC), along with the Noida authority, has decided to restart the city bus service with an aim to provide last mile connectivity to thousands of commuters in Noida and Greater Noida. The authority is carrying out a survey to identify more routes for the bus service, officials said, adding that the service is likely to resume by the end of this year. The NMRC, which operates the 29.7km Aqua Line connecting Noida to Greater Noida, had last year stopped the city bus service terminating the contract with a private agency after the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown was announced. Earlier the city bus service was available on 11 routes covering key roads such as Master Plan 1, Master Plan 2, Master Plan 3, Noida expressway, Dadri road, Greater Noida West, Knowledge Park that is a hub to educational institutes and Delhi-Noida Link road, among others.“We have decided to add more routes so that we can cover all crucial destinations. A survey to identify more key places is underway and likely to be completed by the end of this month. If all goes well, the city bus service will restart by December in the two cities,” said Praveen Mishra, additional chief executive officer of the Noida authority and executive director of the NMRC.The authority has already taken feedback from the general public about the routes of the city bus service.“We have taken suggestions from the general public about existing routes and additional roads that need to be covered under the new route plan. Our motive is that when a commuter steps down from a Metro station, he or she should get the bus service to reach his final destination in the two cities,” said Mishra.The officials said that the Urban Mass Transit Company Limited, an urban transport consultancy firm under the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, has been roped in for the survey in Noida and Greater Noida. “We will finalise the routes soon after the survey, and then we will hire an agency that will provide the city bus service,” said Mishra.In December 2016, the city bus service was started with 50 air-conditioned low floor CNG buses to address the transport woes in Noida and Greater Noida. Till March last year, the service was available from 5am to 10pm with fares ranging between ₹11 and ₹53.Residents said that many important areas were not covered in the earlier routes. “Most of the buses used to run without passengers because the routes were faulty. We hope the new route plan will not have that issue again,” said PS Jain, member of Noida Citizen Forum, a residents’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/city-bus-service-to-restart-in-noida-by-yearend-101633887600069.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Cricket: Punjab’s swashbuckling batter Jasia moves to Rajasthan||Two seasons ago when Punjab women won their maiden T20 national title, opener Jaisa Akhtar played a pivotal role with an impressive run throughout the tournament and hit a match-winning knock of 56 runs off 54 balls beating Karnataka in the final. Originally from Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir, Jasia, who moved to Punjab in 2013 for better cricket opportunities, had been state senior team’s mainstay in the recent years. However, in the upcoming domestic season, the strokeful opener won’t be turning out for Punjab but for Rajasthan.The 33-year-old has been roped in by Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) for senior women’s team that would be competing in the one-day tournament from September 28 onwards and in the T20 competition in February 2022. “Back in my village there were no cricket facilities, so I had to move to a nearby state to pursue cricket. It was great to represent Amritsar in the inter-district tournament and then Punjab in the inter-state competitions. I can’t forget how I did well at the domestic level and got to play in the Challengers Trophy as well as Women’s T20 Challenge. I could not resist an offer from RCA as it is a very professional body with a great set up for the cricketers. I am looking forward to playing for Rajasthan and scoring big runs,” said Jasia, who was selected in the India camp back in 2017. First female cricketer from the Valley to make it to the India team camp, Jasia idolises Sachin Tendulkar and Harmanpreet Kaur. Her father Gul Mohammed Wani, a small-time farmer, feeds his family on the apples and walnuts he grows on a tiny field at village Braripora in Shopian. “Life has not been easy living in my village and dreaming big. Due to the pandemic a lot of time went wasted and I could not train as much as I wanted to. However, things got better in recent months and I started training here in the nearby ground. Then I was helping out my father with plucking apples from the trees. It is so inspiring to see veterans Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami do well for India. I want to play for India and this upcoming season will be like make or break for me. I am pinning hopes on performances playing for Rajasthan,” added Jasia. Jasia’s growth and progress has been hindered due to injuries. Leaving behind the injuries, Jasia is feeling fitter and positive about the new innings. “In the coming months, a lot of cricket is going to take place in India. With a fresh mind, I am taking my new stint at RCA very seriously. I want to do well in the one day tournament and score big knocks. There is a lot of competition now when it comes to fetching a berth in the Indian team. But at 33, I don’t want to give up and aim for a spot in the Indian team. I am raring to make the most of the upcoming season,” said Jasia, who thinks shifting to RCA will provide the much required push.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cricket-punjab-s-swashbuckling-batter-jasia-moves-to-rajasthan-101633887480203.html
10-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP govt’s days in UP are numbered: Akhilesh||Attacking the BJP government in UP, Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday claimed that the days of the government were numbered. Addressing his first public rally ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls at Titron in Saharanpur district in western UP, he alleged that the BJP government at the Centre had sold out airports, ports, trains and other government properties. He further alleged that the Yogi government believed in changing names only and accused it of doing no development work in the state.Raising the issues of farmers and referring to the Kheri incident, he said, “The Samajwadi Party believes in taking farmers together with them while in the BJPs government they get run over by vehicles.” “Farmers are being crushed in the rule of BJP. Attempts are also being made to crush the law and a day will come when they ( BJP) will crush the Constitution too,” he alleged.In a bid to forge an emotional bond with people there, he also remembered former PM and farmer leader Ch Charan Singh, and also Mahendra Singh Tikait.A huge crowd had gathered to listen to former chief minister and gave him a rousing welcome when he appeared on the dais. SP leaders and supporters from Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bijnor and Noida districts participated in the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-govt-s-days-in-up-are-numbered-akhilesh-101633887360001.html

I have assured them that Abhijit will get justice" he said.Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari had visited the marquee on Saturday and later tweeted, "Overwhelmed by the grief at this Durga Puja in Beleghata, Kolkata. The organisers, in remembrance of the slain local lad Abhijit Sarkar; post poll violence victim, has refrained from playing any joyous sound, to honour his memory. Drumbeats of the 'dhaak' has also fallen silent."BJP leader Priyanka Tibrewal, who lost to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the recent Bhabanipur by-election, also visited the puja and said that the party will continue to support Sarkar's family.A TMC leader said that the ruling party in the state does not want to do politics over Durga Puja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-remembers-workers-killed-in-post-poll-violence-more-during-puja-dilip-ghosh-101633886286923.html
10-10-2021||Gurugram||Inderjit Singh calls for preference to locals in municipal bodies, factories||The union minister of state and Gurugram member of Parliament, Rao Inderjit Singh, on Sunday said that preference must be given to locals while hiring employees for the newly constituted Municipal Corporation of Manesar during a public rally.He said that the interests of the local youth should be kept in mind at an event organised by village residents to felicitate him for helping landowners in Kasan, Aliar, Dhana and Bas Kusla villages get enhanced compensation during acquisition.He said that youth from local villages in the jurisdiction of the municipality, whose land was acquired for setting up the industrial township in Manesar, should be given preference for employment. Singh said that due to the acquisition of land, villagers lose out on farming and due to this, they must get a chance to work in municipal bodies as well as local industries. The Gurugram MP also assured locals that the residential areas in Kasan would not be acquired to set up the third phase of IMT, Manesar. “It has come to our notice that local youth are not getting jobs in private sector as well, and this has to be changed. I will take up this matter with departments concerned in the state,” he said. Singh also said that despite large-scale farmers’ protests, people in south Haryana have refrained from participating in protests and that it is important for the state government to recognise the same, and resolve their problems. “I have taken up the issue of non-availability of fertilisers with the union ministry concerned and this matter would be resolved in the coming days. The procurement of bajra has also been a concern for the farmers in this region but it is likely to start from Monday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/inderjit-singh-calls-for-preference-to-locals-in-municipal-bodies-factories-101633886701289.html
10-10-2021||Gurugram||Ambience Mall U-turn underpass to open on October 15||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Sunday said that the Sirhaul underpass near the Ambience Mall will open on October 15 as it is in the process of applying the finishing touches to the project.Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said that work on laying the road is going on and will be completed soon. “Finishing touches are being given and we will open the underpass to traffic on October 15,” he said. The deadline was set by union minister Nitin Gadkari during his visit to Sohna last month. The Sirhaul underpass will help city residents to avoid going to Rajokri in Delhi for taking a U-turn to reach Ambience Mall and DLF Phase-3.The NHAI, which is constructing the underpass, has missed several deadlines in the past. Work on the underpass commenced on March 5, 2019, and it was to be completed by September 2020. However, due to delays in shifting MCD (Delhi municipality) toll booths and lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was delayed, said officials.The length of the underpass, including the roads, is 1.5 kilometres, while the underground stretch is 377 metres long and seven metres wide across.During his visit to Sohna last month, Gadkari had directed officials to complete the work and open the underpass for traffic on October 15 as it would help in reducing congestion on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ambience-mall-u-turn-underpass-to-open-on-october-15-101633886700146.html
10-10-2021||Gurugram||Key 800-m link from Pataudi Road to Dwarka Expressway, KMP to be reconstructed||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram will reconstruct an 800-metre stretch of the Pataudi Road that connects to the Dwarka Expressway near Sector 88, officials said. A ₹1.45-crore estimate was approved for the project during the MCG’s finance and contract committee (F&CC) meeting held last Friday.Besides linking newer sectors 36, 88, and 89, among others, with the Dwarka Expressway, the stretch also connects residents to the Western Peripheral Expressway at the other end.According to MCG officials, the 800-metre portion of the Pataudi Road, from near the Oriental Bank of Commence (OBC) in Sector 88 till Saint Paul’s School, adjacent to the Dwarka Expressway, will be reconstructed.“The stretch has a high number of heavy commercial vehicles plying due to which the base of it has to be of high quality to support the weight of vehicles. The road had been constructed as a normal sector road and was not designed for heavy vehicles due to which it is susceptible to the formation of potholes,” a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said.A second MCG official, of the engineering wing, not wishing to be named, said, “We will be using construction materials such as dense-bituminous macadam (DBM), medium-curing (MC) asphalt cement, and ready-mix concrete (RMC), which are primarily items used in the construction of highways so that road is of high-quality. With the estimates approved, we will now start the process of hiring a contractor and we are aiming to start construction work from next month onwards.”The degradation of road, especially on the two-lane carriageway carrying traffic from Dwarka Expressway through Pataudi Road towards Western Peripheral Expressway, has been a major concern for residents.“The stretch helps a lot of commuters access the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway to head towards Panipat and beyond. It completely negates the city traffic in Gurugram and Delhi, and ends up being a much faster route,” Vijay Singh, a resident of Sector 88, said. The KMP Expressway is also referred to as the Western Peripheral Expressway.“Besides providing connectivity between Dwarka Expressway and Western Peripheral Expressway, the stretch also has several religious spots due to which it is highly accessed. Reconstruction of the stretch was, hence, highly needed,” Satbir Singh, a resident of Sector 102, said.Besides the road reconstruction, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is also revamping a key 5.6-kilometre road that links Rampura Chowk on the National Highway 48 (NH-48) and Pataudi Road.MCG officials said that besides the road construction, 14 other development projects were approved in the F&CC meeting and that tenders for 13 projects have been allotted.The other approved works include a ₹2.49-crore project for construction of roads in Sector 9, ₹1 crore for road construction in Sector 9A, ₹1.14 crore for renovation of green belts along the railway tracks in Palam Vihar, and constructing citizen facilitation centres (CFCs) in various wards of the MCG.In addition, 13 tenders were also allotted in the meeting, including ₹2-crore work for the construction of stormwater drains along internal roads in Sector 10A, ₹1.27-crore renovation and beautification of parks and central verges in Ward 16, ₹2-crore stormwater drain works in Sector 47, and ₹1-crore drinking water facility in Sai Kunj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/key-800-m-link-from-pataudi-road-to-dwarka-expressway-kmp-to-be-reconstructed-101633886643021.html
10-10-2021||Gurugram||Air quality starts falling, pollution board cites temperature dip||With the withdrawal of the monsoon season, air quality deteriorated to the ‘poor’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) over the weekend. Officials cited lower temperatures in the morning and evening hours as the main cause and dismissed concerns that stubble burning was causing pollution.According to the CPCB’s daily bulletin, the city recorded poor AQI on Saturday, following which it improved to the moderate category on Sunday, after weeks of satisfactory air quality.In the past week, the air quality in the city has dropped from the satisfactory category, with an AQI of 92 recorded on October 3, to the poor category, with an AQI of 201 recorded on Saturday. On Sunday, an AQI of 170 was recorded.The air quality is likely to deteriorate further over the next five days but remain in the moderate category, according to a weather bulletin issued for Delhi-NCR by Air Quality Early Warning System. The bulletin also mentioned that crop residue burning fire points have been observed over Haryana and Punjab, which is blamed for poor air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, officials said that the drop in air quality was mainly due to falling temperatures.Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of Haryana State Pollution Control Board for Gurugram (north), said, “The dip in air quality is primarily due to drop in temperature during the morning and evening hours, as pollutants accumulate in lower temperatures. We are taking all measures to ensure that air quality does not deteriorate this winter season.”When asked if crop residue burning in other districts of Haryana could be a reason, Singh said, “Stubble burning is quite controlled in Haryana, this (dip in air quality) is mainly due to drop in temperature.” Every winter, the air quality in the NCR plummets due to incoming pollutants from stubble or crop residue burning in neighbouring districts of Haryana. This year, Haryana has put in place a robust strategy, including incentives and punitive steps to stop the practice, ahead of the paddy stubble burning season. Most of the fires are usually reported from Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Ambala districts. “It is too early to say what the causes are behind poor air quality in the city as monsoon has just started withdrawing. All agencies are also working on implementation of measures to control air pollution. We will see for a few more days and take action accordingly if any external factors are found,” S Narayanan, member secretary of HSPCB, said. A week ago, the state pollution control board released guidelines for different agencies in the city to start working to manage air quality in the city. However, HT found that sufficient measures were not being taken to control dust pollution during a visit to the Sohna Road construction site in the city on Sunday.Officials also said that discussions are underway for implementing a Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), an emergency set of measures implemented between October 15 and March 15 every year to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Under Grap, a ban on diesel generator sets is announced for the entire period and depending on the air quality, measures such as stopping construction work, levying heavy fines for garbage burning and shutting brick kilns, among other measures, are taken.Abhishek Srivastava, a city-based environmental engineer said, “There are three primary reasons for the dip in air quality: stubble burning has started, wind direction has changed from northwest directions and also surface winds have slowed down. The wind direction changed around October 6 and the city also witnessed light rain in the early days of this month, so the air quality was normal then. But now, the wind speed has slowed down which has brought over dip in temperature in the morning and evening hours, so they are all connected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-starts-falling-pollution-board-cites-temperature-dip-101633886641668.html
10-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG: Outsourced engineers barred from accessing project details||Amid complaints and ongoing investigations into discrepancies in various civic projects, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Sunday disallowed outsourced junior engineers from accessing measurement books, based on which payments are made to contractors.A measurement book contains the records of the construction materials used, type of work, the daily or weekly expenditure for road projects, sewerage, stormwater, streetlights and parks, among other such civic amenities. Details are filled regularly and updated in the book, which is MCG’s primary source of project details.MCG officials said that the digital IDs of all 29 outsourced junior engineers (JEs) have been deleted and they no longer have access to the measurement book.The development comes just a week after the MCG initiated a vigilance wing investigation against 15 MCG officials and a contractor based on a complaint filed by the senior deputy mayor. A contractor was allegedly paid twice for laying a new drainage line, setting up manholes, and building roads in Palam Vihar.“There have been discrepancies recently found in the details of several measurement books due to which higher payments have been made to contractors. As there is a possibility that the outsourced JEs may have colluded with the contractors, it was decided to remove the former from the process so that there is less scope for alterations in measurements books,” a senior MCG official of the engineering wing said, requesting anonymity.Various discrepancies have surfaced over the past two years, wherein the MCG contractors were paid a part, or the full project amount despite work not starting on the ground or when it was at a nascent stage. As per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, the MCG can pay the final project sum to a contractor only after the work is completed.In December last year, the charge of an MCG’s executive engineer (XEN) was withdrawn with immediate effect after it was found that he had sanctioned payment of the entire project cost to a contractor for re-carperting roads in Ward 34 even before the work was started.Similarly, a contractor was allegedly paid a quarter of the total project cost in September last year for laying pavement tiles in Ward 25, despite only 10% of work being completed on-ground.In February last year, a contractor received full payment for constructing a two-kilometre road in Ward 1 even before construction work had started.“Due to discovery of a high number of discrepancies in engineering projects, it was decided that outsourced JEs can no longer have access to measurement books. Only permanent JEs and subdivision officers (SDOs) can access it from henceforth,” a second senior MCG official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-outsourced-engineers-barred-from-accessing-project-details-101633886640338.html
10-10-2021||Lucknow||BKU leader Raju Ahlawat joins BJP amid standoff over farm laws||Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Raju Ahlawat joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the presence of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev and the party’s national vice president Radha Mohan Singh here amid the ongoing standoff with BKU and other farmers’ bodies over the Centre’s three new agri reform laws and the latest flashpoint in Lakhimpur Kheri. BKU is among 32 farmer unions protesting against the new laws.Raju Ahlawat was currently in-charge of Saharanpur. The BKU state executive body was also announced on Sunday and he didn’t find a place in the farmers’ body. After joining the BJP, Raju Ahlawat advised BKU leadership to hold talks with the government over the three farm laws.“Protests, stage-ins and road blockades are resorted to attract the attention of the government but now that the government is willing to hold discussions (on farm laws), BKU leadership should consider changing their stance,” Raju Ahlawat said. He also said: “These farm laws offer an option to the farmers and it is up to them to accept them or continue to sell their produce as before.” Several Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders also joined the BJP on Sunday.They included Congress state vice president Virendra Pasi, Dr Bhawna Patel who had contested elections on Congress ticket from Varanasi, ex-BSP MLAs from Sahjanwa and Paniyara in Gorakhpur GM Singh and Dev Narayan Singh, two-time former MLA from Duddhi (Sonbhadra) Rubi Prasad of BSP, BSP’s former candidate from Rohaniya (Varanasi) Pramod Kumar Singh, former BSP lawmaker from Fatehpur Sikri (Agra) Suraj Pal, former BSP MLC and divisional coordinator (Bijnor) Subodh Parashar, former BSP candidate Mukesh Dixit, Gayatri Parashar (BSP), Varanasi-based social worker Shashikant Rai ‘Chunna’, Lok Dal’s Virendra Singh, Chaudhary Pratap Singh of Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia, Virendra Singh Sainthwar (BSP), RK Chaudhary (Congress) and Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha (Varanasi) district treasurer Shubham Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bku-leader-raju-ahlawat-joins-bjp-amid-standoff-over-farm-laws-101633886340118.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh: MVA allies keen on making it a success||To up its ante against their common political enemy, Bharatiya Janata Party, in the wake of the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, the three ruling parties in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – have given a call for Maharashtra bandh on Monday and have decided to pull out all stops to make it successful. The three parties are looking at it as an opportunity to take on the BJP, especially when the ruling party at the Centre has initiated action against many of their leaders. The Shiv Sena has reportedly taken the responsibility of Mumbai, which apparently decides the success of any statewide bandh. The party is expected to compel owners of shops, establishments and public transport to stay shut. “This is not a bandh called by government, but by the ruling parties under MVA. Whether to operate railway or BEST buses has to be decided, by their administrations. We expect the people to participate in this on their own as it is in support of farmers and against the rule of the BJP at the Centre,” said NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik on Sunday. Malik said essential services have been exempted from the bandh. “The bandh would come into force from Sunday midnight. We appeal to all workers to not create any issues for essential services such as hospitals, ambulance, medical stories and milk supply during the bandh.” The bandh is expected to be observed till 4pm. “It more or less depends on the scenario in Mumbai, the financial capital of the country. Its success or failure depends on its success in the city. The Sena has taken it very seriously. Party workers have reportedly been asked to ensure public transport was disrupted to make the bandh successful. At the same time, the ruling parties have also decided to ensure no violence,” said a senior Sena leader. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said his party will participate in the bandh with full strength. According to ruling party leaders, all three parties are aggressive against the BJP and there is anger among party workers at local levels too. “They have realised the ruling parties and their leaders are being targeted by the BJP by using central agencies out of political vendetta. NCP workers showed the anger in Pune on Friday after the I-T raids on relatives of Ajit Pawar. An appeal by Sharad Pawar in Solapur the same day means a lot for party workers across the state. The impact of these developments will be seen during the bandh on Monday,” said a NCP leader. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap said, “We have urged people to participate in the bandh spontaneously and we are sure that in the backdrop of the anger among the people against the killing of the farmers, it will be successful.” The Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, which had earlier announced to not support the bandh, announced its support late in the night, by keeping shops shut till 4pm. “After request from Sena and leaders from other parties, FRTWA has decided to support the bandh by keeping the shops shut till 4pm in protest of the killing of farmers. Kindly follow the order in all areas,” the message of its president Viren Shah read. “The operation of offices depends on the availability of the public transport,” said a high-ranking officer from Mantralaya. GD Kulthe, chief advisor, Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers Federation, said, “Employees never participate in the bandh call given by any political parties. Government offices will work as usual.” Maharashtra Congress has organised a maun vrat agitation outside Raj Bhavan in the morning on Monday. State unit chief of the party Nana Patole, who is heading the agitation, has also appealed to party workers to make the bandh successful. “Traders, farmers, labourer and daily wagers are already under tremendous stress because of the Covid-19 lockdown. We will oppose the bandh which will lead to more hardship to these people,” said BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bandh-mva-allies-keen-on-making-it-a-success-101633885924516.html

HK Rai, wildlife conservator and field director of VTR, said,“As part of the new packages, separate buses for Valmikinagar and Manguraha would leave Patna every Friday for sightseeing and return on Sunday. Tourists are required to pay ₹4,500 for the same.” On the other hand, the charges for the existing 25-km-long jungle safari package has been hiked to ₹2,000 from ₹1,500, Rai said, clarifying that the same was necessitated due to hike in fuel prices.Located at a distance of about 230 km from state capital Patna, the forests of VTR are home to tigers, boars and a number of reptiles, besides monkeys.The Bihar government has been trying to promote ecotourism in VTR since 2012-13. However, the number of tourists has declined sharply owing to the pandemic, said an official, refusing to be identified. “VTR has registered a footfall of mere 35,000 tourists after unlock,” said the official.

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Shortage of coal supply likely to force Maharashtra to go for load shedding||Amid the crisis of coal supply for power generation, 13 units of state-owned and private power generation thermal plants have stalled, leading to a shortfall of 3,330MW. The shortfall in power generation may affect supply and compel authorities to go for load shedding during peak hours in the next couple of days until the coal supply regularises. The shortage of coal has hampered six thermal power generation plants, supplying power to Maharashtra, forcing the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) to cut short the supply to agricultural pumps. The state has also appealed to consumers to use electricity judiciously, during peak hours (from 6am to 10am and 6pm to 10pm). Mahagenecos’s three units at Chandrapur, Bhuswawa, and Nashik, with the capacity of 210MW each, Paras (250MW) and one unit with the capacity of 500MW at Bhusawal and Chandrapur are shut. Besides them, Postal Gujarat Power Limited’s four units of 640MW and Ratan India Power Limited’s three units of 810 MW are shut for want of coal. Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary, energy department, said the state-owned power plants have the stock of coal to last only for a day or one-and-a-half days. “We have been coping with the demand by purchasing power from open market, but the demand goes up, we will have to go for the load shedding. We expect the coal supply to improve in next couple of days. Our own thermal power generation plants are generating 60% of the power of 6,000MW they generate. The power demand during the peak hours in October goes up to 22,000 and in such cases, we may have to go for shedding.”The current power generation in the state ranges around 19,000 MW and was 18,200 MW on Sunday at 11.30am, and 17,289MW on Saturday. The demand is expected to go up during working days from Monday, because of the rise in the temperature, festive season and ramped up agricultural activities during rabi season. The peak hour demand in last October had gone up to 22,000MW and expected to be the same in the next few days. To cope with the reduction in the production, the power supply to the agricultural pumps has been reduced during night time by few hours. The Mahadiscom purchased 700MW at ₹13.60 a unit from the open market, while real time purchase of 900MW was at ₹6.23 a unit. The cost for the purchase of the power from the open market costs rages between ₹2.50 and ₹20 a unit. The state authorities have also pressed on the generation from the hydro and non-conventional generation sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shortage-of-coal-supply-likely-to-force-maharashtra-to-go-for-load-shedding-101633883703114.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||UGC tells institutes to create cyber security ecosystem, Mumbai colleges ask how||The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked all higher educational institutions to create a cyber security ecosystem on campuses but colleges in Mumbai say they are ill-prepared to do so. On August 28, UGC—the apex body governing all higher education institutes in the country—followed up on its instructions to strengthen the cyber security systems of the colleges. The first communication on the matter was made by UGC on November 25, 2020, and was later followed by a notice with guidelines on February 19 this year.The regulatory body instructed all higher educational institutes to prepare a calendar of events and organise awareness campaigns, hackathons, competitions, and workshops on cyber security on campuses to help students deal with new-age crimes. “Most colleges are not aware of what constitutes cybercrime. Especially, now that classes and assessments are being held online, the line between what is official and unofficial communication is blurring,” said the principal of a suburban college on the condition of anonymity.While most colleges still consider email as an official mode of communication aside from physical notices and circulars, teachers and principals agreed that many share questions, important links and assessment via social media such as chat services. Most colleges record their online classes to monitor any wrongdoings.Last year, when colleges were forced to switch to online education following the Covid-19 pandemic, St Xavier’s College in Dhobi Talao, put up ‘netiquettes’ for online education.Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier’s said the netiquettes also included information on what constitutes misdemeanour, how to handle cyberattacks and the consequences of an attack or misdemeanour. “The netiquettes have been uploaded on to the homepage of our website so students can have easy access. It mentions what is acceptable, what’s not and how to report any issues,” Shinde added. In the netiquettes section, the college mentions a ‘zero-tolerance policy’ and strict disciplinary action to a host of incidents such as unauthorised attendance, online abuse and threats. “All the online lectures/virtual classes will be video recorded and so will be the activities on the chat box. Any misdemeanour on video or in chat boxes will be recorded and will be used as evidence whilst reporting to the cyber cell/police,” the post says.The UGC, in its communication last year, said, “Cybercrime is a complex environment consisting of interactions between people, software and services, supported by Information Communication Technology devices and networks. It is vulnerable to a wide variety of incidents, whether intentional or accidental, manmade or natural… it has been decided that cyber security awareness should start at school level… all higher educational institutes are requested to take appropriate action on the implementation of the cyber security awareness.”UGC’s instructions come in the wake of a spate of cyberattacks on the websites of educational institutes. Check Point Research, an organisation that publishes reports on cyberattacks, released a report in August stating that India topped the number of cyberattacks in the education sector. Organisations in the education sector in South Asia recorded the highest number of attacks and India was the most targeted country in the sector, followed by Italy, Israel, Australia and Turkey.Last October, the distance education wing of the University of Mumbai (MU) had to postpone its exams following a cyberattack on its website. Many students logged in to appear for the exam online but could not access the question paper. The problem went on for at least two days. Around 9,000 students of IDOL (Institute of Distance and Open Learning) had their third-year Bachelor of Commerce and Arts exams scheduled. However, more than 90% could not access the exam link. Colleges, however, said that the university administration had not yet asked them to conduct awareness programmes or competitions. “If UGC says we need to have an ecosystem in place, what does it mean? What kind of infrastructure is required? Do we need to have resource persons in place?” asked the principal of another college. Ravindra Kulkarni, pro vice chancellor, MU, did not respond to calls or messages despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ugc-tells-institutes-to-create-cyber-security-ecosystem-mumbai-colleges-ask-how-101633883579886.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Supreme Court to Mumbai shopkeepers: Pay ₹4.01L each for not evicting NTC premises||The Supreme Court (SC) has asked the three shopkeepers who were evicted from Jam Mills in Lalbaug, Mumbai, this year to shell out ₹4.01 lakh each as compensation to the National Textiles Corporation (NTC) for using the premises. The occupants have, however, decided to file review petition, stating that they are not in a position to pay such a huge amount. The occupants of the three shops at Jam Mills were evicted by officials of NTC – the owner of the land – on January 22, after an SC order allowed the Central government-owned entity to “take forcible possession with the help of police force”.The latest SC order stated, “The respondents/alleged contemnors, despite giving sufficient opportunity, have failed to deposit the outstanding dues as ordered finally on 09/03/2021. No further indulgence can be shown to the said respondents. If they fail to deposit the amount of ₹4,01,200 on or before 21/10/2021, the registry shall take steps to issue non-bailable warrants against the said respondents and for being produced before this court immediately after being taken into custody (sic).” The occupants are now filing a review petition saying that they are not in a position to pay such a huge amount. “We are not in the position to pay at all. Our shops have been taken over by NTC in January and we have no income at all. Where we will get this money from?” questioned Santosh Patange, who ran his readymade garments’ store at Jam Mills. The family had been running the store since 1927.Similar is the contention made by Meghraj Tendolkar, who is the fourth generation businessman of Tendolkar readymade garment shop. “We could not open our shop during the Covid-19 lockdown and all our savings have been exhausted. The shop was our only source of income,” he said.Advocate Nimesh Mehta, who represented the shopkeepers, said he will file a review petition in SC on the matter. He added that he is also challenging the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, in the Bombay high court (HC).There are 23 shops at Jam Mill, which were issued eviction notices by NTC under the provisions of the Act on the grounds that they were illegal occupants of the premises. While four shopkeepers approached SC, the case pertaining to the other 19 shops is pending in Bombay HC. After SC ruled in favour of NTC, the four shopkeepers were evicted.NTC officials were unavailable for comment despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/supreme-court-to-mumbai-shopkeepers-pay-4-01l-each-for-not-evicting-ntc-premises-101633883519770.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Royal weavers’ of Karvat Kati sarees in Maoist areas of Maharashtra get help||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, 33-year-old Mumbai resident Prachi Saraf decided to help out a weaver community, etched in the history of ancient India as ‘royal weavers’ but who have been in troubled waters in modern-day India, as they battle poverty and are forced to work out of areas largely affected by the Maoist movement. Saraf, who returned to India after completing her accountancy course from Cardiff University and had a family background of garment manufacturing and export business since 1980, set up a trust – Vyusti – through which she is helping 80 families from the Koshti community by giving them orders to weave Tussar or Kosa Silk sarees. The trust is providing raw materials and returning 90% of the profit made back to the weavers. “I couldn’t bear the fact that the talented weavers were going hungry and decided to help them against all odds,” said Saraf. She said 10 families at Yeola in Nashik district work with the trust to make Paithani sarees. The Himroo sarees’ weaving also faces threat of extinction and the art would have ended had it not been for the 25 weavers from three families of Aurangabad’s Qureshis looms. According to legends, the Koshti community consider themselves to be the descendants of Markandeya Rishi or Rajhans, the king of Devagiri who was given the title ‘Koshti’, which means man of virtues, in 1111AD. The Koshtis were known as the royal weavers, but later took jobs as soldiers in the armies of the Peshwas, Bundelkhand, Rani Laxmi Bai and Tipu Sultan. Today, the Koshti tribe that has settled in some areas of Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat, are largely weaving the famous Karvat Kati sarees made from Tussar Silk or Kosa Silk. A pure Karvat Kati saree costs a minimum of ₹19,500, while those with zari work can cost ₹11,000.But for families of this tribe, who have settled in the fringes of the Maoist-affected regions of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, earning their livelihood through weaving silk has not been easy. They live on the edge as cocoons of the silkworm, Antheraea Mylitta, are found only on Arjun, Saja and Sal trees in the forests that has considerable Maoist presence. Many of the families are not comfortable to describe their lives as they operate out of the ‘Red Corridor.’ Umashankar, who does not know his age, travels five hours to reach Gadchiroli to weave a Karvat Kati gala. “I found about Kosa Silk when I traded a few cocoons and got money. This made me go through the jungles of Gadchiroli and Chhattisgarh to find cocoons and trade. After 11-12 years, I got a cycle which made it slightly easier to travel,” he said. Umashankar refrained from talking about Maoists or their presence in the forests of Gadchiroli and Chhattisgarh. To weave one saree, the family of these weavers have to find at least 1,500 cocoons. “Each cocoon gives anywhere between 350 grams and 500 grams of silk. We take an average of 400 grams of silk per cocoon, and to weave one saree, we need 1,500 cocoons,” said Umashankar. He stated that each family member has a specific role to play, from extracting the thread to weaving and dyeing the fabric. Similar is the story of Bhalchandra, who rarely speaks to anyone from outside the village. His 39-year-old son Prakash said, “My father often talks to my mother about the troubled times during his young age when he had to traverse with Maoists around. And I would not want to talk about it. We should not utter that word Maoist here.” “Life isn’t easy for us,” said Prakash, when asked about the harvest season of cocoons. “Cocoons are harvested twice a year, once during a period closer to Diwali and then in February. But it all depends on many factors surrounding the place we live in,” said Prakash, who is happy that his father could at least build a makeshift house out of loose bricks. The signature trait of the silk is its dull golden brownish texture which makes it an extremely precious commodity, said Prakash. “It is also found in natural shades of dark honey, fawn, orange, pale golden and cream. The actual colour of Kosa Silk is dull gold, but the finished product is dyed with natural dyes to give it other colour,” added Prakash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/royal-weavers-of-karvat-kati-sarees-in-maoist-areas-of-maharashtra-get-help-101633883461307.html
10-10-2021||Other||Power crunch: Bihar pays ₹20 crore more a day to buy from open market||PATNABihar has been paying an additional ₹20 crore daily for the past couple of days to purchase power from open market during Dussehra but is still not getting as much to meet its peak load demand of 5,500 MW as the coal-fired utilities, supplying power to the state, are facing coal shortage, said power officials. Union power minister RK Singh, however, denied of a scarcity in any state. “We have an average coal reserve (at power stations) that can last for more than four days. The stock is replenished every day. I am in touch with (Union minister for coal, mines and parliamentary affairs) Pralhad Joshi,” he said after chairing a meeting with discoms in New Delhi on Sunday, reported ANI. Bihar’s power crisis, however, has deepened because of multiple reasons. First, the Central sector, which supplies thermal power to the state through the NTPC (National Thermal Power Station), has been able to feed around 3,000-3,300 MW power against its scheduled allocation of 4,500 MW. The reduced power supply is attributed to the shutdown of 660 MW unit 5 of the Barh Super Thermal Power Project due to maintenance and shortage of coal at the Farakka and the Kahalgaon Super Thermal Power Projects, where coal was at a critical level to last for around four days, against an average buffer stock of 7-10 days at power stations. If government sources were to be believed, the average daily availability of coal was 0.7 to 0.8 lakh metric tonnes (MT) against a demand of 1.2 lakh MT at NTPC power plants supplying power to Bihar. Secondly, private players are unable to meet the increased demand of thermal power across the country, primarily due to steep hike in coal prices in the international market due to its shortage. Sample this. The power buy quantum in open market at the national level was 10,000 MW against an availability of 2,700 MW and 4,500 MW on October 8 and 9, respectively. Given the high demand and low supply, the power purchase rate had shot up to ₹20 per unit against an average cost of ₹3- ₹5 earlier. In fact, the price was hovering between ₹12 and ₹16 per unit for the last 10 days, said officials quoted above. To meet its deficit, Bihar was still bidding at a higher rate and spending an additional ₹20 crore per day to purchase power through private sources. This was in addition to its average monthly bill of ₹800 crore to the NTPC for supply of thermal power from central sector. Yet, it was unable to get the required quantity of power. The state was getting only around 347 MW to 397 MW over the last couple of days against 688 MW power purchase agreement through private players, said an officer in the know of the subject. Similarly, the state was also short of hydel and wind power. It was getting 453 MW hydel power against an allocation of 762 MW. Add to it the shortfall in wind energy. Against 580 MW, the state was getting between 50 MW and 175 MW wind power over the last few days. Put together, these have led to a power scarcity, leading to an average power outage of 4 to 8 hours a day, especially in rural areas of the state. “Bihar’s power firms do not generate electricity. Instead, they buy power from central power generation institutions and supply to consumers. Given the current coal crisis, we are getting expensive power, but are supplying electricity to consumers at a cheaper rate,” the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) tweeted from its handle, quoting Sanjeev Hans, Bihar’s energy secretary, on Saturday. Another tweet on Sunday, quoting Hans, said, “Power supply has been improving constantly. There has been a reduction in open market price. We are now buying power at ₹14- ₹16 per unit. The situation is returning to normal. We will soon be able to ensure availability of power commensurate to its demand.” Bihar’s power demand goes up by 250-300 MW during the festival season of Dussehra and Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-crunch-bihar-pays-20-crore-more-a-day-to-buy-from-open-market-101633883459937.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid caseload dips, Mumbai sees slight rise||While Maharashtra has been witnessing a steady drop in the daily Covid-19 caseload, infections in Mumbai are seeing a slight rise. Mumbai on Sunday recorded 445 new cases, thus bringing this month’s tally to 4,733. This effectively means an average of 473 infections per day. Similarly, there were six deaths in the city on Sunday, resulting in 48 fatalities in the past 10 daysExperts attribute the rise in Mumbai due to the reopening of activities, including local trains, schools, commercial establishments and also because of more commuters travelling in trains.

This is still the second wave going on and citizens need to take precautions,” said Dr Mandot.Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 2,294 new cases, which brought the total of the past 10 days up to 25,877. The total Covid-19 patients, right from the outbreak last year, has now reached 6,577,872.

10-10-2021||Other||Congress dares RJD to form govt in Bihar without its support||PATNAThe crisis in the Opposition alliance in Bihar escalated on Sunday when All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of the state, Bhakta Charan Das, dared the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to form the government without the Congress’s support in the state. Talking to media persons at the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) office on the sidelines of a crucial meeting of party seniors for by-elections in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, Das said, “RJD would need the support of 19 Congress legislators if it wants to form the government.” The AICC leader said he was compelled to make this statement as RJD did not have any regard for its legislators in the state. Both Congress and RJD have fielded candidates for the two seats in the bypolls.“We are still in the alliance. But the split would have a bearing on the by-elections’ result,” Das said, adding that RJD had the responsibility to stick to the coalition dharma as it is the largest constituent of the Opposition’s Grand Alliance. “A lot of energetic and promising youth leaders have joined the Congress in the past few months and they have already joined the campaigning for the by-polls,” said the AICC leader. A section of party leaders, who attended the meeting chaired by Das at Sadaquat Ashram, the BPCC headquarter, said they had been given a clear message from the party high command to rejuvenate the organisational network at the grassroots level, as the by-elections could be a turning point for the GA in Bihar. Congress has fielded Atirek Kumar, the son of the party’s stalwart Ashok Kumar, from Kusheshwar Asthan (reserved for the scheduled caste) in Darbhanga district and Rajesh Kumar Mishra from Tarapur seat in Munger.They are pitted against the JDU’s Aman Bhushan Hazari and Rajiv Singh and RJD’s Ganesh Bharti and Arun Kumar Sah, respectively. “We (Congress men) are in no mood to compromise anymore. Das has categorically asked us to prepare for 2024 elections alone. Congress has been weakened over the years in Bihar, as it relied heavily on the coalition politics and let its support base, comprising Brahmins, Dalits and Muslims, wither away,” said an MLA who attended the crucial meeting. Former union minister Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who is the chairman of election campaign committee of the BPCC, claimed the party was sure to wrest both the seats as both NDA and RJD were grappling with internal crises. “We are working with renewed vigour in the wake of break-up in the coalition,” said Singh. Senior AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha said RJD’s strength in the Lok Sabha dipped to four in 2014 from 22 in 2009 out of the total 40 seats in the state after it parted ways with the Congress and teamed up with Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP in the parliamentary polls. “Likewise, RJD’s tally in the 243-member assembly dipped to 22 in 2010 against 54 in 2005, when it rejected the Congress’s tie-up proposal and continued its alliance with the LJP,” Jha said. RJD spokesman Shakti Singh Yadav said his party had to go alone as its repeated pleas to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to strengthen the alternative at regional levels failed to yield any result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-dares-rjd-to-form-govt-in-bihar-without-its-support-101633883102185.html

Tej Pratap was referring to suggestions that he was backing an independent candidate for the bypoll in Tarapur assembly seat, who has now decided to withdraw his nomination.In a tweet by his official handle, Tej Pratap said he had never spoken or written about claims being made by the independent candidate Sanjay Kumar Yadav a few days back that he would campaign for him. “ Did I speak or write anything about such claims. So where is my role in it?” Tej Pratap, MLA and former health minister of Bihar, said. “Some Harayanvi script writer should stop writing such C grade stories as people of Bihar know the truth,” he said, in an apparent reference to one of Tejashwi’s close aides, Sanjay Yadav, who belongs to Haryana. Tej Pratap’s bid to distance himself from the Tarapur bypoll came after the independent candidate, Sanjay Kumar Yadav, visited Tejashwi’s residence on Saturday late evening and joined RJD. RJD has already announced the name of Arun Kumar Sah as its candidate for Tarapur. Tej Pratap’s name didn’t figure in RJD’s list of star campaigners for the upcoming bypolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rift-widens-in-rjd-s-first-family-with-tej-pratap-s-fresh-dig-101633883100962.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Constable, wife arrested for killing man, dumping headless body at Antop Hill in Mumbai||The Mumbai crime branch’s unit 4 arrested a 45-year-old police constable, posted as a driver of an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sion division, and his wife for allegedly killing a person whose headless body was found on September 30, in the Antop Hill area. As per the investigation, police said the constable’s wife and victim, Dada Jagdale, 38, were allegedly having an illicit relation, due to which, the constable decided to kill him.The accused Shivshankar Gaikwad and his wife Monali, 35, resided at the Worli police quarters. Gaikwad joined the police service around 20 years ago in the motor transport department and was posted as a driver of ACP Dr Ashwaini Patil (Sion division). Police are yet to recover the sharp objects which were used to cut the victim’s body into five pieces. Police said the head is still missing and they are trying to trace it, said a police officer. Jagdale is a native of Solapur. His wife Monali was also from the same village and knew the victim from her school days, said a police officer. The incident came to light on September 30, around 7:30am when a local resident noticed a body with burn and cut marks, wrapped in a plastic bag in sector 7 of the Antop Hill area. A police team rushed on the spot. The body was without a head. The hands and legs were severed, and the accused made an attempt to burn the body. The spot was a few metres away from the office of ACP, said deputy commissioner of police Prakash Jadhav of the crime branch. The murder case was registered against unknown persons.“The crime branch’s unit 4 and 5 started conducting a parallel investigation. Several teams were made, and they were working on the different leads. We scrutinised the CCTV footage of the vicinity and several vehicles were verified. We found one suspicious Wagon R captured in the footage, which entered in the building where the body was found and it was owned by Gaikwad,” added Jadhav.Another lead was an aluminium plate that had been implanted in the left ankle of the victim (Gaikwad). Based on the serial number on the plate several officers scoured several cities across the country to identify the persons on whom the plates were implanted. We verified and found that 40 same aluminium plates were issued by a company that were implanted to the patient across the country. During the search, a police team reached a Solapur based hospital and managed to identify the person on whom the plate was implanted, said Jadhav.“On checking Gaikwad’s call records, we learnt that he had made two to three calls to the victim in Solapur from Mumbai. And the victim’s mobile number was found with maximum calls on Monali’s number. When the police team visited Jagdale’s residence the family informed us that Jagdale had gone to Mumbai to meet his friend” said a crime branch officer.During interrogation, Gaikwad confessed that he killed the person and used his own car to dump the body, said police inspector Indrajeet More of unit 4.Both have been arrested under the charge of murder and several other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. They were produced in court and remanded in police custody till October 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/constable-wife-arrested-for-killing-man-dumping-headless-body-at-antop-hill-in-mumb-101633883099750.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Go to homes of freedom fighters to disburse pension, Bombay high court tells Maharashtra govt||The Bombay high court (HC), while deprecating the state government’s refusal to grant pension of a deceased freedom fighter to his 90-year-old widow for want of a jail certificate, has directed the secretary of the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) to assist the widow in collecting documents to prove that the deceased husband was a freedom fighter. The woman’s husband had died in 1965 and as per her claims, he had been jailed for a period of six months in 1944 for participating in the 1942 Quit India Movement.The court further directed the state to start paying pension to the widow as an interim arrangement from October 2021 as she had been pursuing the same since 1993 till her petition was decided. The state government had implemented the pension scheme in 1980.The division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar which was hearing the petition of Shalini Chavan, was informed by advocate Jitendra Pathade that the nonagenarian had been seeking pension of her deceased husband since 1993 but the authorities had refused to include the name of her husband as a freedom fighter.Chavan’s petition further stated that her husband had participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942 and had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months with a fine of ₹50 on February 12, 1943, for such participation. Initially, he was lodged in Thane District Prison, after which, he was transferred to Byculla prison on April 17, 1944. However, he was released on June 29, 1944. Thereafter, Chavan died on March 12, 1965. The petition further states that the son of Laxman and Shalini Chavan also passed away, as a result of which Shalini was hoping that her deceased husband’s pension would help her take care of her expenses.The state government had implemented the Freedom Fighters Pension Scheme in 1980 and freedom fighters had to submit the original imprisonment certificate to get the pension. In the previous hearing on September 24, Pathade had informed the court that as it was not possible to get the document from the prison after the passage of time, Shalini was unable to furnish the same. The court had asked the state to respond.While responding to the court query, the government pleader Poornima Kantharia informed the bench that without the original imprisonment certificate, freedom fighters could not benefit from the pension scheme.After hearing the submissions, the bench referred to a Supreme Court (SC) judgement which held that ‘the prescription of a rigid time-limit for the proof of entitlement in the very nature of things is demeaning. The Apex court had further held that benefit should flow from the date of the application and not from any other date.The bench also referred to the SC observation which stated, ‘If the Scheme has been introduced with the genuine desire to assist and honour those who had given the best part of their life for the country, it ill-behoves the government to raise pleas of limitation against such claims. In fact, the government should find out the freedom fighters or their dependents and approach them with the pension instead of requiring them to make applications for pension. That would be the true spirit of working out the Scheme.’Thereafter the bench directed the secretary of DLSA to go to the house of the widow and help her put together the documents or verify her claim by speaking to the resident and known personalities and submit the same to the concerned authority who would decide on the widow’s application within two months. The court also directed the state to start paying pension to the widow from October 2021 onwards and posted hearing of the petition to January 6, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/go-to-homes-of-freedom-fighters-to-disburse-pension-bombay-high-court-tells-maharashtra-govt-101633883040268.html

The Kanpur SIT is also quizzing them in Gorakhpur,” he said.The policemen were on the run since the death of Kanpur realtor Manish Gupta after a police raid on a Gorakhpur hotel on September 27 night.There was a reward of ₹25,000 on all the accused policemen which was later raised to ₹1 lakh by the Kanpur police who circulated their pictures on social media with an appeal for information leading to their arrest. A named FIR against JN Singh, Akshay Mishra and sub-inspector Vijay Yadav under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was filed at the Ramgarh Tal police station in Gorakhpur last month. The FIR mentions three other accused as unidentified cops.SI Vijay Yadav, who has reportedly filed a surrender plea in court, and the others are still on the run.Six police teams were conducting raids to nab the remaining accused policemen in the Kanpur realtor case.The Uttar Pradesh government on October 1 recommended a CBI probe into the death of Manish Gupta. The recommendation to this effect was made to the central government on the directives of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish K Awasthi, had said in a press statement.Till the time the CBI takes over the inquiry, the special investigating team set up for the purpose will probe the matter, transferring the case to Kanpur from Gorakhpur, the statement had said.The government had also ordered appointment of the businessman’s wife Meenakshi Gupta as an officer on special duty (OSD) in the Kanpur Development Authority.The chief minister had issued an order for economic assistance to Manish Gupta’s family.

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Covid: Has Mumbai reached the endemicity stage?||The Covid-19 cases in Mumbai have been hovering between 400 and 500 for the past several weeks now. The number of deaths has been under 10, even as the city’s lockdown restrictions have been eased completely. Barring train travel, public movement in the city is almost back to normal. Has Mumbai achieved a state of endemicity then? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the term endemic as “the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area”. Hindustan Times spoke to experts on Mumbai’s current status: A complex subjectDr Murad Banaji from the Department of Design Engineering and Mathematics, Middlesex University, London said that endemicity is a complex subject that requires consideration of multiple factors. “It is not unusual for numbers to be steady for some time,” Banaji said in an email. “We’ve seen this before, both in Mumbai and elsewhere. We also see it in models and it can occur for several reasons. For example, we see it as the infection spreads from one area to the next. We can also see it as restrictions gradually ease up and mobility increases,” he said. The city’s ‘R’ or reproduction number has been hovering around 1 suggesting that infections are neither surging nor dying away. R refers to the average number of people a Covid positive person infects. The serosurveys carried out in Mumbai have pointed to a high level of exposure to the virus. The city’s vaccination numbers have also gathered momentum with half of the adult population fully vaccinated and nearly 93% given at least one dose. According to Banaji, apart from the multiple factors like exposure to the infection and vaccination, the steady Covid-19 numbers in the city could be because of “endemicity” or an “endemic steady state”. “In this situation, put roughly, you have a balance of effects: (i) people becoming immune to the disease either through vaccination or after being infected, and (ii) the population losing immunity - e.g. migration of people who are susceptible to the disease, or people gradually losing immunity over time,” he said adding that the “endemic steady-state” can be stable over a longer period of time. “If so, we shouldn’t see major uncontrolled surges. We also won’t see disease dying away. So, in a sense, endemicity is both good news and bad news,” said Banaji. So, is Mumbai in an endemic steady state? “Probably not quite - we can’t be sure,” said Banaji. “The reasons why numbers are stable could be a mixture of the factors above. But, given the very high prior infection, and decent levels of vaccination, it is possible that the city is seeing something roughly like an endemic steady state,” he said. Past disaster situationEpidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil said that it is best to not label the situation with terms like endemicity. “What we know is that the city has crossed the ‘disaster situation’ and now it is in a ‘health situation’ wherein people go about their lives and are well aware of precautionary measures like masking and vaccinations,” said Muliyil. “We have also learnt that the virus and its variants respect the previous infection to a large extent. Except for the difference in infectivity, we have not seen a major difference in mortality,” he said. According to Muliyil, even as there is no emergency situation, the government should be vigilant, and constantly tracking variants. “Surveillance is crucial,” he said. While it is believed that the number of reinfections and breakthrough infections may not be high, there is no data available on this. “We don’t know very accurately how long immune responses last after infection/ vaccination - although there is more and more data coming out on this. If immunity is more short-lived than we think, then the population becomes vulnerable to new surges quickly,” said Banaji. He said that the most worrying scenario would be if a new variant starts to circulate, which spreads more easily from person to person, or causes more severe disease, or is more easily able to infect people who have been infected before or vaccinated. “If this happens, then the dynamics could change rapidly and there could be a major surge,” he said. Thick tailA member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, Dr Shashank Joshi said that the World Health Organization will have to first declare the pandemic as over, in order to talk about endemicity. “There may be some degree of baseline endemicity-like stage in Mumbai, but it is still too soon to say,” said Joshi adding that the steady numbers seen in Mumbai are the thick tail of the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-has-mumbai-reached-the-endemicity-stage-101633882859765.html

In the suicide note, which was found at Mahant Narendra Giri’s room in the evening on September 20 in Prayagraj, he has mentioned name of two persons Aditya Mishra and Shailendra Singh Sengar, a realtor, who owed ₹25 lakh to the seer. However, it is still not clear that for what, when and how the payments were made. It is believed that the money was related to the sold property of Baghambari Gaddi Math and it was to be taken from the two persons. Meanwhile, the CBI investigations are still focused on cracking the case through scientific evidence and questioning those close to Mahant Narendra Giri and his disciple Anand Giri. The CBI is joining the dots to establish the reasons which may have led to the Mahant to commit suicide. Anand Giri, former priest of Bade Hanuman temple, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep are at present lodged in Naini Central Jail. CBI officials are keeping an eye on the persons who come to meet them. Jail administration has also made arrangements that proper details of persons who come to meet the trio were maintained. The officials, privy to the investigation, said that the activities of Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep were being monitored. “Anand Giri has been kept at a special cell due to security reasons and is under CCTV surveillance while Aadya Tiwari who is ill is lodged in a separate cell with his son Sandeep,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-akhada-parishad-chief-s-death-probe-persons-owing-money-to-narendra-giri-under-cbi-s-scanner-101633882562764.html

10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to see up to 3 hours of daily power cuts till Oct 13 amid coal crisis||Punjab will witness up to three hour of daily power cuts till October 13 due to a severe shortage of coal which has forced the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to reduce its power generation and impose load shedding in places across the state.Chairman and managing director of the state-owned utility A Venuprasad said on Sunday thermal power plants in Punjab were operating at less than 50 per cent of their generation capacity as the state had only received 11 rakes of coal against its requirement of 22.Private thermal plants have stocks to last just one and a half days while state-owned ones have stocks to last the next four days, he added."Yesterday, 11 coal rakes were received against the total requirement of 22 rakes. Because of depleted coal stock, these plants are operating at less than 50 per cent of their generation capacity," he said in a statement.However, cities across the state are experiencing power cuts of up to six hours and on Saturday morning, Patiala, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Barnala, Sangrur and Bathinda experienced load sheddings that lasted for up to four hours.The state has been witnessing power issues for quite some months now as the power plants were unable to meet the rising demand for electricity amid a paddy sowing season and soaring temperatures.Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu had earlier blamed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with three private thermal plants signed by the previous Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government for the outages.“Power purchase agreements (PPAs) - Badal Govt signed PPAs with 3 private thermal power plants in Punjab. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid 5400 crore due to faulty clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay 65,000 Crore of Punjab People’s Money just as fixed charges,” he saidPunjab continues to pay an exorbitant rate to buy electricity from the power exchange in order to meet demands of both the general public and the agriculture sector.PSPCL procured 1,800 MW of power on Sunday at a rate of ₹11.60 per unit from the power exchange but still could not do away with load shedding, Venuprasad said.Neighbouring states of Delhi and Haryana also are experiencing similar shortages and the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government held a press conference on Sunday urging the Centre to take note of the acute shortage of coal in thermal power plants, comparing the scenario with the oxygen crisis the national capital had witnessed at the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year.PSPCL also said that after the intervention of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi the situation had improved and the shortage was expected to ease from October 15 an expected fall in demand and proper stockpiling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-see-up-to-3-hours-of-daily-power-cuts-till-oct-13-amid-coal-crisis-101633881486406.html

The CM also said that he has asked the Centre for increased supply in view of the possible power crisis in the state due to the shortage of coal supplies.Further, Bommai said that the state needs clearances for two projects for the allotment of coal from mines in Chandrapur, Maharashtra and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited in Odisha. "I have met the minister of environment, forest and climate change Bhupendra Yadav, who, too, has assured me that once the letter from Maharashtra reaches him, he will expedite the process," PTI quoted Bommai as saying. While some clearances have already been obtained for the Mahanadi Coalfield, a few more were still needed, he added.Also read | ‘No threat of power supply disruption, Coal India has stock to meet 24 days of demand’ says coal minister Pralhad JoshiHe also said that the production cost would reduce once the coal from the two mines were allotted to the state. Alongside Yadav, the CM has also requested Union coal minister Pralhad Joshi to expedite the allotment process and to increase the coal supply.Earlier in the day, Joshi said that there was no threat of power supply disruption due to coal shortage and assured that there were enough supplies with Coal India Limited to meet 24 days of demand following a review meeting.“Assuring everyone that there is absolutely no threat of disruption in power supply. There is sufficient coal stock of 43 million tonnes with @CoalIndiaHQ (Coal India) equivalent to 24 days of coal demand,” Joshi tweeted.The minister also assured that the coal despatches were expected to increase after the withdrawal of the monsoon. “Thermal power plants have rolling stock being replenished with daily supply. Moreover, with the withdrawal of monsoons, coal despatches are set to rise in the coming days thereby increasing coal stocks. Reiterating, there is sufficient coal stock, do not fall for fear mongering,” Joshi said in a subsequent tweet. Also, the Union coal ministry also issued a statement saying that fear about power supply disruption was “entirely misplaced” and the coal stock at power plants was at 72 lakh tonnes which was sufficient to meet four days of requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/requested-centre-to-increase-coal-supply-to-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-on-concerns-about-power-disruption-101633880659850.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Five districts of Maharashtra have 75% active Covid-19 cases||Five districts of Maharashtra — Pune, Mumbai, Ahmednagar, Thane, and Satara account for almost 74% of the cumulative active Covid-19 patients who are currently on treatment. The latest report from the public health department shows that no sudden spike in the pandemic curve has been witnessed in any districts of Maharashtra. The seven-day positivity rate of the state stands at 2.1%.As per the data, there are a total of 33,006 active Covid-19 patients in the state, of which 24,277 are undergoing treatment at Pune, Mumbai, Ahmednagar, Thane, and Satara. The highest number of active Covid-19 patients are in Pune (8,422), followed by Mumbai (5,949), Thane (4,220), Ahmednagar (3,803) and Satara (1,883).Other than this, another five districts — Raigad, Solapur, Sangli, Nashik and Sindhudurg collectively have 15% of the state’s active Covid-19 patients.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said that in the past 20 days, the number of active cases has fallen by 21%. “At present, out of the 36 districts, 10 have 90% of the active Covid-19 cases. Cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune with higher populations have most of the active cases, which have been the scenario since the start of the pandemic last year,” he said.Also, the seven-day positivity rate has dropped from 2.5% to 2.1% in the same period in the state. Between September 13 and 20, Ahmednagar had recorded a 5.3% seven-day positivity rate — the highest in the state — has now dropped to 3.1%. However, in the last week, the district has been recording a daily 5% positivity rate. Restrictions have been imposed in 61 villages in Akole, Karjat, Kopargaon, Newasa, Parner, Pathardi, Rahata, Sangamner, Shevgaon, Shrigonda, and Srirampur tehsils, said Bhosale.District collector of Ahmednagar Rajendra Bhosale said, “The district is witnessing 500-800 cases daily and the positivity rate has climbed to over 5%. We have witnessed that people are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Hence, we have been forced to impose restrictions.”Along with this, Sindhudurg is also becoming a cause of concern as the seven-day positivity rate of the district stands at 4.7%.Recently, Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, Maharashtra (health) held a meeting with the public health officers from these 10 districts and asked them to pay special attention. He has also been instructed to increase the daily testing in these districts.“During the Ganesh Chaturthi, almost two lakh people turned up in Konkan Region. So, this is one of the contributing factors for the rise in positivity rate in these districts, including Sindhudurg. If caseload increases further, we may impose local lockdown,” said a senior health officer who was part of the team.However, the cumulative seven-day positivity rate in the state has dropped from 2.5% to 2.1% between September 20 and October 9. Dr Awate said that from May to the first week of October, over 10,000 samples have been sent for genome sequencing from Maharashtra. But no new variant of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been identified. “Almost 80-90% of the samples had the Delta variant and its sub-lineages variants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-districts-of-maharashtra-have-75-active-covid-19-cases-101633877519419.html

The car swept away with the high tide. However, the locals managed to pull it out with the help of a JCB excavator and thick ropes.“On Saturday the grey coloured Mahindra Xylo was parked near the Uttan coast. Locals had warned the Andheri-based owner against it, but he said he will return shortly as he was going to the nearby market to buy fish,” said Bernard D’Mello a local social activist.“Soon, the high tide and the gushing water swept away the MUV and the owner had still not returned. The locals called a JCB and with ropes pulled the car out, even as the water levels began to rise,” said D’Mello. The car was centrally locked and pulling it out was an issue, he said.“When the owner arrived, he spoke rudely to the locals. However, when he was told about the incident, he mellowed down and appreciated the efforts,” D’Mello said.Uttan police are questioning the driver as the MUV had an unclear license plate and was used as a tourist vehicle. The driver did not provide any documents to support the same, said D’mello.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-tide-sweeps-car-at-uttan-locals-pull-it-out-101633877399375.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Green nod for CZMP may spur redevelopment activity near Mumbai coastline||The residents of Yuwan Apartments Cooperative Housing Society, Bandra will now get double the area than which they are currently residing as the Union environment ministry last week gave a green signal to the much-awaited Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Mumbai city and suburbs.“All of 136 residents of our complex will get double the area than which they are residing, and we will generate a corpus of ₹100 crore,” said Akbar Jiwani, a resident and legal advisor of revamp scheme. “Those in one BHK (bedroom hall and kitchen) will get a free two BHK, while those currently residing in two BHK will shift to four BHK in the plush Bandra area,” he added.The revamp was earlier impossible due to the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) restrictions, as any project within 500 metres of the high tide line and 150 metres from the bay were allowed a base floor space index (FSI) of 1.33 in the island city and 1 in the Mumbai suburbs.However, now with the easing of this norm, the city will witness multiple skyscrapers facing the sea as builders will get almost two and half times the developmental rights on such plots. The builders will get a minimum FSI of 2.50.The move is expected to lead to a spurt in vertical growth along Mumbai’s coastline, virtually changing its skyline.Liases Foras, a real estate research firm estimates that around 10,000 such old buildings, as well as 0.2 million slums, will benefit from this largesse.Niranjan Hiranandani, founder of the Hiranandani Group, who has constructed large townships in Powai and Thane, said this has been a long-standing demand. “This will open up land parcels for redevelopment and spur up the revamp of old buildings and slums. These new rules will make the projects viable,” said Hiranandani.Kumar Padyar, 42, who has spent his entire life in the sprawling Madraswadi slum that houses 2,100 families, opposite Worli sea face, now hopes this move will facilitate the redevelopment of the slum. The residents live in tiny shanties of 64-180 square feet and comprise poor class labourers doing menial jobs.“Our condition is so bad that we have to line up for more than one hour outside the toilets in the morning,” Padyar said. The slum has just six toilets for 350 families. “We have suffered enough in such conditions and want our children to live a decent life. The house should be well contained with personal toilets for the families. We hope that at least now the builders will take interest in our slum,” said Padyar,, who is also the managing committee member in this slum.The CRZ regulation first came into force in 1991 to monitor the activities along the coastal stretch. This created a lot of hurdles in the revamp. In December 2018, the Central government separated FSI from CRZ rules through a CRZ notification, 2019. However, not much activity was undertaken after that as the Central government linked this notification with the finalisation of CZMP maps. This was finally approved last week.Various places like Cuffe Parade, Bandra, Khar, Malad, Gorai, Worli have multiple slum pockets which will be benefitted from the easing of norms. Similarly, the Queen’s Necklace housing the area of Marine Drive-Malabar Hill area is dotted with hundreds of such old buildings. Similar is the stretch in the Western suburbs from Bandra to Dahisar.CY Corp, a leading architectural firm, which is handling 15 projects in the CRZ area said, “These are areas which are already developed and we have people living there. These people are living in dangerous buildings and should get the benefit of the redevelopment as others. We have seen such bay being developed in advanced countries like America and Australia where construction rules are very stringent,” said Milind Changani of CY Corp who is also the sub-committee member, Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI) redevelopment committee. “The new rules have made it mandatory that disaster management and environmental assessment be done in such projects which is the best move,” he added.Another major beneficiary of this move will be the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) which has been appointed as the special planning authority (SPA) for beautifying 966.30 hectares along the city’s 28-km eastern waterfront. The plan has also proposed public parks, plazas, promenades, walking trails and marinas apart from restaurants and cafes. “We are still to study the new order,” said Rajiv Jalota, chairman, MbPT. The MbPT area extends from Sassoon Docks to Wadala.Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras, said that this move will facilitate large scale construction activity. “We will see a large supply of housing stock coming up in the market. This will soften the prices too,” said Kapoor. “However we will also see the sea-facing apartments being sold at a premium, since citizens have a fascination for such apartments,” he added.However, the environmentalists are unhappy with the decision. “Our municipal commissioner says by 2050 major parts of south Mumbai will go underwater due to rising sea levels and here we are allowing unrestricted development near the seafront. The 1989 CRZ draft is very clear that areas vulnerable to flooding because of sea-level rise should be kept free from all developmental activities and today we are doing exactly the opposite,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka. “This is nothing but a goldmine for the builders,” he added. Goenka called this disaster management and environmental assessment an eyewash. “Such studies and assessments are made to suit the needs of the builders,” he added.Maharashtra housing minister Jitendra Awhad said the government will maintain a balance between housing and the environment. “All environmental concerns will be addressed while undertaking the redevelopment near the CRZ areas,” said Awhad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/green-light-for-czmp-may-spur-redevelopment-activity-near-mumbai-coastline-101633877219713.html
10-10-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow set for Durga Puja amid Covid norms for second successive year||Lucknow will renew its bond of piety with the Goddess as the five-day Durga Puja celebrations begin on Monday amid observance of social distancing and other Covid protocols for the second successive year.Some of the prominent venues for the Durga Puja celebrations in Lucknow this year are: Ramakrishna Math in Nirala Nagar, Mitro Sangho at Model House, Bengali Club & Youngmen’s Association on Shivaji Marg (Hewett Road), Trans-Gomti Dussehra and Durga Puja Committee in Aliganj and Rabinidra Palli among others.While most of the Durga Puja committees had installed idols in Lucknow last year, some performed the worship symbolically with a kalash (urn) due to the pandemic. This year, the Covid situation is under control. For instance, no fresh Covid case was reported in Lucknow on Saturday. According to the state health department data, there are 33 active Covid cases under treatment in Lucknow and a majority are in home isolation.Kumari Puja to be the highlight at Ramakrishna MathAs in the previous years, Ramakrishna Math, Nirala Nagar, would be a prominent venue of the celebrations in Lucknow and the highlight would be Kumari Puja on October 13.During Kumari Puja, Goddess Durga would be invoked in a six-year-old girl and worshipped by sanyasis of the Ramakrishna order.“The special attention of the festival will be (on) Kumari Puja i.e, worship of Devi Durga in the form of a six-year-old girl at 9.30am on Wednesday (October 13). It symbolises the special presence of the Divine Mother within every woman,” said Swami Muktinathananda, adhyaksha (head of the Math). “Shortlisting a little girl for the occasion is a difficult task as several devotees aspire to see their daughter being worshipped as the deity. We do a small session with a few girls to see how long they can sit quietly. On Ashtami day, the girl will be draped in a saree, to be decked with flower ornaments and a lot more,” he said.Another special attraction will be Sandhi puja, the climax of the five-day celebration. It will comprise the concluding 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami tithi from 7.44pm to 8.32pm on Wednesday (October 13). “Durga Puja will be celebrated by the Ramakrishna Math on its spacious campus at Nirala Nagar, Lucknow, from Monday, October 11 till Friday, October 15, while maintaining the social distancing and other protocols in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. All the programmes will be live streamed on the official YouTube channel: Ramakrishna Math, Lucknow,” he added.Mitro Sangho pandal depicts temple on shipEstablished in 1975, the Mitro Sangho Durga Puja committee of Model House has set up a big pandal this year that depicts a temple on the deck of a ship, said Nitesh Tewari, general secretary of this puja committee. He also said UP technical education minister Jitin Prasada would visit the pandal at 6.30pm on October 12 while law minister Brajesh Pathak will be there on October 13 around the same time.Anando Mela starts festivities at Bengali Club To celebrate the homecoming of the Goddess, the more than century old Bengali Club organised Anando Mela on Sunday. Bengali Club president Arun Banerjee said, “It was our pleasure to see hundreds of people throng the club premises to enjoy the get-together where several food stalls were set up by women members and their families.” “Durga Puja is our most awaited celebration of the year and we really wish to multiply this enjoyment with your (devotees’) presence during this Sharodiya Utsav,” he said.Portraying rural Bengal at Trans-Gomti pujaLike the previous year, this time, too, Trans-Gomti Dussehra and Durga Puja will not hold the rituals at the usual venue Chandra Shekhar Azad Park in the Aliganj area. Rather, the worship will be done indoors opposite the park. Durga Puja committee president Dr Kar Choudhary said, “Our theme is simple. We are replicating Gram Bangla (rural Bengal) on the puja premises. Owing to Covid-19, bhog prasad will not be distributed to the masses.”Rabindra Palli: Idol to be backOwing to the Covid situation, the Rabindra Palli Durga Puja committee did not place an order for a Durga idol last year. Instead, they did Kalash puja and it was only open for members and their family. This year, the 38-year-old puja committee will have a Durga idol in place as the Covid-19 situation has eased, said Pankaj Bose, general secretary of this puja committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-set-for-durga-puja-amid-covid-norms-for-second-successive-year-101633875479346.html

10-10-2021||Dehradun||Portals of Sikh shrine Hemkund Sahib closes for winter months||The portals of the holy Sikh shrine Hemkund Sahib in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand were closed on Sunday. Sewa Singh, manager of the Shri Hemkund Sahib Management Trust said this year the portals of the shrine were opened on September 18. He said generally every year the portals of the shrine are opened on March 25 and shut on October 10. “However, last year and this year too, there was a delay in the opening of the portals due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. This year over 10,000 pilgrims visited the shrine compared to around 8,500 last year. In 2019, 1.65 lakh pilgrims had visited the shrine. Situated at a height of over 15,000 feet above sea level, Hemkund Sahib has emerged as a popular centre of Sikh pilgrimage which is visited by lakhs of devotees from all over the world every summer. Hemkund is inaccessible because of snow from October to April. A 1,100-metre climb on a 6-kilometre of stone-paved path leads to Hemkund Sahib. According to the website of the shrine, it was during the thirties of the twentieth century that the place was discovered by Sant Sohan Singh and Bhai Modam Singh. Bhai Vir Singh, a Sikh savant and a leading figure of the Singh Sabha movement played an important role in helping these two people by verifying for them the location of the place and later by providing financial support for building a gurudwara at Hemkund Sahib.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/portals-of-sikh-shrine-hemkund-sahib-closes-for-winter-months-101633870318680.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Wasteful spray on paddy leads to increase in pest population: Experts||A survey carried out by two Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) experts in paddy growing areas of the state has found wasteful use of pesticides, fungicides and insecticides on the mature paddy crop. The experts opined that the wasteful use of substandard pesticides was increasing the population of insects.They observed that the injudicious spray of insecticides was also prevalent in the area where basmati crops were grown. During the survey, it was found that in a majority of the cases, substandard and needless pesticides were sold by insecticide dealers from whom farmers purchase insecticide on credit or borrow money.The experts said farmers were incurring an extra cost of ₹900 per acre for spray on the crop which was both harmful for the soil and the environment. Besides, it is also leading to an increase in the population of unwanted insects.Dr Amarjit Singh, plant pathologist, and Dr Kamaljit Singh Suri, entomologists from the PAU, said during the survey it was found that a few pesticide dealers were also spreading fear among farmers that their standing crop would suffer pest attack due to the late monsoon season.“Due to pest attack on cotton crop, paddy farmers are already jittery and they are falling in the trap of pesticide dealers,” said Dr Amarjit Singh. He said so far they had covered 15 districts and the problem of wasteful use of pesticides was most prevalent in Sangrur district, followed by Patiala and Mansa. Dr Suri said farmers should not be scared of leaf folder moths. “As the crop is already mature by now, it is not required to spray any pesticides. Instead of falling into the trap of a pesticide dealer, farmers should approach experts of the agriculture department, Krishi Vigyan Kendra and plant clinic in the PAU,” he said.“Brown planthopper (BPH – Kala Tela) — The use of synthetic pyrethroids (an insecticide group) like deltamethrin, cypermethrin, etc, leads to the resurgence of rice planthoppers. Farmers on the advice of pesticide dealers use these synthetic pyrethroids in a mixture with other insecticides for control of rice leaf folders. But their use results in increased population and hence damage by planthoppers. The PAU does not recommend the use of synthetic pyrethroids on rice/basmati,” said Dr Suri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wasteful-spray-on-paddy-leads-to-increase-in-pest-population-experts-101633868998466.html
10-10-2021||Bangalore||Modern Indian women want to stay single & unwilling to give birth: Karnataka minister||Calling it a paradigm shift which is "not good", Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Sunday said modern Indian women want to stay single and are unwilling to give birth even after marriage and desire children by surrogacy, news agency PTI reported. He went on to lament the “western influence” on Indian society, asserting people don't want their parents to live with them anymore."Today, I am sorry to say this, lots of modern women in India want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don't want to give birth. They want surrogacy. So there is a paradigm shift in our thinking, which is not good," he said during the World Mental Health Day at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS)."Unfortunately, today we are going in a western way. We don't want our parents to live with us, forget about grandparents being with us," the minister added.Speaking about mental health in India, Sudhakar said every seventh Indian has some kind of mental issue, adding, stress management is an art and Indians can fall back on tools of yoga and meditation taught by our ancestors."Stress management is an art. This art we need not learn as Indians. We need to preach to the world how to handle stress, because yoga, meditation and Pranayama are the wonderful tools which our ancestors had taught the world thousands of years back," he said.Sudhakar later thanked Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya for providing Karnataka 1.5 crore Covid-19 vaccines every month since September, leading to increased inoculation coverage in the state.The minister also applauded the Centre for administering 94 crore vaccines ever since the country undertook the Herculean task of vaccinating the entire population free of cost."We are the only country which is offering vaccines free of cost. Elsewhere, people are made to pay between ₹1,500 to ₹4,000 per vaccine," Sudhakar said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/indian-women-want-to-stay-single-unwilling-to-give-birth-karnataka-minister-101633864514438.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi may be in for power cuts if coal shortage not resolved: Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said that the national capital may have to plan power cuts if the shortage of coal continued in power plants, even as he criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government for allegedly being dismissive about the crisis, citing the example of the oxygen crisis during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April.“We shall have to consider planning power cuts in Delhi if stocks are not replenished in 24 hours. There is a major crisis of coal in several power plants. The Union minister has dismissed the shortage and criticised chief minister Arvind Kejriwal writing to Prime Minister Modi regarding the matter,” Sisodia said in a press conference on Sunday.“The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is failing to govern the country and they are running away from responsibilities. In a similar fashion, states had warned the Union government against an oxygen crisis and the Central government dodged its responsibilities. Now the coal shortage issue can lead to a power crisis situation,” he said.“A power crisis is equivalent to pushing the country into a dark pit. Governments in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi are seeking help from the Union government but it has so far failed in resolving the matter. The Union government is stressing more on proving that states are wrong in their assessment of power shortage. Governments operate through cooperation. We urge the Union government to be more cooperative,” said Sisodia.Delhi could face power outages if the Central government does not quickly resolve the coal shortage at power plants, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Saturday. His remarks followed reports that over half of 135 coal-fired utilities, which supply more than half of India’s electricity, have fuel stocks to last just under three days.Kejriwal sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the crisis in a letter. A supply disruption could impact strategic institutions such as hospitals, cold chains for Covid-19 vaccines and Covid Care Centres, he wrote.Of the five coal-fired thermal power plants that supply Delhi about 1,971MW electricity every day, at least one has completely run out of stock, Kejriwal wrote in the letter. He was referring to the Mejia thermal power station in West Bengal, which provides 100MW of electricity to Delhi.The plant has no coal reserve to generate electricity for even one extra day, the letter indicated. Of the remaining four, three had only a day of coal stocks, while the fourth had a reserve of four days, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-may-be-in-for-power-cuts-if-coal-shortage-not-resolved-sisodia-101633865938052.html

Private thermal plants flouting guidelines, punishing domestic consumers by not keeping coal stock for 30 days should be penalised," Sidhu tweeted.Talking about the alternative to coal for power generation, he said it is time to aggressively work on the solar electricity models."It is time to aggressively work on solar PPAs, and roof-top solar connected to the Grid," said Sidhu in his tweet.Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday asked the central government to immediately enhance State's coal supply as per quota to tide over the power crisis with the impending shutdown of its thermal plants due to fast depleting coal reserves which are likely to be exhausted within the next couple of days.Other states like Chhattisgarh and Delhi have also raised the issue of coal shortage in the last couple of days.In Delhi, amid the possibility of a power blackout in the national capital, the officials of Delhi's Power Ministry, BSES and Tata power reached the residence of Union Power Minister RK Singh on Sunday for a meeting over coal shortage at power plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-should-prepare-for-looming-power-crisis-prevent-it-navjot-singh-sidhu-101633861502955.html
10-10-2021||Bhopal||More than 140 cows pushed into ditch, rescue operation is going on||Administration in Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa district has been running an operation since October 1 to rescue at least 140 cows that were pushed into a ditch by some villagers who allegedly wanted to protect their crop, said officials aware of the development. A few residents of Lalgaon and Sarai Rachoi village reportedly pushed the cows one by one into Rewah Ghati (a local ditch) to deal with the problem of cows destroying standing crops in their fields . Many cows received grave injuries and several others have died, alleged Sanjay Sharma, a resident of Lalgaon village who lodged the complaint on October 1. The matter received wide publicity on Friday after a video clip of the rescue operation went viral on social media. The MP Police have registered a case under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act at Garh police station against five named and more than a dozen unnamed villagers for pushing stray and other cows that were past their milking period into the Rewah Ghati. “The case has been registered against Kailsah Yadav, Dheerendra Singh, Mahendra Singh, Baccha Saket and Brijvasi Yadav, all residents of Lalgaon,” said Rewa, superintendent of police Navneet Bhasin. “They are absconding and we are trying to nab them. We are also identifying the other accused as villagers claim that this has been going on for the past few months to get rid of stray cows,” said Bhasin. The district collector also formed a committee to probe the matter. “We are also trying to find out how such a huge number of cows reached the village,” district collector Iliyaraj T said. We are also shifting the stray and the rescued cows to nearby shelters, he added. However, a villager claimed that the administration has been very late to react and urged that they be punished too. “Despite informing the administration about this brutal treatment with cows, nobody paid attention initially,” he said. Madhya Pradesh is the first state to have a Cow Cabinet comprising six different departments for coordinated action for welfare and protection of cows. The opposition Congress party has attacked the state government alleging the condition of cows was poor in MP.“The cows are dying without food and shelter and the state government is indulging in drama of cow protection. The miserable condition of cows is exposing the fake concern of the state government,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson of the Congress party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/more-than-140-cows-pushed-into-ditch-rescue-operation-is-going-on-101633860537582.html

What you need to know||The Maharashtra ruling alliance has called for a statewide bandh on October 11 to protest against the killing of four farmers in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA)—the ruling coalition of the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena—on Saturday said that bandh has been called to show that the state is with the farmers of the country.On Saturday, Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha lawmaker Sanjay Raut said his party will participate with full force in the Maharashtra bandh. Raut said it was necessary to wake people up against the Centre’s anti-farmer policies, adding that farmers are not alone in their fight and the process of showing solidarity with them must begin from Maharashtra. “All the three parties will actively participate in the bandh. What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri was a murder of the country’s Constitution, a violation of the law and a conspiracy to kill the food-provider farmers of the country,” Raut said while addressing a press conference along with NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik and state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Also read | Maharashtra bandh: Pune’s Market Yard to remain shut on October 11, essential services won’t be affected“We appeal to people that they must come together.

Malik added that the bandh would come into force from Sunday midnight. “We appeal to all the workers to not create any issues for the essential services, such as hospitals, ambulance, medical stories, milk supply, during the bandh,” he also said.Also read | MVA leaders prepare to make bandh successful in PuneTraders associations have decided to keep Pune Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) closed on Monday by participating in a Maharashtra bandh.

10-10-2021||Delhi||Multiple challenges, no resolve, rue food delivery agents||Recently, a post was doing rounds on the internet about a restaurant named Corner House Ice Creams, situated in some undisclosed location, banning the food delivery executives from using their washrooms. Previously, a mall in Udaipur had come under the scanner for not allowing the riders to use the lift in its premises. And these cases are not exceptions as a Twitter account named Delivery Bhoy, keeps posting about the miserable working conditions being faced by food delivery agents. The issues these executives face range from low pay structures, abysmal bonuses and no job security to being ill-treated by restaurant managers and their staff. Even the riders who work as long as 12 hours in a day to ensure delivery of hot and fresh food at people’s doorsteps, have to often face heat from the customers. “Washroom kya, kai log toh paani tak offer nahi karte,” says Keemat, 29, a food delivery executive from Delhi. He recently shifted from Noida to the Kirti Nagar. He says, “Yaha restaurant wale bilkul acche tarike se baat nahi karte. Noida mein lagta tha ke restaurants ko humari zaroorat hai. Yaha shift hoke aisa feel hua jaise humein inki zaroorat. Bohot gande manner se baat karte hai kai log.” Some delivery agents talk of not being paid any extra amount by the food aggregator for travelling additional distances. Vijay Kumar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is currently living in Hauz Khas, rues, “I usually starts my shift at 2.30pm and work till midnight. Koi extra paisa nahi milta thoda extra kilometer pe jaane ka kyunki kabhi-kabhi customer exact location nahi daalta.”Riders feel that they’re stuck in a catch 22 situation. “Duty toh kabhi kabhi 12 ghante ki kar lete hai kyunki incentive milta hai. Par humein toh dono taraf se sunna padta hai. Jab restaurant order late karta hai toh bhi humari complaint hoti hai. Dono taraf se humari koi khaas sunwai nahi hoti,” says Manoj Sharma, 27, who recently joined a food aggregator platform after losing his job in Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/multiple-challenges-no-resolve-rue-food-delivery-agents-101633851001630.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||A Buddy for all times: Dog who made our lives whole||Thirteen years ago, we brought home a beautiful golden-maned puppy despite mother’s resistance. Father’s heavy solitary vote weighed in, and we welcomed our pet, Buddy, and embraced with him all of his antics. Be it shredding toilet paper, or chewing furniture legs, or boldly strutting into mother’s room with muddied paws, we all learnt to love him in our own ways. He shared a companionable silence with father during his morning newspaper reading routine. He listened to the evening ‘ardas (prayer)’, almost with reverence, at mother’s feet. He furtively assisted my sister finish many a meal from under the dining table. He was a permanent fixture by my side, whether it was burning the midnight oil, or an evening with friends, or even while getting married. After my sister and I moved out of our parental home, we never felt that our parents would go through the empty-nest syndrome. They filled their time with purposeful work, and get-togethers at home adorned with lovely confabulations with friends and family. Later, the chatter of their grandchildren also added to the vibrancy of their evenings. They finally found time for their own interests, like golfing and gardening. And after the end of the day, there was always Buddy. Although a much more sober version of his former youthful self, Buddy would climb stairs despite his excruciating arthritis and give them company. His diminishing energy levels would forbid him from running around, but he would wag his tail in participation from where he was sitting. Buddy, after having lived a wholesome life, left us in August. When he passed away, my children accompanied us to bury him. They too joined us in bidding him farewell with flowers and cards. They had a slew of questions for me later. “Mama, will Buddy become a star?” “Will he be reborn as a puppy and come back to us?” “Will he be happy going to God?” I didn’t have any answers for them at that moment. We opened our treasure on the phone instead, and revisited fond memories of him. Buddy’s first night at home, his insatiable appetite, his rather overly enthusiastic way of greeting guests, the way he tiptoed around my babies when they arrived… the memories were countless. His loss sensed similar to what I felt when I moved from my parents’ home. The time was right, the shift was synchronous with the natural flow of life. However, it felt like the end of a chapter. The average life span of a golden retriever is 10-12 years, Buddy had outlived it. In terms of theories on age and longevity, the time was certainly ‘right’. This was, indeed, the natural course of life. However, no matter how wholesome a life one has led, no matter how many good things await in the future, one can never be quite prepared for leaving. Although, leaving, despite all the hurt that accompanies, is positive. It denotes movement from one milestone to the next, from one chapter to the next. Still, there remains a tinge of longing, because life cannot be lived backwards. When Buddy left, it too felt like the end of a chapter. However, leaving, though uneasy, signals a new start. He came into our lives and changed us. We bonded in so many ways because of him. He filled our lives with so much love and laughter, that we’ll always have ample space in our hearts for pets, even though, there’s a corner in our hearts which will always remain with Buddy alone. As Rodger A Caras says, “Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole.” seeratsandhu25@yahoo.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-buddy-for-all-times-dog-who-made-our-lives-whole-101633850276058.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Why was Aryan Khan denied bail? Magistrate's court cites this act||Aryan Khan and two others, who were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drug raid on a luxury cruise ship last week, were denied bail by a local court in Mumbai on Friday. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) RM Nerlikar sent Aryan Khan to jail for two weeks pending an investigation of the case. Aryan Khan, the eldest son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were arrested on October 3 after the NCB claimed it seized banned drugs aboard the cruise ship off the Mumbai coast. They have been booked under various provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.In his 15-page order released on Saturday, Nerlikar said that a magistrate's court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain a bail application for an offence with prescribed punishment of more than three years under the NDPS act as it has to be tried by a special court. He said "this court ceases its jurisdiction to entertain the applications for bail" considering section 36A and the fact that all three were held for one crime under various provisions of the NDPS Act for which the prescribed punishment was more than three years.Also read | Byju’s stops Shah Rukh Khan ad amid Aryan Khan drugs probeThe magistrate noted that NCB’s investigation has shown that allegations levelled against all the accused are in respect of consumption, sale and purchase, with intermediate quantity as well as commercial quantity of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances allegedly being seized, for which the punishment prescribed is more than three years.Also read | Agency let off BJP leader’s kin after raid: NCP’s Nawab MalikAdditional solicitor general Anil Singh on Friday challenged the bail pleas claiming the magistrate court had no jurisdiction to hear such applications in this matter. As lawyers of those accused argued for bail citing previous orders, the magistrate said such decisions were not useful as facts and circumstances of the present case were at hand. He also that the decisions cited by the lawyers differed from each other. "The same are related to the powers of the Sessions Court and the High Court. Considering all these aspects, the bail applications filed by the accused are not maintainable before this court. The same are required to be rejected," he added.Also read | NCB records statement of Shah Rukh Khan’s driver in drugs bust caseA lawyer said Aryan Khan, lodged at Arthur Road prison, has approached the sessions court for bail and the hearing is likely to be held on Monday.

He was allowed to go after his father and uncle reached NCB office,” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said.Malik had earlier in the week also attacked NCB over the “involvement” of individuals from outside the agency during the raid, which he termed as “fake”.The NCB termed Malik’s allegations as baseless. “NCB reiterates that its procedure has been and will continue to be professionally and legally transparent and unbiased”, Gyaneshwar Singh, deputy director general of NCB, said in a statement released on Saturday.Kamboj, who threatened to file a ₹100-crore defemation case against Malik, rejected the allegations.“Nawab Malik ji claimed that the mobile phone of my father-in-law was used to contact BJP leaders in Delhi and Mumbai. So which agency do we have to submit the mobile phone? take his contact number, get a forensic examination done... Do not make vague allegations, come up with evidence,”he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/agency-let-off-bjp-leader-s-kin-after-raid-ncp-s-nawab-malik-101633814525385.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | The viper and the squirrel||The lure of hard-earned food is such that serpents are loath to discard prey even if humans are present as an unwelcome audience. A series of definitive photos in dazzling, rich colours captured a Russell’s viper ingesting a squirrel in broad daylight in the parking of the Teachers’ Flats at Panjab University.The viper was in full view of panicky residents and the rescue team, but it did not budge till it had fully taken in the squirrel. Neither did the rescue team indulge in the sentimental stupidity of attempting to “rescue” the squirrel from the viper!The photographs were clicked by Dikshant Kanojia, a budding naturalist and wildlife rescue personnel. Kanojia hails from a humble background, but works part time to fund his passion, while pursuing an undergraduate degree in the arts.Vipers resort to varied hunting techniques. They can ambush and bite its prey and wait for it to perish before ingesting it. Or, a viper may grab prey without biting it, and then ingest it head-first to reduce flailing resistance. It could bite the prey while swallowing it as venom aids digestion.When it comes to a squirrel, a viper may quickly swallow it as venom takes time to kill. The viper senses that a bitten squirrel may yet have time to scurry up a tree and find its last refuge in a hole out of the viper’s reach. Flower gloom, blood bloomThe role that chance or luck play in human-wildlife interaction was underscored in an emphatic manner, laced with a touch of merciless irony. A luckless wildlife photographer could spend years hard tracking mighty eagles and yet not frame a noteworthy predation moment that could set a new benchmark for action photography. On the other hand, a disappointed photographer out to capture something else could be bestowed a spectacle so unsurpassable that it could regale viewers for a century.Rajkumar Dongare was scouting the outskirts of Mayureshwar wildlife sanctuary, Maharashtra, to photograph the Caralluma fimbriata flower, an iconic plant whose extract is eaten by tribal hunters to suppress hunger and thirst before embarking on long shikars. Specialising in flower photography and not birds, Donagare was dejected as cattle had grazed over the flowering grasslands. By chance, his companion, Amit Kuwal, noticed an agitated Bonelli’s eagle 15 feet away. For 45 minutes, they closely witnessed the eagle killing and eating a sturdy monitor lizard (Goh) in full view.The eagle jumped repeatedly to gather momentum for impact. The eagle would land hard on the lizard and the talons would embed deep. The lizard’s left foreleg was mangled as the eagle lifted the heavy reptile. Suffering unimaginable pain, the lizard battled to get free of the golden rakes. Its blood fountained to smatter the grasses bereft of seasonal flowers. As life ebbed from the flailing lizard, the eagle calmed down. The flattened battlefield grasses cautiously curved erect, and they were finally ‘petalled’, with dainty crimson spots of blood. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-viper-and-the-squirrel-101633817679489.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Health is the crowning jewel of life||“I never fall ill,” I would retort as soon as somebody started bombarding me with unsolicited health advice. After all, removing my tonsils four decades ago had so far been the only time I had required hospitalisation. As they say one should not brag about Divine benedictions, and I was soon eating my words after a two-pronged attack of dengue and typhoid brought me down.The twin diseases were like a stone dropped in placid pool whose ripples would take days to subside. When my platelet count nosedived, I was taken to the nearest private hospital. However, dissatisfied with the medical care provided, we decided to shift to the Military Hospital.A patient recovered is a customer lost and sarcasm was all I could use before paying a bill of almost half a lakh for the few hours spent in therapeutic captivity and by the time I was in the hands of the combat healers, a lot of time had been wasted and weakness and rising temperatures had taken a toll on my body.It was a collapse at an ungodly hour in the dark of night that raised panic and sent me to the intensive care unit. The last time I lost consciousness was during flying training days when my instructor subjected me to a high level of anti-gravity acceleration. However, this time the experience came at a rather embarrassing place : the washroom.Wired with instruments monitoring different parameters, never had I known hours like these. Infusion of platelets, medicines and fluids through my veins was another maiden experience. With five of my co-patients on ventilator and one with terminal cancer, my heart went out seeing their plight as I wondered if they would ever lead a normal life hereafter. Even though placed in a much better league in comparison, I struggled to maintain high spirits in that gloomy odour of sorrow. The praiseworthy doctors worked round the clock like a shadow of God on earth in their struggle of pulling patients from the jaws of death.As I waited for time to heal me, I felt a conviction grow on me. If life was the greatest gift, then a healthy life was a jewel in the crown. There was so much life had to offer and yet one succumbed to ego, jealousy and anger, which disturb the harmony of the body, mind and spirit. Wasn’t it better to count your blessing rather than nurture the pain of regrets, deficiencies and failures? We climb sublime heights on wings of fancy, little realising that life was stranger than fiction and an invisible microbe was enough to lay bare the fickleness of fortune.While I have no clue where I fit in the great scheme of things, nor do I seem to have any role in the cosmic drama, thankfully the veil of illusion that had clouded my vision has lifted. I walked out of the hospital, emaciated, but wiser with a heart full of gratitude leaving little room for negativity.Thank God for adversity, it has finally dawned upon me that happiness is the highest form of health and the only constant in life.harrypal71@yahoo.co.in(The writer is a Mohali-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-health-is-the-crowning-jewel-of-life-101633817378476.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays | Creative thinking a must for students||Creative learning is a rarity in our country as most schools and colleges emphasise on memorising bookish details over the years.Rote learning had become so much a part of our existence that I still recall some of the rattas that I had rattled off in middle school! There were endless facts to be ingrained and all sorts of details to be inculcated in our growing years. Exactly how many of those came in handy during the exams or more importantly in life’s journey ahead is a debatable point. Indians have traditionally been brilliant at mental maths and multiplication as well as all forms of calculation. These skills have diminished in significance, ever since the all conquering technological gadgets have intruded into our existence. Basic knowledge and factual information are also available at the click of a button these days, with not much need for us to memorise dates et al. Mr Google and his extended family have ganged up to obviate the need for human beings to tax their brains beyond a point. Google maps make it unnecessary for us to ask anyone the route any more. The ubiquitous computer voice keeps us company more often than not. Be that as it may, the left segment of the brain, which is the logical arena, need not be burdened too much any more. It is the right portion of the human brain, which is the creative realm, which needs to be put to use in order to enhance our lives on the whole. “Creativity is intelligence having fun,” Albert Einstein had said. Anyone who has had brain waves, or inspirational ideas, while showering or while swaying to some music, would agree entirely with the great scientist. What is life, after all, without zing, oomph and pizzazz?The newness of an unchartered course, the thrill of a hitherto unexperienced situation, the sheer fun that comes from heading into the unknown, is what enthrals those with a bit of heart.Which is why we need to fine tune our educational paradigms in order to make our children really think in schools. Problem solving and project building are activities which can propel youngsters to potential greatness if they are a part and parcel of their school years.Creative writing, art, music and even sports also require thinking patterns that are distinct from the norm. What is the point of scoring 99% marks in the board exams if the student knows nothing else?Edward de Bono was on target when he said, “There is no doubt that creativity is the most important human resource of all. Without creativity there would be no progress and we would forever be repeating the same patterns.”Our educators need to be injected with some enthusiasm and fervour in order for them to alter their mores to impart creative learning to their wards. No amount of policy making will do the trick unless teachers are well looked after and motivated to bring some more imagination and verve to their roles in the classroom.Some pockets of excellence, have already been enabling students to delve into the world of creativity, across the land, but far more needs to be done. There is no incentive, no push, no reason, for a majority of educational institutions to deviate from the tried and tested dusty pathways.The future of the world will depend on how well the youth will be able to combat crises of varied kinds which will doubtlessly spring up again and again. It will depend on their ability to stay innovative and ahead of the game. The success of individuals will also depend on their ability to break away from the hordes and blaze a trail of excellence in unheard of or rare fields of endeavour.The world of tomorrow will belong to men and women with initiative and enterprise. It is time to start preparing our boys and girls for that tomorrow by tweaking our pedagogical norms and breaking the mould, if we can. Let us also have some fun in the process. vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-creative-thinking-a-must-for-students-101633816958614.html

In a statement issued here, the chairman of the organisation, Satish Mahaldar, said, “On October 5, Makhan Lal Bindroo was shot dead by terrorists as he sat in his shop in Srinagar’s Iqbal Park, an area dotted with the police and paramilitary installations, He was in love with Kashmir.” He also referred to the latest killings of a principal and teacher in a Srinagar school and that of a migrant street vendor, Virendra Paswan, besides a local. “These attacks have proved that counter-insurgency strategies have failed and the intelligence is an utter failure in the valley. The premature claims about normalcy in Kashmir got exposed two months ago when it was informed to the LG office in writing by Kashmiri Pandits that there are rumours that the minorities in Kashmir will be targeted. Unfortunately, the LG office and security agencies ignored our inputs,” said Mahaldar. Despite the inputs to security agencies, the state government and the Centre failed to protect the minorities in Kashmir, he said. He asked the LG administration to bring its act together before it was too little, too late.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-failed-to-protect-minorities-in-kashmir-kp-body-101633815459473.html

In a statement issued here, Chugh said the UP government had registered criminal cases and the investigation was on in addition to the judicial inquiry that had been instituted under a retired high court judge. “So, in this situation, it was only but cheap politics that the political parties were making a beeline to Lakhimpur Kheri to pay lip service to farmers and try to win their sympathy in view of the forthcoming assembly elections,” he added. He said it was a law-and-order problem in Lakhimpur Kheri and the UP government had been dealing with it firmly. Chugh said while the UP government had stood firmly by the affected families and assured them all help following which they withdrew their agitation, political parties like the Congress and the Akalis, after having failed to do anything for the welfare of farmers all these years when they have been in power, were now “faking sympathy” with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-akalis-trying-to-hijack-farmers-stir-chugh-101633815457704.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||BJP steps up efforts to placate rebel Chetan Bragta||With just a day left for withdrawal of nominations, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday stepped up its efforts to persuade its information and technology chief Chetan Bragta, who had revolted against the party and filed his nomination as an independent candidate from Jubbal Kotkhai after the party chose Neelam Saraik over him.“I will not budge. The party has meted out injustice on me and other BJP workers. I was asked by the party to start campaigning soon after my father’s demise. Why did it do so when it had no plan to field me as a candidate,” said Chetan when contacted. State party chief Suresh Kashyap also spoke to Chetan and urged him to withdraw his nomination in favour of party candidate Saraik. A large number of office-bearers of the block unit are currently siding with Chetan and also gave a miss to chief minister (CM) Jai Ram Thakur’s public meeting on Friday. The CM had also reached out to Chetan and his supporters earlier.Union minister for information and broadcasting, Anurag Thakur also spoke to Chetan over the phone, asking him to reconsider his decision of contesting elections. Former horticulture minister Narendra Bragta was an ardent supporter of Anurag’s father and former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal. Bragta’s death necessitated elections in Jubbal and Kotkhai. Bragta is largely credited with strengthening the horticulture economy. Besides, he was known for his political acumen. Bragta’s supporters had staged a show of strength in Kaharapathar in Jubbal on Friday and raised slogans against urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj. Chetan’s supporters are out rightly blaming the urban development minister for the change of choice for ticket at the last moment. Neelam Saraik is considered to be close to Bhardwaj. Saraik is yet to start campaigning and is expected to do so after Chetan withdraws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-steps-up-efforts-to-placate-rebel-chetan-bragta-101633815278213.html

10-10-2021||Chandigarh||UT cricket association’s operations manager resigns||Under fire for not registering three mainstay cricketers of the boys’ U-19 team for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy well in time and costing Chandigarh a loss against Madhya Pradesh in the opening tie, Union Territory Cricket Association’s (UTCA’s) cricket operations manager Manjit Singh has resigned from his position. The Chandigarh U-19 team led by Raj Angad Bawa did win three matches in the tournament, but that loss against Madhya Pradesh cost them a place in the upcoming quarter-finals. Singh, a former NIS-qualified cricket coach, had been working as the operations manager since the 2019 season. In his resignation letter to the UTCA president and secretary, Singh, 68, writes that for the past one month, he had not been keeping well and unable to concentrate on the work. Cites ‘increasing workload’, ‘inability to take stress’ as reasonHe further said that due to the “increasing workload, he is not able to take stress at his age”. He stated that he needs to have a peaceful and relaxed life. Singh, who has vast coaching experience, had never worked in cricket operations before and UTCA hired him for the post in their opening domestic season in 2019. All-rounders Arbab Iqbal, Pratham Sodhi and Paras Amarjit Kumar were the players who had to miss out the opening game against Madhya Pradesh in the Elite Group B. The trio was registered ahead of the second game against Himachal Pradesh that Chandigarh won.Speaking on Singh’s ouster, Rakesh Jolly, who is a former first-class cricketer and also chairperson of the three-member UTCA Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), said, “It is such a pity that a strong team like U-19 Chandigarh had to bow out due to his glitch. That loss against Madhya Pradesh hurt Chandigarh’s chances of qualifying in the quarterfinals. UTCA needs to be very careful and professional in future.” The players should have been registered by September 10, the deadline set by the BCCI. And, the first match of the Vinoo Mankad Trophy was slated to take place on September 28 in New Delhi.When UTCA joint secretary was asked the reason for Singh’s resignation, Yuvraj Mahajan said, “He has very clearly written in his resignation that due to his ill health he is giving up the post. He has not been keeping well since last two months.” Chandigarh beat Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra in the league stage. Teams like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Kerala, Vidarbha, Karnataka and Nagaland are in the quarterfinals.“If UTCA is short of staff, why do they not hire more staffers and that too qualified ones. They might be an associate state and BCCI not giving them annual funds. But the BCCI can always pay for the hired staff. Chandigarh U-19 cricketers could have made an impact in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. Players were eyeing the U-19 World Cup scheduled for next year. CAC is supposed to look after cricket and the hired coaches and selectors, but UTCA has not given any powers to the panel. It is very disappointing and accountability should be held,” added Jolly, 63, who has played 40 first-class matches for Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ut-cricket-association-s-operations-manager-resigns-101633814078503.html

Besides, the hospital is providing tele-consultation to over 1,500 people daily.“PGIMER is scaling up its elective surgery and OPD services to help non-Covid patients, who have been struggling to get treatment due to the pandemic. Keeping in view the decreasing Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh and neighbouring states, and the increasing number of patients at the OPDs, we have decided to increase the timings for physical consultation registrations and limit the duration for tele-consultation registrations,” said Dr Ram.No change in online registrationsThe online registrations for physical as well as tele-consultation will continue as before.For physical consultation through the institute’s official website, PGIMER has allowed 50 patients per department and 100 for three major departments — opthalmology (eye), hepatology (liver) and internal medicine. Before the contagion started, over 10,000 patients visited PGIMER’s OPDs daily. But now, apart from the 5,500 walk-in patients, only 2,000 to 2,500 are being called in per day through tele-consultation and online appointments. Since the suspension of walk-in consultation and online appointments in March last year, the institute had been providing OPD services only through tele-consultation. The physical consultations had resumed on June 21 this year, but only after prior appointment through tele-consultation, until walk-in OPDs started on September 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/registration-timings-at-pgimer-opds-to-change-from-oct-11-101633811921828.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||WhatsApp chat proves deficiency in services, Chandigarh make-up studio penalised||Taking a WhatsApp chat, wherein a Chandigarh-based make-up studio denied a refund to a bride-to-be, into consideration, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Panchkula, has held the former guilty of deficiency in services.Parul Duggal Make-up Studio, Sector 10, Chandigarh, has been directed to refund the ₹25,000 payment with 9% interest, and also pay the complainant ₹5,000 as compensation for mental agony and harassment. Romil Gupta of Sector 12, Panchkula, had submitted before the commission that she had hired the studio’s make-up services for her wedding on April 16, 2020, against an advance payment of ₹25,000. But due to the lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic, all salons and beauty parlours were shut down in line with a Union ministry of home affairs order. Therefore, she decided to hold a simple wedding ceremony and sought a refund from the make-up studio via a WhatsApp message. In response, the studio asked her to utilise the payment for future services, while declining to refund the amount.Seeking directions for a refund, Gupta approached the consumer court that sent notices to the studio in September 2020. As the notices were not accepted, it was proceeded against ex parte. While disposing of the complaint, the commission said, “Pertinently, a complete lockdown was imposed at the national level on March 25, 2020, due to the Covid-19 situation and thus, neither the complainant was in a position to avail of the said services from the make-up studio nor they were in a position to provide these to the complainant. Therefore, no lapse can be attributed to that extent.” “However, the make-up studio denied a refund of the booking amount, claiming it to be non-refundable as per its policy. It is pertinent to mention here that no such policy entitling them to forfeit the booking amount is available on record,” the commission held. It further said as per the WhatsApp chat, the make-up studio asked the complainant to avail of the services within 2020, only to the extent of 50% of the amount deposited, which was totally unfair, unjust and unreasonable. Therefore, the commission ordered the studio to refund the full amount, along with compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/whatsapp-chat-proves-deficiency-in-services-chandigarh-make-up-studio-penalised-101633811920747.html

10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Speaking for farmers does not mean I am against BJP, says former Union minister Birender Singh||Former Union minister and BJP leader Birender Singh was recently dropped from the party’s central decision-making body --- the national executive. This came in the backdrop of his consistent support to the farmers’ agitation over three contentious farm laws, a move that ran contrary to the BJP’s stand. Speaking to Hindustan Times, the veteran leader, who had quit the Congress in 2014 to join the saffron fold, on Saturday said his support to the farmers’ cause and voicing their concerns should not be construed as an act against his own party. He also said the BJP-JJP government in Haryana needs to accelerate the pace of implementation of its programs and policies to the satisfaction of the common man. Excerpts: How do you view the ongoing farmers’ agitation? From the very beginning, I am of the view that there is a scope to sort out this issue through dialogue. So, let’s sit down and talk with the farmers. Otherwise, the deadlock will prove harmful and damaging for the agriculture sector, the country and even the government. What’s your stance on the three Central agri-marketing laws? I am very vocal about the farmers’ concerns. But supporting the cause of farmers should not be construed as speaking against the party (the BJP). But there has been a hardening of stance on both the sides? So how does one reinitiate negotiations? I think both the farmers and the government are now willing to let go their hard stance. Both the sides, I think, now realise they need to break this deadlock. The government should reinitiate discussions. I’m sure once the talks start again, the issue will get resolved. You didn’t find a place in the BJP national executive. How do you react to this? I do not attach much political significance to this development. There is nothing to be read between the lines here. The BJP, before 2014, did not have a pan- India presence which it has now. It has spread its footprint across the country after successively forming the central government twice. The latest national executive list has a good representation. Even states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala have been well represented. So, it is natural that representation from the Hindi-speaking states will come down. You surprised everyone by attending the INLD function at Jind. What prompted you to take such a step?See, INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala accepted my invitation for attending the release of writings and speeches of Sir Chhotu Ram by the Vice-President,M Venkaiah Naidu. In fact, I had invited a lot of leaders cutting across party lines for that event. These included Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, leaders from Akali Dal, CPI, CPM and Socialist Party. Chautala then extended me an invitation to come for the birth anniversary celebrations of Chaudhary Devi Lal. So that’s why I went for that function. It was a reciprocal gesture. Do you think BJP has not given leaders like you and Rao Inderjit their due since you are not originally from the BJP? Well, the BJP has given me a lot. I had left Congress to join the BJP and was given a berth in the Union cabinet. But there is a hell of a difference between the functioning of the Congress and the BJP. The latter is a cadre-based party. They have their own way of selecting representatives from different fields, walks of life, communities. If you see the fresh BJP national executive list, the party has not picked prominent leaders such as Capt Abhimanyu, Rao Inderjit Singh, Ratan Lal Kataria and me. It does not mean anything but it can also mean something. Someone can question why these prominent people have not been picked. Frankly, for me it does not carry any importance. The BJP’s national executive is a huge body having about 350 members. How do you evaluate the performance of the BJP-JJP government in Haryana? The coalition governments have their own compulsions. There is an inherent stress in a coalition set-up. Often the interests of the allies’ also clash. This government will surely survive. But I find things moving at a slow pace in Haryana. The state government needs to pick up pace. Can you be a little more specific? The government’s performance should be to the satisfaction of the people at large. If the level of people’s satisfaction is poor, then it will cause more damage to the BJP than the JJP. The JJP, someday, may decide to even walk out of the alliance to become heroes on some issue. But the BJP should be on its toes. We should ensure that whatever is being implemented at least evokes positive response from the common man. Where do you see yourself one year from now? I’m quite contented. I have survived 50 years in electoral politics. Irrespective of whether or not I remain in politics, I will continue to speak on farmers’ issues. My stand is very clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/speaking-for-farmers-does-not-mean-i-am-against-bharatiya-janata-party-birender-101633811737675.html

10-10-2021||Patna||Bihar crosses 6 crore vaccine doses, 9 states adopt Patna’s successful vaccination model||Nine Indian states have replicated Patna’s successful Covid-19 vaccination model of administering jabs to people at their convenience through 24x7 or 12 hours-a-day vaccination camps, as Bihar crossed the 6-crore dose vaccination mark out of its target population of 7.22 crore on Saturday. “We achieved administering 6-crore Covid-19 vaccination doses to beneficiaries in the state today with people’s cooperation, support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and guidance of chief minister Nitish Kumar. We had set up 15,000 vaccination sites and pressed into service over 50,000 personnel on the job,” said Bihar’s health minister Mangal Pandey. “If we continue to get the same cooperation of our people, we will achieve administering 8 crore doses in the state by December,” added Pandey. The Bihar chief minister had on June 11 set a target to administer 6 crore jabs to 6 crore people by December. The state had then achieved around 1.16 crore jabs. Three other states, meanwhile, are lined up to roll out 24x7 or 12-hour mega camps on the pattern of Patna soon, said a resource person of Care India, which provides technical support to Bihar government’s health, nutrition, education and livelihoods programme. Jharkhand, Assam, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi (NCR) have commenced Covid-19 vaccination mega camps in collaboration with the Care India, after its successful implementation in Patna, said Mansoon Mohanty, team lead for Patna district resource unit of Care India. The initiative will be rolled out soon in Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Himachal Pradesh, he added. “The Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT) and the airport at Guwahati (Assam’s capital) operate 24x7 mega camps in our collaboration. Likewise, Malleshwaram, in Bengaluru, has also initiated a 24x7 vaccination mega camp, after its success in Patna,” said Mohanty. “Other places like Jharkhand’s Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Jamshedpur; Udaipur in Rajasthan; Bhopal, Panna, Balaghat and Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Lucknow and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi (NCR) have mega camps, which operate 12 to 15 hours a day,” he added. All mega camps, hosted in our collaboration in other states, have been initiated in August and September, after their success in Patna, where we launched them in June,” said Mohanty. The 24x7 vaccination mega camps at the government polytechnic in Patliputra Colony, Hotel Patliputra Ashok on Beer Chand Patel Path and the Patliputra stadium at Kankerbagh, managed by the Care India in Patna, have catered to the administration of over 50% doses to the nearly 12 lakh urban population of Patna, said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate (DM). Patna, which has an estimated target population of 44,24,678 to vaccinate, is a success story as far as Covid-19 vaccination in Bihar is concerned. It has done better than the state and national average and tops among 38 districts in the state in terms of administering Covid-19 doses to beneficiaries. With a total of 51,93,789 doses administered till 6.30pm on Thursday, Patna has a first dose coverage of around 76% and 58% second dose achievement against the first shot. The state’s vaccination coverage is 64% and 28%, respectively, as on Thursday (6.40pm). Around 26.3% had been fully vaccinated with both doses in India, while the country’s first dose coverage was 70.1%, as of 7am on October 3. Having inoculated 1,36,560 doses on August 7, Patna became the fifth district in India to cross the 1 lakh vaccination mark in a single day. It achieved another milestone by becoming the second district in the state after East Champaran to vaccinate over 2 lakh people in a day, having administered 2,01,142 doses during a mega camp on October 2. East Champaran administered 2,40,054 doses on September 17, during a special vaccination drive on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, when Bihar logged 33,39,879 Covid jabs, the day’s highest in India when it administered 2.5 crore doses. “Patna ranks ninth among Indian districts in terms of administering Covid vaccine doses. We have vaccinated over 114% of our urban population and 57% of district’s rural population. Many people from rural areas and adjoining districts have come to take shots at our 24x7 vaccination centres,” said Singh. “We understood the people’s need and convenience and launched the special vaccination centres in June so that we can tap the people interested in taking jabs early in the morning, before going to office or on their return from work in the evening. We opened three 24x7 centres and a couple for 12 hours-a-day. Their response was very encouraging, prompting other districts to adopt it,” the DM said. Danapur, Sheikhpura and Kankerbagh branches of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sri Krishna Memorial Hall, ITI-Digha, Anugrah Narayan College, the Ram Dev Mahto Samudayik Bhawan (community hall) and the Patna Women’s College were venues of special centres in Patna, most of which were operational from 9am to 5pm, while a couple functioned for 12 hours a day. “We reduced the waiting time at the special camps by deploying our best workforce, increasing the number of vaccinating teams, segregating people based on their choice of vaccine, age and gender, having separate queues for them. We also ensured cleanliness and hygiene, providing basic facilities like drinking water and washroom, having proper waiting areas with arrangement for sitting and opened up to 1,000 slots a day at each such camp, before introducing on-spot registrations,” said Singh. “Many other districts (Katihar, Darbhanga, Rohtas, Gaya and Bhagalpur) in Bihar, and some other Indian states are also learnt to have recently adopted our model,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-crosses-6-crore-vaccine-doses-9-states-adopt-patna-s-successful-vaccination-model-101633810057772.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmer who claimed to have been hit by BJP MP Saini’s convoy booked in three cases||Two days after a farmer from Yamunanagar, Bhawan Preet claimed of getting hit by the Innova of BJP MP Nayab Saini’s convoy, he has been booked in three separate FIRs along with district BKU (Charuni) chief Malkit Singh and others at Naraingarh police station, while there has been no action on his complaint yet. As per the first case lodged on complaint of the station in-charge of Naraingarh police station, SI Dhoom Singh, it was alleged that the farm unions had protested outside the Saini Samaj Dharamshala at a social event attended by MP Saini and state transport minister Moolchand Sharma.Singh said, “Despite our efforts of asking them to remain calm, the union members broke barricades twice and gathered outside the venue. The farmers continued to create a ruckus when the dignitaries were leaving the event.”Farm leaders Malkit Singh and Jaswinder along with Bhawan Preet have been named in the FIR on charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and others.In the second case, Malkit, Bhawan and Parmeshwar alias Pappi have been booked on complaint of a local Rajiv Saini for rioting, wrongful confinement and others.Saini said the suspects had levelled false allegations against him that he was driving the MP’s car and had hit Bhawan Preet.“I was inside the venue from 9am. Many of us were captivated for at least four hours inside the venue as the protestors had surrounded us. They’ve said that I was driving the car and tried to crush Bhawan but I’ve never been the MP. I’m an industrialist,” he told the police.The third case has been registered by Saini’s driver Anil Kumar, of Babain, against Malkit, Bhawan and Jaswinder Bhookhri on charges of wrongful restraint, attempting to commit offences and others.The driver said he was driving the Innova with PRO Joginder Singh, behind the vehicles of Saini in the convoy, when the farmers followed him, attacked his car with weapons and tried to drag him out of the vehicle.Sub-inspector Dhoom Singh said, “Three cases were lodged against the farmers on Friday. No arrest has been made and investigations are underway. We’ve already registered a DDR on complaint of Bhawan Preet but no FIR has been lodged.”Meanwhile, protesting against the fresh cases and no FIR on their complaint, farmers have decided to gather at the Naraingarh grain market at 11am on Sunday.At 9am, Bhog ceremony will be held in memory of the slain farmers of Lakhimpur Kheri at the Panjokhara Sahib Gurdwara.Malkit Singh said, “Police have made a record by lodging three cases in a single day against us, in favour of Saini. We’ll gather at the grain mandi and decide on further course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmer-who-claimed-to-have-been-hit-by-bjp-mp-saini-s-convoy-booked-in-three-cases-101633809997703.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Successive govts failed to formulate policy to secure jobs for Punjab youth: Bhagwant Mann||Punjab Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) president Bhagwant Mann on Saturday alleged that the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) governments failed to come up with a policy to secure jobs in public and private sectors for the youth of the state.In a press statement, the Sangrur MP claimed that this often leads to candidates from other states occupying public and private sector jobs in Punjab. Mann said the latest example of this is the inclusion of 51-71 percent candidates from other states in the merit list of various posts in the Punjab State Transmission Corporation Limited (PSTCL). “According to the list released by PSTCL, 64 of a total of 95 posts of assistant linemen (general category) have been filled by candidates from other states. Similarly, 28 of the 39 posts of assistant sub-station attendants have been taken by candidates from other states. Besides, 28 of the 54 posts of junior engineer (sub-station), four of the 11 posts of assistant engineer were given to candidates from other states,” he said. The Congress in the run-up to the assembly polls had promised ‘ghar-ghar rozgar (jobs in every household) to the people of Punjab but failed miserably, the AAP leader said. “While the people of Punjab cannot even buy land in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan, but residents of other states can buy agricultural land here and get jobs. This clearly means that the Congress and the Badals-led governments have been asleep,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/successive-govts-failed-to-formulate-policy-to-secure-jobs-for-punjab-youth-bhagwant-mann-101633809877529.html

During a rally near DAV University in Jalandhar to mark the 15th death anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram, party’s state president Jasvir Singh Garhi made the announcement in the presence of SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal. “Nearly 35% population of Punjab belongs to OBC category but they get only 10% reservation in government sector. Dr BR Ambedkar struggled for the reservation of OBCs who were economically and educationally backward. Babu Kanshi Ram carried forward the fight for their rights and got the Mandal Commission,” Garhi added. Sukhbir said the coalition would implement the Kanshi Ram Pendu Vikas Scheme once voted to power in 2022 under which all villages with 50 per cent scheduled caste population would be given a special grant of ₹50 lakh for development works. He also announced that the alliance was committed to setting up of district-level medical colleges and multi-specialty hospitals in the memory of Kanshi Ram besides a university in the Doaba region after Dr Ambedkar. BSP state affairs in-charge Randhir Singh too endorsed the demand for implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations for OBCs. “We will give 25% government contracts each to SC and BC contractors and 50% government contracts to contractors from general category, as was done in UP,” added Beniwal. Sukhbir termed Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s hunger strike a “sham”, saying he also insulted slain journalist Raman Kashyap by indulging in the drama at the latter’s residence. He also condemned delay in arresting Union minister’s son Ashish Mishra over the Lakhimpura Kheri incident.Shoe hurled at Sukhbir Badal’s car Sukhbir faced farmers’ protest on the Jalandhar-Pathankot road during his visit to address the SAD-BSP rally. When Sukhbir’s convoy was on the way to the rally, a shoe was thrown at his car even as there were tight security arrangements. Earlier, the SAD president paid obeisance at Devi Talab Mandir on occasion of Navratris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-bsp-alliance-reaches-out-to-obcs-promises-27-reservation-in-government-sector-101633809637839.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||It’s fishy business at Ludhiana meat shops||Raw chicken and meat businesses have come under the health department’s scanner after veterinary teams on Saturday found that rotten broilers and meats of ailing animals were being stored in unhygienic conditions and being supplied to wedding feasts. A total 296kg of rotten meat was destroyed in the city during the raids and 19 challans were issued. Municipal corporation senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Singh Dhalla said in several cases the meat had turned black and the same was to be served at weddings. “At colonies near the Jalandhar Bypass, the veterinary team found that meat shop owners had created illegal slaughter houses in their shops. The animals were kept in unhygienic condition and their waste, including their coat and intestines, were being flushed directly into the discharge, which was contributing to frequent choking of sewerage in the area,” said Dhalla.While Dhalla’s team raided shops in Zone C and Dr SM Yaseen’s team combed through Zones A and B . Yaseen’s team issued four challans and seized 116-kg chicken and mutton, while Dhalla’s team issued 15 challan in both zones and seized 180-kg raw meat, including chicken.Raw chicken can be stored for 24 to 32 hours, and 48 hours in a refrigerator. Meanwhile, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu asked meat shop owners to avail meat from the Modern Slaughter House, which is equipped with modern facilities. “Meat shop owners were not procuring meat in a legal manner, due to which a drive has been initiated. Strict action will be taken against those found selling illegal, unhygienic and diseased meat,” Sandhu said.Preparing frozen meat a skilled job “The process of preparing frozen meat is a skilled job as moisture has to be removed, permitted preservatives added and the product maintained in a cold chain. However, it was seen that migrant workers with no expertise are slaughtering animals and packaging them in polythene bags without a care for technique or hygiene,” Dhalla said, adding that at one shop a pig that had died due to a disease was about to be cut, which was alarming.  Meanwhile, Non-vegetarian Shopkeepers’ Association president Sanjeev Kumar said, “I have no knowledge of the raids as I was out of town. However, we are following all guidelines laid down by the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/its-fishy-business-at-ludhiana-meat-shops-101633809517613.html

Navjit will tie the knot with Simrandheer Kaur, an engineering graduate from Amlala village near Dera Bassi in Mohali district. The marriage will take place as per Sikh rituals at Gurdwara Sacha Dhan at Phase 3, Mohali. “Only Close relatives have been invited for the marriage which was fixed much before he (Channi) was elevated as chief minister. After taking charge as CM, he didn’t change anything regarding his son’s marriage,” said a family member.Earlier, the marriage rituals were to be performed at a gurdwara in Phase 8, Mohali, but it was changed to the Phase 3 gurdwara, which has space to accommodate a larger gathering. There will be no special decoration in the shrine. He personally visited the gurdwara on Tuesday to request the management for permission for the ceremony.Since Channi had printed wedding invitation cards before his elevation, his designation is mentioned as that of a Punjab cabinet minister. But with the change of venue, another leaf was added to the card, highlighting the new venue and describing Channi as CM.Though Channi has invited some central leaders and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar, Punjab Police officials said there was no confirmation of anyone visiting the marriage venue. Punjab cabinet ministers and other politicians are invited for post-marriage lunch and reception on Monday at a marriage palace in Sunny Enclave, Kharar.A sangeet party was held on Saturday evening for which some cabinet ministers and family members were invited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-big-fat-wedding-punjab-cm-channi-s-son-to-tie-the-knot-in-a-low-key-ceremony-today-101633809339398.html

Will talk to everyone and in a way that there are no problems,” Bommai said on Saturday, soon after returning from Delhi where he met several cabinet ministers.The rumblings in the Karnataka government continue as the new chief minister has not yet named district in-charge ministers. The biggest bone of contention is Bengaluru for which there are several contenders.Some of the leading contenders for the post include revenue minister R Ashok, higher education minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan and housing minister V Somanna. There are several others who aspire to get the responsibility of Bengaluru.But Bommai, like his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, has retained this portfolio with him to avoid a full-blown crisis within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state that is already facing several challenges.“I have the confidence that we will come to a decision after discussing it with everyone, Bengaluru is very important,” Bommai said, refusing to divulge further details.People aware of the developments said that there were several bouts between leading contenders to be named as in-charge of Bengaluru. Bommai had made an interim list of district in-charge ministers only for Covid-19 and the recent floods. Ashok was named for Bengaluru and Narayan was named district in-charge of neighbouring Ramanagara.As one of India’s biggest cities, Bengaluru is a cash-cow that has been one of the main reasons for it being so lucrative for legislators to take charge.There has been no elected body in the corporation for over one year now that gives more power to the district in-charge minister to take decisions over some of the state’s biggest infrastructure and other projects.“We have asked that he (CM) keep it. If you are giving it, then I have no problem. But when giving it, I am the senior most in Bengaluru,” Somanna said on Saturday.He added that so far there has been no district in-charge minister named and that the issue will be resolved in the next 3-4 days.He indirectly targeted Ashok who has become the de facto in charge of the city, conducting meetings of the corporation and other affairs.Ashok had also held a few meetings with the BBMP, which other ministers had objected to, as the former had no powers to do so.“I have never said anywhere that I want it (Bengaluru district in-charge). It is the chief minister’s prerogative and whatever he decides, I have no problem,” Ashok said on Saturday.The BJP has been in control of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) for over a decade. But in both BJP governments (under Yediyurappa and Bommai) since 2018, the chief minister has retained Bengaluru under them to avoid the boiling over of simmering dissent.Control over the BBMP would also help the BJP in its perception battle of who controls the administration in Bengaluru, a globally renowned city for being one of the biggest software exporters in the country and houses one of the biggest start-up and e-commerce ecosystems globally.The living quality in Bengaluru has denigrated over the years due to unplanned growth, mass migration, crumbling infrastructure and inability by civic authorities to provide basic amenities to its residents.The apathy by civic agencies has been forcing citizens to mobilise resources and help themselves and not wait for any help from the authorities.Though the government has said that it will hold the BBMP elections early next year, former corporators have expressed their apprehensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rumblings-continue-in-karnataka-govt-over-district-in-charge-ministers-appointment-101633809224647.html

Harsimrat was interacting with the media following the visit of a high-level delegation of party leaders to Lakhimpur Kheri on Friday. She was accompanied by the committee members, including Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Bikram Singh Majithia. The former Union minister said the victim families of farmers, who had been crushed to death by the union minister’s son Ashish Mishra, did not have any hope for justice from the Uttar Pradesh government. “It is clear that justice cannot be done in the case till the Union minister of state is not dismissed. I fail to understand why he has not been dismissed till now. In fact, a case should have been registered against Ajay Mishra on September 25 when he incited people to commit violence against peacefully protesting farmers” she said. She said Ajay Mishra had compounded his crime after his son crushed four farmers and a journalist under his vehicle by stating that the vehicle was being stone pelted and that the driver lost control. “This version has also been discredited now following live videos of the entire incident. Ajay Mishra should be booked under Section 120 (b) for inciting the violence and trying to divert the investigation. The central government must follow the edict of winning the ‘vishwas’ of everyone, particularly the victim families,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harsimrat-for-sc-monitored-probe-into-lakhimpuri-deaths-101633809157618.html

The state government has been taking steps to prevent the pollution of rivers, including Cauvery, in Tamil Nadu under the guidance of chief minister M K Stalin. “The latest initiative is to constitute five panels comprising the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on October 6 to monitor if untreated effluents from the dyeing units in Erode, Kumarapalayam, Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur were discharged into the Cauvery and its tributaries,” the minister said.The committees are inspecting the units in the areas, he said in a statement here. In addition, engineers from the TNPCB and IIT (M) team have collected samples at various places from Mettur to Mayiladuthurai on October 9 and sent them for analysis in the wake of the IIT Madras findings that the Cauvery river is polluted by pharmaceutically active compounds, plastics, heavy metals and pesticides, among others.This study, carried out with joint funding from Water Technology Initiatives of the Union department of science and technology and the UK Natural Environment Research Council, found a range of emerging contaminants, including personal care products, flame retardants, among others.“Efforts are on to obtain the advice of experts including those from IIT (M) to prevent the pollution of Cauvery river,” Meyyanathan said, adding that based on their reports and guidance of the chief minister, steps will be taken to protect the water sources in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-govt-forms-panels-to-prevent-pollution-of-cauvery-tributaries-101633809099330.html

The letter reads: “The October 3 incident, which took place in Lakhimpur Kheri, has been condemned by all--the government and the citizens. The government, police and administration are making efforts to give justice.” “Public representatives and common people of the district and those coming from outside, should exercise restraint while offering condolences,” it read. “Thanks to all Sikh brothers and sisters for maintaining restraint and co-operating with the government and administration due to which an atmosphere of peace and amity prevailed,” the administration said in the letter.

The event was organised by Saurabh, alias Mithu Madan, a close aide of the then local bodies minister Sidhu whose wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu was chief guest on the occasion. Judicial magistrate (first class) Vishav Gupta in his September 5 order noted, “From the perusal of the final report and accompanying documents, it prima facie makes a case under sections 304-A (causing death by negligence), 338 (grievous hurt) and 337 (causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. The chargesheet for the offence is served on the accused who pleaded guilty.”The next date of hearing has been fixed on December 2.The government railway police (GRP) had filled a chargesheet against seven organisers of the event in June last year. The accused are Dussehra committee president Mithu Madan whose mother Vijay Madan is a Congress councillor, and other office-bearers Rahul Kalyan, Deepak Kumar, Karan Bhandari, Kabal Singh, Deepak Gupta, and Bhupinder Singh. Soon after the incident, the GRP had registered an FIR under sections 304 (culpable homicide), 304 (A), 337 and 338 of the IPC against unidentified persons. But section 304 (that provides imprisonment of for a term which up to 10 years) of the IPC was removed when the chargesheet was filed in the court. The victims’ families have been alleging that police deliberately removed Section 304 under “political pressure”. Deepak Kumar, whose father died in the tragedy, said, “At last, we got a ray of hope of justice after three years. We have faith in the court. But we will also file an appeal in the court against the removal of section 304 against the accused. A strict punishment should be handed over to them,” said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charges-framed-against-navjot-sidhu-aide-6-others-in-amritsar-dussehra-train-tragedy-case-101633808681374.html
10-10-2021||Other||Karnataka: Cong-JD(S) tussle heats up contest for Sindagi and Hanagal bypolls||Bengaluru: With Sindagi and Hanagal assembly constituencies heading to by-elections on October 30, the three major political parties in Karnataka — BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) — have been making all efforts to win the seats.The parties are bracing up for the contest as the bypolls are being held ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluka panchayat elections as well as the 2023 assembly polls. The bypolls have particularly reignited the bitter rivalry between the Congress and JD(S) as the two parties slug it out away from their strongholds.The by-elections have been necessitated as the seats fell vacant following the death of Sindagi JD(S) legislator M C Managuli and BJP’s C M Udasi from Hangal.While Ramesh Bhusanur, who came second behind Managuli in 2018 polls, is the BJP candidate from Sindagi, Shivaraj Sajjanar is its candidate from Hangal.The Congress has named Managuli’s son Ashok Managuli, who has joined the party, as its candidate from Sindagi, and MLC Srinivas Mane from Hangal. The JD(S) has fielded Naziya Shakeel Ahmed Angadi from Sindagi and Niyaz Shaikh from Hangal.Congress leaders, including Siddaramaiah, have alleged that the JD(S) deliberately fielded minority candidates to help the BJP, resulting in war of words between the parties.The Congress has for long accused the JD(S) of being the “B-team” of the BJP as both believe that the former is the common enemy.“Their (JD(S)’s) intention is not good. Their intent is not to help minority candidates win. If this was the case, why give them (Muslims) tickets in these bypolls and not in Ramanagara, Mandya and Hassan,” Siddaramaiah said on Saturday.JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda on Friday said that the Congress cannot act as if it has taken a “contract” of Muslim population and their votes.The Congress and JD(S) have also traded poaching charges as the former has fielded Ashok Managuli.“The people of Sindagi need not be misled. The leaders of the Congress are now disoriented after they did not even have a candidate. It is not right to smear the name of (MC) Managuli who had great loyalty to our party (JD(S)) and HD Deve Gowda,” HD Kumaraswamy said on Saturday in a post on Twitter.“When did Managuli go to Shivakumar’s house? When did he ask that his son be accommodated? Their lies are disgusting. A person who was supposed to be our candidate was hijacked and now they are trying to con the people under these lies,” he added.His statements come after senior Congress leaders claimed that the late MC Managuli had approached Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar to accommodate his son, Ashok, in the party.The Congress and JD(S) share a tempestuous past but this battle has been mainly fought in the old Mysuru region where the BJP has been scouting to make new ground to help it return to power with a full majority in the 2023 assembly elections.The bypolls are the first electoral challenge for chief minister Basavaraj Bommai after taking charge. Hangal is the neighbouring constituency to his Shiggaon assembly segment.The bypolls have also presented Bommai with an opportunity to prove his mettle and step out of the shadow of his mentor and predecessor, BS Yediyurappa.The recent income tax raids on Yediyurappa’s close associates have raised the question if the BJP is trying to contain the influence of the 78-year-old leader who has been planning a state-wide tour.Though the BJP has been unsuccessful in moving away from dominant-caste politics, the party’s central leadership has tried to project Hindutva as the main platform that goes against Yediyurappa’s style of politics, Hindustan Times reported on September 1.The BJP is leaving nothing to chance to secure victories in both bypoll constituencies.BJP legislator and former minister Laxman Savadi said the party wants to win both constituencies by a big margin.“Around seven teams have been formed for all seven zilla panchayats to help us win with a very big margin,” Savadi said.The BJP has named a 26-member team of ministers, legislators and other leaders to help the party win the bypolls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-cong-jd-s-tussle-heats-up-contest-for-sindagi-and-hanagal-bypolls-101633808677510.html

10-10-2021||Chandigarh||SGPC launches drive to counter Christian missionaries in Punjab||The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has recently launched a special drive to counter alleged mass conversions of Sikhs to Christianity in Punjab. Amid videos showing proselytising activities of Christian missionaries in the state being shared widely on social media, the apex Sikh body has come under criticism from within the community for not doing enough to “protect” the faith. Named “Ghar Ghar Andar Dharamsaal (sacred shrine within every home)”, the SGPC campaign is adopting means used by Christian preachers and other traditional methods to spread Sikh literature and teachings across villages in the state. “The campaign will not only bring firmness among Sikhs toward their faith, but also make the young generation take pride in their history and culture,” said SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur.150 teams of preachers dispatched to villagesUnder the campaign, 150 teams comprising seven preachers each have been dispatched to villages. They stay in the village for a week, and go from door to door to distribute Sikh literature. In the evening, they gather children at the local gurdwara to teach them the correct recitation of gurbani (hymn) and create awareness about the Sikh history, culture and philosophy. Thereafter, diwan (religious congregation) is staged by the preachers, dhadis (ballad singers) and kavishars (folk singers) to sensitise the community members about their faith and values. A grand congregation is organised on the last day and an amrit sanchar (initiation rite) ceremony is held as well. The preachers also have an informal dialogue with villagers at saths (small gatherings at a common place in the village). In the coming days, the SGPC plans to double the number of teams with the help of Sikh missionary colleges.“The drive is aimed at countering the impact of the mission being run by Christian preachers. We also approach families that have converted to have a dialogue with them and make them take pride in Sikh beliefs,” said Sarabjit Singh Dhotian, SGPC’s head preacher.Foreign funds, alleges Akal Takht jathedarNot just Sikh bodies, even Hindu outfits, including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its affiliates, have been raising concern over activities of Christian missionaries among weaker sections, including scheduled castes, in the state. Many videos shared on social media show the preachers using various means to lure people. Hindustan Times has not independently verified the veracity of any of these videos.The issue of alleged mass conversions was the key agenda during the Panthic gathering called by the Akal Takht on July 26.Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh alleged that the religious conversion drive is being run in Punjab with funds from foreign countries. “Converting Sikhs to another religion is worrisome. When we don’t force anyone to join our religion by greed, then no one has the right to ask the followers of our religion to convert by greed or pressure,” he said.Bishop denies mass coversion allegationsHowever, Emmanual Masih, Bishop of Punjab region, outrightly rejected all these allegations. “The Constitution of India gives its citizens right to preach their religion. Second, the allegations that Sikhs are being lured or they are being forced to become Christians are totally baseless,” he said. Masih said Christians are a very small minority in Punjab while Sikhs are a majority. “How can we make any Sikh convert forcibly? Majority of Christians are poor in Punjab. How can we give money to anyone? Actually, some forces want to divide various communities in the state,” he said. According to the 2001 census, Sikhs comprised 59.9% of Punjab’s population while Christians accounted for a mere 1.2%. By 2011, there had been a significant drop in Sikh population to 57.69% while the ratio of those following Christianity saw just a marginal increase to 1.26%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-launches-drive-to-counter-christian-missionaries-in-punjab-101633808437608.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||EOW books directors of 2 Assam firms for duping Mumbai-based NBFC of ₹114 crore||The economic offences wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police have booked five directors of two Assam-based vehicle loan finance firms for allegedly duping a city based non-banking finance company (NBFC) of ₹114 crore. The two accused firms, which are revenue sharing partners (RSPs) of the complainant company, allegedly fraudulently processed loans for commercial vehicles and caused a huge loss to the NBFC. On the complaint of Elphinstone-based company Fortune Integrated Assets Finance Limited’s operation deputy manager Jignesh Patel a few days ago, EOW’s general cheating unit has filed a case under the relevant Indian Penal Code sections. The first information report (FIR), of which HT has a copy, is lodged against Kumar Gaurav and his wife Sharmishta Baruah – the directors of Echo Motors and Automobiles Pvt Ltd and Amarshakti Commerce and Industries, Guwahati, Assam – and three other directors. The complainant NBFC provides loans for purchasing commercial vehicles (goods carriers and passenger vehicles). The loans are sanctioned to the applicant only through RSP. A firm is authorised as RSP by the company only after a thorough procedure of scrutinising agency’s antecedents. The RSPs send applications of people, who are looking for commercial vehicle loans, to the company and the company sanctions loan through RSPs. “The RSP’s role is very important as it is the agency responsibility to check the antecedents of the loan seekers, their KYC (know your customer) details and financial potential for repayment,” said an officer. In 2014, the complainant company signed an RSP agreement with Gaurav and Sharmishta’s Echo Motors and Automobiles Pvt Ltd, Guwahati. In 2017, Gaurav closed this company and started Amarshakti Commerce and Industries. Besides the husband-wife duo, there were three more directors in the company till May 2017. Between November 21, 2014, and August 21, 2019, the complainant company distributed loans for 7,128 vehicles. But in 2018, NBFC allegedly detected discrepancies in the documents submitted by the two accused firms. “Later, an internal scrutiny revealed that there was gross misappropriation and illegalities involved and many rules and laws were violated in the entire procedure of the loan-sanctioning system. Details of same vehicles and persons were misused by accused RSP agencies for multiple loans. The inquiry also revealed that in many cases, physical verification of the vehicle was not done. And most importantly, forged and bogus documents were used to fraudulently procure the loan,” said an EOW source. The two accused firms have allegedly submitted forged and bogus documents in loans matters of 668 vehicles. In this, 361 vehicles existed only on paper. Many loan applicants have also been defaulted in paying for the equated monthly instalment (EMI), despite exhausting time limit. The RSP agencies, which also had responsibility of collecting EMIs from the loan recipients and send it to the finance company, allegedly misused the funds for personal gains, the FIR stated. Thus, the two firms allegedly caused wrongful loss to the complainant NBFC to the tune of ₹114.19 crore in loan matters of 5,241 vehicles, the complaint added. EOW has sought details from the banks and is analysing loan documents and collecting further evidence, an officer said. Gaurav said that the allegations levelled against him and his company are false. “We were summoned by EOW in this matter last year and our representatives had submitted all the required documents and evidence to the officers explaining our side of the entire dispute. EOW was then convinced from our replies. We don’t know how have they registered an FIR now. It’s a civil dispute and we have already filed a case against the complainant company in a court in Assam. There is possibility that EOW officers or the local police were kept in dark about the criminal case registered in Assam. We have not been contacted by EOW in connection with the said FIR. If they do so, we would certainly cooperate with the authority and furnish all the details of the deal and explain that we are not involved in any illegal practice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eow-books-directors-of-2-assam-firms-for-duping-mumbai-based-nbfc-of-114-crore-101633808378710.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Heroin haul: ED seizes ₹79 lakh during searches in Amritsar||The enforcement directorate (ED), Jalandhar, has seized around ₹79 lakh in Indian and foreign currency during searches at nine locations in Amritsar, including properties of former Akali Dal leader Anwar Masih, an accused in the 194-kg heroin haul dating back to January 2020. The financial investigation agency has been probing the money trail in an international drug nexus under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The searches began on Friday and coincided with the National Investigation Agency’s raid at Masih’s house in Amritsar in connection with the seizure of 3,000-kg heroin by the directorate of revenue intelligence at the Mundra port in Gujarat last month. The ED on Friday also raided the office of a money changer in Amritsar, who was suspected of transferring the drug money through Hawala to abroad. ED officials revealed that a few of the accused are in judicial custody. “We have been making efforts to crack down on the drug cartel established in India with its strong roots in Punjab,” said an ED official privy to the development.In January 2020, the special task force (STF), Punjab, had recovered nearly 188-kg heroin from the house of Masih, a former member of the Punjab subordinate service selection board in Amritsar. Around 6-kg heroin had been recovered already in the same case from another man in Mohali.The ED has also raided properties owned by Ankush Kapoor, who has been identified as the kingpin of drug racket along with Tanvir Bedi, who is in Australia, and Simranjit Singh Sandhu, who is in Italy. According to the ED, Kapoor and his aides Sukhwinder Singh, Major Singh, Tamanna Gupta and Afghanistan national Arman Bashar Mall had established their base at a house owned by Masih in Amritsar. A senior intelligence officer of Punjab Police, requesting anonymity, said Tanvir Bedi is running an international drug network with links in Dubai, Pakistan and Afghanistan and they were receiving payments through Hawala or shell companies. Bedi’s name had also surfaced in the multicrore ex-sarpanch Gurdeep Singh Rano drug case busted by the STF in November 2020. The officer said both NIA and ED have been probing Bedi and Sandhu’s role in the Mundra drug haul case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heroin-haul-ed-seizes-79-lakh-in-searches-at-amritsar-101633808257568.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||PAU alumnus Harpeet Kochhar to head Canada’s Public Health Agency||A senior Indo-Canadian scientist has been appointed president of the Public Health Agency of Canada or PHAC, replacing an incumbent who has had a controversial tenure which included being censured by the speaker of the House of Commons.Dr Harpreet S Kochhar, currently a senior bureaucrat with Health Canada, the country’s health ministry, with the designation of associate deputy minister of health, will assume charge later this month, replacing Iain Stewart.Making the announcement on Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Stewart for his service to the PHAC and “recognised his leadership in successfully implementing the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.”Kochhar, who formed part of the senior management of Health Canada, will now take over at a time when Covid-19 cases in the country are declining but the country remains in the midst of a fourth wave.Kochhar received his bachelor’s and master’s degree in veterinary science from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, before moving to Canada and completing his doctorate in animal biotechnology at the University of Guelph in the province of Ontario.Before joining Health Canada in April 2020, just as the Covid-19 pandemic started causing a crisis in the country, Kochhar was with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada since 2017, and prior to that, between 2015 and 2017, he served as the chief veterinary officer for Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Canada’s Delegate to the World Organization for animal health.However, he may have an onerous task before him. Stewart was reprimanded by the speaker of the House of Commons Anthony Rota in June this year for refusing to hand over documents relating to the reasons behind the firing of two Chinese-origin scientists from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg in January last year.Xiangguo Qiu, and her husband, Keding Cheng, were earlier escorted out of the laboratory in the spring of 2019, with reports swirling she supervised shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is now synonymous with the Covid-19 pandemic.As that matter is still being investigated and is even before Canadian courts, it will continue to pose a significant challenge to Kochhar as will the possibility of a winter wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pau-alumnus-harpeet-kochhar-to-head-canada-s-public-health-agency-101633808018591.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra fisherworkers’ group seeks new land revenue category for koliwadas||The Akhil Maharashtra Machhimaar Kruti Samiti (AMMKS), a state-wide fisherworker’s society, has written to the chief minister, revenue minister and urban development minister, seeking creation of a new land revenue category called ‘aadhya gaothan’ for koliwadas in Mumbai. Their demands also include giving fisherfolk freehold property rights over commons and providing home owners with additional floor space index (FSI) rights based on future needs.“Presently, koliwadas are shown in the DP (development plan) 2034, but there are no additional benefits for residents because the final demarcation of koliwadas has not been completed. Common land is owned by the government and there is a constant threat of redevelopment and land grab, which will become worse with the new Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) that was approved by the environment ministry. We want our traditional rights over land to be acknowledged by giving us ‘aadhya gaothan’ status,” said Devendra Tandel, president, AMMKS.While placing koliwadas under ‘gaothan’ status would give fisherfolk ownership and redevelopment rights to their land, ‘aadhya gaothan’ lands have been envisioned by fisherfolk to come with several other safeguards in the interest of the artisanal fishing business. For example, Tandel’s letter to authorities also asks for collective ownership of areas used to dry and mend fish nets, and areas used for drying of fish. AMMKS has also sought collective ownership of boat parking, playgrounds and areas used to receive tourists.“Koliwadas which are registered as per the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code (1966) are given village status, so all laws concerning property, development rights and land ownership which are applicable to the village become applicable to any koliwada within the village boundary. In order to rectify this historic mistake, Section 122 of the Revenue Code should be amended to give the status of “aadhya gaothan” to all koliwadas, kolivastya, kolipade, and other koli villages registered in the state, including Mumbai,” Tandel wrote in his letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.Speaking to HT on Saturday, Tandel explained that the state government is vested with the power to amend ownership rights in gaothan areas, and should do so in the interest of protecting the koliwadas, which have been in existence for years before the Land Revenue Code was formulated in 1966. “There are basically three kinds of ownership. One is ownership by encroachment, ownership of village land, and then ownership of koliwada. Koliwadas are neither encroachments and have been around since before village planning was taken up, so our customary rights should precede those of encroachers and village land owners,” Tandel said.Another notable demand is that home owners in koliwadas be given additional FSI to construct homes based on current and future requirements. AMMKS has proposed an ‘XYZ’ approach for the same. “Let us assume that I am living with my family in an area of 1,000 square feet with a current FSI limit of 2. A survey would be carried out to determine my family’s space requirement over the next 20 years and the FSI needed for the same. That FSI – called Y – would be added to X to arrive at a number, Z, which is the new FSI available for a fisherman to build his home,” Tandel explained.Independent experts, however, viewed these demands with scepticism. “For any indigenous community, it is important to distinguish between environmental rights, land rights, livelihood rights, infrastructure rights and development rights. Each of these rights is governed by a different set of rules. CRZ, for example, governs environmental rights, while the Land Revenue Code deals with land rights, and DP2034 deals with development rights,” said Pankaj Joshi of Urban Design Research Institute.“If the demand here deals with ownership rights, then it’s important to note that the Land Revenue Code is community neutral and does not distinguish between Kolis, Agris or Bhandaris, for example. As for development rights, there is a provision under Section 33.16 of DCPR (Development Control and Promotion Regulations), which states that development plans for koliwadas will be framed as and when the demarcation is finalised. The DP also sets aside land used for fishing-allied activities. There are issues with these rules, of course, but such an overarching demand tends to muddle the situation and comes off more as political posturing,” Joshi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fisherworkers-group-seeks-new-land-revenue-category-for-koliwadas-101633807664612.html
10-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pvt operators in Punjab eating into revenue of state-run buses||With state-run transport undertakings, including the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), Punjab Roadways, are reeling under financial crisis, the Punjab government has failed to take action against erring private operators for running their buses on illegally extended routes and permits.Despite the Supreme Court order in 2016 to cancel 73 permits issued illegally, the transport companies, mainly owned by high-profile politicians, continue to ply buses on key routes.These permits, issued during the previous SAD-BJP tenure, allowed integral coaches and luxury buses to run on highly lucrative routes, primarily to Chandigarh from different parts of the state.In 2012, the Punjab and Haryana high court also directed the government to cancel these permits. The order was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2016. “There is no stay and appeal pending in the court, but no action has been taken in past four-and-a-half years by Congress led government,” said Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener of the PRTC-linked trade unions.He added that the delay in taking action is incurring huge financial losses to the state-run transport undertakings as the key routes for running luxury and other buses are with private playersPunjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said directions have been issued to scrutinise permits and extension of routes given to transporters in the past. “We have already initiated campaign against those running buses without paying road taxes. The whole process of issuing permits and extensions will be streamlined,” he saidState transport commissioner Amarpal Singh said the department has initiated the process to look into illegal permits.Despite multiple notices, private operators continue to run buses on illegal extensions in the original bus route permits.“In 2011, the state government amended the transport policy allowing unlimited extensions in existing permits. The rules have been floated during 2007-2017 as the influential transporters were allowed to have 3-4 extensions in the original bus route permits,” said an official.In its 2018 transport policy, the state government stated to cancel these extensions but nothing has been done to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pvt-operators-in-punjab-eating-into-revenue-of-state-run-buses-101633807597811.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Drugs case: Friend of Sushant Singh Rajput and Mumbai hotelier Kunal Jani gets bail||A Special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Court on Friday granted bail to Bandra-based hotelier Kunal Jani, who was a friend of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had alleged that he had discussed about procuring drugs with actor Rhea Chakraborty on a group chat.Additional sessions judge, VV Patil granted Jani bail on cash bond of ₹15,000.Advocate Swapnil Ambure, who argued for Jani, had told the court that the agency had found chats about him asking for 1-mg cocaine. The chats were old and the cocaine was for personal consumption, argued Ambure.Section 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance) of NDPS Act has a maximum punishment of one year. The Act provides that lenient view be taken when charges are of personal consumption. He was not ordering the drugs for any profits and cannot be compared with peddlers and suppliers, argued Ambure. He also said that no material was found from Jani.Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande, who had appeared for the agency, had told the court that the charges against Jani were serious and drugs have become a menace in the society. Serious sections of the Act have been applied against Jani, as he was in touch with several suspicious people.The agency had alleged that though no drugs were found from Jani’s possession, he acted as a mediator for drug peddlers and clients and his name had cropped during questioning of those arrested following the death of Rajput.Jani was arrested by NCB on October 1 in the same case in which Agisilaos Demetriades, the brother of an actor’s girlfriend, was arrested.Jani, along with Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra, is the director of Bandra’s Bastian Restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drugs-case-friend-of-sushant-singh-rajput-and-mumbai-hotelier-kunal-jani-gets-bail-101633807537464.html

Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said, “The ministry has identified 10 cities and 82 routes to develop helicopter corridors across the country, starting with six between Juhu and Pune; Mahalakshmi Race Course and Pune; Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad.” Scindia was speaking during the Helicopter Summit organised by industry body Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), in association with the Union civil aviation ministry and Pawan Hans Ltd on Friday Sudhir Mehta, president, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture, tweeted, “This is excellent news. Shared shuttle chopper services between Pune and Mumbai will bring great relief. Competition will bring lower costs and better service.” Prashant Girbane, director general (MCCIA) said, “The helicopter service is certainly a positive development as connectivity helps commerce and hence communities. We request progress on cargo and international flights at the existing airport with the same alacrity. Also, there is a long-standing issue of the new airport that is still up in the air. We look forward to working with the Government and authorities to support them towards these goals in every possible way that we can. Aviation analyst Dhairyasheel Vandekar, a former Air India Pune station in-charge said, “It is a global trend currently and India is emerging as one of the top aviation markets in the world and the way trade and commerce industry are expanding. It is an important requirement. With Pune attracting many business sectors, it is important to have such service. It will play an important role in urban mobility and when we are talking about a new airport coming in Purnadar, then it will need to have helicopter hub service in different parts of Pune region. If a new airport comes in five years, then we need to have helicopter service (two or three seater) for easy access before that so it can be useful for going to a new airport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/helicopter-corridor-plan-in-pune-gets-thumbs-up-101633807357456.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray, Narayan Rane share dais, trade barbs in Maharashtra||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union minister Narayan Rane on Saturday shared the dais at the inauguration of an airport at Chipi in the Sindhudurg district, and took swipes at each other.This was first time the two came face to face after Rane threatened to slap Uddhav. He was arrested for his statement and later released on bail.Rane, who hails from Sindhudurg and was earlier a Shiv Sena leader, in his speech listed the work done by him since he was elected as MLA from this picturesque region of coastal Maharashtra for the first time in 1990.He was given the charge of the district on the instructions of Shiv Sena founder (and Uddhav Thackeray’s father) late Bal Thackeray, and there were no proper roads, water or education facilities in the region then, he said. After the Shiv Sena-BJP combine came to power in the state in 1995, he requested then chief minister Manohar Joshi to declare Sindhudurg as a “tourism district”, Rane claimed. “After that the work for basic amenities like roads, power, education, water, and healthcare was carried out. The existing infrastructure is because of Narayan Rane. Nobody can match it,” he said. “People know who works. Uddhav-ji, I learnt everything from Saheb (Bal Thackeray),” Rane added.In a veiled attack on the chief minister, Rane said the late Bal Thackeray disliked lying, and did not care for those who lie.Thackeray hit back, saying, “Balasaheb did not like lying. Hence, many times such people (who lied) were kicked out of the Shiv Sena. (Bal Thackeray would say) Even if the truth is bitter, please speak it.”In another dig at Rane, he said, “As per my knowledge, the Sindhudurg fort was built by (Shivaji) Maharaj...otherwise someone might say ‘I built it’.” He also said it must be pondered why it took so long for this airport to be built. “Some people said Konkan will be transformed into California, but why has it not happened yet,” Thackeray added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-narayan-rane-share-dais-trade-barbs-in-maharashtra-101633806385220.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Additional protection camps, camera traps to be set up to capture leopard in Aarey||The Maharashtra forest department will be setting up four additional protection camps in Aarey Colony, in addition to installing 19 more camera traps in the area, in a bid to capture a two-year old, sub-adult female leopard responsible for attacks on eight people in the past 45 days. The forest department on Friday night also installed a fifth cage trap near dairy unit number 13, where a 14-year-old boy was attacked by the leopard earlier in the day.“We require a total of 30 camera traps, including the 11 we have already installed. And we have one protection camp in the area, but another four are being set up to lessen our response time to any other attack which may happen. We are also making announcements in the evening, warning people to not go into densely-wooded areas, and to travel in groups. We suspect that the leopard is attacking people because she is a sub-adult and is learning to hunt,” said Gajendra Hire, deputy conservator of forests (Thane), who is coordinating the response between experts, the forest department, citizens and volunteer organisations.Since August 31, eight people in Aarey Colony, including a 68-year-old woman and a four-year-old child, have sustained injuries after the leopard charged at them. A sub-adult leopard aged between one-and-a-half to two years was captured in the early hours of October 1, but was later identified to be a different individual than the female behind the recent attacks, in what are the first signs of human-leopard conflict in the region since 2017.“You can’t tranquilise a free-ranging leopard because its instinct will be to run away. In the 15 minutes it takes to become sedated, it could enter a house, for example, and wake up hours later around humans. It’s not feasible. The forest department is doing the right thing by involving citizens and volunteer organisations, and is doing their best to trap the animal in a cage. As compared to similar spates of attacks in say 2010-11 or 2016-17, the current situation does not have any signs of panic or alarmism, and Aarey residents seem to have developed a trust in the administration,” said Vidya Athreya, an ecologist with close to two decades’ experience in studying human-wildlife conflict.Once the leopard is trapped, the forest department, along with experts, will conduct an examination, after which a committee will decide on how and where to release the animal. “Until the creature has been captured, we cannot comment on future steps,” said Hire, adding that their response will be scaled up further if the animal continues to remain elusive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/additional-protection-camps-camera-traps-to-be-set-up-to-capture-leopard-in-aarey-101633806697311.html

10-10-2021||Mumbai||₹125 crore heroin consignment seized at Navi Mumbai port came from Afghanistan: DRI||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), which had recently seized about 25.45 kilograms of heroin worth ₹125 crore at the Nhava Sheva port in Navi Mumbai, on Saturday said that the consignment originated from Kandahar, Afghanistan. The central agency has also arrested two more persons who were involved in financial transactions including hawala for smooth import of the consignment. Earlier the DRI had arrested a businessman in the case.The apex anti-smuggling agency suspects that the consignment was part of a larger international narcotics trafficking.The drug consignment was concealed in the boxes of sesame seed oil and mustard oil and was being smuggled via Iran to India in a container. The drugs were concealed at the bottom of oil cans.This is a new modus operandi. It is for the first time that heroin has been seized by any Indian Agency, which was found to have been concealed in oil cans, in order to make it nearly impossible to detect it during the course of usual examination of import cargo, said DRI.The agency officials found out that the shipment was imported by a small-time businessman named Sandeep Thakkar from Masjid Bunder area. When interrogated, Thakkar told DRI sleuths that he has given his firm’s Import Export Code to another businessman, Jayesh Sanghvi, from Navi Mumbai who offered him a commission on every import order from Iran.Sanghvi has lived in Iran for a long time. The consignment was imported by him from Afghanistan by using his old connections in Iran. In his statement, he accepted that the imported consignment from which the narcotics were recovered, belonged to him, and divulged details about his Afghan connections. He was subsequently arrested under the NDPS Act for smuggling narcotic drugs.Later DRI arrested two more persons from Delhi on Friday and brought them to Mumbai under transit remand. Both of them were involved in financial transactions including hawala for smooth import of this consignment.All three accused have been remanded in DRI custody by courts for further investigation. Earlier in July this year DRI Mumbai had seized 294 Kgs Heroin atNhava Sheva port from a consignment which too had originated from Afghanistan. Before that, in August 2020, DRI Mumbai had seized 191.6 Kgs Heroin at Nhava Sheva port from yet another consignment of Afghanistan origin. All these Drugs consignments originating from Afghanistan are shipped though Iranian ports of Chabahar/Bandar Abbas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/125-crore-heroin-consignment-seized-at-navi-mumbai-port-came-from-afghanistan-dri-101633806517209.html

Union minister for state for finance and banking Bhagwat Karad, who navigated the meeting, asked authorities for satisfactory resolution of the bank. Pandit requested RBI deputy governor Rajeshwar Rao that liquidation of the bank is not the solution. “Instead, we request for merger of the Rupee Bank with other strong bank and protection of depositors who have more than ₹five lakh of deposits,” he said. He brought to the notice of higher authorities of RBI that it is very necessary to protect the interests of high value depositors who are not insured at par with insured depositors. “If the bank goes into liquidation, then holders having more than ₹five lakh deposits and majority of whom are senior citizens may lose almost 65 per cent of their deposits,” he said. Karad also advised the authorities for satisfactory resolution of the bank. Pandit was hopeful about the outcome of the meeting.

10-10-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray, Rane trade barbs at inauguration of Chipi airport||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union minister Narayan Rane traded barbs at the inauguration of the Chipi greenfield airport in Sindhudurg, where the two leaders shared the dais on Saturday. Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia participated in the function through video conferencing. Thackeray and Rane came face to face for the first time since the Union minister was arrested for his remarks that he would have slapped the former for forgetting the years of India’s Independence in August, this year. The two leaders who shared the dais after several years did not greet each other while inaugurating the plaque of the airport and later while being seated next to each other. Without naming any Sena leader, Rane, in his speech, accused party leaders of corruption and stalling work on the airport, road project, and tourism-related projects in Konkan. Thackeray, meanwhile, indirectly took potshots at Rane stating that he was expelled from the party by Sena supremo Bal Thackeray for speaking “lies”. He further said this is not the place or time to criticise each other, adding that he would not let politics come in way of development.Thackeray flagged off the first flight from Chipi airport to Mumbai, while Scindia parallelly flagged off the flight virtually from Delhi. The airport was stuck for over three decades due to various reasons. The Sena and BJP are claiming credit for the project. The project is particularly important for tourism and the overall development of the Konkan region, which is the stronghold of Sena, and where BJP is trying to gain a foothold.Scindia who made it a point to speak in Marathi in his address said that the distance of 530km will be covered in just 50 minutes with the airport getting operational. He added, “We should have 20 to 25 aircraft (direct/connecting) for Sindhudurg, in the next five years.” The Chipi airport is built on 271 hectares of land in Chipi-Parule village in Sindhudurg district with an estimated cost of ₹520 crore. The construction commenced on February 19, 2013, by IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited, under Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation.Apart from Thackeray and Rane, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, Industries Minister Subhash Desai, tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, other ministers and senior officials were present for the event in Sindhudurg.Rane accused the Sena leader of opposing the airport in the past and indulging in corruption by stalling the development projects. “In 2009, while carrying out bhoomi pujan of the airport, there was a protest opposing the airport. Those opposing the project are present on the stage today,” said Rane. He further alleged that the work on Mumbai-Goa national highway was also opposed by Sena leaders at several places in the district and they sought money to allow the work to continue.Rane, in his speech, took credit for the progress on the airport and overall development of the Sindhudurg district. “When Balasaheb asked me to go to Konkan in the late 90s, there was nothing here. When I became the minister [in Congress-NCP government] I gave ₹120 crore for roads, ₹118 crore for water supply. The reason for infrastructure development in Sindhudurg is Narayan Rane. No other name can be there,” he said.Thackeray too sought to take credit for the airport during his speech. “What someone did or should do is his lookout. I can talk a lot on that subject, but today is an important day. Why did it take so many years for the airport? Why did you have to wash the utensils for so many years? The project was sorted out when this government came to power,” said Thackeray, in an apparent response to Rane.Referring to Rane’s statement that the Sena patriarch never liked the people who lie, Thackeray said, “It is true. Therefore, Balasaheb had expelled such people from Shiv Sena at that time. This is also history.” In 2005, Bal Thackeray had expelled Rane from the Sena over anti-party activities.Thackeray, meanwhile, said that leaders from five political parties had come together on the stage for development. He quipped that the airline that started services in Sindhudurg was named Alliance Air for the same reason. He said that he does not create political hurdles for development. Explaining his point, Thackeray said, “You might not remember, but when you called me for [approval for] your college, I signed the file [approving it] immediately. I don’t want to bring politics and narrow mindedness in the development work.”Exchanges between Uddhav Thackeray and Narayan RaneUddhav Thackeray said:“When I was doing aerial photography of the forts in Maharashtra, I saw Sindhudurg fort. As far as I know, the fort was built by Shivaji Maharaj. Otherwise, somebody would say that he built it.” “Only the soil knows the pain because many time there are mango trees as well as are plants that have thorns. When such plants grow, what can the soil do besides cultivating it.”“Balasaheb had expelled such people [who lie] from Shiv Sena at that time. This is also history.”Narayan Rane said:“When Balasaheb asked me to go to Konkan in the late 90s, there was nothing here. I took inspiration from [Bala] Saheb.”“When I became the minister [in Congress-NCP government] I gave ₹120 crore for roads, ₹118 crore for water supply... No development has happened on the dam. What progress are you (Shiv Sena) talking about.” “Narayan Rane is the reason for infrastructure development in Sindhudurg. No other name can be there,” he said.“Merely invoking Shivaji Maharaj is not enough. Develop this district and show the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-rane-trade-barbs-at-inauguration-of-chipi-airport-101633805797307.html
10-10-2021||Mumbai||BJP proud of Hindutva but failed to save Hindus in Kashmir: Sena||After Sikhs and Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by terrorists in Kashmir, the Shiv Sena launched an attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying it speaks of Hindutva but failed to save Hindus in the Union Territory. The Sena, through an editorial in Saamana, said that the demonetisation has not ended the terror network in the valley as promised. It also said that claims made while abrogating Article 370 too have failed.Over the past few days, a militant group has killed civilians including a well-known Kashmiri Pandit ML Bindroo, a schoolteacher and principal of a government school. A group called The Resistance Force has claimed responsibility for the killings. So far seven people have died in six days, spreading panic among the minorities there.“The BJP workers, spokesperson and bhakts are everywhere. But they are not seen in Kashmir valley... BJP had spoken a lot about the ghar-wapasi of Kashmiri Pandit. Let alone going back, the remaining Pandits are fleeing the valley. You roam around being proud about Hindutva, but you have failed to save the Hindus in Kashmir,” an editorial said in Saamana, the Sena mouthpiece.The editorial further said that Pakistan is eyeing to enter Kashmir on the backs of the Taliban government in Afghanistan and added that Kashmir cannot be saved by “empty speeches, assurances and surgical strikes ahead of elections”. It added that the separatists in Kashmir have gained strength after the Taliban took over Afghanistan.“The government in Afghanistan is the sin of the Pakistanis, and Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan dreams to scale Kashmir valley with their (Taliban) support. Tell us how will you crush this dream? Empty speeches and assurances and surgical strikes ahead of elections will not save Kashmir and the Hindus. The surgical strike of note ban (demonetisation) did not work here,” the editorial said. As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of BJP does not comment on Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-proud-of-hindutva-but-failed-to-save-hindus-in-kashmir-sena-101633805503819.html

Ram is the soul and culture of India and India is incomplete without Ram. The court also condemned the practice of caste discrimination.On the allegations against the applicant, the court said that there are many countries in the world where there is a provision of harsh punishment for such conduct but in India there is provision of lesser punishment in comparison to other countries.The court said that one should respect the deities and culture of the country in which he or she lives instead of making obscene remarks on such issues.“The Constitution of India allows one to be an atheist but it doesn’t mean that one can pass obscene remarks against gods and goddesses,” justice Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/law-needed-to-honour-ram-krishna-allahabad-hc-101633805257091.html

10-10-2021||Lucknow||Minister’s son arrested after 12 hours of questioning||Lucknow/Lakhimpur Kheri After nearly 12 hours of marathon questioning, the Lakhimpur police on Saturday arrested union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra at the crime branch office, said police officials privy to the investigation. Investigation committee head deputy inspector general Upendra Agarwal confirmed the arrest of Ashish Mishra at 10.40 pm, after 12 hours of interrogation. Agarwal came out of the Crime Branch office briefly and announced the arrest, saying: “He was arrested after he failed to cooperate in the interrogation. He could not inform or validate on various points regarding his whereabouts at the time of the incident. We will try to get information after getting him on police remand.” Post arrest, a preliminary medical examination of Ashish Mishra ‘Monu’ was done at the Crime Branch office itself by calling emergency medical officer Dr Akhilesh Kumar. The officials said Ashish was questioned about his location and involvement in the incident that resulted in the death of eight people, including four farmers, on October 3. A police official said the nine-member investigation committee headed by deputy inspector general (DIG), state police headquarters, Upendra Agarwal, along with senior committee member Sunil Kumar Singh, commandant of 10th battalion PAC, questioned Ashish Mishra. He said the committee had prepared 40 questions to be asked. Ashish presented multiple affidavits through his lawyer Awadhesh Singh, who accompanied him, he said, adding Ashish had not clarified about his location at the time of the incident. He said Ashish Mishra’s mobile phone was seized and video recording of the entire process was done by the investigation committee, which started questioning Ashish soon after he appeared before it at around 10.40 am. Lakhimpur Sadar MLA Yogesh Verma of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also accompanied Ashish to the crime branch office. However, he stayed out of the interrogation room. Ashish Mishra appeared before the investigators after the second notice was pasted at his Lakhimpur residence on Friday, asking him to appear in connection with the violence in which eight people were kllled, including four farmers. He had failed to show up in response to the first notice and missed his 10 am deadline on Friday. The notice to Ashish Mishra was issued under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code and he was asked to appear and present evidence that he was aware of the incident. Earlier on Thursday, UP police’s additional director general, law and order, Prashant Kumar had said the police identified six people as accused, three of them dead in the violence, the two accused who have been arrested and Ashish Mishra. Another accused was unidentified. To note, two accused Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey were arrested and sent to jail on Thursday. Meanwhile, the police raided several places in search of former union minister Akhilesh Das’s nephew Ankit Das in Lucknow and Lakhimpur Kheri after he was said to be accompanying Ashish Mishra in his SUV at the time of the incident. In videos of the incident shared on social media, Das’s black SUV was seen following the minister’s car that allegedly mowed down four farmers after which violence broke out. Ankit Das was not found but his driver has been taken into custody. Mobile use not allowed A source said DIG Upendra Agarwal was particular about his questions and did not allow use of mobile phone by anyone. He even sent three policemen out of the interrogation room after their mobile phone started ringing during the questioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ministers-son-arrested-after-12-hours-of-questioning-101633805017065.html

The protest was led by Colonel CM Lakhanpal. The activists demanded pollution free environment, especially clean air and water, from the state government as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of IndiaAdvocate Inderjit Kaur, who specialises in human rights and was present at the protest said, “ The Supreme Court stated in its 1991 judgment in the Subhash Kumar vs state of Bihar case that the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 includes pollution-free water and air. Through this case, the court recognised the right to a wholesome environment as part of the fundamental right to life. The Punjab government has been shirking its duty of protecting citizens from polluted air and water. Our rivers have been mercilessly polluted and industries and municipal authorities have been dumping toxic sewage and effluents right under the nose of PPCB.”Puja Sen Gupta of Earthcare Welfare Society said , “Punjab needs eco-friendly industries, which do not damage its surface and underground water. The government should stop promoting industries which damage the natural resources of the state.”Jaskirat Singh of Naroa Punjab Manch said, “Government hides data which should be available in the public domain.

10-10-2021||Delhi||Centre denies nod to Delhi govt’s doorstep ration delivery scheme||The central government has refused to approve the Delhi government’s ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme, arguing that it deviates from the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. In a letter sent to Delhi’s food commissioner, the Centre said it cannot permit the proposal “in its current form”.“It is reiterated that the Delhi government should follow the norms and provisions of NFSA, 2013 in rightful spirit and manner while distributing food grains to the eligible NFSA beneficiaries under TPDS [Targeted Public Distribution System] and it is also conveyed that this department will have no objection if a separate scheme is made by the state government without mixing the elements of the NFSA food grains. It is, therefore, informed that all the statutory provisions of NFSA, 2013 are mandatory, and operation of TPDS as mandated shall be conducted in the manner prescribed under the NFSA, in order to ensure transparent and rightful targeting. The alleged proposal under consideration with the Delhi government for home delivery does not fulfil the norms of NFSA and therefore, is not permissible in its current form by the government of India,” said the letter sent by the under-secretary to the government of India to the city’s food commissioner on October 8.Also Read| Door to door survey in Nov to identify inactive ration cards: Delhi ministerThe letter evoked sharp criticism from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government is colluding with the city’s “ration mafia”.“It must be noted that this letter came after the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh made a representation before Delhi LG [Lieutenant Governor] Anil Baijal against the scheme. This association includes the same people who went to court against the Delhi government. But, the high court had given a decision in favour of the Delhi government, which is now being violated by the Centre. This is a clear case of collusion between the BJP and the ration mafia. The BJP is using the central government’s machinery for their own political benefit,” said AAP chief spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj.The Union ministry of food and civil supplies said the letter is just a reiteration of the Centre’s earlier stand on the issue.“The Centre has only been talking about following the provisions of NFSA act passed by the Parliament. All ration distribution activities in states are to be done in accordance with the laid down statutes only. Let’s not drag government departments into politics,” said a spokesperson of the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution.Earlier this week, the Delhi government sent the file on doorstep delivery of ration to the LG for approval once again. This came after the Delhi high court on September 27 allowed the government to stop supplying food grains to fair price shops (FPS) for those who have chosen doorstep delivery over the physical collection. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh took note of submissions by the AAP government that supplies made under the existing public distribution scheme will have to be curtailed so that food grains could be distributed door-to-door for those who want it.The LG office also did not respond when asked to comment on the issue on Saturday. However, senior officials in the LG office said that the file is still with Baijal and is yet to be sent back to the Delhi government.Nearly 7.2 million people in Delhi are eligible for subsidised food. They include 1.7 million ration card holders and nearly 3 million priority households. There are also other food-insecure categories identified by the Delhi government.Also Read| Transport of food grains in Delhi now an essential serviceThe doorstep delivery of ration scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25. But the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 objecting to the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for the scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Centre also said that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi Cabinet on March 24 decided to change the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFSA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-denies-nod-to-state-govt-s-doorstep-ration-delivery-scheme-101633803577203.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s annual air quality index worsens, to further deteriorate next week||With the withdrawal of monsoon from Delhi — and other parts of northwest India — on Friday, the Capital’s recent run of clear, clean, cerulean skies has started to give way to an annual veil of smog borne largely by stubble fires in neighbouring states. Data from the central pollution watchdog shows that the city’s air quality has seen a gradual, but sustained, drop over the past 10 days. And as farm fires pick up in Haryana and Punjab, Delhi’s air is only likely to get worse over the coming week.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday declared the withdrawal of the south-west monsoon from Delhi, which means that the moisture-laden easterly winds blowing over the Capital have now been replaced with dry, north-westerly winds. These winds will bring down temperatures, but push pollution levels, said weather forecasters.Recordings by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) show that as the wind patterns changed on Friday, air quality levels fell sharply.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) reading, jumped from 127 on Thursday to 167 on Friday, and then to 171 on Saturday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Experts said that this is the impact of stubble fires in the neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana.Scientists from the United States’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said that the rise in farm stubble burning is visible in the increased number of “fire dots” spotted over the region on satellite imagery.“Over the last one week, as the clouds have cleared up, there is a consistent increase in the number of fires appearing over north India. This will start impacting the region’s air quality,” said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association.NASA’s fire map on Saturday showed a jump in fires over parts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Ludhiana, Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar and Sangrur in Punjab. In Haryana, fires were observed in parts of Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Yamuna Nagar, Karnal and Panipat.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also warned Delhiites of the impending deterioration of the city’s air quality in a series of tweets on Friday and Saturday.Kejriwal has tweeted out the city’s daily air quality for the past month to establish that the AQI in the city, with only local pollution sources at play is in the “acceptable” range, but as soon as farmers in the neighbouring states start setting their fields on fire, the air quality in Delhi starts taking a nosedive.“Pollution has started increasing. 09 Oct-AQI – 171...,” Kejriwal tweeted on Saturday.Weather forecasters warned that from October 15, temperatures will start falling, which will increase the share of stubble smoke in the city’s air.“At present, Delhi is largely getting north-westerly winds with some components of westerly winds, but there is a forecast of day and night temperatures falling from October 15, which will lead to the formation of haze because of the stubble fire smoke. The air quality is likely to get bad from here on,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services.Union Ministry of Earth Science’s air quality monitoring system, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also forecasted the impending worsening of air quality in Delhi. They also highlighted that the primary pollutants in the city’s air on Friday were “fire emissions and dust suspensions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-annual-air-quality-index-worsens-to-worsen-next-week-101633803396777.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||Despite HC order, suspended AAP councillors not allowed to attend EDMC meet||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) called a special meeting of the House on Friday and discussed vector-borne diseases. Over a dozen suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillors were not allowed to attend the meeting, despite the Delhi high court’s Friday order allowing suspended members to attend the meeting. EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Agarwal, who suspended the 17 AAP councillors for 15 days on September 27 over alleged indecent behaviour and obstruction of the proceedings of the House, said that since they did not receive the high court’s order before the meeting began, the suspended members were not permitted to attend. “By the time we received the court orders, the meeting was over,” he said. Leader of Opposition in EDMC, AAP’s Manoj Tyagi, alleged that the court’s permission was deliberately suppressed by officials of the municipal body, to restrict them from the meeting. “Our counsel informed us at 3.30pm that the high court has granted us permission to attend the House. But, EDMC officials continued to claim that the order was not communicated to them by the competent authority. As a result, we had no option except staging a peaceful sit-in outside the House. While we were suspended for raising our voice against corruption, by disobeying the order, the mayor and his supporters have shown their contempt to the court,” he said. Tyagi also said that his party will inform the court about the contempt. “The order of suspension was illegal and contrary to the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, which provides for suspension of a councillor only in the presence of two orders of withdrawal from two successive meetings within 15 days of each other. The EDMC is involved in corruption in collaboration with builders. We were suspended as we sought action against the officials, who cleared EDMC’s building plan for a temple without any field visit,” he said. The Delhi high court, on Friday, sought a response from EDMC on a petition challenging the suspension of AAP councillors for allegedly creating a ruckus in the House and granted permission to them to attend the special meeting held during the day. Issuing a notice on the petition and seeking a response from the EDMC mayor, Justice Rekha Palli said that this interim arrangement was subject to the members maintaining decorum at the House and sought EDMC’s response on the petition challenging the suspension order. “It is directed that by way of an interim arrangement, the petitioners be permitted to attend the special session of the respondent today. The same would however be subject to the undertaking by the senior counsel for the petitioner that they will maintain the decorum of the Sabha/House and it is clarified that the permission is granted to attend the session would be subject to the outcome of the petition. If the respondent is successful in showing (the legality of the suspension), the court will consider passing appropriate order regarding the presence of the petitioner in session today (Friday),” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/despite-hc-order-suspended-aap-councillors-not-allowed-to-attend-edmc-meet-101633802976833.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Four firefighters injured while dousing blaze at factory in Narela||Four firefighters suffered burns, two of them seriously, in firefighting operations after a blaze set off an explosion which collapsed large portions of a three-storey factory engaged in manufacturing paper plates in Narela Industrial Area on Saturday.Fire department officials said the building, spread across 300 square metres, was operating without a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department. Nobody was inside the factory when the fire broke out.Of the four injured men, two of them -- identified as Manjeet and Praveen -- suffered nearly 40% burns and were admitted to the burn ward of Lok Nayak hospital where they were said to be critical till late Saturday night, officials said.A third fireman, Vijender, who suffered burns was also admitted to Lok Nayak but officials said he is out of danger. The fourth fireman, Brahm Singh, only suffered minor burns and few injuries to the leg, and was discharged soon, said Delhi Fire Services (DFS) director Atul Garg.“We first sent our injured firemen to a leading private hospital to provide them the best treatment. Unfortunately, the hospital did not have a burn ward. Without wasting any time, we admitted them to Lok Nayak hospital, where they are under the observation of doctors. We are closely monitoring their health status,” said Garg.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Bijender Kumar Yadav said that around 7.30am, the police control room was informed about a fire in a factory in Narela Industrial Area.According to the fire department, initially 33 fire tenders were rushed to the spot as the factory was full of inflammable materials and the fire was growing in strength. It soon engulfed the entire building and thick smoke and flames started coming out of the windows and doors.“Nearly 120 firefighters were involved in dousing operations. Around 1.30pm, an explosion took place inside the building that had already developed some cracks because of the blaze. Four firemen were injured and half of the building came crashing down in the back,” said deputy chief fire officer Sunil Chaudhary, who was leading the operation, adding that no firefighting arrangements were in place at the factory.While the exact reason for the fire is not ascertained, senior fire officials suspect a short-circuit in the electric cables may have caused the blaze.“Prime facie, it appears that the presence of heavy smoke inside the factory building turned it into a gas chamber and it may have triggered the explosion. The impact of the explosion was such that the flames came out of the building fast and reached our firefighters, who were standing nearly 12 metres away from the factory to carry out firefighting operations. Half of the building also collapsed in the blast,” said Garg, adding that the factory did not have the fire NOC.DCP Yadav said “legal action will be taken in due course”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifour-firefighters-injured-while-dousing-blaze-at-factory-in-narela-101633802496640.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||Freedom 251 scam mastermind held for framing brother-in-law in threat case||The Delhi Police on Saturday said they arrested Mohit Goel, the 34-year-old founder of Ringing Bells Company who allegedly masterminded the ₹200 crore Freedom 251 smartphone scam of 2016, along with two of his associates.The men were arrested for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to frame Goel’s brother-in-law in connection with a case that involved threatening a rape survivor.Goel’s brother-in-law, Vikas Mittal, was booked and arrested in connection with a case involving the rape, drugging, and threatening of a woman at the Dwarka South police station in August 2020.According to the police, Goel considered Mittal a personal and business rival and suspected Mittal’s involvement in all the cases registered against him in 2016.Goel conspired with his personal security officer (PSO) Vineet alias Shanky and accomplice Sumit Yadav to frame Mittal in false cases, said joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar.Explaining the entire conspiracy, Kumar said that it all started with the registration of the rape case against Mittal in 2020. When Goel learnt about the case, he decided to settle his scores with him. First, he arranged a mobile phone and a SIM card using fake documents. When Goel learnt that Mittal, who was out on bail, had gone to Ujjain with his family, he sent Vineet there.“After reaching Ujjain, Vineet telephoned the rape survivor impersonating Mittal, threatened her and asked her to meet him (Mittal) at the Delhi airport. Vineet returned to Delhi in the same flight that Mittal and his family members were travelling in. As Mittal landed at Delhi airport, he was arrested by the police on charges of threatening the woman,” he said.On September 24, 2020, Goel sent Vineet to the Civil Lines area after he found out the woman was there. Vineet met her and threatened her at the Civil Lines Metro station. Goel’s other associate (Yadav) made sure to be in the vicinity and became a witness in the threatening case the woman filed at the Civil Lines police station.The police said that Goel and Yadav planned to trap Mittal further. On October 18, 2020, Vineet called up Yadav from Gurugram and pretended to threaten him with dire consequences if he did not withdraw his name as a witness. Then Yadav, who was in Jind (Haryana) at that time, fired four rounds in the air with a pistol, went to the local police station and got an attempt to murder case registered against Mittal and unknown persons.“Yadav, in his complaint, mentioned that he was subjected to a near-fatal attack because he was a witness in the threatening case lodged in Delhi by a rape survivor. The objective was to make the police believe that everything was happening on Mittal’s orders,” said the joint CP.Since the local police were not able to identify or trace the unknown caller who had been threatening the woman, the Supreme Court transferred the case to the crime branch.Investigators collected details of the flights between Delhi and Ujjain on the day the woman received the first threatening call and realised that Goel’s PSO Vineet had travelled in the same flight.On October 2 this year, the police arrested Vineet from a rented apartment in Gurugram and he confessed during interrogation. His interrogation led to Goel’s arrest from Noida and Yadav’s arrest from Chandigarh on October 5 and 6 respectively.Yadav is also wanted in connection with 12 cases registered in Noida against a fraudulent dry fruits company that he and Goel set up.Goel, who belongs to Shamli in Uttar Pradesh, founded the Ringing Bells Private Ltd company in 2016 to sell smartphones named Freedom 251 at ₹251 in India under the Central government’s Digital India Programme.Several cases were registered against him by distributors and dealers across India as he could not provide deliveries of the phones despite payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifreedom-251-scam-mastermind-held-for-framing-brother-in-law-in-threat-case-101633802076565.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||32 construction firms fined ₹15 lakh as part of Delhi govt’s anti-dust drive||As part of its anti-dust campaign, the Delhi government on Saturday inspected 103 construction sites and fined 32 agencies around ₹15 lakh for violating dust control norms, said environment minister Gopal Rai.“In this anti-dust campaign, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) teams are visiting different districts and inspecting all construction sites. I had myself inspected the underpass construction work going on at Pragati Maidan earlier this week. There was a massive violation of the guidelines issued by the Delhi government there, after which strict action has been taken against them,” said the minister, who also conducted a surprise inspection of an under-construction commercial complex near Khyber Pass on Saturday.“While inspecting the construction work of the commercial complex on Saturday, we found no violation of the rules. I am happy that whatever guidelines have been issued by the government for the construction are being followed. Here, tin sheds and an anti-smog gun were installed. Water sprinkling was also being done. I appeal to all the private and government construction agencies in Delhi to carry out work while following the norms so that we can carry forward this fight against pollution with more strength,” said Rai.To control rising pollution levels in the Capital during the winter season, the Delhi government launched an anti-dust campaign across the city from October 7 to 29 to keep a check on construction agencies. The government released 14-point guidelines for the construction agencies in Delhi, including covering building sites with tin sheets and green covers, regular cleaning of vehicles carrying construction material and installation of anti-smog guns in sites with a built-up area of over 20,000 sqm, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/32-construction-firms-fined-rs-15-lakh-as-part-of-delhi-govt-s-anti-dust-drive-101633802016587.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Fake call centre busted, 4 who posed as staff of e-commerce giant held||New Delhi: The city police on Saturday said they busted a fake call centre in south Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and arrested four men who allegedly impersonated executives of a multinational company dealing in e-commerce and targeted US citizens. Police said they seized 10 mobile phones, four laptops, two desktop computers, and other items.Police received information about the fake call centre late on Wednesday night, following which a team raided the place around 4.30am on Thursday. Investigators said four men, who were present at the spot, allegedly tried to flee but were stopped by the police team.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Esha Pandey said a case of impersonation, cheating and criminal conspiracy was registered and the four were arrested. The suspects, who were identified as Mohammad Mukarram Hussain, Arjun Singh Saini, Gagan Bhatia and Shadab Ahmad alias Shadab Mullick, have no prior criminal record, she said.According to police, Mullick has completed his B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, Saini holds a diploma in computer engineering, and the other two are Class 12 passouts. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, DCP Pandey said that the arrested men created a fake website claiming to be the service provider of the MNC and posted virtual toll free numbers. Police said they managed to push their website to the top of search engine results.“When gullible victims (mostly from the US) called, they tricked the customers into buying gift cards of the company and share the details with them. They further redeemed the cards into US dollars, Bitcoins, and Indian currency on a trading platform through an app,” said Pandey, adding that efforts were being made to nab more co-accused in the case.More than 350 people have been arrested and nearly 20 fake call centres targeting citizens of the US and the UK through various cheating modus operandi have been busted in the past six months by the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifake-call-centre-busted-4-who-posed-as-staff-of-e-commerce-giant-held-101633801781893.html
10-10-2021||Delhi||100% threshhold eases in 7 courses as DU releases 2nd cut-off list for admission||Of the 11 courses in eight colleges that saw 100% cut-off under the first list last week, only three -- Political Science (Hindu College), Computer Science (Hansraj College), and Psychology (Jesus and Mary College) -- have closed admissions under the second cut-off list released on Saturday by Delhi University administration.The remaining courses with 100% cut-off have seen a marginal drop, ranging from 0.25 to 1.50 percentage points, except for Ramjas College, which has continued with the 100% cut-off in Political Science in the second list as well.Jesus and Mary College, which announced 100% cut-off for Psychology (Honours) for students who did not have psychology in their best-of-four results (and 99% for those with psychology in the best-of-four), announced on Saturday that there was not going be a second cut-off in any subject except BA Honours in Hindi (68%) and B. Vocational studies (84% for Retail management and IT; 82% for Healthcare management).Ramjas College, which had kept 100% cut-off in three subjects, has allowed admissions in all three courses under the second cut-off. While the college has continued with 100% cut-off in Political Science, it has reduced cutoffs in Physics (99.33%) and BA programme (99.5%). The college has, however, closed admissions in its B.Com programme after recording over-admissions.Tanvir Aeijaz, head of Political Science department at Ramjas college, said, “There are two spots left as two students had not paid the fee. We admitted 29 students in the UR (unreserved) category for 31 seats. This is why we decided to keep it open at the same percentage for second cut-off.”Hindu College saw a record number of admissions this year as a result of which they have closed admissions in 16 undergraduate courses. The college is accepting applications only for B.Com (Honours) and Economics, where the cut-offs have come down by 0.75 and 0.50 percentage points respectively. The college has admitted 1,784 students against its sanctioned strength of 937 for merit-based courses.Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu College, said it was unlikely that these subjects would open for UR category students in the subsequent lists. “There might be one or two stray cases but even that is unlikely because in most courses we have admitted twice or thrice the capacity of students in UR category. This is why we reduced the cut-off in commerce courses below one percent.”Authorities at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies – who had originally set a 100% cutoff in Computer Science – have reduced it to 98.5% in the second list after receiving no applications in the unreserved category under the first cut-off.Same is the case with Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College which had set a cut-off of 100% for its B.Com course and reduced it to 98.75% on Saturday, after recording no admissions for the course.Shri Ram College of Commerce has reduced the 100% cut-off in its two courses – BCom (Honours) and Economics – by 0.88 and 0.25 percentage points, locking it at 99.12% and 99.75% respectively.Popular courses such as Economics, English, History, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics have seen a drop in the range of 0.25 to 2 percentage points in most colleges, keeping it in the range of 96-100%. Officials said students, who have scored below 90%, have little chance of securing admission for these courses in the unreserved category.Meanwhile, most off-campus colleges have exercised caution while reducing cut-off in the second list as well.Rajesh Kumar Dwivedi, admissions convener at Aryabhatta College, said the college has decided to reduce cut-offs mostly in the range 0.25-1 percentage point, as 50% of its seats were filled under the first cut-off.“We haven’t reduced the cut-offs beyond this range because around 150 students become eligible with the reduction of just one mark, which corresponds to a drop of around 0.25 percentage points. Even if we get 10% of that number of students, we will record over-admissions,” he said.For Computer Science, which emerged as a popular course this year as three colleges set 100% cut-off in the subject, admissions are closed in eight out of the 20 colleges offering the course.Many colleges have either closed admissions in Political Science or have continued to set high cut-offs in the subject. Out of the 45 colleges offering Political Science, admissions are closed in 13 colleges, and cut-offs in the remaining range from 97%-100% in the second list.For courses such as Psychology (offered in 11 colleges), Sociology (offered in nine colleges), and Journalism (offered in seven colleges), admissions are open in nine, seven, and five colleges, respectively, under the second list.Eligible students wanting to study Political Science can still apply to Ramjas College (100%), Lady Shri Ram College (99.5%), Kirori Mal College (99.25%), Sri Venkateswara College (99.25%), Daulat Ram College (98.75%), and IP College (97.75%).Unlike Political Science, English is still open in the second cut-off in more colleges, such as LSR (98.75%), Hansraj College (98.5%), Ramjas College (98.25%), and Sri Venkateswara College (98%).Of the 70,000 sanctioned undergraduate seats in around 65 colleges in the varsity, 36,130 had been filled under the first cut-off.Admissions under the second cut-off will be conducted between Monday and Wednesday and students can pay their fee till 5 pm on October 15. The third cut-off list is slated to come on October 16.The university is expected to release five cut-offs, followed by a special cut-off to close admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/100-threshhold-eases-in-7-courses-as-du-releases-2nd-cut-off-list-for-admission-101633801776648.html
10-10-2021||Pune||Water quality between Khadakwasla dam and Mundhwa bridge most polluted: Report||According to the Namami Chandrabhaga report 2019, the water along the stretch of river between Khadakwasla dam and Mundhwa bridge (Pune Municipal Corporation/PMC area) was found to be of poor quality as the dissolved oxygen reduces by 42.6% and the BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) increases 6.1 times only to then reduce to an increase of 4.8 times.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) – which studied the river samples at multiple spots – found that the dissolved oxygen levels, which should be 5mg/litre, are 6.62mg/litre at the Khadakwasla dam source; 3.70mg/litre along the Mutha river at Sangam bridge; and 3.80mg/litre at Mundhwa bridge.While the main cause of pollution along this stretch of river is sewage runoff as faecal coliform increases 10 times in the western part of Pune city, other sources include: industrial pollution from chemical industries such as electroplating; agricultural runoff containing fertilisers; and untreated sewage. However, the report also found that when fresh water from sources such as the Ghod river merges with the existing river, it rejuvenates the health of the river to some extent proving that rivers can be rejuvenated and the damage possibly reversed.In the wake of the report, the Pune district administration is now considering a proposal put forward by Vision Earthcare Private Limited to build five sewage treatment plants (STPs) at five different locations along the Bheema river, also known as the Chandrabhaga river in the holy city of Pandharpur. The STPs will be based on Continuous Advanced Multistage System using Soil Biotechnology (CAMUS-SBT) that was invented by professor H S Shankar, department of chemical engineering, IIT Bombay.Dr Chandrashekhar, director and CEO, Vision Earthcare, said, “The plants could be commissioned within a year when we get the approval. The STPs will not only ensure that the sewage water is treated but also that the treated water is potable and can be used for multiple purposes. It is not just about rejuvenating the river but also about reversing the damage caused to the health of the residents of all the villages downhill who use the same river as a source of drinking water. A lot of waterborne ailments can be controlled once the water is treated effectively.”Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune zilla parishad, said, “Along with this, we are also in talks for public consultancy with the villages. This is a proposal which will need approval from multiple authorities. Once approved, we can take it up along with multiple authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chandrabhaga-found-polluted-between-khadakwasla-dam-and-mundhwa-bridge-report-101633795655815.html
10-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur Kheri incident: Akhilesh Yadav says farmers, law being crushed||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday attacked the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and said that farmers and the law were being crushed.The way police served summons (on Union minister of state Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra), it was like giving samman (bestowing respect) or offering a bouquet instead of bringing them (the accused) to book, Akhilesh Yadav said at a press conference at the SP state headquarters in Lucknow.“You have seen how a vehicle ran over farmers who were fighting for their rights... It is as if instead of giving summons, a bouquet was being given. The summons is only in name, and (in reality) samman (honour) is given.”His remarks came barely a few hours before Ashish Mishra was arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case.Ashish Mishra was asked to appear before the police on Friday, but he did not do so. The Uttar Pradesh Police then issued a fresh notice asking him to appear before it by 11am on Saturday and he finally did so.Accusing the UP government of shielding the guilty, the SP chief again demanded the resignation of Ajay Mishra Teni from the Union Council of Ministers.“The MoS had said that he has been an MP, MLA, but he has also been something else and was threatening the farmers,” he alleged.He also said the BJP’s “dumdaar (powerful)” stance is only for “protecting the powerful”.The reference was to the BJP government’s hoarding in Lucknow using the tagline “Dumdaar”. “The government claims that it is a dumdaar sarkaar. Is the government only for the powerful and not for the farmers? In the coming time, the BJP will be wiped out,” he warned.The family members of the aggrieved persons wanted justice and punishment for the guilty, he said.“The law of the country is being pulverised under the tyres of a jeep,” he said.He said though there was evidence and the Supreme Court had rapped the government, this government was in slumber over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and tried to save the accused.Reacting to Akhilesh Yadav’s statement that the BJP government was crushing the law and other allegations, UP cabinet minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh told a TV news agency: “A fair investigation under a retired high court judge is on; some of the accused have been arrested, others are begin interrogated...And during Akhilesh ji’s tenure as the chief minister, more than 200 riots happened and a journalist in Shahjahanpur was burnt alive after he said something against his government.”(With agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-akhilesh-yadav-says-farmers-law-being-crushed-101633793795486.html
10-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur Kheri: Farmer groups announce antim ardas in Tikunia on October 12||Farmer groups have announced that antim ardas (last prayers) will be held on October 12 for the deceased Sikh farmers at Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri district, where eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed on October 3. The announcement made by farmers groups on Friday night has alerted the local administration.A poster under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha of Lakhimpur inviting people to pay their last respects to the farmers killed in the violence was circulated in Lakhimpur and the nearby districts on Saturday. The poster states that the antim ardas for the farmers will be held at the Maharaja Agrasen Inter College ground in Tikunia.Satwant Singh, an office bearer of Samyukt Kisan Morcha in the district, said, “The antim ardas will be held peacefully in Tikunia. We will seek permission from the administration for the same.” Mandeep Singh, the son of deceased farmer Nachhatar Singh, said the family is yet to decide the place where the antim ardas of his father will be held. Farmer leaders had earlier given a deadline to the state government for meeting their demands in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. The farmer leaders were demanding the resignation of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, and his arrest along with his son Ashish Mishra, who is the main accused in the incident. Ashish Mishra was arrested on Saturday night hours after he reached the office of crime branch in Lakhimpur for questioning on Saturday after having skipped a summons on Friday. “The Union minister (Teni) should be arrested. We have given till 12th. There is a meeting on October 12th after that we will take the next decision,” farmer leader Rakesh Tikait told the press in New Delhi on Saturday. In a press conference held in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday, Tikait had made a similar announcement.According to people aware of the issue, the local administration has started making preparations for the event. Lakhimpur Kheri district magistrate Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya said, “The family members of the deceased farmers have not approached us regarding any such programme. The administration will think it over in the light of the recent incident and prohibitory orders, which are in place before giving permission for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-kheri-farmer-groups-announce-antim-ardas-in-tikunia-on-october-12-101633793742373.html

Though the first from her family to venture into the business field, Naqshbandi’s gamble paid off. Her boutique, a first-of-its-kind in Baramulla, became an instant hit as it had clothes of the latest trends. “To my surprise, my boutique was a hit with not just women, but men too. Many of them visit my store and compliment my work,” says Naqshbandi, who has given an indigenous name ‘Qoraab’, to her enterprise. Qoraab essentially means folded sleeves of Pheran, a long Kashmiri gown. “In a rural town like Baramulla, it takes time to flourish in business. But I am happy and satisfied with the response of the clientele,” says the 26-year-old who plans to open more such boutiques in other parts of Kashmir. Naqshbandi currently employs around 10 women and hopes to create more jobs. “Though I completed my masters in English in the midst of the pandemic, I did not want to sit at home after that. I am happy that not just have I become financially independent, but have also created jobs for others,” she says. She adds, “It wasn’t easy for me to venture into the business field. Both my parents were former government employees and had no business experience. Relatives and friends wanted me to get a government job but now they do feel proud after seeing my business venture flourishing.” Naqshbandi is grateful for the support her family provided her. “I had meagre savings. My mother and brother played a huge role in making my venture a success. They are my biggest inspiration,” says the 26-year-old. Her message for other girls, hoping to set out on the entrepreneurial journey: “Nothing is impossible if you want to do it; I always wanted to do something different, but I was waiting for the right time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/emblems-of-empowerment-in-the-midst-of-a-pandemic-she-took-the-start-up-plunge-101633791696148.html

10-10-2021||World||Iraq’s elderly vote, the young boycott||Issam Shukr, 70, voted Sunday at Al-Amal School in Baghdad. It means “hope” in Arabic, but there is little of that among the country’s overwhelmingly youthful population. For them the parliamentary election didn’t generate much enthusiasm. Leaning on his cane but looking good for his age, Shukr said he was “proud” of having cast his ballot. With many of the country’s eligible voters boycotting, Shukr was among a minority who voted.Sixty percent of Iraq’s population is under 25. For them, the ballot is about the same old faces who are unable to fix a country rich in oil but replete with problems, including a youth unemployment rate of around 40 percent.The streets of Baghdad, adorned with election banners, were deserted, a reflection of the low turnout expected among Iraqis fed up with the country’s political class.Virtually the only people visible were soldiers and police, deployed to safeguard the democratic process in a war-scarred country where cells of the Islamic State (IS) group jihadists are still active.Authorities also feared there could be anti-government protests. Overhead, two warplanes patrolled in a sunny sky.TORN POSTERSBack on the ground Shukr aimed, as he does every election, to be the first to cast a ballot. These are the fifth elections since the dictator Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003 and Shukr hoped for “improvement of the situation” in his country gripped by a political, social and economic crisis.The election is being held early in a rare concession to the unprecedented youth-led protest movement that broke out two years ago. Tens of thousands took to the streets to vent their rage at corruption, unemployment and other problems. Hundreds lost their lives in protest-related violence.Like Shukr, Jassem Mohammed Sultan, 53, was among members of the relatively older population who said voting is a means to improving things in the country. “We should all participate to choose the most suitable” to govern, the day labourer said in Mosul, Iraq’s second city which IS occupied from 2014 to 2017.In a symbol of the disinterest among many younger Iraqis, election posters of various candidates had been torn down and lay on a Baghdad lawn near police armoured vehicles. “I am not going there. I am not voting for anyone,” said a teacher, 30, who lives in Baghdad and belongs to Iraq’s Christian minority. “Why vote? We don’t trust any candidate, Christian or not,” she said.GOVERNMENT BRINGS ‘NOTHING’Taleb Mohammed, 28, was similarly disenchanted in Arbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq. “The government brings us nothing, at this time when there are no permanent jobs,” said the teacher who works on contract.In Nasiriyah, the city at the heart of the 2019 revolt, Imane al-Amine, 54, was also staying home because the elections “have nothing democratic”. “We live in a state controlled by firearms which circulate completely out of control and which kill people who think differently,” said Amine, an agricultural engineer.Polling stations visited by AFP throughout the day saw only a very limited flow of voters. Election workers with an air of weariness sat at worn-out wooden desks near gleaming electronic voting machines.A poll worker at one Baghdad centre said that of 413 registered voters only 43 had shown up, a few hours before the polls closed. “There were a limited number of youth. Most were seniors,” the worker said under cover of anonymity, as an elderly woman entered with a walker.Voters around Iraq held up their fingers to show the ink stains which confirmed they had cast their ballots.But those fingers were generally not the fingers of youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqs-elderly-vote-the-young-boycott-101633885080017.html

China has already overtaken theUS in the AI fight, he said, adding that he could not stand to watch China overtake America.“We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it’s already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion,” the 37-year-old first chief software office for the US Air Force said.Beijing is heading for global dominance because of its advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and cyber capabilities, he said. Compared to China's advancement, US cyber defences in some government departments were at the kindergarten level.Chaillan blamed the reluctance of Goggle to work with the US defence department on AI. Chinese companies, on the other hand, are obliged to work with Beijing, and were making “massive investment” into AI without regard to ethics, he said to Financial Times.Though the US spends at least three times more than China on defence, this is not being translated into any result as theUS is spending in the wrong areas and "bureaucracy and overregulation" stand in the way of change that the Pentagon needs.In his resignation announcement, too, he did not reveal his disappointment with the way Pentagon functions. "Please stop putting a Major or Lt Col. (despite their devotion, exceptional attitude, and culture) in charge of ICAM, Zero Trust or Cloud for 1 to 4 million users when they have no previous experience in that field – we are setting up critical infrastructure to fail. We would not put a pilot in the cockpit without extensive flight training; why would we expect someone with no IT experience to be close to successful? They do not know what to execute on or what to prioritize which leads to endless risk reduction efforts and diluted focus," he had written.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-already-lost-to-china-in-ai-fight-says-ex-pentagon-software-chief-101633870759285.html
10-10-2021||World||World Mental Health Day: How nature-based activities improve mood, reduces anxiety||Outdoor activities, which involve nature, such as gardening and exercise, have been found to improve mental health in adults – including those with pre-existing mental health problems, a new study has revealed.The research for the study was led by the University of York, Great Britain, and its findings were published in the journal SSM-Population Health. It showed that these nature-based, outdoor activities resulted in improved mood, less anxiety and also positive emotions.What did the study find?According to the study, activities lasting for 20 to 90 minutes, and continued over the course of eight to 12 weeks, have the most positive result for bettering mood and mitigating anxiety.It was also found that engaging in conservation activities was also revealed to make people feel better, similar to the effects of forest bathing – stopping in a forest to absorb the atmosphere.To sum up, the study findings showed that these nature-based interventions (NBIs) support people to get involved with ecology in a structured way to enhance mental health.How was the research conducted?For the study, researchers screened 14,321 NBI records and analysed 50 studies. Peter Coventry from the department of health sciences, who is the lead author of the study, said that it is not a novelty that “being in nature is good for health and wellbeing,” but the findings “reinforce the growing evidence” regarding the association of activities in nature with large gains in mental health.“While doing these activities on your own is effective, among the studies we reviewed it seems that doing them in groups led to greater gains in mental health,” Coventry noted.What new avenues do the study open up?The research, albeit found less evidence about outdoor activities contributing to better physical health, has recommended that there must be more apt ways to measure the short and longer-term impact of nature.The study emphasised that to address the demand for mental health support following the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a requirement for substantial, and sustained investment in the community and place-based solutions – such as nature-based interventions.“One of the key ideas that might explain why nature-based activities are good for us is that they help to connect us with nature in meaningful ways that go beyond passively viewing nature,” Coventry added.Who is behind the research?Along with Coventry, the research has been co-authored by Piran White (also from University of York), and forms part of the new 'Environment and Health' research theme, supported by the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI). The duo is now working with partners at the University of Central Lancashire to understand the health benefits of green social prescribing.The study has also been contributed by the academics from the department of health sciences, department of environment and geography, YESI, Hull York Medical School and Stockholm Environment Institute at York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-outdoor-activities-involving-nature-improve-mood-and-reduces-anxiety-101633869668869.html

Check details||In a milestone, Malaysia has fully vaccinated 90 per cent of its adult population, enabling the government to lift interstate and international travel restrictions that have been in place for months.In a televised interview, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said that fully vaccinated Malaysians will be allowed to cross state borders from October 11. Not only that, the requirement to apply for the MyTravelPass scheme to travel overseas has also been dropped for fully-vaccinated citizens, he added.Even as he announced the lifting of the curbs, Ismail Sabri advised people to continue following Covid-19 protocols such as mask-wearing to keep the virus in check.“Despite all the concessions that have been announced, the fact is that we have to live with the virus,” Bloomberg quoted Ismail as saying.“The situation demands that people continue to adhere to SOPs. I’d like to remind people not to be complacent about the relaxations," he added.To fight its worst Covid-19 wave in recent months, Malaysians had been prohibited from travelling between the country's different states since January. Even international travel was allowed for those who got special permission by applying through an official system.It must be noted that even as the new travel rules will come into effect from Monday, returning travellers will still need to undergo quarantine.The country has registered over 2.3 million virus cases and 27,000 deaths so far. Malaysia could keep the virus in check last year by closing its borders and imposing strict restrictions, it was, however, hard hit by the Delta strain this year with the country logging over 20,000 cases every day in August.With fast vaccine rollouts, the country has now managed to bend the curve. The country is aiming to reopen all economic and social sectors by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-eases-travel-curbs-as-90-adults-fully-jabbed-check-details-101633857968067.html

Seven people were pulled alive from the wreckage, officials said. The remaining sixteen are "without signs of life," a representative of the emergency services told the RIA Novosti news agency.The Emergencies Ministry said that the plane had 23 people onboard, including a group of parachute jumpers, according to the TASS news agency. The local health ministry was quoted by RIA as saying that one of the seven survivors who are in hospital is in "very serious condition".The aircraft was Let L-410 Turbolet, a twin-engine short-range transport aircraft. Accidents involving ageing planes are common in far-flung regions in Russia, even as its aviation safety standards have improved over the years.Last month, an Antonov An-26 transport plane crashed in the Russian far east killing six people. Two other L-410 aircraft also suffered fatal accidents in Russia earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-feared-dead-as-plane-carrying-parachutists-crashes-in-russia-101633852660436.html

10-10-2021||World||US will see a drop in Covid-19 deaths this winter: Anthony Fauci||US top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci expects the number of coronavirus fatalities to go down during the cold season. “I strongly suspect that you're going to start seeing the deaths go down similar to the hospitalizations; how quickly they go down and how thoroughly they go down is going to depend a lot on a number of circumstances, which will be influenced by things like the colder weather, people doing things indoors, how well they go by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines,” Fauci said in an interview with Greta Van Susteren, as quoted by The Hill.Fauci, who is the chief medical advisor to the US president, advised people to wear masks during outside gatherings regardless of whether an individual is vaccinated or not since there are communities with a high Covid-19 prevalence.“Fortunately, right now, over the last few weeks, we've seen a turnaround in the slope is going down in both cases and hospitalisations. Deaths are still up, but it's really flattening, so it's a lagging indicator,” Fauci said in the interview to be aired on Sunday. In September, the infectious disease expert warned that the Delta variant remains of primary concern in the US, having increased the share of new cases in the United States to over 98 per cent, from 13.5 per cent in June.The United States has the largest total number of confirmed coronavirus cases and the greatest Covid-19 death toll of all the countries in the world. According to the latest data from John Hopkins University, the US has registered over 44.3 million cases since the start of the pandemic and the number of fatalities has surpassed 712,000.At the start of this month, when the total Covid-19 death toll in the United States surpassed 700,000, US president Joe Biden said that the fact that the US death toll from the coronavirus infection is increasing means that more people need to get vaccinated in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-see-a-drop-in-covid-19-deaths-this-winter-anthony-fauci-101633847309288.html

10-10-2021||World||Tesla allows a sneak peek of its Gigafactory in Germany||It was showtime on Saturday on the site of Tesla's first European Gigafactory. With roughly 9,000 tickets issued to local residents, it required a good deal of organizational talent to deal with the crowd amid strict pandemic precautions. Although long lines formed in front of the entrance gate, Tesla's crew and security services were extremely efficient. In all, a 15-minute wait was more than acceptable, considering what visitors were able to see.In guided tours lasting an hour and a half each, local residents were able to watch the whole production process involved in making a Tesla electric car such as the Model Y.People took their time to see what was going on in the stamping and casting units and later in the paint shop and assembly and quality control sections of the huge plant. Wherever questions arose, Tesla employees were on hand to answer them.The 'wow' effect"I'm deeply impressed by what I'm seeing," a young woman said. "The degree of automation is unbelievable with all these robots around — I hear over 10,000 jobs will be created here, but, looking at the robots, you don't really understand where human beings will be needed at all."A man standing next to the woman was phoning home to his wife and kids, who didn't get tickets. "You should have seen this," he enthused. "It's awesome what Tesla has built here in such a short time. It just tells me how much we Germans have fallen behind."Information boards all along the guided tour track pointed to the Gigafactory's significance for the region, but also beyond it."We can produce as many cars here annually as were sold in the EU last year," Tesla told visitors, with half a million vehicles eventually expected to leave the Grünheide assembly line per year. Visitors were told that 80% of the workforce will be from Germany and 20% from 50 other countries. Also of some interest: 80% of all parts used in the Grünheide plant will come from European suppliers."I came all the way from Portugal, together with my friends," a member of a Tesla fan club said. "Of course I'm interested in electric cars, but it's also a more general interest in seeing Tesla helping pave the way towards a sustainable future — and I want to see the man," he added, referring to CEO Elon Musk, who was scheduled to make an appearance at the county fair later on.After visiting the plant, people could also go for a fun ride in a Tesla car on a high-speed test track or simply enjoy some free drinks and food. The US company's resolve to pull out all the stops on Saturday is likely to win over at least some of the plant's opponents in the region.Formality of permitsAccording to the online portal Business Insider, the Grünheide Gigafactory — including its battery cell production plant — will get a final permit from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment (LfU) later this year.Originally planning to open its Gigafactory in July, Tesla has been forced to move the date closer to the end of the year, blaming what it called German bureaucratic hurdles. Though many in the area have welcomed the prospect of thousands of new jobs, others have expressed mainly environmental concerns that Tesla is still dealing with.When the company announced its plan to add a battery cell plant to the Grünheide premises earlier this year, more than 800 objections from local residents and environmental groups were filed. They are currently being dealt with in a virtual hearing via email. Critics and Tesla have until mid-October to present their arguments.The US company will again be responding to concerns about the Gigafactory's water consumption. So far, it has stuck to its argument that the plant will not harm the drinking water supply in the area, following fresh contracts with a water management firm to secure just that.The carmaker promised that it would also meet German requirements for a viable incident concept to protect employees in the event of an accident, including the handling of hazardous substances.The German government is expected to decide before the end of the year just how much state aid Tesla will receive for its battery cell unit. The company is investing about €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in the plant. The German daily Tagesspiegel reports that this unusually high investment "means that the US car manufacturer can count on German state subsidies of €1.14 billion."The subsidies would dovetail with a plan approved by the European Union to assist major players in the production of electric vehicle batteries with a view to reducing the bloc's reliance on imports from China and other overseas industry leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-allows-a-sneak-peek-of-its-gigafactory-in-germany-101633838999106.html
10-10-2021||World||Austria's Kurz resigns over corruption allegations to save coalition||Austria's conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz resigned on Saturday to end a government crisis after his coalition partner said he was unfit to lead the country because he has been placed under investigation on suspicion of corruption.The move by Kurz, who denies wrongdoing, satisfied the demand by his junior coalition partner, the Greens, that he go even though he plans to stay on as his party's leader and become its top lawmaker in parliament, positions from which he can continue to influence government policy."I would therefore like to make way in order to end the stalemate, to prevent chaos and to ensure stability," Kurz said in a statement to the media.He added that he was proposing to President Alexander Van der Bellen that Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, a career diplomat backed by Kurz's party, that he take over as chancellor.Greens leader and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler indicated he was satisfied, meaning Kurz had succeeded in pulling their coalition back from the brink."I believe this is the right step for future government work," Greens leader and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said in a statement, adding that he had had a "very constructive" working relationship with Schallenberg.A star among Europe's conservatives and known for his hard line on immigration, Kurz, 35, became one of the continent's youngest leaders when he took over as chancellor in 2017 at the head of a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party.Prosecutors said on Wednesday they had placed Kurz and nine others under investigation on suspicion of breach of trust, corruption and bribery with various levels of involvement.Starting in 2016 when Kurz was seeking to take over as party leader, prosecutors suspect the conservative-led Finance Ministry paid for advertisements in a newspaper in exchange for manipulated polling and coverage favourable to Kurz.Kurz has pledged to defend himself against what he says are false allegations. He had said he was willing to keep governing with the Greens. But the left-wing party said the investigation made Kurz unfit to serve as chancellor and called on his party to name a successor who was "beyond reproach".No Confidence VotesThe Greens began talks on Friday with Austria's three opposition parties, which have all demanded that Kurz resign and had planned to submit one or more no-confidence motions against him at a special session of parliament on Tuesday.Austrian media reports before Kurz's announcement had said he would step down only temporarily. While Kurz did not say that he did say he would mount a legal defence: "Above all ... I will of course use the opportunity to refute and disprove the accusations that have been made against me.""Is it enough?" the leader of the liberal Neos party, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, told a news conference soon after Kurz's statement, referring to the seriousness of the accusations against Kurz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austrias-kurz-resigns-over-corruption-allegations-to-save-coalition-101633837663126.html
10-10-2021||World||With little hope for change, Iraq heads to vote in early election||Iraq on Sunday is set to hold an early election billed as a concession to anti-government protests, but expected to be boycotted by many voters who distrust official promises of reform.Polls were due to open at 7:00 am (0400 GMT) and close at 6:00 pm. Dozens of election observers deployed by the European Union and the United Nations were set to monitor the vote.Security was tight, with all airports closed from Saturday evening to dawn on Monday across Iraq, where despite the government's declaration of victory over the Islamic State group in late 2017, jihadist sleeper cells continue to mount attacks.Dozens of anti-government activists have been killed, kidnapped or intimidated in recent months, with accusations that pro-Iran armed groups, many of which are represented in parliament, have been behind the violence."Iraqis should have the confidence to vote as they please, in an environment free of pressure, intimidation and threats," the UN mission in Iraq said ahead of the polls, which are being held a year early in a rare concession to the youth-led protest movement.The protests that swept through Baghdad and the south in October 2019 rocked the Shiite factions that have dominated Iraq since the aftermath of the US-led invasion of 2003.Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to express their anger at corruption, unemployment and crumbling public services, and hundreds lost their lives in protest-related violence.The protests have largely fizzled out as anger has given way to disillusion, and analysts predicted a potentially record low turnout for Sunday's vote."Nothing will change. This election will be won by the same factions that people protested against," bemoaned Baghdad day labourer Mohammed Kassem, vowing not to vote."We have no power, no transport, no public services, and a wretched health service, even though Iraq is the richest country in the region," the 45-year-old said.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi's political future hangs in the balance, with few observers willing to predict who will come out on top after the lengthy backroom haggling that usually follows Iraqi elections.In a speech on Friday, Kadhemi sounded a reformist note, saying voters had a "historic opportunity" to elect "competent individuals... who are not tarnished by corruption" and are capable of launching "comprehensive reform at every level".'Musical chairs'A new single-member constituency system for electing Iraq's 329 lawmakers is supposed to weaken the power of the traditional blocs largely based on religious, ethnic and clan affiliations.But most analysts believe it will make the political process even more opaque.The electoral commission said it expects to publish preliminary results within 24 hours of the close of polls.But it will likely take longer for the balance of power to emerge as the leading factions compete for the support of a larger number of independents.The Fatah Alliance, the bloc representing many Iran-backed Shiite militias, is expected to retain its share of seats.The list of populist cleric Moqtada Sadr, already the largest in the outgoing parliament, is expected to make gains but not enough to dominate the Shiite camp."The election will likely result in another fragmented parliament, followed by opaque, corrupt horse-trading among factions to form the next government," said researchers Bilal Wahab and Calvin Wilder in an analysis published by the Washington Institute."Few expect this election to amount to more than a game of musical chairs, and the (October 2019 protest) movement's core demands -- curbing systemic corruption, creating jobs and holding armed groups accountable -- are unlikely to be met."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-little-hope-for-change-iraq-heads-to-vote-in-early-election-101633830448469.html
10-10-2021||World||Italy extends Covid-19 ‘green pass’ rule, spurs massive anti-government protests in Rome||Thousands of protesters including members of far-right groups demonstrated in central Rome on Saturday against the extension of the Covid-19 health pass system to all workplaces. There were scuffles with police as the demonstrators took aim at the health pass, which has been a requirement to enter museums, sporting events, and restaurants since August.Although the march was authorised, several hundred people broke off from the main column and tried to march on parliament. Police used water cannon and tear gas to stop them, arresting several protesters during clashes, the AGI news agency reported.A separate protest took place in the capital and others in the northern city of Milan and in Cesena, central Italy.Three weeks ago the government of prime minister Mario Draghi announced that the scheme would be extended to all places of work from October 15 and any employees refusing to comply faced suspension without pay. The health pass system is already in place for all medical workers. It requires people to provide a certificate of vaccination, proof of recovery from Covid-19, or a recent negative test result.Retiree Maria Ballarin denounced "criminal and cowardly blackmail" by the Italian state.By not making vaccinations compulsory but forcing workers to have them "it absolves itself of any responsibility for fatal or serious consequences, but indirectly obliges people to be vaccinated in order to be able to go to work", she said."We were both suspended two months ago," Cosimo, one of the protesters, told AFP. He and his wife Morena are both nurses.The couple says they have immunity and allergy problems and were exempted from the vaccination requirement by their family doctor. But both were suspended without pay.Stefano, who came from Como in the north to join Saturday's protest, said he would take the test. "I have to pay to work, it's absurd," he said. Nearly 80 per cent of the over-12s in Italy have been fully vaccinated, according to government statistics. The first European country to feel the full force of the pandemic, Italy has so suffered more than 130,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-extends-covid-19-green-pass-rule-spurs-massive-anti-government-protests-in-rome-101633829181213.html
10-10-2021||World||Taiwan marks ‘national day’ today under looming shadow of China||Amid concerns regarding a potential Chinese ‘invasion’ around the corner, Taiwan celebrates its ‘national day’ on Sunday. The celebrations for the day, which is immensely significant in the history of the East Asian nation, are likely to not be received well by China, which celebrated its own national day earlier this month by violating Taiwan's airspace with a slew of fighter aircraft in a major display of military supremacy and strategic pressure. Beijing claims the democratic island as its own territory and Chinese president Xi Jinping even said on Saturday that Taiwan's independence was a “grave lurking threat to national rejuvenation”.Also Read | Taiwan says China could launch ‘full scale’ invasion by 2025, tensions aggravateThe Taiwan National Day—also known as the ‘Double Ten’ or the ‘Double Tenth Day’— is a public holiday that remembers the 1911 Wuchang Uprising which ultimately led to the creation of the Republic of China. However, after the Chinese civil war, the Republic of China was forced to cede control to the communists and the erstwhile officials fled to Taiwan in 1949. Each year, the presidential square in Taipei—the capital of the island nation—is lit up on this day while large parades and rallies, displays of martial arts, folk dancing, and other cultural activities are conducted.Also Read | ‘Complete reunification of China will be realised’: President JinpingHowever, the threat of Beijing's increasingly hostile advances seems closer than ever this year, according to reports. Although a ‘full scale’ Chinese invasion seems unlikely at least until 2025, Taiwan's defence minister said at the country's parliament on Wednesday that tensions with Beijing are now at their worst in more than 40 years. He noted that there was an added risk of “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait and that while China may already have the required arsenal to take Taiwan by force, the cost of a “full scale” war for Beijing might be at its lowest by 2025, when a potential invasion seems likely.Notably, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed more than 150 fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Straits, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, declared on Saturday that "the complete reunification of China can and will be realised,” and said that the ‘Taiwan question’ brooks no international interference from third parties. Although Xi promised that Beijing will concentrate its efforts on a peaceful “reunification” with Taiwan, he stopped short of mentioning anything on the use of force. Taiwan responded shortly after by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan’s people could decide their future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-marks-national-day-today-under-looming-shadow-of-china-101633825045069.html

Our thoughts are with the 10 wounded civilians, who were doing no more than seeking to travel or make a living," US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a tweet.A spokesperson of the coalition Brigadier-General Turki Al-Malki said that the attack was through a projectile that fell on the airport, Xinhua news agency reported citing Saudi media.The attack against the King Abdullah airport in Jizan was carried out Friday night by an explosives-laden drone, resulting in injuries to 10 passengers and workers, Gulf News quoting the alliance spokesman Turki Al Maliki reported.On Wednesday, four employees at another Saudi airport were injured after Saudi defences intercepted an explosive drone launched by Al Houthis, Gulf News reported.In recent months, Al Houthis have ramped up drone and missile attacks into the Saudi territory. The rebels have plunged Yemen into a devastating war after they unseated the internationally recognised government and seized some parts of the impoverished country including the capital Sana'a in late 2014, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-department-condemns-attack-on-saudi-arabia-s-king-abdullah-airport-101633825740235.html
10-10-2021||World||China, US reps hold ‘candid’ meeting on trade issues||China and US held their first trade talks under the Biden administration with a “candid exchange” in a virtual meeting of US trade representative Katherine Tai and China’s vice premier Liu He on Friday.The two officials “reviewed implementation of the US-China Economic and Trade Agreement and agreed that the two sides would consult on certain outstanding issues”, according to a readout of their meeting issued by the office of the US trade representative (USTR).Tai signalled the resumption of trade talks with China last week saying she plans to have ‘frank conversations” with her Chinese counterpart about “shortfalls” in deliverables China had committed itself to under a 2020 trade deal popularly known as the Phase 1 agreement.At the meeting, Tai emphasised US concerns relating to China’s “state-led, non-market policies and practices that harm American workers, farmers and businesses”, the USTR said.US trade officials have indicated they do not foresee a Phase 2 of the trade deal with China, and are focussed on ensuring the implementation of the 2020 deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-reps-hold-candid-meeting-on-trade-issues-101633806574565.html
10-10-2021||World||‘Complete reunification of China will be realised’: President Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday to realise peaceful “reunification” with Taiwan, though did not directly mention the use of force after a week of tensions with the Chinese-claimed island that sparked international concern.Taiwan responded shortly after by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan’s people could decide their future.Xi’s call on reunifying Taiwan comes in the backdrop of a week of heightened military tension with the democratically-run island that Beijing claims as a breakaway region.The Chinese PLA deployed more than 150 fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Straits, which violated the island’s air space last week prompting Taipei to call it the worst tensions with China in 40 years. The tension has also sparked international concern.“The complete reunification of China will be and can be realised,” Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state media, adding the Taiwan question, which is purely an internal matter for China, arose out of the weakness and chaos of the Chinese nation and will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality.“It has never ended well for those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, or split the country,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Saturday, the anniversary of the revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911.“They will definitely be scorned by the people and judged by history,” he said.“National reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including compatriots in Taiwan,” he noted.“Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should stand on the right side of history and join hands to achieve China’s complete reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi said.Xi’s Saturday speech seemingly struck a softer note than the one he delivered on July 1 to mark the Chinese Communist Party’s 100 years in which he vowed to “smash” any attempts at formal independence.The presidential office in Taipei criticised Xi’s speech, saying Taiwan was a sovereign independent country, not part of the People’s Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China’s offer of “one country, two systems” to rule the island.“The nation’s future rests in the hands of Taiwan’s people,” the presidential office said was quoted as saying by Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/complete-reunification-of-china-will-be-realised-president-jinping-101633805168891.html

She is currently pursuing a Bachelor’s programme from Miranda House college of the Delhi University and oversaw the functioning of the British High Commission on Friday.“As the UK’s top diplomat in India, Aditi experienced a broad variety of diplomatic activity. She observed the India-UK Energy for Growth Dialogue,” the embassy said it a release.It said she met with beneficiaries of a leadership programme for aspiring female politicians funded by the Chevening Alumni Programme Fund besides joining climate experts from the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and young leaders from the not-for-profit Global Youth. “Aditi’s packed day also included a hands-on demonstration of the I-PACE-Jaguar’s zero-emissions, all-electric performance SUV to be used by world leaders at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month,” the embassy said.On her part, Aditi said she had applied for the competition last year as well and was really pleased that she got the opportunity. “The interaction with senior diplomats and with women from ‘She Leads’ leadership programme were the two personal highlights of the day for me. I also enjoyed being driven around in an electric vehicle by the High Commissioner,” she said. “The amount of work that both the UK and India are doing to tackle issues like climate change and gender inequality made me really hopeful as a young woman. I will cherish this day for a long time to come,” she added.The applicants for the competition were invited to submit a one-minute video answering the question: ‘How can young people best support tackling the global challenge of climate change?’ The embassy said UK High Commissioner Alex Ellis acted as the Deputy High Commissioner for that day.“It was a pleasure for me to work with Aditi throughout the day. Her confidence and thoughtfulness on important issues like climate change and women’s rights shone through. The UK is working with India to provide a platform for young women like Aditi to help them reach their potential,” Ellis said. The envoy said he was happy that so many young girls sent in their entries for this year’s competition.“Women are disproportionately affected by climate change and are often left out of decision making on it. The UK is committed to hosting an inclusive COP26 that advances gender equality by calling on all countries to implement the Gender Action Plan agreed at COP25,” Ellis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20yrold-takes-over-as-the-high-commissioner-of-britain-for-a-day-101633890421536.html

Ajay Mishra's arrest and dismissal are awaited in addition to arrests of all culprits in Lakhimpur Kheri farmers' massacre,” it added.Further, the farm unions have also said that they would take out a ‘Shaheed Kisan Yatra’ from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh with the ashes of the farmers who lost their lives after October 11 if their demands were not met by then. Alongside, the unions have also called for protests by blocking trains from 10am to 4pm on October 18 and a ‘mahapanchayat’ (farmers meeting) in state capital Lucknow on October 26. “Planning, meetings are happening in various states to implement SKM call for action for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri farmers massacre,” the SKM also said.Meanwhile, Ashish Mishra, son of Ajay Mishra, has been remanded to judicial custody for a period of 14 days, a day after his arrest.Eight people died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, of which four were farmers allegedly hit by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Two BJP workers and their driver were also dead as violence erupted. While the protesting farmers claim that Ashish Mishra was present in one of the vehicles involved in the incident, Mishra and his father have both denied it saying that they possess evidence to prove otherwise.However, the farmers have said that Mishra continuing as the minister of state, particularly for home affairs, is “untenable and inconceivable"."It is clear that the MoS Home had a role to play in promoting enmity and disharmony, in criminal conspiracy and murder, as well as in harbouring offenders and trying to obstruct justice and to tamper with/conceal evidence," the SKM further said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-skm-warns-of-intensifying-protests-if-minister-ajay-mishra-not-removed-by-oct-11-101633888113425.html
10-10-2021||India||Bhupesh Baghel attacks UP CM over Priyanka Gandhi's detention, calls him a 'coward'||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday came down heavily on his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath, calling him a "coward" for not letting Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visit Lakhimpur Kheri following the violence that ensued last Sunday and keeping her in the custody, reported news agency PTI. Priyanka Gandhi was detained in Sitapur on Monday following her attempt to visit the violence-hit district in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed.Bhagel made the remarks while addressing the party’s "Kisan Nyay Rally" in Varanasi. During his address, he also slammed the BJP, claiming that the party divides people in the name of religion, which they "learnt from the British".Training guns at Adityanath, the Chhattisgarh chief minister said he had never known seers to fear anyone but CM Yogi proved to be an exception who, he said, was a “big coward”."He is such a coward that he got afraid of a woman, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, that he did not allow her to go to Lakhimpur Kheri and kept her in jail for four days. The UP chief minister will be such a big coward, I never knew this," PTI quoted Baghel as saying."When I reached Lucknow from Raipur, I was not allowed to move out of the airport. When I said that I want to go to the UP Congress office and that I want to meet Priyanka Gandhi, I was told that I cannot go out of the airport. Such a coward and frightened person, I have not seen," Baghel added.Stating that Congress has always fought for the farmers, Baghel urged people to vote for the party in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. He also mentioned that unlike CM Yogi who never stayed true to his word of doubling the farmers' income, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi gave farmers in Chhattisgarh ₹2,500 per quintal for paddy, the only state to do so."The RSS and Savarkar used to act as informers of the British while on the other hand, it was Mahatma Gandhiji, who fought for the farmers. (Jawaharlal) Nehruji and Sardar Patelji also fought for the farmers," he said."They (BJP) know how to make people fight in the name of religion and this quality of divide and rule they have learnt from the British. This has been going on since the freedom struggle," he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-attacks-up-cm-over-priyanka-gandhi-s-detention-calls-him-a-coward-101633884757959.html

Furthermore, a cyclonic circulation lies over the north Andaman Sea and its neighbourhood, and another one lies over the east-central Arabian Sea. Owing to these conditions, the IMD has forecasted heavy rainfall coupled with thunderstorms in as many as four states and Union territories (UTs), including Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Maharashtra, Kerala and Mahe in Puducherry.The IMD has already issued an orange alert in six districts of Kerala, including Idukki, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Ernakulam. A yellow alert has been sounded in four districts – Thiruvananthapuram, Malappuram, Palakkad, and Kozhikode. These districts have been put on alert till October 13 due to the possibility of heavy rainfall caused by two low depressions in the Bay of Bengal.The latest IMD bulletin said that conditions are favourable for further withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some parts of Chhattisgarh, Gujarat; some parts of Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal, and most parts of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand over the next two days.Meanwhile, the cyclonic storm over the Andaman Sea is expected to trigger the formation of a low-pressure area over the same region in the next 36 hours. “It is likely to become more marked and move west northwestwards towards south Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh coasts during subsequent four to five days,” the IMD stated in its bulletin.Additionally, the cyclonic storm that lies over the Arabian Sea is “very likely to persist during the next three to four days.”Under the above influences, here are key IMD alerts for four states and UTs till October 15:1.     Due to the cyclonic storm over the Andaman Sea, light to moderate rainfall at most places with isolated thunderstorms and heavy to very heavy falls are likely over Andaman and Nicobar Islands till October 15.2. southern peninsular India is expected to receive fairly widespread to widespread, light to moderate rainfall with isolated heavy downpours till October 15. The IMD has forecasted the same weather for Maharashtra till October 13.3.     According to the IMD bulletin updates, isolated very heavy rainfall is very likely over Kerala and Mahe in Puducherry between October 12 and 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-withdrawal-cyclonic-storms-to-bring-heavy-rain-in-4-states-uts-imd-101633886969737.html
10-10-2021||India||In Kerala snake bite murder case, verdict to be delivered on Monday||The district magistrate court in Kollam (south Kerala) will deliver its verdict in the sensational snake bite murder case on Monday in which a 25-year-old woman was allegedly killed by her husband who put a cobra in her room and forced it to bite her while she was sleeping. The macabre incident which triggered outrage and indignation took place on May 7, 2020 and the trial was completed in record time. The prosecution has sought death sentence for the main accused P Sooraj, the victim’s husband, saying it was a well-planned and executed murder. The victim’s parents also said they want maximum punishment for the accused. The victim, Uthra, got the fatal bite in her home while she was undergoing treatment for another snake bite that she suffered a couple of months ago. During the probe, the special investigation team (SIT) found that he had procured enough training from a local snake handler, who provided him with a cobra. He became overconfident after nobody suspected any foul play during his alleged first attempt in which he used a viper. The case surfaced after the woman’s parents filed a police complaint a couple of days after her death, alleging that Sooraj and his family members harassed their daughter for dowry. The couple had been married for two years and has a son. After the parents filed a complaint, Sooraj filed a counter-complaint against Uthra’s brother saying he wanted to usurp her father’s property. Her married brother was staying separately and he had some property dispute with the father and Sooraj used this to mislead investigators, the SIT found. During investigation the SIT found that he bought a fully-grown black cobra from a snake handler Suresh, who turned an approver later, after paying ₹10,000 and took it to Uthra’s house in Anchal where she was staying after the first bite. The SIT said on May 6 night after she fell asleep he allegedly took out the snake from the bottle and threw it on her and provoked it and it bit her twice. Sooraj reportedly told the police that since she was under heavy medication for the first bite she failed to get up. He kept awake all night to ensure that it did not bite him and went out as usual in the morning. Though she was rushed to a nearby hospital doctors said she died of snake bite. During investigation the SIT found that he was planning to marry again after eliminating his first wife. His parents were also charged with dowry harassment, destruction of evidence and other charges. Though there are no direct witnesses the SIT had managed several scientific evidences including autopsy of the dead cobra. It later reconstructed the murder scene using a dummy experiment. The dummy video submitted in the court is expected to play a crucial role in the case_ the video shows the cobra trying to bite the dummy of the woman lying on the bed after it was provoked by the handler. Sooraj was charged with murder while his parents and sister are accused of domestic violence and abetment to the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-snake-bite-murder-case-verdict-to-be-delivered-on-monday-101633884899781.html

10-10-2021||India||NIA raids on TRF in Jammu and Kashmir amid spate of civilian killings||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday carried out raids at multiple locations in Jammu and Kashmir and arrested two operatives of The Resistance Front (TRF) in connection with its larger conspiracy probe against the outfit, people familiar with the development said. Among the residences searched, are that of Sajjad Gul, who is the Commander of TRF in the valley. TRF was created by the Pakistan army and the ISI in response to India’s abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 that gave somewhat special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Indian agencies claim that the outfit is nothing but an offshoot of LeT. The outfit has claimed responsibility of the recent attacks on civilians in the valley. Investigators have stated that the TRF is also behind the June 27 recovery of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) weighing 5.5 kg, which was dropped using a drone in Jammu on June 27 in Bathindi (Jammu) as well as twin-drone based attacks at the Air Force Station in Satwari on the same day. The places raided on Sunday are located in Kulgam, Srinagar and Baramulla districts. Two TRF operatives arrested by the probe agency have been identified as Tawseef Ahmed Wani, a resident of Baramulla and Faiz Ahmed Khan, a resident of Anantnag. “Investigation has revealed that Pakistan-based handlers of proscribed terror outfit LeT and their associates based in J&K had conspired to cause extensive terror activities for harming the public. They had planned that responsibility for the terrorist acts so committed would be taken by the pseudo-acronym TRF so as to maintain plausible deniability and evade Law Enforcement Agencies. During the searches conducted today many digital devices including mobiles, pen drives, data storage devices and other incriminating materials have been recovered,” the NIA said in a statement. A senior counter terrorism official said Pakistan-based terror outfits are trying to create tension in the valley using their operatives. The Union home minister, during a meeting with senior security officials on Friday, has directed hard action to be taken on all the elements including terrorists, overground workers (OGWs) and sympathizers for the killings of civilians. According to Jammu and Kashmir police data, a total of 28 civilians have been killed by terrorists in the Valley this year out of which seven have been killed since Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-raids-on-trf-in-jammu-and-kashmir-amid-spate-of-civilian-killings-101633881359787.html

It is a huge honour for me,” said the 60-year-old activist, the second Indian to win a Nobel Peace Prize after Mother Teresa.Satyarthi said he spoke with Malala after the announcement and now hoped to work with her for peace.“Children should be born and grow in peace ... I will definitely invite Malala to come and work with me,” he said at his office after the announcement. “The fact that the prize has been given to an Indian and a Pakistani is a big statement from the Nobel Committee and this statement has to be read not only by the government but the public too.”Malala, who was in school when the Nobel was announced, urged the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers to attend the prize ceremony. “I want India and Pakistan to talk about peace and focus on education and development … I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to join us when we receive the Nobel Peace Prize,” she said in Birmingham, England, where she is now based.“I’m feeling honoured that I’m being chosen as a Nobel laureate. I’m proud that I’m the first Pakistani and the first young woman, or the first young person, who is getting this award,” she said. “The award is not for me but for every child in the world. This is not the end of the campaign I started, but the beginning. I want to see every child in the world go to school. I want every child to stand up for their rights, to receive quality education, not to suffer child labour, child trafficking.”After the announcement in Oslo, joyous celebrations broke out at Satyarthi’s Bachpan Bachao Andolan office in Kalkaji as friends and family distributed sweets and activists hugged each other.Modi congratulated Satyarthi on winning the Peace Nobel. “Shri Kailash Satyarthi has devoted his life to a cause that is extremely relevant to entire humankind. I salute his determined efforts,” he tweeted.The New Delhi - based Bachpan Bachao Andolan has been at the forefront of the fight against child labour, creating domestic and international consumer resistance to products made by bonded children as well as with direct legal and advocacy work.Satyarthi, an electrical engineer by training, has rescued some 80,000 children sold to pay their parents’ debts and helped them find new lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-october-11-2014-peace-nobel-united-india-pak-kailash-satyarthi-shares-prize-with-malala-yousafzai-101633879208603.html

We are low on the second dose. Almost 26 lakh people are due for the second dose. So, this type of drive allows them to come and ensure that they get their second dose," ANI quoted Radhakrishnan as saying.Further, Radhakrishnan also said that the camps are being conducted to not only vaccinate the people but also to create awareness about the drive. “We are trying to spread the message that those who are vaccinated are safe. Those who are due should come. So, it is not a forcing approach but a convincing one,” he said.“Before we started this mega camp we were at 46%; now we are [at] 65% first dose [coverage] after four such camps. This is only the scientific way forward to protect ourselves,” he added.Briefing on the vaccine availability in the state, the health secretary said that there were 47 lakh vaccine doses currently and another six lakh doses would be received on the day and so the availability of vaccines was not an issue.Meanwhile, the fifth mega camp is the highest yet in the state, in terms of the number of camps, with 30,000 such facilities set up, state health minister Ma Subramanian had said earlier this month. “Currently we have about 24 lakh vaccine doses in stock and expect another nine lakh to be sent from the Centre, totaling 33 lakh. By Saturday evening we expect to have 25 lakh vaccines to conduct the fifth Mega Vaccination Camp,” news agency PTI quoted him as saying on October 5. The minister also said that the state government aims to inoculate at least 70% of the population with one dose by the end of October, which he called was a safe standard prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO).(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5th-covid-19-vaccine-camp-underway-in-tamil-nadu-as-state-aims-to-achieve-70-first-dose-inoculation-by-october-101633877361262.html

The former NC leader also said that he could continue to “serve people even outside the party”.Slathia along with party colleague Devendra Rana announced their decision to quit the Jammu and Kashmir-based NC on Sunday. Rana, who has served as the party’s provincial president of Jammu, told reporters outside his residence that he and Slathia had “resigned from the basic membership of the National Conference”.Slathia and Rana, who had won from the Nagrota and Vijaypur constituencies, respectively, are expected to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday in the presence of general secretary, Arun Singh, MP Jugal Kishore, J&K chief Ravinder Raina and Union minister Jitendra Singh."Dr Farooq Abdullah has received & accepted the resignations of Mr Salathia & Mr Rana. No further action or comment is deemed necessary," a National Conference spokesman tweeted earlier in the day.Rana also said quitting the NC will help him work for the people of Jammu by helping them realise their aspirations, adding his political philosophy going forward would be based on the Jammu declaration.The two leaders' exit came after a spate of civilian killings that rocked the valley in recent days. As many as eight civilians have lost their lives since last Sunday. The Resistance Front, an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for five of these deaths.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-speak-openly-for-people-of-jammu-surjit-singh-slathia-on-nc-resignation-101633877423670.html
10-10-2021||India||What does SAS tell us about India’s animal farms?||Have tractors finally replaced bullock carts and private dairies the milk-animal in the Indian farmer’s house? Vigilante groups (“gau rakshaks”) claiming to be protecting cows have been making news (for the wrong reasons) in the past few years in India. But how many “gau palaks” — those who keep cows at home — are there in India? How big are animal farms and animal farming in the business of farming in India?HT has analysed unit-level data from the latest Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India (SAS) to answer some of these questions. The SAS was conducted in the calendar year 2019 and gives data for the July 2018-June 2019 period on animal farming.A Rajasthan farmer is about thrice as likely to have an animal as his Telangana counterpart The SAS only looks at households which meet the criterion set for agricultural households. This requires at least one member to be self-employed in agriculture and an output in specified agricultural activities of ₹4,000 (in 2018-19) in the past 365 days. Just as not all farmers are counted as agricultural households, not all agricultural households which have an animal at home – this excludes pets – qualify for the animal farming household (AFH) category in the SAS. Only those agricultural households are considered in AFH category that received some value of output – such as milk, wool, live animals, or even manure -- from animal farming. An estimated 60.2 million out of the total 92.5 million agricultural households or 65% qualify for the AFH category in the entire July 2018-June 2019 period. Data on ownership of animals was, however, only collected when data on agricultural households was being collected with reference to July-December 2018. During this period, 58% households were engaged in animal farming, but 71% owned some kind of livestock (excluding pets). However, there are significant state-wise differences in whether or not an agricultural household qualifies for the AFH category. Among major states, the share of AFHs among agricultural households was 90% in Rajasthan. This number was just 34% in Telangana. Cows and hens, not buffaloes and goats What are the most common animals in India’s animal farms? 45% of India’s agricultural households own cattle, 27% own buffaloes and 14% have poultry birds. Ovine and other mammals (sheep, goat, pig, rabbits, etc) are owned by only 19% of agricultural households. In terms of estimated numbers, cattle and poultry birds outnumber other animals. An average agricultural household owned 1.35 cattle and 1.34 poultry birds compared to 0.90 ovine and other mammals and 0.71 buffaloes. Nearly a third of Other Backward Classes (OBC) agricultural households (32%) own buffaloes, much higher than the 15%, 23% and 32% share for Scheduled Tribe (ST), Scheduled Caste (SC) and agricultural households not belonging to SC, ST or OBC groups. The share of agricultural households owning buffaloes is 2.3 times the share owning cattle in Haryana. Poultry ownership is nil in Haryana compared to 60% in Assam. Size of land-ownership is an important factor in deciding cattle and buffalo ownership though not in case of poultry. Is there a problem of stray cattle in Indian villages? Anecdotal accounts suggest that it is a huge problem. Does the SAS offer any clues on this question? Deductive reasoning suggests that it does. 73% of cattle and 85% of buffaloes owned by agricultural households are female. This means that cattle and buffaloes are largely kept as milk animals and not for working on farms. Such a skewed gender ratio is unlikely to be the result of natural causes. This leaves disposal – either by selling or abandoning -- of male cattle and buffaloes by agricultural households. The SAS shows there is a compelling economic case for doing so. Animal ownership, especially cattle and buffalo ownership, is strongly correlated with land ownership. Intuitively, this makes sense. Animals, like humans, need space to live. Also, cattle feed entails a financial burden. It was 84.4% of a typical AFH’s total expenditure on animal farming in 2018-19. To be sure, not all female cattle and buffalo generates income for the AFH. The SAS found that only 27% of cattle and 37% of buffaloes were giving milk at the time of the survey. Even among female cattle and buffaloes, this figure was 37% and 43%, respectively. This is bound to hurt the net income of such a household. The ownership of in-milk female cattle among OBC and non-SC-ST-OBC households was more than twice that of SC households. Animal farmers are more likely to use poultry than milk for self-consumption Commercial farming is not the driving force behind India’s animal farmers or AFHs. 49% of the value of total value of output is consumed by the household itself. To be sure, the SAS definition of own consumption includes retention for future sale or for use as animal ‘seed’. Also, share of animal output used for self-consumption varies significantly across products. It is around 45% in the case of cattle and buffalo milk, 60% case of poultry, but just 9.9% for fish and nil for live sheep or goat. The regional divide in India’s dairy economy In Gujarat, the home of Amul, which pioneered the cooperative revolution in India’s dairy economy, 64% of the milk produced by AFHs is sold to cooperatives. Gujarat is not the only state where cooperatives have a strong presence in the dairy sector. In Kerala and Karnataka too, around 50% milk is sold to cooperatives. Then there are states such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, where private processors buy more than 40% of the total milk produced. At the other extreme are states like Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand, where neither cooperatives nor private businesses have a strong footprint in the milk economy and 3/4th or more of milk production is consumed within the household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-sas-tell-us-about-india-s-animal-farms-101633876739810.html

10-10-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Dubai showdown for IPL crown; WHO to decide on Covaxin’s emergency use approval||I am still recovering from that Goa-to-Gold Coast delivery by Indian bowler Shikha Pandey that clean bowled Australian batter Alyssa Healy at Carrara on October 9 during a T20I series. You can watch it here at Cricket Australia’s official Twitter account where, surprisingly, it got less than 40,000 views. But at cricket journalist Annesha Ghosh’s account (who also coined the Goa-to-Gold Coast phrase), it received more than 1.5 million views. This monster of an in-swinger, now being described by many experts as the Ball of the Century in women’s cricket, deserves to be seen in a non-stop loop, it’s that beautiful. The Indian team fought valiantly that day, but Australia is the team to beat in women’s cricket. It is more dominant than Steve Waugh’s and Ricky Ponting’s teams were in the men’s version. Here, too, it is quite often India that dented Australian dominance. Which brings us to this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL). It may not have reached the exalted heights of its 2020 edition, but it certainly is one of the most exciting sporting leagues in the world. This Friday, the 2021 final will be played at the Dubai International Stadium. We don’t know the finalists yet, but Mumbai Indians, which has won more IPL trophies than any other team and the champion in both 2019 and 2020, has not even made it to the playoffs this year. This alone makes for an exciting playoff schedule. There are hearts beating in the Indian pharmaceutical firmament as well. The decision on whether to grant emergency use listing to Bharat Biotech’s vaccine against coronavirus disease will be taken by WHO (World Health Organisation) this week. The experts from WHO, and a group of independent experts, are going through the data currently, and are expected to carry out the risk-benefit assessment this week. Once EUL is granted, Covaxin will be eligible for use in low- and middle-income countries under the COVAX facility. It will also bring huge relief to Indian travellers as some countries might recognise Covaxin and allow Indians vaccinated with it to travel, a significant step in our journey to pre-Covid normalcy. What Indians are also looking forward to this week is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of September and Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for the month of August. Both will be released on October 12. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for September will be released on October 14.To be sure, CPI inflation had moderated further from 5.6% in July to 5.3% in August, a four-month low. It had stayed above the upper limit of Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance zone of 2%-6% in May and June. This decrease in inflation is because of food prices, which grew at 5.15% in June, but decreased to 3.96% in July and 3.11% in August. Food has 39% weight in CPI. Non-food inflation increased from 6.7% in July to 6.8% in August.Meanwhile, IIP grew at 11.45% year-on-year in July, but this has to be read with the fact that factories were affected by the lockdown imposed to curb Covid-19 in 2020. IIP was 131.8 in July 2019, but decreased to 117.9 in July 2020. It was 131.4 in July 2021. Unlike retail inflation, WPI inflation did not show a decline in August. August was the fifth consecutive month of double-digit WPI inflation. The 11.4% inflation in August was also slightly higher than the July inflation of 11.2%, although lower than the 13.1% and 12.1% inflation in May and June. These numbers could have an impact on the stock indices, that have moved either sideways or downward this past week, with the BSE closing above the psychological 60,000 mark on Friday. There are a host of company results to be announced this week and the next, and the indices could see significant action. Internationally, the situation in Afghanistan will continue to remain in focus as external affairs minister S Jaishankar makes an official visit to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Armenia during October 10-13. The Central Asian states have been keeping a wary eye on the security situation in Afghanistan and the issue is expected to figure in Jaishankar’s meetings. Minister of state for external affairs Meenakashi Lekhi will visit Serbia during October 10-13 as the special envoy of the prime minister to attend a commemorative meeting marking the 60th anniversary of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). In domestic politics, we have the results of the two-phase local body elections held in nine newly carved districts in Tamil Nadu on October 12. Expelled leader V K Sasikala will be visiting J Jayalalithaa’s memorial on October 16, a day ahead of when the AIADMK celebrates its golden jubilee year. In Assam, Congress leaders and cadres will take part in a three-hour ‘maun vrat’ (vow of silence) on October 11 demanding the sacking of union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni. This is part of the party’s nationwide programme that day. In Kerala, a local court will give its verdict on one of the most intriguing cases of our times – the snake bite murder case – on Monday. A woman was bitten by a cobra let loose by her husband and killed. Her husband and a local snake handler are main accused. For background, read here and here. In Karnataka, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is expected to take a decision on naming district in-charge ministers and help calm soaring tempers in an increasingly tense cabinet. He is expected to find a balance and name a minister in-charge for Bengaluru or decide to retain the post himself like his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa. The bypoll campaign is gathering momentum as all three parties slug it out to secure victories in Hanagal and Sindgi. This is also the first test for chief minister Bommai after he took over the top chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-dubai-showdown-for-ipl-crown-who-to-decide-on-covaxin-s-emergency-use-approval-101633873501182.html

The IMD said these districts will witness a heavy spell of rain between Monday and Wednesday. An orange alert has been sounded in Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki and Ernakulam districts. A yellow alert was issued in four other districts, Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Malappuram and Palakkad. Those who live in low-lying areas, in the vicinity of rivers and hilly areas prone to landslips have been put on high alert. The alert-bound district administrations have been asked to open relief camps if the rain persists and control rooms will be opened in all district headquarters. Fishermen have also been advised not to venture into the sea due to the possibility of strong winds with a speed of 50 km per hour. Usually the IMD sounds a red alert if the rainfall is expected to be more than 20 cm and above in 24 hours and an orange alert if it is between 11 and 20 cm. The state has already crossed the 2000 mm rainfall mark during the current south-west monsoon season. This is the fourth consecutive year the state is surpassing the usual quota of (2000 mm) of rain, IMD data showed.

The agreement was temporarily suspended due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Maldivian foreign minister Abdulla Shahid tweeted on Sunday."Delighted that India has agreed to resume the 2018 Dec Visa Exemption Agreement between the Maldives and India, which was temporarily suspended due to COVID-19 border closure,” Shahid wrote on the microblogging platform.“From 15 Oct 2021, Maldivian Nationals will be exempt from visa requirements for tourists, medical and business purposes," he added. In a subsequent tweet he also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar for considering the Maldivian government’s request to resume the agreement.This move comes as India is gearing up to open up for tourists from October 15 after being closed for a year. The domestic tourism industry has been disproportionately hit by the two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. The sector accounted for about 10 percent of the Indian economy in pre-pandemic years. Maldives on the other hand has remained open for tourists since July 2020.The 2018 visa exemption agreement eases travel for Maldivian nationals to visit India for tourism, business, education, and medical purposes and it also grants Indian employees work permits within 15 days of their arrival and eases visa rules, allowing their visa fees to be paid for by their employers.

10-10-2021||India||Sasikala to visit Jayalalithaa memorial to mark AIADMK’s 50th founding day||All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK) former interim general secretary VK Sasikala, who has been lying low for the past few months, will visit the former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s memorial on the Marina Beach in Chennai on October 16-- a day ahead of the golden jubilee celebration of the founding of the AIADMK-- in what is being considered a politically significant move.This will be Sasikala’s first visit to the memorial after her release from the Parappana Agrahara prison in Bengaluru where she served a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case. “She wasn’t able to do so before because of the previous government closing the memorial and then the pandemic continued with restrictions,” said a Sasikala aide. She is also likely to visit the residence of former chief minister M G Ramachandran (MGR) w ho founded the party in 1972 after splitting from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) under M Karunanidhi.She had visited MGR’s residence on her way back from Bengaluru during a 24-hour road show when she sought to reclaim her position in the AIADMK which is being currently led by her former loyalists turned foes O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami. The duo had expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran and also ordered closure of Jayalalithaa’s memorial just a few days after it was inaugurated with fanfare leading to speculation that it was done to prevent Sasikala’s entry.Before she was sent to the prison in February 2017, Sasikala stopped at Jayalalithaa’s grave, where the mausoleum has come up now, and dramatically thumped her palm to the ground taking a vow.After her release, following staunch opposition by Palaniswami , who was handpicked by Sasikala as the chief minister, Sasikala laid low, delaying her political comeback before the April 6 assembly elections. After AIADMK’s loss, she emerged again with her team releasing her recorded phone conversations with a few members of the AIADMK and a splinter faction founded by Dhinakaran, the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).Also Read: Tamil Nadu CM Stalin distributes welfare aid, maintenance grant to differently abledIn these audio clips, Sasikala repeatedly consoles and assures cadre that she will “set the party right” and re-establish the rule of MGR and Jayalalithaa. The mouthpiece of the AMMK, Dr Namadhu MGR last week published an article that quoted Sasikala saying that, “We would have formed the government, had everyone stayed united.” AMMK was formed with Sasikala’s supporters for the sole purpose of reclaiming the AIADMK. The party, however didn’t win any seat in the assembly elections.Sasikala’s visit to Jayalalithaa’s memorial will be right after the rural local body election results, to be announced on October 12. The two-phase polls to nine newly-carved districts concluded on October 9 in which AMMK contested a few seats but the competition was chiefly between cadres of the ruling DMK and the principal opposition, AIADMK. Political analysts say that if AIADMK performs poorly then Sasikala would want to use their loss to her advantage to project herself as the only saviour of the party. “But Sasikala is a prisoner of her past,” says political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “Palaniswami and Panneerselvam will never give up their right over the two-leaves symbol and authority over the party. They will not admit her in the AIADMK where they were subordinates to her once. Now, she has no room in the party. She has a Herculean task of proving her strength.”Since her release Sasikala has been a threat to the AIADMK’s current leadership and Palaniswami has staunchly opposed any truck with her while Panneerselvam, who has been sidelined, was often seen softening his stance towards her.In a statement, AIADMK’s leadership has urged the party cadre to celebrate the historic golden jubilee by following Covid-19 safety norms. Starting from October 17, when it turns 50, the party plans to hold a yearlong celebration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-to-visit-jayalalithaa-memorial-to-mark-aiadmk-s-50th-founding-day-101633867138298.html

The minister also said that the coal dispatches would increase in the coming days because of the withdrawal of monsoon.He made the remarks in a tweet following a review meeting regarding the coal production and supply situation in the country.Joshi said that Coal India Ltd currently has 43 million tonnes (430 lakh tonnes) of coal stock which would be sufficient to meet 24 days of demand. “Assuring everyone that there is absolutely no threat of disruption in power supply. There is sufficient coal stock of 43 million tonnes with @CoalIndiaHQ (Coal India) equivalent to 24 days of coal demand,” he tweeted.Reviewed coal production & supply situation in the country.Assuring everyone that there is absolutely no threat of disruption in power supply. There is sufficient coal stock of 43 million tonnes with @CoalIndiaHQ equivalent to 24 days coal demand. pic.twitter.com/frskcJY3UmFurther, the minister also asked people to not fall for fear mongering as the supply of coal is expected to increase following the monsoon’s withdrawal.“Thermal power plants have rolling stock being replenished with daily supply. Moreover, with the withdrawal of monsoons, coal despatches are set to rise in the coming days thereby increasing coal stocks. Reiterating, there is sufficient coal stock, do not fall for fear mongering,” he said in a subsequent tweet.Earlier in the day, the Union ministry of coal said in a statement that any fear about the disruption of power supply was “entirely misplaced” and the coal stock at power plants was at 72 lakh tonnes which was sufficient to meet four days of requirement.Also read | 'Acts of irresponsible behaviour creating panic': Power minister refutes reports of coal shortageThe ministry further said that the domestic coal based power generation grew by nearly 24% this year, till September 2021, based on a robust supply from the coal companies. Also, the average daily coal requirement at the power plants was about 18.5 Lakh tonnes and the daily supply was around 17.5 lakh tonnes, the ministry added.“Due to extended monsoons the despatches were constrained. The coal available at the power plants is a rolling stock which gets replenished by the supplies from the coal companies on a daily basis. Therefore, any fear of coal stocks depleting at the power plant end is erroneous. In fact this year, domestic coal supply has substituted imports by a substantial measure,” the ministry added.Union power minister RK Singh too, on Sunday, denied any possibilities of a power crisis in the country. “In effect, neither there was, nor was there any crisis. It was created unnecessarily. I've warned Tata Power CEO of action if they send baseless SMSs to customers that can create panic. Messages by GAIL & Tata Power qualify as acts of irresponsible behaviour,” news agency ANI quoted the minister as saying after he met with the officials of power ministry, BSES and Tata Power at this residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-threat-of-power-supply-disruption-coal-india-has-stock-to-meet-24-days-of-demand-says-union-coal-minister-pralhad-joshi-101633864009667.html

The Rajasthan Police have arrested four persons and detained one minor in the case. On Sunday, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati asked why the Congress high command was “silent” on the suspected lynching of a Dalit man. “The lynching of a Dalit in Hanumangarh is very sad and condemnable, but why is the Congress high command silent? Will the chief ministers of Chhattisgarh and Punjab go there and give ₹50 lakh each to the victim’s family? BSP wants answers or else stop shedding crocodile tears in the name of Dalits,” she tweeted. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha MP, Kirodi Lal Meena said the murder of a Dalit youth following “merciless beating” was a horrific example of “misgovernance” by the Congress government. “It is unfortunate that the head of the state is only trying to save his chair, while there are continuous atrocities on the poor, farmers, women, and Dalits in the state. If the accused are not arrested then I will reach Hanumangarh and bring justice to the victim’s family,” he said in a statement. Hanumangarh’s superintendent of police Preeti Jain said of the eight identified accused, four have been arrested and one has been detained as he was a minor. Efforts were being made to nab the rest, she said.The dharna staged by victims and social organisations outside the government hospital has been called off after assurance of speedy arrest of the accused involved in the act. The body of the deceased was handed over to the family and it has been cremated. According to the police, Jagdish Meghwal was thrashed by the accused on October 7 with sticks till his death. He was lynched allegedly over his relationship with a woman and the culprits shot a video of his brutal killing. Jagdish’s body was later dumped outside his residence.Earlier, Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat too hit out at the Congress-led state government for keeping “silent” on the matter while protesting against the incident of violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. “Rahul ji, don’t worry about Lakhimpur where Yogi ji is in the government and not you dear Gehlot ji. Show some courage to speak about the murder of a Dalit youth in Prempura of Rajasthan so that people get to know how truthful you are?” he said in a Twitter post in Hindi.

Targeting the BJP, she said the party should introspect how the state’s law and order was during their regime. She asked the leaders of the saffron brigade to also “show concern” on the Lakhimpur Kheeri incident where 4 farmers were run over by a cavalcade allegedly led by an SUV driven by Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son, Ashish Mishra, last Sunday. The farmers lynched four persons who were travelling in the caravan in retaliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsp-chief-mayawati-questions-congress-on-dalit-man-s-lynching-in-rajasthan-101633864918145.html

Most of those who tested positive for the virus are under trial prisoners arrested in recent months as part of the new Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government’s special campaign against illegal drugs since May. “88 prisoners, 80 men and 8 women, who tested positive in September alone are drug users who got infected due to use of the same syringe among several users or from the same source,” Dr LC Nath, superintendent of Nagaon Bhogeswari Phukanani Civil Hospital. The fresh detection of HIV cases in Nagaon comes after 27 youths were found positive for the virus in neighbouring Marigaon district. According to a report by Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS) released last month, the state has 19,545 HIV positive cases. “The under trial prisoners who were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, were found positive during a special screening by ASACS,” said Arup Patangia, superintendent of Nagaon special jail which houses inmates from neighbouring Hojai district as well. “Most of those found positive are in the 18-38 years age group. Apart from being peddlers, these inmates are drugs addicts as well and were infected prior to their arrests and didn’t get the virus as a result of using drugs inside the jail,” he added. Of the total cases, 45 were found in special jail and the rest in Nagaon central jail. Jail authorities informed that most of those found positive last month were already out on bail and only 32 remaining were lodged at present in both jails. “These under trial prisoners who were found positive were kept away from the convicted inmates and their treatment has begun,” said Abani Kumar Muktiar, superintendent of Nagaon central jail. Also Read | Centre exploring methods to expand telecom network in the northeast: MinisterA senior prison department official said that following the state government’s drive against illicit drugs, a HIV screening drive is underway in most prisons where arrested drug peddlers are being kept. “Our department is conducting the screening in association with the health departments and ASACS. Few more HIV positives cases among those arrested under NDPS Act have been found in some other jails as well. Proper counselling and treatment of those inmates is underway,” said Barnali Sharma, inspector general of prisons, Assam. Illegal drugs worth around ₹200 crore have been recovered and nearly 2000 persons involved in the drug trade have been arrested across Assam since May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88-under-trial-prisoners-test-positive-for-hiv-in-2-assam-jails-101633862577669.html

But why? In his application, deputy engineer Rajkumar Yadav explained in detail that he wants to embark on the religious journey to erase his ego, the realisation that dawn upon him after he suddenly had a flashback of his last birth, Livehindustan reported. The story does not end here. The engineer also receives a reply from his senior who says that the journey to erase one's ego should begin by not thinking that he can spend his Sundays the way he wants.In his previous life, as the engineer describes, he was a character of the Mahabharata, with Hyderabad MP Asaduddhin Owaisi being his friend Nakul and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was the 'Shakuni mama'. He wrote he wants to know more about his past life and that's why he wants to study Gita. On Sunday, he will go begging, he wrote expecting that his senior will grant him leave on Sundays.The reply to the bizarre leave application has also gone vial with Janpad Panchayat CEO Parag Panthi advising him to work on Sunday to erase his ego, instead of begging. He wrote in his reply that the very thought that one can spend his Sundays the way he wants is egoistic thinking. Extending his support to the deputy engineer's endeavour, his senior said he will help him destroy his ego by making him work on Sundays.“Dear deputy engineer, you want to erase your ego, it is a matter of great happiness. To this end, our cooperation can help you achieve your goal. A person is often egotistical and thinks that he can spend his Sundays at will. Destroying this ego from its roots is indispensable for your progress. Therefore, keeping in view your desire for spiritual progress, you are ordered to work every Sunday by being present in the office, so that your ego of celebrating Sunday as a holiday can be destroyed,” Parag Panthi wrote in reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owaisi-friend-of-past-life-mohan-bhagwat-shakuni-engineer-wants-sundays-off-101633861227869.html

This country is yours. If you are not aware, you will not be able to save your own country, and yourself. You have made this country.”Also read | Priyanka picks up broom again at Valmiki temple, says it’s a message to YogiBeginning her speech with a recital of shlokas, the Gandhi scion said, “Today is the fourth day of Navratra.

As this is the time of Navratra, I thought of speaking of my heart with all of you.”The gathering was earlier addressed by Congress' Uttar Pradesh unit head Ajay Kumar Lallu and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.Vadra, who was detained for more than a day last week on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri where some farmers and a local journalist among others were killed in violent clashes on October 3, said this country was about faith. Here, farmers feed the citizens, and their sons protect the country’s borders. “But when some of them got killed in Lakhimpuri Kheri, their families lost hope for justice.”Around the same time the PM came to Uttar Pradesh to attend some celebratory events, but he did not have the time to meet the aggrieved families, the Congress leader added.Stating that her fight for justice would continue until Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni was suspended, she said the junior home minister’s son (Ashish Mishra) had trampled over protesting farmers, but he was sent an invitation for interrogation. “The chief minister (Yogi Adityanath) is protecting him... What is this?”Also read | Union minister's son Ashish Mishra arrested in Lakhimpur Kheri violence caseShe said Modi did not have time to speak to farmers who had been protesting for almost a year against the three centrally passed agri laws.“The farmers are protesting against the three laws because they know their land will be snatched, if three agri laws were implemented, by the corporate friend of Modi,” Vadra added.Exhorting people to fight for their rights, she said those “who call you andolankari (protesters) and terrorists, force them to give justice. We are the workers of the Congress. We are scared of anyone. Put us in jail, beat us, but we will fight for justice.”“If you want to bring a change, come with me, struggle together and change this government. I will not stop until I bring change here,” she added.Vadra also targeted Modi over growing inflation and rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas. She said unemployment was at its peak“People are angry and upset with the government due to these problems. But when people are losing their jobs and small businesses are shutting down, the PM’s rich friends are making billions of money.”She said the PM bought two planes for himself that cost ₹8,000 crore. “And, then Modi sold off Air India for ₹18,000 crore,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobody-is-safe-in-this-country-will-not-stop-until-change-happens-priyanka-101633860043947.html

I believe that Kashmiris will expose the elements who are trying to divide Kashmiri society on communal lines,” the Army officer was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The remark by the top Army officer comes three days after gunmen killed the principal and a teacher of a government-run school in Srinagar's historical old town Eidgah. Two days before the Eidgah shooting, terrorists gunned down three other people, including a prominent Srinagar-based pharmacist, in three separate incidents.Last Tuesday, terrorists belonging to an outfit affiliated to Lashkar-e-Taiba killed three people, including a prominent pharmacist, in three separate incidents.The deceased included Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and the owner of one of the most popular medical stores in Srinagar, Bindroo Medicate. He was shot dead at his shop in Srinagar's Iqbal Park area.The terrorists then killed a street vendor from Bihar, identified as Virender Paswan, near Madina Chowk in Lalbazar and a taxi driver, Mohd Shafi Lone, in a separate incident at Naidkhai in Bandipora district.The Indian Army launched a massive search operation in Uri last month, after it detected suspicious movement along the Line of Control on the intervening night of September 18 and 19. Three terrorists were killed during their infiltration bid.Earlier in June, Lt Gen Pandey hinted at the possibility of Pakistan-aided terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish –e- Mohammed behind the drone attack on an Indian Air Force base in Jammu.

10-10-2021||India||Ample supply of coal, fears of power supply disruption unfounded: Ministry||Amid concerns over coal shortage that may severely affect power supply in certain parts of the country, the Centre said on Sunday there was ample supply of the mineral to meet all demands and fears of electricity disruption were entirely misplaced.In a statement, the Union ministry of coal said there was a stock of about 72 lakh tonnes, which was sufficient for four days. Also, Coal India Limited (CIL) has more than 400 lakh tonnes of stock, which is being supplied to the power plants.At the same time, Union coal minister Pralhad Joshi said there was absolutely no threat of disruption in power supply. “There is sufficient coal stock of 43 million tonnes with Coal India Ltd equivalent to 24 days of coal demand,” he added.Earlier, Union power minister RK Singh hit out at companies that sent “baseless SMSs” to customers and created panic about a power crisis and warned that such acts would be treated as instances of “irresponsible behaviour”.Also read | Amid warning of power crisis due to coal shortage, Centre lists 4 reasonsThe ministry said the domestic coal-based power generation has grown by nearly 24 per cent this year (till September 2021) based on a robust supply from the coal companies. The daily average coal requirement at the power plants was about 18.5 lakh tonnes of coal per day, while the daily coal supply had been around 17.5 lakh tonnes, it said.The ministry further said there were constraints in despatches due to the extended monsoons. Coal available at the power plants is a rolling stock which gets replenished by supplies from companies on a daily basis.“Therefore, any fear of coal stocks depleting at the power plant end is erroneous. In fact this year, domestic coal supply has substituted imports by a substantial measure,” the ministry said in a statement.Also read | These states may soon face a 'blackout' as coal demands surgeThe ministry also said that despite heavy rainfall in the coalfield areas, the CIL had supplied more than 255 MT coal to the power sector this year, which is the highest ever H-1 supply from CIL to the power sector.“Out of the total coal supply from all sources, present coal supply from CIL to power sector is more than 14 lakh tonnes per day and with the receding rains, this supply has already increased to 15 lakh tonnes and is set to increase to more than 16 lakh tonnes per day by the end of October 2021. The supply from SCCL and captive coal blocks shall contribute to another 3 lakh plus tonnes of coal every day,” the statement read.Stating that coal supplies were likely to set a record high in the current financial year, the ministry said, “Domestic coal supplies have supported power generation in a major way despite heavy monsoons, low coal imports and a steep hike in power demand due to economic recovery.”Due to high international prices of coal, supply of power even under PPAs by import based power plants has reduced by almost 30 per cent, while domestic-based power supply has gone up nearly 24 per cent in the first half of the year. The imported coal-based power plants have generated about 25.6 BU against a programme of 45.7 BU.It may be noted that the comfortable coal position in the country is reflected by the fact that the CIL has been supplying more than 2.5 lakh tonnes (approximately) daily to meet the demand of non power industries like aluminum, cement, steel along with supply of coal to thermal plants of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ample-supply-of-coal-fears-of-power-supply-disruption-unfounded-ministry-101633857842019.html

Messages by GAIL and Tata Power qualify as acts of irresponsible behaviour,” he said, adding that “neither there was, nor there is any crisis. It was created unnecessarily.”The minister met officials from BSES, Delhi’s power ministry, and Tata power at his residence on Sunday to talk about the issue of coal shortage in power plants. He told reporters that the GAIL CMD was asked to continue supplying the required amount of gas to power plants across the country, and that GAIL has “assured” him that supplies will continue.Also Read: Andhra Pradesh power plants running out of coal stocks, CM sends SOS to PM ModiSingh also hit out at Congress for their remarks on the reported coal shortage, alleging that “the Congress party has run out of ideas. They are running out of votes and therefore they are running out of ideas as well.”Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain had warned residents of an acute coal shortage in thermal power plants across the country and cautioned that the national capital had enough coal stocks to last one more day. "There is an acute shortage of coal in coal-fired power plants across the country. There is only one day's stock left in the plants from which Delhi gets electricity, there is no coal at all," Jain told reporters on Saturday.Following which Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to the Prime Minister urging for his intervention in ensuring power plants supplying electricity to Delhi have access to sufficient quantities of coal and gas.The CEO of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) Ganesh Srinivasan warned on Saturday that the national capital might witness intermittent and rotational load shedding in the coming days as coal-based power stations are left with coal stocks that will last one-two days.Both Jain and Srinivasan’s warnings came after the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) released a report claiming that of the 135 power plants it monitors across the country, 64 non-pithead power plants (plants located 1500 kms away from coal mines) are left with coal stocks for less than four days of supply.Singh refuted these claims insisting that the demand for coal is actually a sign of the economy recovering after the brutal second wave brought things to a standstill.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-minister-refutes-reports-of-coal-shortage-101633856449954.html
10-10-2021||India||How does PM Modi take a decision? 'Not seen a listener like him,' says Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah was asked whether PM Modi takes a decision in an autocratic way. "I have never seen a listener like Modi ji. In whatever meeting it is, he speaks the least and listens patiently to every one. He gives importance to the suggestion of every person based on the basis of quality," Amit Shah said in his interview to Sansad TV, which was telecast on Sunday.On the occasion of 20 years of Narendra Modi in political office, Union minister Amit Shah, in his interview, said there is no blame that has not been imposed on PM Modi, but PM Modi has overcome all this because all opposition strengthens PM Modi, as he had the confidence of the people. "The public knows that the decision Modiji takes is for the country. He has nothing to gain from that. Hence, even if there has been any mistake, the public forgave him," Amit Shah said."No Indian Prime Minister has said ever that India has the courage to become a five trillion-dollar economy. Today our economy ranks 6th from 11th and will become 5th soon. I have the confidence that India will soon become a five trillion-dollar economy," Amit Shah said.During the interview, Amit Shah said PM Modi's political life can be divided into three parts -- first his initial days in the organisation, second, after he became the chief minister of Gujarat and third, his entry to national politics. "Modiji strengthened the party in Gujarat through his hard work, planning and determined implementation," he said adding how Bhuj rose from the ashes of the earthquake, but Latur could not.Listing out PM Modi's initiatives, reforms in the last seven years, Amit Shah said PM Modi took bold decision regarding economic reforms. On farmers' protest, he said the concerns are unfounded and the three laws are aimed at helping the farmers."Leftist ideology is not for the welfare of the poor, I am sorry to say. This is only a way to capitalise the resentment of the poor to capture power. Otherwise, what explains the situation of the Left-ruled states?" Amit Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-does-pm-modi-take-a-decision-not-seen-a-listener-like-him-says-amit-shah-101633856012693.html
10-10-2021||India||From drugs to porn cases, Shatrughan Sinha opens up about Bollywood's silence||With a series of controversies surrounding the film industry, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who featured in the latest edition of The Interview with Hindustan Times’ Kumkum Chadha, spoke on why heavyweights choose to remain silent instead of taking a stand. ExcerptsOn one hand, there is a furore on what Javed Akhtar said about Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Taliban and on the other there is complete silence on the Raj Kundra-Shilpa Shetty case. Why these double standards?People belonging to the film industry are wise, nice and simple people. I am not their spokesman. If they want to speak…well, fine. If they don't want to speak, no problem. Why do we expect them to speak on every matter? Sometimes this happens because they are very close to the people concerned. They find it a little awkward. Sometimes they do not want to comment because they think this might lead to some undesirable controversy. So, if they want to speak, they come forward and those who do not want to come forward, you can't say they are engaging in double standards, or they are scared. How does it matter?It matters because it is an overview situation. There is pornography, there are drugs, there used to be casting couch syndrome etc. So somewhere the impression is that Bollywood is a dirty place. The clean people there, like you and some of the others, are silent when these wrongdoings go on. So, I think that is probably the issue. If there is mudslinging or if there are these wrongdoings then why don't some of them come out and condemn those black sheep which are tainting the entire industry?Why do they expect only from the film industry people? Do these only happen in the film industry? Does it not happen in the corporate or political corridors? It happens everywhere. But since the film industry seems to be the favourite whipping horse, beat it as much as you want as it is weak. They are businessmen in true sense, they are scared…whichever government is there…they don't want to go against it. As far as I am concerned, I only speak when I am spoken to. It is not that I start speaking on every issue like there are few people in politics who speak on every issue.Will the government tackle the repercussions if a person from Bollywood says something? In such cases, our people have to bear the brunt. There have been protests outside their houses. So, they say let's not do it…When you talk about casting couch or drugs, you judge any industry by majority. Have you heard anything of this sort about the late Dilp Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Dev Anand or me? There are certain incidents and these are all accusations, nothing has been proved yet. So, this is important to understand. Out of many good things, there is just one single flaw in the film industry. It is not united; it does not have a platform of its own. There should be an attitude of gratitude but at times selfish attitudes can be seen here.That's exactly my point. Self-centred and I would use the word ‘selfish’ and living for themselves and this indicates that when something happens, they do not come out.First of all, there is no proper association so it becomes a difficult task coordinating with everybody. Secondly, there is no platform where we can talk. Many do not have the courage to debate, so they remain silent or hesitate or feel embarrassed if something happens. They try to distance themselves. There is a need for unity and understanding. If we all become united then it will be great.You are also saying the same thing and substantiating what I am saying. A sad commentary on the film industry and the kind of people who the world or at least the youth look up to shouldn't then set an example rather than a bad example?It's very unfortunate. I may not conclude this matter to the extent where you may like me to conclude. But I hope, wish and pray that my viewpoint is being understood by all. Substantiating in the sense that I say that it's very unfortunate but I have also said this is not only in the film industry, what about the sports industry. If it is about their own leader, then they will come forward and speak. But it is not right to expect from all.Fair enough but senior actors like you, Mt Amitabh Bachchan …people look up to you to take the lead because you have represented the industry for decades. They want you to take the lead and say this far and no further. So this impression goes that they are all thick as thieves, which is damaging for the industry also.It is possible to some extent. You won't expect from those who are seen with the government or are seen being scared from the government. But people have seen that I have called spade a spade but you can't expect this from our friends. They are seen with the government…their so-called lobbying is somewhere else. So, this is too much to expect from them. So in such a situation, we don't blame them. It is better to remain silent than to make an issue out of it.What do they have to fear? They are successful and not dependent on the government for anything. So, to say that actors are scared is really not something which one would expect from them.You answered my question. They are scared because they are successful. Not saying anything at all is better than saying something controversial. At times being silent also shows acts of prudence.Amitabh Bachchan is always a mute spectator to the wrong things which are going on.Well, I won't say much on this. A public figure must know how to behave in public.To be a mute spectator?You focus on his behaviour, his public conduct.If you don't cross the line, then these things will obviously come in questionI am there to cross the line. He is a friend…I do it on everybody's behalf.Why have you been silent on many wrongdoings of the film industry? Yours have been an unblemished career and maybe you are not scared of the government too, so maybe it was easy for you. So, be it drugs, Raj Kundra pornography case or casting couch syndrome, why didn't you take the lead? You said there is no platform. Why did you then not take the lead being fearless, being in politics and being a veteran? And take people like Mr Amitabh Bachchan and some of the others along to tell the younger stars that this far and no further? Or condemn that section which was tainting the entire industry?The direction of talks changes when we say thus far and no further. Many people haven't spoken on Raj Kundra. There are many obvious reasons. Me and my family are very fond of Shilpa Shetty or for that matter Shilpa Shetty's mother. I don't know Raj Kundra ji very well. I just know he is Shilpa Shetty's husband…this doesn't mean I consider him good or bad. The matter is in court. Before we could speak anything, the matter was in court already. So, it is not right to say something now.I had raised my voice against the underworld. I had said this is wrong. There is nothing clear in the drug case now. The images of Dev Anand, Amitabh Bachchan, Jitendra or me are not tainted. I am talking about the majority.There is one well-known actor who said, "Maal chahiye”. People look up to her films. So, what kind of an example does this set?If this is true, then such things should not happen at all. This is absolutely wrong.The new generation actors are undoing whatever your struggles have been.We can suggest counselling to those who are newcomers. Punishment should be given to those who are experts in this field so that they are deterrent to others.What have the senior people like you done on the ground? Don't you think the majority has failed the people? If a well-known actor is consuming drugs, then the younger generation today who watch these films say if they can do it why not us? So, your responsibility is much bigger.I don't agree with you on this. One should see if these issues are genuine or something to divert attention.There are enough video tapes where you see that these people are coming out from parties in drug stateI have said this is wrong. I used to drink but I quit drinking years ago. Jitendra, Amitabh Bachchan used to drink/smoke, they have quit years back.The younger generations have started consuming drugs nowThese are all new habits of the youth. They will sooner understand. I am sure they will see other people and understand.Between Mr Amitabh Bachchan being a mute spectator and Mr Javed Akhtar shooting off his mouth, what is your advice to each of them?Both of them are very dear to me. I am very fond of them. There will be conflict of interest. Both me and the society respect them a lot. So they can answer this better and I am sure they are capable of handling the situation.Are you considering or would you ever consider going back to your parent party which is the BJP?I haven't got any such proposal and I haven't given any such proposal to anybody. I have moved forward. I have no interest or intention. People say politics is an art of possibilities. One can't say what will happen tomorrow, but today I can surely say neither I have any intention nor I am interested.If a proposal from the BJP comes, would you consider it?This question is hypothetical. If they send a proposal and if they feel they have done something wrong, which should not have happened, then I can consider.At one point, you praised the government and you said, “Tremendous efforts in fighting the pandemic”. Are you serious Mr Sinha? People were dying by the minute, there was no oxygen and you were saying “tremendous efforts”?I agree with you whole-heartedly with the second part of your question. Yes, I did say that because I also got carried away at that time but the reality came out to be something else. I feel India could have made a name in such a situation but unfortunately, we were humiliated in this regard.Your wife Poonam ji is richer than you and you owe money to your daughter. Is that true?She is my wife and I am working for her. It's good if she is richer than me. It is the time of women empowerment. Maybe our daughter is also richer than me. If I owe money to my daughter, I will try to repay it.You are an actor and a politician. In your view, which is murkier…politics or Bollywood?It's more when it comes to power game. Politics is murkier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-drugs-to-porn-cases-shatrughan-sinha-opens-up-about-bollywood-s-silence-101633845847932.html
10-10-2021||India||Shiv Sena likens Priyanka to Indira, says she’s charged up party||Shvi Sena has likened Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi to her grandmother and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, claiming she “exposed” an “attempted cover-up” of the Lakhimpur Khiri violence and one could witness shades of Indira Gandhi in her actions. In his weekly column Rokthok in party mouthpiece Saamana,Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut also said that Priyanka’s brother and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi was the only leader who could provide an alternative to the current dispensation in New Delhi. Raut also dismissed the Aam Admi Party (AAP) and the Trinmool Congress (TMC) as “spoilsports” who were likely to end up helping the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The Yogi government faces one of the biggest challenges due to this [Lakhimpur Khiri] killings. When Priyanka Gandhi was going to meet the kin of the dead farmers, she was illegally stopped. The way she protested her detention by the police was commendable. She played a major role in awakening the nation about the gruesome murders,” said Raut. He was referring to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s arrest at Sitarpur en route to Lakhimpur Kheri where 4 farmers were mowed down last Sunday by a cavalcade of three vehicles linked to Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra. In retaliation, angry farmers lynched four members of the convoy. Following a political uproar over the incident and politicians from rival political parties wanting to visit Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the aggrieved farmers, the Uttar Pradesh government imposed Section 144 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) prohibiting assembly of more than 4 people at a time in the district. Priyanka Gandhi dodged the UP Police to reach Sitapur but was arrested there for violating prohibitory orders. She was finally allowed to visit the farmers after spending two days at a state guest house. Also Read: Have sought audience with President Kovind on Lakhimpur Kheri case, tweets Congress. Then hits deleteRaut said her rivals took notice of the support she received in Sitapur and the images of her cleaning the floor of the rest house with a broom overshadowed the one-day photo session by “some politicians”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was participating in programme to commemorate the 75th year of independence in Lucknow along with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath last Tuesday.Raut drew parallel with Indira Gandhi’s arrest on October 3 1977 by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on charges of corruption only a couple of months after her August visit to Bihar to commiserate with the victims of Belchi massacre (May 27) received great response, laying the foundation for her return to power in 1980 Lok Sabha polls. Raut also went on to describe his Tuesday meeting with Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress leader was committed to fighting the Narendra Modi led Central government. “Rahul Gandhi started his discussion by saying that the present government was all out to destroy democracy in this country and he would fight against these actions,” said Raut. Raut said that Rahul added that he and Priyanka were not worried about getting jailed. “Rahul told me that Priyanka was a brave woman and he was going to Lucknow the next day and was not worried about getting arrested,” he added.The BJP described the Saamana editorial as a desperate attempt to keep the Congress in good humour. “The Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray opposed Congress all his life and here we have his son Uddhav literally bending backwards [to please the Congress] to remain in power. Uddhav Thackeray has been a failure as the chief minister and instead of pointing fingers at Uttar Pradesh, he should ideally be concentrating on Maharashtra which is in bad shape due to his misgovernance,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-likens-priyanka-to-indira-says-she-s-charged-up-party-101633852496204.html

We must not put petty political gains above national unity,” Varun Gandhi said.An attempt to turn #LakhimpurKheri into a Hindu vs Sikh battle is being made. Not only is this an immoral & false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault-lines & reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal.We must not put petty political gains above national unityOn Thursday, Varun Gandhi, the BJP MP from Pilibhit constituency in Uttar Pradesh said, "The video is crystal clear. Protestors can't be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer.”At least eight people, including four farmers and a local journalist, died last Sunday during a violence that ensued at a rally of protesting farmers.A 29-second video of Sunday’s violence surfaced in which an SUV could be seen ploughing through protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. The SUV reportedly belonged to the convoy of Ajay Kumar Mishra who was travelling to receive Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.However, hours after Varun Gandhi shared a video on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence demanding accountability, the parliamentarian and his mother Maneka Gandhi’s names were found missing from the party’s national executive committee list that was released by national president JP Nadda.ALSO READ | What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri: Sequence of events according to both sidesWhile four farmers died after the convoy allegedly mowed down protesters opposing the deputy chief minister’s visit, the other four people, reportedly BJP members, were allegedly thrashed to death.

The minister and his son, however, denied the claims even as an FIR has been registered against Ashish.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, too, slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre for its “silence” over the violence in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri. He also called for immediate removal of Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra, whose son Ashish was allegedly in the SUV that mowed down the protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempts-on-to-turn-lakhimpur-violence-into-hindu-vs-sikh-battle-varun-gandhi-101633849123379.html

Petrol was priced at ₹109.83 a litre on Saturday in the city. Fuel prices have been raised on all six consecutive days up to October 10. Mumbai on Saturday became the first metro city in the country to see diesel prices cross the ₹100 per litre mark after fuel prices were hiked again.Fuel prices had last dropped in the city at the beginning of September. On 31 August, a litre of petrol was priced at ₹107.52 while one litre of diesel was available at ₹96.48. On September 1, the prices dropped marginally to ₹107.39 for a litre of petrol and ₹96.33 a litre for diesel. Prices further dropped on September 5 when petrol was available for ₹107.26 and diesel for ₹96.19. Petrol crossed the ₹100 per litre mark in Mumbai on May 29.Also Read | Mumbai mega block: Local train services on these lines to be affectedAfter Mumbai and Hyderabad, diesel rates crossed the ₹100 per litre mark in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, and in the Union Territory of Leh.

Bhopal, Raipur and Jaipur are other state capitals where diesel is above that mark, according to a PTI report.Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.State-owned fuel retailers have since Wednesday started passing on the larger incidence of cost to consumers.

10-10-2021||India||These states may soon face a 'blackout' as coal demands surge||India is facing a coal shortage following a sharp rise in the demand for importing power-generation fuels, such as coal, as the economy jumped-started again with the ebbing coronavirus pandemic. And, with the rising demand, the international prices of such fuels also shot up. As a result, India—the world’s second-highest importer, producer and consumer of coal—may face a potential blackout across the country. Many generation units are running coal as low as two days.Here is a list of states facing an acute coal shortage:Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal shot a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday over "a power crisis". "I am personally keeping a close watch over the situation. We are trying our best to avoid it," Kejriwal said in a tweet. Meanwhile, a Tata Power spokesperson said that they have stopped generation in Mundra as the high cost of imported coal is “making it impossible to supply under present PPA terms”.Rajasthan: Rajasthan is facing power outages on a daily basis. The state government has announced that it is resorting to one hour scheduled power cuts on a daily basis to tide over the power crisis.Punjab: Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi asked the Centre to immediately increase the state’s coal supply as per quota to meet the demands against a power crisis that could potentially cause a shutdown of its thermal plants due to the depleting coal reserves. An official of the Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) told news agency PTI that two units each at Talwandi Sabo power plant, Ropar plant and one unit at the Lehra Mohabbat, 475 MW plant have been shut. The state has already been experiencing at least 3-4 hours of power cuts on a regular basis.Tamil Nadu: The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) said it suspended power supply in parts of Chennai to carry out maintenance work in the city.Andhra Pradesh: In Andhra Pradesh too, acute supply shortfalls were pushing the state towards unscheduled power cuts, adding that crops could dry up if there is no electricity to power irrigation pumps. "More water is required in the last stage of harvesting and if it is denied, fields would dry up and farmers stand to lose," Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said in a letter to the Prime Minister.Meanwhile, neighbouring Telangana Genco officials claimed that they have sufficient coal reserves for the next one week to 10 days. Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha have also been facing an acute energy crunch due to the coal shortage. In Odisha, the industry was facing a coal shortage and had petitioned the state government to ensure an adequate supply of the fuel.An inter-ministerial sub-group led by the Union ministry of power has been monitoring the coal stock situation twice a week. The ministry on Friday issued guidelines for ensuring optimum utilisation of generating stations as per the requirements in the Electricity Grid. Officials have said these guidelines will enable imported coal-based plants with sufficient coal operate and ease out the burden on domestic coal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-states-may-soon-face-a-blackout-as-coal-demands-surge-101633844669042.html
10-10-2021||India||Hot Springs conflict: What India and China are discussing in 13th round of LAC talks||India and China are holding the 13th round of negotiations on Sunday to cool tensions down the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Officials familiar with the development told Hindustan Times on the condition of anonymity earlier this week that problems at Hot Springs, or Patrol Point-15, are likely to come up in Sunday's discussions, which began at 10:30am in Moldo (Chusul) on the Chinese side of the LAC. The ANI news agency also reported citing officials in the know that the resolution of the friction point at Hot Springs will be discussed during the talks on October 10.13th round of Corps Commander level talks between India and China started at 10:30 am to resolve the ongoing military stand-off along the line of actual control in eastern Ladakh: Army SourcesWhat is the dispute over Hot Springs point?Hot Springs, traditionally known as Kyam, is a campsite and the location of an Indian border check-post – Patrol Point-15 – at the Chang Chenmo river valley in Ladakh near the contested border with China. The spot was so named due to the presence of a hot spring in the area; it is one of the four points where the Indian and Chinese armies went face-to-face back during the standoff in May 2020.The three other points of friction are Patrol Point-17A near the Gogra Post, Patrol Point-14 in Galwan Valley, and the northern bank of Pangong Tso. Chinese troops had crossed over the contested border across all these points and positioned themselves in Indian territory. Since then, a series of talks have been held among top military negotiators deployed by New Delhi and Beijing to resolve the friction. The meeting, currently ongoing, is part of the 13th round of these talks.What were the developments in the last round of talks?After the last round of talks – the 12th in the series of negotiations held on August 2 – the Indian and Chinese troops pulled back from the Patrol Point-17A near the Gogra Post, the second such disengagement this year. In mid-February, the two countries agreed to withdraw troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector in Ladakh.Meanwhile, the Indian Army's General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Saturday that if the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre, so will the Indian troops. He was referring to the massive military buildup and infrastructure development by the Chinese army across the LAC.“It is a matter of concern that the large-scale buildup that occurred last year (when the border row erupted) continues to be in place," the chief of the army staff told HT on the eve of the 13th round of talks. “To sustain that kind of buildup, there has been an equal amount of infrastructure development on the Chinese side. It means that they are there to stay. But if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too,” Gen Naravane added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hot-springs-conflict-what-india-and-china-are-discussing-in-13th-round-of-lac-talks-101633841831640.html
10-10-2021||India||Global shipping crisis sparks trade chaos, how will it impact India||Apple Inc. takes, on a cumulative basis, a month’s worth of shipping time to source all 34 major components and 100s of other small parts for an iPhone from nearly 200 suppliers located across the world. It then sells these to one of its largest contract manufacturers, Taiwanese maker Foxconn, in China’s Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou facility, which churns out over 300 iPhones a minute, sells the finished products to resellers around the world using different shipping lines. According to data from the World Economic Forum, 80% of global trade by volume are carried by sea this way. A global shipping slowdown has currently sparked a trade chaos, throwing off gear delivery timelines of critical raw material, intermediate goods and finished items. Advanced economies are witnessing labour shortages because the pandemic shrunk the labour force putting pressure on global supply chains. The supply knots are forecast to impact manufacturing output in Asia’s third-largest economy, much like elsewhere. Close to vaccinating a billion people and witnessing a surge in demand amid a festival season, India is a net importer of many things, such as petroleum, electronics components, semi-conductors, active pharmaceutical ingredients and fertilisers. Here’s how the shipping crisis built up One half of the world comprising western economies, which are the biggest recipients of coronavirus vaccines, have opened up faster than the other half, including countries where much of the world’s factories are located and aren’t able to match the demand surge in developed economies. Trouble first began in June when the Ever Given, a 20,124 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit is a measure of volume in units of twenty-foot long containers) container giant, got wedged in the Suez Canal for nearly a week, delaying hundreds of ships between Asia and Europe. That same month the port of Yantian in the Chinese city of Shenzhen was partially locked out due to a coronavirus outbreak. This threw shipping schedules out of gear for a whole month, with domino effect. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development data, 70% of world trade by value are carried by sea. The lack of synchronised recovery due to vaccine inequality has created congestion resulting in ocean freight rates doubling.Also Read: Barge tragedy: Court rejects bail pleas of director, employees of shipping firmThe modern shipping container is to global trade what packaging material is to Amazon. Shortage of labour, higher demand and lack of raw materials have pushed up costs of all-weather containers, the lifeline of global trade. The average price for a 40-foot container increased 2.9% around the middle of September 2021 from a month ago and 323% over a year ago, according to the Drewry World Container Index, which tracks their cost. The gridlock’s nerve-centre is the world’s factory floor, China. The world’s largest trading nation is still pursuing stringent strategies to keep Covid-19 at bay, slowing its manufacturing prowess. Indian small manufacturers, fertilizer makers and the pharmaceutical industry are experiencing delays in import of raw materials and intermediate goods, all of which can stoke inflation. After widespread pandemic-induced layoffs, global corporations are finding it difficult to get workers back, many of who have relocated to less expensive places or have moved jobs. This is the main reason for labour shortage in advanced economies ahead of Christmas. “I am not panicking but will have to if shipping costs don’t stabilise and regularity is restored,” says Anand Sarin, who exports basmati rice from his factory in Hisar, Haryana Quarantine rules at ports means ships are taking twice the time to dock and leave with fresh goods from 60% of the world’s ports, including in India, according to a research note by the Copenhagen-based Sea-Intelligence Plc. It’s going to linger, forecasters say. “It is hard to see supply-chain bottlenecks being resolved any time soon, with some major exporters including Indonesia and Vietnam still struggling to contain the delta outbreak. It could continue to drag on the global recovery by slowing production and pushing up costs, although not derailing it,” wrote Bloomberg’s Asia chief economist Chang Shu in a recent note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-shipping-crisis-sparks-trade-chaos-how-will-it-impact-india-101633843435039.html

The federal agency busted the alleged drugs party last week on the Cordelia Cruise ship, which was on its way from Mumbai to Goa, team seized 13 grams of cocaine, 21gm of Hashish, 22 pills of MDMA, and 5gm of MD. It has made as many as 19 arrests so far.Also Read | Byju’s stops Shah Rukh Khan ad amid Aryan Khan drugs probeWhile speaking to news agencies this week, the NCB revealed how those aboard the cruise ship initially planned to evade the check – attempting to conceal the drugs in a sanitary napkin and a pair of socks. An NCB official told the ANI news agency on Saturday that a woman, who is accused in the Mumbai cruise ship drugs case, carried drugs by concealing them in a sanitary napkin. In footage retrieved by a Mumbai-based news channel, the intelligence officials can be seen pulling packaged materials out of what appear to be sanitary pads.Also Read | No drugs found on Aryan Khan; what are the accusations against him?Earlier, the NCB officials informed the Mid-Day morning daily that accused Arbaaz Merchant, who was held on the cruise ship along with Aryan Khan and Munmun Dhamecha, initially attempted to conceal the drugs inside his socks and shoes to evade the security check. The central agency has also accessed WhatsApp chats between Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant and officials familiar with the development said that Merchant may have “shared some drugs” with Khan.A local court in Mumbai on Thursday sent Aryan Khan and seven others to judicial custody for 14 days. The bail plea of Aryan Khan, who was arrested on October 3, was denied by the court on Friday.

10-10-2021||India||Priyanka Gandhi’s Varanasi rally in backdrop of Lakhimpur violence||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will address Kisan Nyay (justice for farmers) rally in Varanasi on Sunday, October 10 in Rohania area of the temple town where her mega cut-outs along with those of Rahul Gandhi have been put up in what seems like a loud declaration of the beginning of the election season in Uttar Pradesh.Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari and party national secretary Rajesh Tiwari were among the party leaders who inspected the venue to ensure every bit of detail was taken care of for the rally, being billed as the UP assembly election 2022 campaign opener for the Congress . Congress leader Ajai Rai said Priyanka Gandhi will first offer prayers at Baba Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Maa Durga Kund Temple in the city before addressing the Kisan Nyay Rally.Party leaders have held several meetings in eastern UP districts, including Varanasi, Mirzapur, Bhadohi among others,to mobilise support for Gandhi’s Kisan Nyay rally . The Congress leaders, including Tiwari, also met elderly Congressmen and locals in Ballia, Ghazipur, Mau, Azamgarh, Bhadohi and Jaunpur during these visits. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said that the Kisan Nyay rally in Varanasi will not only light up a new path for Uttar Pradesh but also serve a warning for political rivals in Delhi. “We will not rest in peace until the culprits of the heinous crime committed against farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri are put behind bars. We will give full fight for the farmers’ rights so that their demand for justice is not suppressed,” Lallu said.Also Read: Priyanka’s bid to reclaim Congress’ lost ground in eastern UPHe said that the Congress has fought for the rights of farmers since the freedom struggle. He cited that the Land Acquisition Act was passed by a Congress led government at the Centre to protect the rights of farmers.Lallu claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh was silent on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and questioned why it didn’t release posters of the accused involved in the mowing of a group of farmers last Sunday. Lallu accused the state government of protecting Ashish Mishra, an accused in the Lakhimpur violence case and son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni. “Instead of taking action against the accused booked under a serious section like 302, a notice was served by the police. What does the government want to show by issuing a notice to appear before the police for interrogation,” he asked. “We will hold the Kisan Nyay Rally in Varanasi on Sunday. Congress’ struggle will continue until the farmers get justice,” Lallu added.On Saturday, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted, “The aggrieved farmer families have only one demand: justice to them. It is impossible to get justice without the dismissal of the minister and arrest of the accused of murder. What message does the government want to convey by sending an invitation to the accused of murder to appear [for questioning before the police]?” The government should not protect the guilty but punish them, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-s-varanasi-rally-in-backdrop-of-lakhimpur-violence-101633840434492.html

10-10-2021||India||Priyanka’s bid to reclaim Congress’ lost ground in eastern UP||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has visited eastern UP at least six times since 2019 in her bid to revive the Congress party’s lost ground in the region centered around Varanasi. Her current run started in March 2019 through a Ganga Yatra undertaken on a boat from Allahabad to Varanasi via Bhadohi and Mirzapur, when she visited many villages en route, culminating in a visit to the Varanasi boatmen at the famous Assi Ghat. On July 19 the same year, Priyanka landed in Varanasi en route to Umbha village in Sonbhadra district to meet the families of the 10 members of tribal community killed in a firing over a land dispute on July 17, 2019. She was stopped by police and detained at Narayanpur in Mirzapur before being taken to Chunar fort, where she and other Congressmen staged a protest. A day later, the kin of the victims arrived at the fort to meet Priyanka. She returned later in August to Umbha village and met the families of the 10 tribals. In January 2020, Priyanka Gandhi visited Varanasi to support activists and some Banaras Hindu University (BHU) students who had been arrested while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act . “They (protesters) were holding a peaceful agitation,” Priyanka said and accused the Uttar Pradesh government of acting against the Constitution. Also Read | Farmers’ crisis, inflation: Priyanka Gandhi to pan UP govt in rally todayIn February 2020, she visited Azamgarh and met family members of some jailed anti-CAA protesters, asserting that raising a voice in a democracy was not a crime. A year later in February 2021, Priyanka returned to Varanasi and offered her obeisance to Sant Ravidas at Seer Govardhan area of the city. This Sunday, she is again in Varanasi, considered the cultural capital of the country by many and also the heart of eastern UP’s socio-political and cultural activities and the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi .With Sunday’s rally Priyanka has entered campaign mode for the upcoming assembly elections in 2022. Political analyst Professor Kaushal Kishore Mishra said, “The Congress is trying to regain its lost mass base in eastern UP and that is why it is holding a rally in Varanasi, the centre of politics of eastern UP for a long time.”Mishra added that while her persistent efforts to build a connect with the masses here will certainly rejuvenate Congress workers across eastern UP, it will still not be easy for the party to regain its lost support base before the 2022 assembly elections in “absence of committed workers”. He pointed out that long-time Congress loyalist Laliteshpati Tripathi, the great grandson of former UP CM Pandit Kamalapati Tripathi had quit the party and it reflected the challenges that the party was facing while rebuilding. “The rally will increase the political temperature in the entire region,” Professor Mishra said, and added that the Congress, which had strong support in the region till three decades ago, understood that eastern UP was important.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyankas-bid-to-reclaim-congress-lost-ground-in-eastern-up-101633838514091.html

As many as eight people including four farmers died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3.“Rahul Gandhi's visit to Lakhimpur Kheri is merely an instance of political tourism. There is no genuine sympathy and compassion involved. Wherever Congress and the other opposition parties get a chance, they go ahead with their political tourism. I would like to ask why did Rahul Gandhi not visit the family of the journalist killed in that incident? Why has he not visited Kashmir to meet families of people who are being killed over there?” Singh said while talking to the media.Congress delegation including Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the kin of deceased farmer Lovpreet Singh in Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.Giriraj Singh also congratulated the Bihar government for administering 6 crore vaccine doses before December.“Today, the entire world is appreciating the pandemic management and Covid-19 vaccination pace of India, which we have achieved under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I am also very proud that in spite of all abuses we faced, not only did we save our own people, but also saved lives worldwide by sending vaccines to various countries,” he added.On the issue of RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav campaigning for an independent leader, he said, "It is the family matter of Lalu Prasad Yadav. Which son got a bigger share in the party is not my business."In the recent list of star campaigners for the by-elections in Bihar released by the RJD, Tej Pratap Yadav had been left out even as it includes the names of the party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav.

Here's what he said||Even as coronavirus-related curbs across the country are being eased due to declining second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, top virologist Dr W Ian Lipkin has cautioned against this, saying that India does not yet have the sort of “safety armour” needed to start reopening. The “safety armour,” according to Lipkin, is that a large percentage of people should be vaccinated against the viral illness, which, he said, is “very small” in India's case.“Less than 20 per cent of the Indian population is vaccinated. Then, 30 per cent of population under the age of 18 is not yet eligible for vaccination. So, this means that you don't have the sort of armour needed to safely reopen in that way,” Lipkin said on Saturday at a media conclave, according to PTI.The Chicago-born expert was pointing to the fact that though the Government of India aims to fully vaccinate cent percent adult population of more than 900 million by the end of the year, nearly 950 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered till now, a figure which includes both single and double jabbed (fully vaccinated) beneficiaries. Also Read | Union health minister reviews vaccine progress as India nears 1 billion dosesThe nationwide vaccination drive against the contagious disease began on January 16 this year. However, as mentioned by Lipkin, only those aged 18 and above are eligible to get inoculated.He also stressed that scientists should develop vaccines that will not only prevent severe diseases, but also block their transmission. “We need to improve our public health infrastructure. Also, we should be able to track and trace individuals who have been exposed, so that we can adopt a ring vaccination strategy, which successfully eradicated smallpox in India,” Lipkin said.On Saturday, India recorded 19,740 new Covid-19 cases, down 7 per cent from the day before. 248 more people succumbed due to the infection, the Union health ministry's dashboard showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-reopens-top-virologist-has-a-word-of-caution-here-s-what-he-said-101633830836334.html

Rai also said that the Adityanath regime “failed to check the inflation and rise in petro-products, including petrol, diesel and cooking gas.”Priyanka Gandhi also aims to bring up the issue of the farmers' protests, a contention that has recently been magnified due to the violent incident at Lakhimpur Kheri. “The farmers and youth are upset with the state government as unemployment is at its peak and the growing inflation has left every section upset,” Congress leader Ajay Rai told HT.Also Read | Priyanka picks up broom again at Valmiki temple, says it’s a message to YogiVaranasi, an important political center in eastern UP where the Congress enjoyed immense support till three decades ago, is now a BJP bastion.

A recent opinion poll, however, showed that the BJP is likely to retain power in Uttar Pradesh in the assembly elections slated to be held early next year. According to the latest survey, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP can get 41.3 per cent of vote share, while Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party can get 32 ​​per cent, the Bahujan Samaj Party can get 15 per cent, Congress 6 per cent and others can get 6 per cent in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh.Priyanka Gandhi is expected to stay in Uttar Pradesh for five days every month, presumably to zero in on her campaigning agenda ahead of the upcoming assembly polls early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-crisis-inflation-priyanka-gandhi-to-pan-up-govt-in-varanasi-rally-today-101633830212123.html

10-10-2021||India||Centre takes steps to build up coal stocks||The supply of coal and the power situation in the country are likely to improve soon, with steps being taken to ensure gradual buildup of coal stocks in the near future, people aware of the matter said on Saturday.An inter-ministerial sub-group led by the coal ministry has been monitoring the situation twice a week. In order to manage the coal stocks and ensure equitable distribution, the power ministry earlier constituted a core management team (CMT). “The CMT is closely monitoring and managing the coal stocks on a daily basis and ensuring follow up actions with CIL, railways to improve the coal supply to power plants,” an official said on condition of anonymity.Also Read| Amid warning of power crisis due to coal shortage, Centre lists 4 reasonsOn Saturday, the CMT held a meeting to review the latest situation. “It was noted that on October 7, total dispatch of coal by Coal India limited (CIL) touched 1.501 MT thereby reducing the gap between consumption and actual supply. Ministry of Coal and CIL have assured that they are making best efforts to increase dispatch to power sector to 1.6 MT per day in next three days and thereafter try to touch 1.7 MT per day. It is likely to help in gradual buildup of coal stocks at the power plant in near future. The coal supply as well as consequent power situation is likely to improve,” the official quoted above said.There are four reasons for the depletion of coal stocks at the end of the power plants — sharp increase in demand of electricity due to the revival of the economy; heavy rainfall in coal mine areas during September; increase in prices of imported coal, causing more dependence on domestic coal; and non-building of adequate coal stocks before the onset of the monsoon. “There are also legacy issues of heavy dues of coal companies from certain states such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, UP, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh,” another official said.With declining coal reserves sparking concerns of a power crisis in the country, the Centre has issued guidelines for optimum utilisation at stations generating electricity, a move that is aimed at ensuring that no “unutilised capacity remains idle” by relaxing some aspects of power purchase agreements.“It has been brought to the notice of the Government that some power plants are not generating to their full capacity at any given time and the unutilised capacity remains idle as they are tied up under power purchase agreements. Whereas in the public interest, such power needs to be despatched, where there is a requirement in the grid by the other users or consumers,” the latest guidelines, issued by the Union power ministry on October 8, said. HT has seen a copy of the guidelines.Also Read| Coal crisis: Delhi may soon face load shedding; Kejriwal seeks PM's interventionAs the Indian economy picked up after the brutal second wave of Covid-19, demand for power rose steeply.

The country is the world’s second largest importer of coal despite also being home to the fourth largest coal reserves in the world.“Where the procurer does not requisition power from the power plant with which he has signed the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), up to 24 hours in advance prior to 00.00 hrs of the day of delivery of power, the generator shall be free to sell the unrequisitioned power in the power exchange,” the guidelines said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-takes-steps-to-build-up-coal-stocks-101633820191576.html

Off late, Faesal has been repeatedly praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah on social media.Last year, 17 months after laying the foundation of a new political party, Faesal had resigned the as president of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Movement. The 38-year-old former bureaucrat had also removed the party tag from his bio on social media that gave rise to speculation that he could rejoin the government or pursue other interests. Faesal had formed the party in March 2019.Faesal had resigned as an IAS officer in 2018, citing personnel reasons. He was detained at the Delhi airport on August 4, 2019 after he reached the national capital from Srinagar, a day before Parliament pushed through constitutional changes revoking Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcating it into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh.In February, the Public Safety Act was invoked against him, but was revoked before he was released in June.Faesal was the IAS topper of 2010 and has worked in various positions in the Jammu and & Kashmir administration.

10-10-2021||India||Mumbai cyber police summon CBI chief in data leak case||The cyber wing of the Mumbai Police has summoned Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal for a probe in connection with a case registered under the Official Secrets Act regarding an alleged leaking of a report revealing corruption in police transfers and postings and illegal phone tappings.Jaiswal was the Director General of Police, Maharashtra when the said report was allegedly leaked. He has been asked to remain present before the investigators on October 14, said a senior IPS officer from Mumbai police.Jaiswal did not respond to phone calls and messages. Earlier the cyber police recorded the statement of senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Rashmi Shukla in connection with the same matter in May 2021. Shukla, who is presently on central deputation and posted as additional director general of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Hyderabad, had refuted the allegations made against her in the FIR. The cyber police had on March 26 registered a case on the basis of a complaint lodged by the state intelligence department (SID) against unknown persons for allegedly leaking the report submitted by Shukla to Jaiswal, over the purported payments for transfers within the police department. Shukla was the commissioner, state intelligence department in August 2020 when the report was prepared by her.Shukla’s report had named senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking. The report referred to “monetary exchange” between officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians. Home department officials said that the copy that was reportedly leaked was the SID’s office copy and did not bear Shukla’s signature on it. Previously, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had submitted a report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, detailing the circumstances in which Shukla had created the report. Kunte’s report stated that Shukla had intercepted the calls of six people in the name of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”. It further stated that no transfers of police officers took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020, the period in which the calls were intercepted. Kunte’s report raised doubt on whether Shukla had leaked the report. He contended that if that were the case then she would be liable for “strict action”. “The report leak had led to a breach of privacy and defamation of the officers whose names have been mentioned in it. The deals for the transfers mentioned in it and actual transfers done by the government differ. This proves that there was no question of any scam in the transfers,” Kunte’s report stated. Earlier, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had alleged, “Shukla had sought proper permissions from the then additional chief secretary (home), and intercepted the phone calls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cyber-police-summon-cbi-chief-in-data-leak-case-101633814318195.html
10-10-2021||India||Kerala gold smuggling accused Sandeep Nair out on bail after custody of 15 months||After spending 15 months in judicial custody, the fourth accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case, Sandeep Nair, was released on bail on Saturday from the central jail in the state capital. Earlier he was granted bail in cases registered by the National Investigation Agency and Enforcement Directorate but he could not come out due to charges imposed under the Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa). His one-year detention under Cofeposa ended on Friday and the High Court also quashed Cofeposa provisions imposed on his acquaintance Swapna Suresh on Friday. After coming out of jail, Nair said most of the charges against him were trumped up and he would fight it out in court. He said he will stick to all statements given to various investigating agencies. While he was in the jail he sent a letter to the chief judicial magistrate in Ernakulam alleging that he was under pressure from a senior officer of the ED to drag the names of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and two other ministers in the case. It led to a major faceoff between the ED and the state government and the latter registered a case against ED assistant director P Radhakrishnan which was later quashed by the High Court. Later the NIA had made him an approver in the case much to the reservation of other central agencies. To a question, Nair said he knew Swapna Suresh for last three years or so but was in touch with first accused P Sarith as an employee of the UAE consulate for many years. He said since he was released on bail under strict conditions he could not divulge further details about cases pending against him. The sensational gold smuggling case surfaced in July 2020 after the seizure of 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. The case was later handed over to the NIA and the agency arrested Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru. The case invited enough embarrassment for the Left Front government after the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. Later he was suspended and he secured bail from the High Court. During investigation central agencies found that the accused smuggled at least 180 kg gold on 21 different occasions through the consulate. After the case came to light a senior consulate official slipped out of the country under the garb of diplomatic immunity. Though customs made a request to the Union government to interrogate him the UAE is yet to grant permission. Now a multi-agency team (NIA, ED, Customs and Income Tax) is probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far but most of them got bail later. Customs preventive officer Sumit Kumar, a tough officer who was supervising the investigation, was also transferred later. On Friday the HC had quashed the Cofeposa slapped on main accused Swapna Suresh. Her mother had moved the court saying Cofeposa can be applied on habitual offenders and this was the first case against her. A division bench of Justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and CP Mohammad Nias allowed the mother’s plea that sought quashing of the order. Though Cofeposa was quashed she will remain in judicial custody as many other cases are pending against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-sandeep-nair-out-on-bail-after-custody-of-15-months-101633810897860.html
10-10-2021||India||Big rejig: Ex-ministers now part of key house panels||In the biggest reshuffle of Parliament’s department-related standing committees since 2019, senior BJP leaders, who were dropped as ministers during the cabinet rejig in July, have been accommodated in key House panels.Bihar’s former deputy chief minister Sushil Modi has replaced Bhupendra Yadav as the chairman of the Personnel, Public Grievances and Law and Justice panel. The former has become the Union minister of environment and sciences and the labour minister in July this year. Two top-ranking Opposition leaders—the Congress’s Abhishek Singhvi and Trinamool’s Derek O’Brien—shifted to the home affairs committee at a time when the junior minister for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra is in choppy waters over the Lakhimpur violence which killed eight people after a car mowed down protesting farmers in UP.The newly created ministry of cooperation is yet to be allocated to any House panel. Officials pointed out that the House has to take a decisionAmong former cabinet ministers, Ravi Shankar Prasad is in the finance panel, Prakash Javadekar and Harsh Vardhan are in external affairs, Sadanand Gowda in defence, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in law and Santosh Gangwar in the commerce panel.The reshuffle, for the first time, also saw at least 28 Rajya Sabha MPs being shifted out of their existing panels due to poor attendance, according to a senior official. Out of the 237 Rajya Sabha members nominated by chairman Venkaiah Naidu for the 24 department-related standing committees for 2021-22, a total of 50 members of the Upper house also have been placed in new committees.“This includes 28 members who had poor attendance in the meetings of committees held during 2020-21. 12 of these 28 members didn’t attend any meeting in the last one year due to Covid or elections,” said a senior Rajya Sabha official.The entry of O’Brien and Singhvi in the home affairs committee assumes significance as both leaders have been vocal critics of the functioning of the home ministry over various issues including internal security.Singhvi told HT, “It’s a privilege to serve on any parliamentary standing committee. But home affairs always has a wide jurisdictional outlook and raises many challenging issues.” O’Brien’s joining comes when the Bengal government, ruled by the Trinamool Congress, has frequently been at loggerheads with the home ministry.While a detailed analysis of shifting of Lok Sabha members was awaited, most of the changes involving 50 members of the Rajya Sabha were suggested by the respective parties. Among the major changes, Chaya Devi Verma has moved from Agriculture to Social Justice and Empowerment while Prof Manoj Kumar Jha of the RJD has shifted from railways to labour. Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohel will join the transport panel from IT committee while the BJD’s Sasmit Patra is now in the education committee from the law and justice committee.Trinamool’s Mausam Noor goes from the Commerce to the Water Resources panel and world champion in boxing, nominated member MC Mary Kom, has opted for the Urban Development panel from the food body. Indu Bala Goswami will be in the health panel.There are 24 standing committees and each panel has 11 members of Rajya Sabha and 20 of Lok Sabha.“All three Shiv Sena members in the Rajya Sabha got new panels. Sanjay Raut moves to External Affairs from Defence, Anil Desai from Coal and Steel to Commerce and Priyanka Chaturvedi from Commerce to Transport, Tourism and Culture. All 3 had good attendance last year,” said another official.Data for Rajya Sabha members suggests that 9 BJP members, 6 from Trinamool, Congress (4), 3 members each from Sena, CPM, RJD, YSRCP and 2 each from DMK,BJD and TRS have been shifted to new panels as per the consultations with the parties. All other parties have seen at least one member shifting to another panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-rejig-ex-ministers-now-part-of-key-house-panels-101633808606690.html
10-10-2021||India||Maharashtra: Uddhav Thackeray, Narayan Rane trade barbs at Sindhudurg airport inauguration||Chipi (Maha): Arch-political enemies Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union minister Narayan Rane on Saturday shared the dais at the inauguration of an airport at Chipi in the Sindhudurg district, and took swipes at each other.This was probably for the first time the two came together on stage after Rane parted ways with the Shiv Sena -- now headed by Thackeray -- on a bitter note sixteen years ago. The occasion also had a backdrop of Rane’s arrest in August this year for a remark against the chief minister.Rane, who hails from Sindhudurg, in his speech listed the work done by him since he was elected as MLA from this picturesque region of coastal Maharashtra for the first time in 1990.He was given the charge of the district on the instructions of Shiv Sena founder (and Uddhav Thackeray’s father) late Bal Thackeray, and there were no proper roads, water or education facilities in the region then, he said. After the Shiv Sena-BJP combine came to power in the state in 1995, he requested then chief minister Manohar Joshi to declare Sindhudurg as a “tourism district”, Rane claimed. “After that the work for basic amenities like roads, power, education, water, and healthcare was carried out. The existing infrastructure is because of Narayan Rane. Nobody can match it,” he said.“People know who works. Uddhav-ji, I learnt everything from Saheb (Bal Thackeray),” Rane added.The BJP leader also said even today there is no water or electricity infrastructure near Chipi, nor is there a proper road to the airport. In a barely veiled attack on the chief minister, Rane said the late Bal Thackeray disliked lying, and did not care for those who lie.In his speech, chief minister Thackeray hit back, saying, “Balasaheb did not like lying. Hence, many times such people (who lied) were kicked out of the Shiv Sena. (Bal Thackeray would say) Even if the truth is bitter, please speak it.” In another dig at Rane, he said, “As per my knowledge, the Sindhudurg fort was built by (Shivaji) Maharaj...otherwise someone might say `I built it’.” He also said it must be pondered why it took so long for this airport to be built. “Some people said Konkan will be transformed into California, but why has it not happened yet,” Thackeray added.Then he took a dig at Rane’s portfolio at the Centre, namely, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). “You (Rane) are a minister. So what if it is `micro and small’, it is still an important department and (we are sure) you will use it for the benefit of Maharashtra,” the CM said. There should also be a heliport at Chipi which can be used for tourism, he said.The chief minister also said he never mixed politics and work, and when Rane called him up for the grant of approval for a medical college in the Sindhudurg district, he immediately cleared the proposal. Since his exit from the Sena in 2005, for which he blamed Uddhav Thackeray, Rane has often targeted the latter. Soon after he was inducted into the Union cabinet, Rane was arrested by the Maharashtra police in August over his comments against Thackeray. He was granted bail by the court the same day. Meanwhile, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on this occasion that thanks to the new airport, the distance of 530 km between Mumbai and Chipi can now be covered in 50 minutes. There are also plans to connect Chipi with Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and other major cities and 20-25 flights to Chipi will be started in the next five years, he said. Maharashtra now has 14 airports, Scindia noted. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, who also handles environment portfolio, said all efforts will be made to promote tourism in Konkan while conserving its ecology. The Sindhudurg Airport, also known as Chipi Airport, is spread over 275 hectares. The length of its runway is 2,500 metres, and it can accommodate narrow-body aircraft like Airbus A-320 and Boeing B-737. The airport terminal building has the capacity to handle 200 departing and 200 arriving passengers during peak hours.Union minister Ramdas Athawale and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar were also among those present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-uddhav-thackeray-narayan-rane-trade-barbs-at-sindhudurg-airport-inauguration-101633808380018.html

The development comes a day after a court denied bail to Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and seven others in the case and remanded them in judicial custody. An NCB team busted an alleged drugs party on the Cordelia Cruise ship, which was on its way to Goa at mid-sea on October 2. Meanwhile, the NCB on Saturday also recorded the statement of film producer Imtiaz Khatri, shortly after raiding his Bandra residence. After nearly eight hours of questioning, the agency again summoned him to appear before it on Monday. The agency also arrested a drug peddler from Santacruz in connection with the rave party bust, for allegedly supplying contraband material to one of the arrested accused. The peddler’s link was found during interrogation of the arrested accused in the cruise drug bust case, said a NCB officer.So far, the agency has arrested a total 19 accused in the case, including Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant, fashion designer Munmun Dhamecha and a Nigerian national drug peddler, along with others.NCB detained Aryan Khan along with seven others on Saturday night, and arrested him on Sunday afternoon during the raid on the cruise ship on which he was present. The agency recovered 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of mephedrone, 22 pills of MDMA (Ecstasy) -- all categorised as “intermediate quantities”, and 21 grams of charas, which falls under “small quantity”, and cash of ₹1.33 lakh during the raid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-records-statement-of-shah-rukh-khan-s-driver-in-drugs-bust-case-101633807477479.html
10-10-2021||India||Will intensify the agitation after Lakhimpur: Farmers||Farmer leaders on Saturday said they will intensify their stir against the three farm laws in the wake of violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district where eight people were killed, including four farmers and a journalist.They demanded the immediate arrest of Ashish Mishra, the son of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, for his alleged involvement in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.“We demand the dismissal of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra and immediate arrest of his son Ashish Mishra,” Yogendra Yadav, a leader of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a collective of farmer organisations, said at a media briefing in New Delhi on Saturday.SKM, which has been leading demonstrations against the three central farm laws for over a year, said farmers from various states would gather in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 12 to mourn the death of the four farmers and the journalist.SKM threatened to block train traffic on October 18, and hold a mahapanchayat (general gathering) on October 28 at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh’s capital, if their demands are not met.Farm unions blame Ajay Kumar Mishra and his son Ashish, who has been booked under charges of murder among others, for the violent incident in which a convoy of vehicles belonging to the junior home minister ploughed through farmers returning from a protest last Sunday.SKM’s announcement came on a day when Uttar Pradesh police interrogated the minister’s son, who was not arrested till the time of filing of this report. The minister and his son have denied any involvement.“This incident has completely exposed the character of the Union government, the Uttar Pradesh government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in power at both places,” Yadav said. “The BJP is not ready to take any step against its leaders and goons, even after there is clear evidence of such a big murder and involvement of BJP leaders in it. It is clear that the BJP has now turned to violence after losing ground in the face of this historic farm movement.”Farmers have been agitating for over a year against the three new agriculture laws that seek to liberalise farm trade in the country.One of the laws allows big businesses and supermarkets to buy produce from farmers outside the regulated, state-backed wholesale markets. The second law allows private traders to stockpile food, while the third law lays down a framework for contract farming.The government says the changes were necessary to boost investment and raise farm incomes, but farm unions maintain that the new laws would leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-intensify-the-agitation-after-lakhimpur-farmers-101633806683051.html
10-10-2021||India||After marathon questioning, Union minister’s son held for Lakhimpur incident||After nearly 12 hours of marathon questioning, the Lakhimpur police on Saturday arrested Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra at the crime branch office, police officials privy to the investigation said.Deputy inspector general, state police headquarters, Upendra Agarwal confirmed the arrest.“He was arrested after he failed to cooperate in the interrogation. He could not inform or validate on various points regarding his whereabouts at the time of the incident. We will try to get information from him after getting him on police remand,” Agarwal said.The officials said Ashish was questioned about his location and involvement in the incident that resulted in the death of eight people, including four farmers, on October 3.A police official said the nine-member investigation committee headed by deputy inspector general (DIG), state police headquarters, Upendra Agarwal, along with senior committee member Sunil Kumar Singh, commandant of 10th battalion PAC, questioned Ashish Mishra.He said the committee had prepared 40 questions to be asked. Ashish presented multiple affidavits through his lawyer Awadhesh Singh, who accompanied him, he said, adding Ashish had not clarified about his location at the time of the incident.He elaborated Ashish Mishra’s mobile phone was seized and video recording of the entire process was done by the investigation committee, which started questioning Ashish soon after he appeared before it at around 10.40 am. Lakhimpur Sadar MLA Yogesh Verma of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also accompanied Ashish to the crime branch office. However, he stayed out of the interrogation room.Ashish Mishra appeared before the investigators after the second notice was pasted at his Lakhimpur residence on Friday, asking him to appear in connection with the violence in which eight people were killed, including four farmers. He had failed to show up in response to the first notice and missed his 10 am deadline on Friday.The notice to Ashish Mishra was issued under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code and he was asked to appear and present evidence that he was aware of the incident.Earlier on Thursday, UP police’s additional director general, law and order, Prashant Kumar had said the police identified six people as accused, three of them dead in the violence, the two accused who have been arrested and Ashish Mishra.

10-10-2021||India||India, Denmark agree to strengthen ‘green strategic partnership’||India and Denmark on Saturday agreed on a five-year action plan to take forward their unique “green strategic partnership” and signed four agreements aimed at boosting cooperation in green technologies and management of natural resources such as groundwater.Following a meeting with his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the green strategic partnership finalised a year ago reflected the foresight of both countries and respect for the environment.“This partnership is an example of how by collective effort, through technology, one can work for green growth while preserving the environment. Today, we not only reviewed progress made under this partnership, but reiterated our commitment to increasing cooperation on climate change in the near future,” Modi said.Frederiksen said cooperation between India and Denmark is a “great example of how green growth and green transition can go hand in hand”. She noted that while Denmark has the skills in the field of green technologies, India has the scale to use them to benefit a population of more than a billion.“Our green cooperation is now part of a very ambitious five-year joint action plan,” Frederiksen said, adding there is huge untapped potential in trade and investment.The five-year action plan for 2021-26 aims to consolidate green and low carbon growth and focuses on sectors such as water, renewable energy, climate action, circular economy, sustainable and smart cities, cooperation in intellectual property rights; maritime cooperation, food and agriculture and health and life science.Among the four agreements signed on Saturday was a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the National Geophysical Research Institute in Hyderabad, and Aarhus University the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland on mapping groundwater resources and aquifers. This will pave the way for long-term collaboration to address groundwater depletion and deterioration of quality.The Indian Institute of Science-Bengaluru and Denamrk’s Danfoss Industries Private Limited inked an MoU to establish a centre of excellence on natural refrigerants for tropical climates. The centre will spread knowledge of CO2-based cooling systems and offer skill development for installation and maintaining such systems.A traditional knowledge digital library access agreement was signed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Danish Patent and Trademark Office, while the skill development ministry and the Danish government signed a joint letter of intent to explore collaboration in skill development.Three commercial agreements announced on Saturday were an MoU between Reliance Industries and Stiesdal Fuel Technologies for developing a hydrogen electrolyser and its manufacturing and deployment in India, an MoU between Infosys Technologies and Aarhus University to establish a centre of excellence for sustainability solutions in Denmark, and an MoU between the Observer Research Foundation and State of Green on research on green transition.Modi welcomed Denmark’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance, saying this has added a new dimension to bilateral cooperation. He also thanked Denmark for backing India at different international forums.The two sides also decided to expand the scope of their cooperation, including a new partnership in health. “In order to increase agricultural productivity and income of farmers in India, we have decided to cooperate in agriculture-related technology. Under this, work will be done on technologies in many areas such as food safety, cold chain, food processing, fertilisers, fisheries and aquaculture,”, Modi said.India and Denmark will also cooperate in smart water resource management, “waste to best”, and efficient supply chains.Modi referred to Danish companies that have been working in India for a long time in areas such as energy, food processing, logistics, infrastructure and machinery, and said reforms in the domestic economy, especially steps in the manufacturing sector, are facilitating many opportunities for these firms.Reenat Sandhu, secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing that the issue of Kim Davy was raised in the meeting between the prime ministers. “We have an understanding that the legal process must go forward and both countries are working on it,” she said.In 2012, India scaled down diplomatic ties with Denmark to signal its displeasure over the refusal of Danish officials to appeal in the Supreme Court against a lower court’s order barring Davy’s extradition. The two countries put their ties back on an even keel in 2018, when they decided to separate the Davy issue from the overall relationship.Sandhu said Modi also briefed Frederik on developments in Afghanistan and the Danish side echoed India’s concerns about the situation and the risks of terrorism. “Both sides share similar views on protection of human rights, including women and minorities, the need to allow people to move freely and to leave the country, the importance of an inclusive government and to prevent terrorism,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-denmark-agree-to-strengthen-green-strategic-partnership-101633805200829.html
10-10-2021||India||Maharashtra: Woman gangraped by 8 on board Pushpak Express train; 4 arrested||A 20-year-old woman was gangraped by eight men on the Lucknow-Mumbai Pushpak Express train in Maharashtra, police said on Saturday. Four people have been arrested.The rape took place when the express train was traversing between Igatpuri and Kasara around 8 pm on Friday, according to Government Railway Police (GRP).“The train had just left from the Igatpuri station and was slowing down before entering a tunnel, when the accused boarded the D-2 sleeper bogie.

10-10-2021||India||‘Reaction to action’: Tikait on BJP workers’ murder in Lakhimpur Kheri||New Delhi Farmer union leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday said the death of three people said to be associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 2 was a “reaction to an action”. “It was a reaction to the action of (BJP leader) Ajay Mishra’s jeep running over farmers returning home peacefully after a protest,” Tikait said in Hindi. He said a “neutral probe” into the entire incident should be ordered. Farm unions do not have faith in the probe ordered by the UP government by a retired judge, he said, adding he was “saddened” by the loss of lives. Farmers had been provoked into reacting, he said.“(Prime minister Narendra) Modi also said during the Gujarat riots that the violence was a reaction to an action. What’s wrong in saying what appears to have happened?” Tikait, a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Indian farmers’ union), said. Tikait is an influential leader from Baliyan khap (clan) of western Uttar Pradesh, a sugarcane belt. He is among a clutch of leaders who have led yearlong demonstrations against the Modi government’s three farm laws enacted last year. On October 2, a convoy of vehicles belonging to Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra, struck protesters, enraging farmers. A viral video a day later, reportedly of the incident, showed a jeep ploughing into farmers from behind at high speed in Lakhimpur Kheri. Eight people were killed in the incident. Four farmers and a journalist are said to have been crushed by the vehicles. Three people associated with the BJP, including the driver of the jeep, died in the ensuing violence. The police have named Ajay Mishra in a first investigation report and are probing whether he was in the vehicle that slammed into protesters. Mishra was being questioned by Uttar Pradesh till the time of filing this report. Both the Union minister and his son have denied involvement in the violence. Major farm unions belonging to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, addressed a press conference in the Capital on Saturday in which Tikait was present. The farm unions have sought dismissal of the Union minister and arrest of his son. They announced a series of agitation to protest the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, including a massive rally in Lucknow on October 26. The unions also said they would block trains for six hours on October 18 and mourn the death of the farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri on October 12, where a large number of protesters are expected to show up. Farmers in several states are on yearlong protests against three new agricultural laws that seek to liberalise farm trade in the country. One law is meant to allow big businesses and supermarkets to buy produce from farmers outside regulated state-backed wholesale markets. A second law seeks to allow private traders to stockpile large quantities of food for future sales. A third law lays down a framework for contract farming. The government has said the changes were necessary to boost investment and raise farm incomes but farm unions say the changes will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reaction-to-action-farmer-union-leader-rakesh-tikait-on-bjp-workers-murder-in-lakhimpur-kheri-101633804897183.html
10-10-2021||India||Kerala HC sends notice to Centre over Modi's photo on vaccination certificates||Thiruvananthapuram The Kerala high court on Friday sent a notice to the Union government on a petition seeking a Covid-19 vaccination certificate without Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photo embossed on it. The petitioner, M Peter, a resident of Kottayam, contended that the present vaccine certificate violates the fundamental rights of a citizen and sought a certificate without the photo of the Prime Minister. Justice PB Suresh Kumar directed both the Union and the state governments to file their views in two weeks. The petitioner also produced vaccination certificates from different countries, including the United States, Indonesia, Israel and Germany, saying they all carried necessary information, not photos of their heads of government. The petitioner, a frequent traveller, also said he has to carry the certificate with him to several places and the photo of the PM has “no substance, utility or relevance”. In the petition filed through his counsel Ajit Joy, he said the fight against the pandemic has been converted into a public relations and media campaign and it gives an impression that it was a one-man show and the whole idea is to promote an individual and that too at the expense of the public exchequer. He said he has every right to carry a vaccine certificate without the photo of the PM. “The photograph is a needless intrusion into the private space of the petitioner. The central government or the PM cannot claim to have done anything particular, but their duty,” he contended in the petition. Earlier, the Union government defended its decision to include the photograph in the certificate, saying the PM’s image along with his words helps create general awareness and Covid-appropriate behaviour. When a question came up in the Upper house two months back, minister of state for health BP Pawar said it was ideal to promote awareness. “Given the context of the pandemic, its evolving nature and the fact that following of Covid-appropriate behaviour has emerged as one of the critical measures for preventing the spread of the disease,” he said in a written reply, “the photograph along with his words reinforces the message for creating awareness and importance of following Covid-appropriate behaviour even after the vaccination. It was done in the larger public interest.” The Congress and other opposition members had deplored the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-sends-notice-to-centre-over-pm-narendra-modi-photo-on-covid-vaccination-certificates-101633804657028.html
10-10-2021||India||Minister’s son arrested after questioning over Lakhimpur||Lucknow/Lakhimpur KheriThe Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday arrested Ashish Mishra, son of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, for his role in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence after several hours of questioning, officials said a day after the Supreme Court pulled up the state government for its handling of the case. Confirming the arrest, state police headquarters director general of police Upendra Agarwal said that Ashish Mishra was arrested after he “failed to cooperate”. “He was arrested after he failed to cooperate in the interrogation. He could not inform or validate on various points regarding his whereabouts at the time of the incident on the day of the incident. And we will try to get information after getting him on police remand,” he said. Ashish Mishra, who has been charged with murder, appeared before police at around 10.30am. He was interrogated till late in the night. The minister’s son was accompanied by his counsel, Awadesh Singh and Yogesh Verma, Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Lakhimpur Sadar, to the crime branch office in Lakhimpur reserve police lines, officials said, requesting anonymity. With heavy media presence in the area, the three were escorted to the crime branch office from a separate entrance, the people said. Security personnel were deployed in strength and barricades were put up in the area.The nine-member panel, headed by Agarwal, interrogated Ashish Mishra from a list of 40 questions, including his location at the time of the violence, a police officer said.Ashish Mishra presented multiple affidavits through his lawyer, the officer said. Police have seized Ashish Mishra’s phone after the closed door proceedings, he said. Earlier on Friday, Uttar Pradesh police issued a second notice to Ashish Mishra, hours after he failed to appear for questioning in response to the first summons. Photos of police pasting the second notice outside the minister’s Lakhimpur Kheri residence were widely shared on social media. The notices were issued under Section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), said officials. According to the notices, Ashish Mishra was asked to appear in person. As the questioning continued till evening, the Union minister was huddled with lawyers at BJP’s office in the district, where a large number of party workers gathered and shouted slogans in his support. Violence broke out on Sunday afternoon after a vehicle, reportedly owned by Ajay Kumar Mishra, mowed down protesters while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village. Farmers allege that Ashish Mishra was in the lead car that ran over people. The junior home minister and his son deny the allegation. They have alleged that farmers pelted the car with stones that led the driver losing control of the vehicle. They also accuse the protesters of lynching two BJP workers and the car’s driver. A local journalist was also killed.Police also conducted raids at several places in Lucknow and Lakhimpur Kheri on Saturday in search of former Union minister Akhilesh Das’s nephew, Ankit Das. There are reports that Das was travelling in the same car as Ashish Mishra at the time of the incident. His driver has been taken into custody. On Thursday, Uttar Pradesh police made the first arrests in the case by detaining two people, Luvkush Rana and Ashish Pandey. Both are said to be associates of Ashish Mishra. Opposition and farm leaders, meanwhile, kept up their attack against the ruling BJP during the day, and sought Ajay Kumar Mishra’s resignation. Yogendra Yadav, who has been at the forefront of the agitation against the three central farm laws since last year, said Ajay Kumar Mishra should be “dismissed from the cabinet and arrested on charges of spreading disharmony, murder and conspiracy. He is also protecting the culprits in the case”.“His son Ashish Mishra and his associates, who have been accused of murder, should be arrested immediately,” he said at a media briefing in New Delhi.Samajwadi Party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav hit out at the government, saying it has “pulverised the Constitution”. “The way farmers were crushed, now preparations are on to crush the laws. This government has pulverised the Constitution. You have seen how a vehicle ran over farmers who were fighting for their rights. The guilty persons are yet to be caught. Instead of giving summons, a flower bouquet is being given. The summon is only in name, and (in reality) ‘samman’ (honour) is given,” he told reporters in Lucknow.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury drew a parallel between the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and the Mumbai cruise ship raid case, saying that the “of arresting the son of @iamsrk who is allegedly a drug-addicted kid, was conspicuously absent in the case of arresting the son of Mr Ajay Mishra, MoS Home affairs”. The Narcotics Control Bureau has arrested actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan for alleged possession of contraband DRUGS at a party on a cruise. “The alacrity of arresting the son of @iamsrk who is allegedly a drug-addicted kid, was conspicuously absent in the case of arresting the son of Mr Ajay Mishra, MoS Home affairs,” Chowdhury tweeted. “It is intriguing as the wayward kid of Mr Mishra is alleged to have mowed down by the self-driven car in a savage manner to the innocuous protesting farmers. #LakhimpurKheri,” he said. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a collective of farmer organisation leading the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, alleged that the violence was a “pre-planned conspiracy”.Farmer leader Darshan Pal said, “Union minister Ajay Mishra made some remarks during an event in Lakhimpur Kheri on September 25. It forms the background of what happened on October 3. The video is on Facebook. This incident is a terror attack and part of a pre-panned conspiracy.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-son-arrested-after-questioning-over-lakhimpur-101633804596313.html
10-10-2021||India||Delhi stares at a power crisis, sends out SOS||Delhi could face power outages if the central government does not quickly resolve the coal shortage at power plants, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday. His remarks followed reports that over half of 135 coal-fired utilities, which supply more than half of India’s electricity, have fuel stocks to last just under three days.Kejriwal sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the crisis in a letter. A supply disruption could impact strategic institutions such as hospitals, cold chains for Covid-19 vaccines and Covid Care Centres, he wrote.Of the five coal-fired thermal power plants that supply Delhi about 1,971MW electricity every day, at least one has completely run out of stock, Kejriwal wrote in the letter. He was referring to the Mejia thermal power station in West Bengal, which provides 100MW of electricity to Delhi. The plant has no coal reserve to generate electricity for even one extra day, the letter indicated. Of the remaining four, three had only a day of coal stocks, while the fourth had a reserve of four days, it added. “I draw your attention to the prevailing coal shortage situation that is continuing since August/September for the third month in a row, which has affected power generation from the major central generating plants supplying power to Delhi,” Kejriwal wrote in his letter.Several parts of Delhi are already suffering scheduled power cuts, residents said. Consumers in south and north Delhi, in areas such as Chirag Delhi, Burari, Deoli and Mohan Garden, reported power outages for up to four hours in the past two days.A statement from the Union power secretary’s office said: “The Union petroleum secretary has ensured that all required quantity of gas will be supplied to the gas based Bawana and Pragati stations for Delhi. NTPC has been directed to increase coal stocks equal to the national average for Dadri and Jajjhar stations and to give full availability. Delhi Discoms are not scheduling power from Dadri I as they want to exit PPA after 25 years. They have been advised to schedule power from Dadri-I.”The ministry in a separate statement, said: “Ministry of Coal and CIL have assured that they are making best efforts to increase dispatch to power sector to 1.6 MT per day in next three days and thereafter try to touch 1.7 MT per day. It is likely to help in gradual build up of coal stocks at the power plant in near future. The coal supply as well as consequent power situation is likely to improve.” Taking note of the situation, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission held an emergency meeting on Saturday and decided to relax certain charges for the city’s distribution companies so they can procure power from any source readily available to them. The regulator asked the state-owned Gas Turbine Power Station to make available 270MW of electricity through natural gas or any other alternative fuel available. It separately wrote to the Union power ministry, seeking its urgent intervention to resolve the issue.The coal supply crisis seems to be deepening with the onset of the festival season as 64 power plants not located near coal mines are left with under four days of the fuel stocks.There are a number of reasons for the current situation. International prices of coal have surged, increasing the demand for local coal. Power demand, and therefore the derived demand for coal, has increased sharply in the past couple of months, perhaps a reflection of pent-up demand on account of the disruption from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May, HT reported earlier. Heavy rainfall, especially in the coal-producing regions of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, have added to the problems.Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain held a meeting with distribution companies and asked them to buy power at spot prices, if necessary. Spot purchase of power is more expensive than long-term agreements. “No power plant that supplies electricity to Delhi is operating at 100% capacity. They’re all functioning at minimum levels. Even the hydroelectric power plants are not running at full capacity. If they are run at full capacity, at least in peak hours, it will be a huge relief,” Jain said. “Delhi may face a blackout if the supplies are not resumed at the earliest.”Kejriwal requested the central government to allocate enough natural gas to run plants such as Bawana, Pragati-I and Gas Turbine Power Station in and around Delhi. Kejriwal sought that the cost of spot purchase of power be capped to “discourage profiteering by traders or generators” amid the crisis.The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised Kejriwal for not initiating steps to prevent power outages. “Whenever a crisis hits Delhi, be it of pollution, water shortage, Covid-19, or the ensuing power crisis, the Delhi government always humbly pleads for help to the Centre. But the moment the crisis passes off, Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party begin criticising the Centre. People of Delhi now understand this dirty politics of the AAP and it will face its consequences in the civic elections of Delhi next year,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-stares-at-a-power-crisis-sends-out-sos-101633804536292.html

Police said three people have been detained in connection with the case.According to the police, the incident took place on October 7 in Prempura area of Hanumangarh where the accused thrashed Jagdish with sticks till he died, allegedly because of his relationship with a woman. The culprits also shot a video of the entire incident, in which they are seen giving water to the victim to drink and then thrashing him repeatedly with sticks. The accused later dumped Jagdish’s body outside his residence, police said.Taking strong note of the incident, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat hit out at the Congress-led state government for keeping “silence” on the matter.“Rahul ji, don’t worry about Lakhimpur where Yogi ji has his governance and not your dear Gehlot ji. Show some courage to speak about the murder of dalit youth in Prempura of Rajasthan so that people get to know how truthful you are?” he said in a Twitter post in Hindi.A couple of days ago, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel’s along with other party leaders met the kin of farmers killed in the violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri.Meanwhile, Jagdish’s family has refused to accept his body, demanding early arrest of the accused and adequate compensation. Later, SDM Ranjeet Kumar on Saturday met the victim’s family members and convinced them to cremate his body.“A case has been registered against 11 people. Three people -- Mukesh, Om Prakash and Hansraj -- have been detained and two teams have been constituted to nab the remaining accused,” Pilibanga SHO Inder Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-erupts-as-dalit-man-lynched-in-rajasthan-101633804476971.html
10-10-2021||India||India, China to hold 13th round of LAC talks today||The Indian and Chinese armies will parley on Sunday to cool tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Military negotiaters will try hammer out a disengagement plan for soldiers deployed at Hot Springs, one of the friction points on LAC, officials familiar with the developments said on Saturday.The 13th round of talks between corps commanders, to begin at 10.30 am, will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC, said one of the officials. “Problems at Hot Springs, or Patrol Point-15, are likely to be discussed during the talks,” said a second official. “We are hopeful of positive outcomes that will take the disengagement process forward.” Both officials declined to be named.Also Read| If China continues presence along LAC, so will we: Army chief General NaravaneThe last round of talks was held on August 2, after which the two armies pulled back troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A. It was the second such disengagement this year after the two armies pulled back troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector in Ladakh in mid-February.If the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre, so is the Indian Army, General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on the eve of the talks, referring to the massive military buildup and infrastructure development by the Chinese army across the LAC.“It is a matter of concern that the large-scale buildup that occurred last year (when the border row erupted) continues to be in place. To sustain that kind of buildup, there has been an equal amount of infrastructure development on the Chinese side. It means that they are there to stay,” the chief of the army staff said at a public event on Saturday. “But if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too.”India and China are locked in a border standoff for 17 months. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each deployed in eastern Ladakh.Also Read| No Chinese soldier detained, no structural damage: Govt on Tawang standoffThe 13th round of military dialogue follows a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the border in the sensitive Tawang sector in northeast India’s Arunachal Pradesh last week, and another incursion by the PLA in Uttarakhand in northern India on August 30.“PLA plans to keep the entire border active so that they can keep reinforcing their claims,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd) said on Friday. “It can also be an act of creeping assertiveness to subsequently lay a claim to these areas.”Indian and Chinese commanders agreed to a speedy resolution of outstanding issues on the LAC at the 12th round of talks, with discussions focusing on disengagement of troops from the remaining flashpoints on the contested border.A joint statement issued after the 12th round described the talks as “a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.”After the disengagement of troops from Gogra, former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said, “Hopefully, it can provide grounds for further disengagement in other areas. The real test will come when Depsang is discussed, and a breakthrough here could lead to a major de-escalation.”The problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-13th-round-of-lac-talks-today-101633804416286.html

They are operating from mandal (block) headquarters,” the official said, requesting anonymity. “Now, the government plans to set up as many as 10,032 YSR Rural Clinics to take the healthcare to the villages. They will be attached to the village councils and each clinic will cover a population of 2,000.”The clinics will be staffed by health providers who are either graduates in nursing or have completed a certificate course in community health. There will also be trained midwives. Asha (accredited social health activist) workers will report to the proposed rural clinics.The clinics will be linked with primary health centres and pathological labs through video conferencing, the official said. The health records of villagers will be available in the clinics through their Arogyasri cards, the official added. YSR Arogyasri is a health scheme run by the state government.Government doctors at primary health centres will be able to assess health records through the Arogyasri cards, helping them to diagnose and treat patients when they visit villages. “Every mandal (sub-district) will have two primary health centres equipped with facilities and staff, including two doctors, and they will be integrated with emergency health services and ambulance services,” the health department official said.The staff at the rural clinic will provide 12 basic medical services and 14 types of basic diagnostic tests, the official said. As many as 64 types of medicines will be stored at the clinic. Further, 67 types of basic medical equipment will be available in these clinics, apart from telemedicine services, the official said.“The government is investing ₹16,203 crore for revamping government hospitals and medical colleges across the state in order to strengthen public healthcare and health Infrastructure,” the official said. “The chief minister has already given green signal for the recruitment of 14,200 doctors and paramedical staff this year, so that there is no staff crunch in the hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-plans-to-set-up-rural-clinics-for-better-health-infra-in-villages-101633804296930.html
10-10-2021||India||If China continues presence along LAC, so will we: Army chief General Naravane||If the Chinese army is to stay in eastern Ladakh, so is the Indian Army, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Saturday, referring to the military buildup and infrastructure development by the People’s Liberation Army across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).“It is a matter of concern that the large-scale buildup that occurred last year (when the border row erupted) continues to be in place,” the army chief said.“To sustain that kind of buildup, there has been an equal amount of infrastructure development on the Chinese side. It means that they are there to stay. We are keeping a close watch on the developments. But if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too,” he said at a public event in New Delhi.India has taken countermeasures and matched Chinese moves, Naravane said. His comments come at a time when the rivals are planning to hold the next round of military talks to cool tensions in eastern Ladakh. The 13th round of talks to take disengagement at friction points on LAC forward is expected to take place next week.India and China have been locked in a border standoff for 17 months. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two nations still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each deployed in Ladakh.“If they continue to stay there for the second winter, it will definitely mean we will be in Line of Control (LoC) kind of situation (referring to the Indian and Pakistani deployments on the LoC), though not an active LoC as is there on the western front. We will have to keep a close eye on PLA troop buildup and deployments to ensure they don’t get into any misadventure once again,” Naravane said.Asked to comment on PLA’s intentions, given its aggressive moves in the northern sector, he said: “I wish I knew. The most difficult thing is to get into your adversary’s mind. This is the question we have been asking not just within the army, but also at other forums. But whatever those reasons may have been, I don’t think they have been able to achieve their aims because of the rapid response by the Indian armed forces.”The army chief said renewed infiltration attempts by Pakistani terrorists were being witnessed along LoC in Kashmir after a four-month lull, following the renewal of a ceasefire pact with Pakistan in February 2021. The two countries first agreed in 2003 to observe truce along their de facto border in Jammu and Kashmir.“The ceasefire held in totality till July. Incidents have started taking place again. There have been three incidents of ceasefire violation in north Kashmir. It seems to be a repeat of the 2003 pattern when it started with one odd incident and then rising to...as good as not having a ceasefire,” he said.On the Afghanistan situation and its impact on Kashmir, Naravane said when the previous Taliban regime was in power 20 years ago, Afghan-origin terrorists were operating in the valley. “There is reason to believe that the same thing might happen once again. We are prepared for any such eventuality. Just as we dealt with them in early 2000s, we will deal with them now should they venture anywhere near us.”Naravane flagged concerns about the recent targeted killings in Kashmir, saying the acts were unacceptable and a last-ditch attempt by terrorists to stay “a little relevant.”On the possibility of women being assigned front-line combat roles given that the doors of the National Defence Academy have been opened to them, he said, “We have opened 10 branches of the army to women, except infantry, armoured corps and mechanised infantry. I think for the foreseeable future that will remain the same. I will not make any false promises. We will have to see how it goes along. None of our neighbouring countries have opened up their combat arms to women officers. Things could change in future. We have to move slowly... Change will happen but at its own pace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-china-continues-presence-along-lac-so-will-we-says-army-chief-general-naravane-101633803883938.html

10-10-2021||Today's||LAC and the India-China stalemate||Reports of fierce jostling between Chinese and Indian troops in the east Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh stoked anxiety about a replay of the kind of violence and loss of life that ensued in Galwan in June 2020. But while the situation appears to have been defused, the incident shows, once again, the fragile state of India-China ties.
10-10-2021||Today's||Lakhimpur Kheri: The movement and the politics||It was the evening of October 4. I was driving to Delhi from Gajraula when we got stuck in a massive traffic jam. Suddenly, we heard an ambulance siren. The ambulance driver tried in vain to move ahead, flashing his lights and blowing his horn, but to little avail.I got out of my car and requested the driver of the vehicle behind me to make way for the ambulance. He seemed preoccupied listening to music, but nodded. I tried to persuade the drivers of a few other vehicles as well. The ambulance was about 300 metres behind me and people watching the chaos tried to help. After considerable effort, we were able to get the ambulance moving. I cannot forget the helplessness on the faces inside the ambulance.This was on a highway where thousands of vehicles pass every day, paying exorbitant tolls to the National Highways Authority of India. One of the conditions of the toll is that it would be the responsibility of the operator to keep traffic running smoothly. But when the police decide to block the road, who would listen to anyone else?After a few inquiries, I found out that Rashtriya Lok Dal president, Jayant Chaudhary, had gone to Lakhimpur Kheri by this route a few hours earlier. He could not be stopped. But the ordinary citizen — in this case, a patient — was not afforded such courtesy.At that time, I did not know that the chaos on the roads in Uttar Pradesh would continue into the following week. Top Opposition leaders wanted to go to Lakhimpur and Bahraich. The government was stopping them so that no more “unpleasant” incidents would take place. In this tug-of-war between the administration and politicians, it is innocent people who suffer the most.Now, let’s come to the sad story of Lakhimpur. Every day, we see a new leader and a new video in the news. There are concerns about those who lost their lives and those who were injured.But in the clamour to appropriate the farmers’ cause, real issues have not been addressed. This non-violent farmers’ movement, which has been going on for a year, has now witnessed a bloody incident that has aroused anger and passion. The people whose vehicles crushed the farmers were associated with Union minister of state for home, Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni.The minister’s son is the main accused in this ghastly tragedy. In the beginning, he was absconding, but after repeated notices by the police, and receiving a reprimand from the Supreme Court (SC), he appeared before the police, six days after the incident (he has now been arrested). This is why the SC has expressed displeasure over it. The time has come to ponder whether politics is for the benefit of society or not.Last year, when batches of farmers from villages in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh were gathering at the borders of Delhi, the question arose of how long they would be able to sustain their movement. They have held their ground till today, in the face of inclement weather, a pandemic and various other problems. This has also created problems of mobility for people in the surrounding areas. The farmers are aware of this, and they have made efforts to ensure that the conflict between them and the government does not go out of hand. So far, they have been successful.On January 26, when some so-called farmers tried to vandalise Red Fort, this confidence was shaken, but the farm leaders were able to convince everyone that this was the work of a handful of miscreants. People were willing to give farmers the benefit of the doubt at that time. It’s general belief that our peasants are anndatas and their sons secure our borders by blood.It appears from the video of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that the farmers were attacked first by vehicles, after which the mob turned violent. However, some videos and photos have also surfaced in which the image of Khalistani leader, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, was seen on the T-shirt of the young man carrying a stick. If these images are authentic, farm leaders should be on their guard. Such elements can derail the direction of their movement. After the incident at Red Fort too, this issue of wayward elements causing trouble was raised.Let’s look back into history. Most of the non-violent movements created new precedents. Imagine what would have happened if there had been no retaliation in Lakhimpur Kheri. The whole world would have stood in favour of them. Even then, those who crushed the silent protesters would have deserved exemplary punishment.I understand that it is not easy to stand by and see your own people mowed down by speeding vehicles. But violence in retaliation serves little purpose. Let us hope that farm leaders will see the merit of keeping the movement non-violent in the face of provocation.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/lakhimpur-kheri-the-movement-and-the-politics-101633874519214.html
