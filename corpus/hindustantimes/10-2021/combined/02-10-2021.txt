02-10-2021||Noida||With 11 new cases, dengue tally reaches 60 in Noida||Eleven new cases of dengue were reported in Gautam Budh Nagar on Friday, taking the tally of such cases to 60 in the district, the highest in the last five years, said officials from the district health department. Seven of the 11 cases reported on Friday are currently taking treatment at various hospitals. According to official data, the district reported 13 cases of dengue in 2017, 28 in 2018, 40 in 2019 and 27 cases in 2020. Officials said the prevalence of the disease in Gautam Budh Nagar is lower than in nearby districts. “While comparative data of the last five years shows that the district has maximum dengue cases this year, it is still better than nearby districts where the tally of dengue cases has breached the 300 mark. Compared to nearby districts like Ghaziabad or Meerut, Gautam Budh Nagar has been successful in controlling the outbreak of dengue. We are undertaking several measures with the help of authorities, nagar panchayat and nagar palika and conducting scheduled programmes and drives to eliminate larvae breeding spots. We are also focussing on the areas from where maximum dengue cases are being reported,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.In the past one month, the district health department has found larvae at 30 places. “While larvae was found at 30 places, 18 notices have been issued in the last 10 days to those establishments where mosquito larvae was found. Notices have been issued under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention and Control of Malaria, Dengue, Kala Azar and any Vector Borne Disease Regulations, 2016. According to the rules, the inspecting officer can issue a notice to the owner or the occupier of any place where water is found accumulating, which become harbours for mosquito breeding,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.He added the department is continuing fogging and anti-larvae spraying drives in the district. “Our health teams are screening densely populated localities in the district to eliminate any chances of mosquito breeding. Dengue is an urbanized disease; the mosquito causing the disease breeds indoors in artificial or man-made containers, hence our teams’ focus is on such areas. The teams are also going door-to-door to check for fever patients and taking their samples to test them for dengue and malaria,” added Sharma.According to medical experts, the low number of dengue cases in Gautam Budh Nagar compared to nearby districts could be due to more awareness among the residents of the district.“I believe people in Gautam Budh Nagar are more aware when it comes to sanitation and illnesses, which is why the number of dengue cases in the district are still under control. We also have fewer densely populated colonies or temporary settlements (slums), as compared to Ghaziabad, Hapur or Meerut, which helps in controlling the outbreak of dengue. However, Gautam Budh Nagar is the one of the most advanced medical hub in the region and it is possible that serious cases of dengue may be referred to here in the coming weeks,” said Dr N K Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (Noida). Meanwhile, the district has also reported one new case of scrub typhus from a private hospital in Noida, taking the tally of such cases to four. Two leptospirosis cases have also come to the fore.“One new scrub typhus case and two leptospirosis have been reported from private hospitals in the district. All three patients have recovered. Currently, there are no active cases of the diseases in the district,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-11-new-cases-dengue-tally-reaches-60-in-noida-101633199081388.html

Police said that in a bid to escape, the suspects crashed their jeep into a police barricade and one of them fired a gunshot, which was almost going to hit a police official. A pistol, one live cartridge, one bullet, number plates, and a Thar jeep were allegedly seized from their possession. Police said a case was registered against the accused under various sections of the IPC at Bajghera police station. The arrested suspects were identified as Dara Singh alias Dara, who allegedly fired the gunshot, Amit alias Meeta and Abhinav Verma alias Chunnu. Subash Boken, a spokesperson of Gurugram police, said a team from Sector 31 crime branch put a barricade on Sector 114 road in Bajghera late Friday night and started checking vehicles as they had information that the suspects were moving around in the area in an old Thar jeep with the intention of committing a robbery. Around half an hour later, the police observed a jeep coming towards Gurugram from Delhi side.

02-10-2021||Lucknow||Row after video of girl dancing inside Bada Imambada goes viral||LUCKNOW: The All India Shia Muslim Personal Law Board (AISMPLB), Shia clerics and Shia youth wing registered a strong protest after a 30-second video clip of a girl dancing inside the Bada Imambada here went viral. Calling the act ‘un-Islamic’ and ‘breach of sacredness’ of the religious structure, the protestors demanded ban on entry of tourists in Bada Imambada. An FIR under Section 295A of the Indian penal Code for malicious act with intent to hurt religious feelings of a community has been registered at Chowk police station. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) West CN sinha said a team had been constituted to investigate the matter and identify the people involved in the act. Earlier, Shia Muslims had demanded ban on wedding shoots inside Bada Imambada and opposed shooting of ‘tik-tok’ videos. “We strongly oppose the act as it is a breach of sacredness of the religious structure. We demand immediate intervention of the district magistrate, the chairman of the Hussainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) that owns the structure. We also demand ban on the entry of tourists in the Bada Imambada. One must not forget that it is not a tourist place, it is a religious structure and such acts hurt our religious sentiments,” said Maulana Yasoob Abbas, senior Shia cleric and general secretary of AISMPLB. Similarly, Maulana Saif Abbas, president, Shia Chand Committee too raised objection to the video clip and said this was not for the first time such videos had gone viral. “We strongly oppose the act and demand action against the girl. We have written several letters to the administration demanding ban on such acts which hurt our religious sentiments. The sanctity of Imambadas should be maintained,” said Abbas. “Such acts should be banned immediately,” said Shamil Shamsi, convener, ‘Hussaini Tigers’—a group of Shia Muslim youths. Besides, he said that he had also written to the ASI and HAT to make all possible arrangements and install CCTV cameras in order to keep a check on such acts. In the 30-second video, a girl in black attire, wearing a mask, was seen dancing inside the Bada Imambada that is also known as Asafi Imambada. However, this is not for the first time when the objections on such acts were raised. In 2019, ban on pre and post wedding shoots inside Bada Imambada was imposed after Shia Muslims raised objections. However, in 2020, Shia Muslims demanded ban on the shooting of ‘tik tok’ videos at Bada Imambada. A Shia Muslim group also demanded dress code and said that tourists only in decent attire should be allowed to enter the Imambada. One of the most preferred tourist destinations Bada Imambada, an over-200-year-old Nawabi era structure that was constructed by the then Nawab Asaf Ud Daulah during 1784-1791 to carry out religious ceremonies, is among the most popular tourist destinations in the state capital. If HAT and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials are to be believed, it is among the three most frequented heritage structures of the state capital, the others being Chhota Imambada and Residency. As per HAT records, in 2019 Bada Imambada witnessed footfall of 80,6854 tourists, of which 5361 were from foreign countries. The same financial year saw revenue collection of ₹4,92,14,343. However, the tourist movement dipped in 2020 and 2021 following the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/row-after-video-of-girl-dancing-inside-bada-imambada-goes-viral-101633198607036.html

What to say about the city, the problem of blatant littering, mounds of garbage and poor sanitation plagues even hospitals, leading to over a 100 dengue cases being reported over the past week. Sample this: less than 100 metre from the special ward for dengue at the Jallianwala Bagh Martyrs’ Memorial Civil hospital, the railway line leading to Amritsar junction has been turned into mini-garbage dumping sites at multiple points. Those responsible for sanitation have not been implementing the basics of efficient garbage disposal. “I have been running a dhaba near the civil hospital for four years, and this area has always been filthy. This rail track is right alongside the post-mortem section of the hospital. People throw used plastic bottles, food waste and other every other kind of rubbish. Two of my workers are sick because of this. Water gets stored in plastic bottles, leading to larvae formation, and dengue,” says Sonu Kumar, 54, adding that business has been hit. “The problem is widespread, even in Islamabad area, or around the GT Road or the smaller alleys in the area around the Golden Temple,” says social worker Praneet Babbar, adding that dengue mosquitoes thrive moist damps and the uncovered water pools on or near the garbage. “Only fogging is not the complete solution, we need cleanliness,” Babbar added. Gurpreet Singh, a hotelier in Kishangarh says, “The quantity of open waste generated in a congested city is a grave health hazard. Amritsar is called the Holy City, but looks anything. Visitors complain of the stench around the alleys and under bridges and flyovers.”The government authorities appear to be in a denial mode and despite major announcements, there is little change on the ground. Just a couple of days ago, mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu had announced that the municipal corporation had constituted 56 teams for the prevention of the spread of dengue and malaria. When will things improve on the ground remains a key question, though? Dengue needs to be checked with war-like urgency. Amritsar civil surgeon Amarjeet Singh said, “As temperature decreases, dengue cases will come down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dengue-cases-on-the-rise-in-amritsar-as-authorities-ignore-garbage-disposal-101633198361669.html

02-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: A year on, residents still wary of using city’s first cycle track||Lack of streetlights, broken bollards, encroachments and parking of cars and autorickshaws are among a host of issues plaguing the city’s first cycle track on Netaji Subhash Marg, even a year after its construction. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) inaugurated 5km cycle tracks on each side of the stretch between HUDA City Centre (HCC) and Subhash Chowk on October 2 last year. V S Kundu, the then CEO of GMDA, had said the project was aimed at ensuring pedestrians and cyclists have equal right of way (ROW). The track is also used for parking cars and autorickshaws at various points, such as near Subhash Chowk and near residential clusters on Arya Samaj Marg. The stretch has limited signages indicating the presence of a cycle track, due to which a large number of cyclists end up riding on the main carriageway. “Only if one observes closely can they spot the signage with a cycle drawn on it. I had no clue about the cycle track and thought it to be a service road as I could see cars and motorcycles passing by. More signages should be put in place along the stretch, preferably in Hindi, so that daily workers can understand it,” said Kishan Singh, a resident of Samaspur village.The Netaji Subhash Marg track was launched as a pilot project, based on which cycle tracks across the city were planned. Over the past year, cycle tracks have come up on various stretches across the city such as Hamilton Court Road, Vyapar Kendra Road, the service lane leading towards Gold Souk Mall, and a section of the Old-Delhi Gurgaon Road while one such facility is also under construction at the Anaath Road in Udyog Vihar, the new sector road which links Rampura Chowk on National Highway 48 with Pataudi Road.Last month, the GMDA also decided to construct 800 kilometres of cycle tracks across the city by 2035. While GMDA is going ahead with its plan of scaling up the cycling infrastructure in Gurugram, many residents are not comfortable using the tracks due to lack of safety. “The cycle track is much-needed but must be equipped with necessary features so that people are encouraged to use it. At night, a large portion of the track, especially near HUDA City Centre, is completely dark because there aren’t any streetlights or the ones that are there aren’t turned on. In addition, motorcyclists drive their vehicles at high speed on the track, due to which I rarely use the facility,” said Chetna Das, a resident of Sector 47.Sudhir Rajpal, CEO of GMDA, said the issues concerning cycle tracks, including the one at Netaji Subhash Marg, were raised during a residents’ advisory council meeting held recently, and he subsequently directed officials to address all issues.“The GMDA is constructing a cycle track for every new road that is coming up or being taken up for special repairs. We want to promote cycling in the city by all means and the maintenance and upkeep of cycle tracks are of utmost importance to us,” said Rajpal.Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said, “The biggest problem with the Netaji Subhash Marg cycle track is its design. It does not take into account the crossings that are located on the stretch. The cycle track is not continuous as a result. Further, the space between two concrete bollards is significant that leaves enough space for motorcycles to enter the cycle track” He added the entire stretch needs to be under 24x7 surveillance, for which CCTV cameras should be installed to keep a check on violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-a-year-on-residents-still-wary-of-using-city-s-first-cycle-track-101633198121329.html

I have repeatedly informed the local police about those who have been selling drugs, but no action has been taken so far. If drug smuggling continues as it is, my village will be ruined. Please take immediate action. My mind is saddened,” Cheema, a member of the block samiti and husband of the party’s sarpanch, had tweeted on September 30 (Thursday), while tagging Channi. Cheema told HT on Saturday, “After my tweet, Amritsar-rural police raided some locations in my village, but those involved in drug smuggling have gone underground.”He added, “I have been complaining to the police for months, but they asked me to name those involved in the trade. If I directly reveal their names to the police, these people will harm me and my family, as they are dangerous. Police know who is behind these networks, but don’t act deliberately.”He added that to underplay the drug problem in his village, police had taken a note from the family of a young man, suspected to be a victim of drug overdose, stating that their ward did not die of drugs. There was no medical examination carried out, he alleged. “Many people of our village are involved in drug smuggling. They all should be sent behind bars. We need a good society,” he said, adding that if this continues, many more deaths due to drugs will happen in the coming days.Beas station house officer (SHO) Harjit Singh, however, feigned ignorance about the issue. He said, “There is no complaint from any leader regarding drug smuggling or the menace of drugs.There is an issue of groupism.”Even as Channi had not responded to his tweet, Amritsar-rural police had replied, “We are looking into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amritsar-village-cong-leader-tweets-to-channi-on-drug-menace-sho-says-issue-of-groupism-101633197824385.html
02-10-2021||Noida||Man held for ATM fraud in Noida||A 25-year-old man was arrested on Saturday for allegedly tampering with an ATM and fraudulently withdrawing cash in Noida’s Sector 51. The suspect was identified as Maan Singh Nishad, a native of Etawah. Police said that they had received complaints from some banks that some miscreants were involved in manipulating ATMs. Sanat Kumar, sub-inspector at Sector 49 police station, said that police received information about the presence of a suspect near an ATM in Sector 51 market. A police team reached the spot and apprehended the suspect, he said. Police recovered two debit cards, ₹19,600 in cash, a motorcycle, and a knife from his possession. The suspect revealed that he had taken these debit cards from two vulnerable people from his hometown. “Nishad had found a trick to manipulate the machine and withdraw money. He used to visit different ATMs and first deposit some cash using a deposit machine. He then tried to withdraw cash from an ATM. Once the machine dispensed cash, the suspect used to grab the cash and then pushed back a few notes inside the machine to ensure the transaction failed,” he said. Nishad also carried a knife to threaten the ATM kiosk security guards if they put up resistance to his suspicious activities, police said, adding that the suspect had been doing such activities for the last one year. Vinod Kumar, SHO of Sector 49 police station, said police are investigating his crime records. “We are yet to figure out the number of ATMs he manipulated. A case has been registered against him under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC. The suspect was produced in a court that sent him to judicial custody,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-held-for-atm-fraud-in-noida-101633197762806.html

02-10-2021||Noida||Mihir Bhoj row: Gurjar leaders tell UP govt to apologise by Oct 30||Members of the Gurjar community on Saturday held a meeting under the banner of ‘Rashtriya Gurjar Swabhiman Samiti’ to discuss the issue related to the statue of king Mihir Bhoj. In the meeting, the Gurjar leaders set a October 30 deadline for the Uttar Pradesh government to issue an apology to the community for the alleged removal of word ‘Gurjar’ from the plaque installed below the 15-foot statue of the ninth-century ruler. The statue has been the centre of a controversy since its inauguration at the Mihir Bhoj PG College in Dadri by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on September 22. The Gurjar community has been protesting against the removal of their caste’s name from the plaque installed below the statue. The community leaders maintain that the king belonged to the Gurjar community. The Rajput community has also claimed that the king belonged to their caste.“The samiti has demanded the UP government to issue an apology over the issue and add the word ‘Gurjar’ before the name of king Mihir Bhoj on the plaque by October 30,” said Raj Kumar Bhati, a Gurjar leader. “If the government does not issue an apology and rectify the plaque, we will change the plaque and intensify our struggle,” he said. The meeting was held at a research institute in Greater Noida. On September 26, during a mahapanchayat held at Piyawali village in Dadri, the Gurjar leaders had formed the swabhiman samiti and called a meeting on October 2. More than 600 people, who participated in the mahapanchayat, were booked for allegedly violating Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Police had said that the organisers of the mahapanchayat were not given permission to hold any such event.On September 28, police booked 150 people for allegedly smearing black paint on the chief minister’s name on the plaque.Ravindra Bhati, another Gurjar leader, said that if a case was registered for smearing black paint on the plaque, a case should also be registered against those who removed the word ‘Gurjar’ from the plaque. “Everyone is equal before the law, and a counter FIR should be registered in this case,” he said. The Gurjar leaders claimed that around 200 people from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, and Madhya Pradesh participated in the meeting on Saturday. They have also planned to hold similar meetings at local levels in these states and continue their protest. Police have so far arrested four persons for damaging the plaque and posters of the chief minister’s programme in Dadri. The swabhiman samiti also demanded that all the arrested persons be released. Meanwhile, Thakur Dhiraj Singh, UP president of Rajput Uthan Sabha, said that the Gurjars’ meeting on Saturday was politically motivated. “The Gurjar community leaders in the meeting urged people against voting for a certain party, which showed the programme was politically motivated. There is historical evidence that king Mihir Bhoj belongs to Rajput community. We urge people not to get misguided by the Gurjar leaders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mihir-bhoj-row-gurjar-leaders-tell-up-govt-to-apologise-by-oct-30-101633196261942.html

Credibility and dignity of governance and your position should always be maintained, as also respecting Constitutional norms. It is unfortunate that senior bureaucrats, also well aware of rules and norms, allowed this error to happen,” a press note from Sharma said.

While suggesting that a special drive must be held in this regard, the governor constituted a ten-member committee under the chairmanship of additional chief secretary, governor, Mahesh Kumar Gupta to ensure 100% distribution of degrees.The decision was taken following a recent information submitted to the governor by the state universities wherein it was mentioned that a large number of degrees of previous years were yet to be distributed. Some of these degrees were over a decade old and the universities had to use their resources for its safe keeping.“Taking cognisance of this, the governor has suggested that universities must make arrangements for speedy distribution of these degrees. The governor has also suggested that universities must distribute all degrees during or right after their convocation event as well as remove unnecessary rules to ease the system,” said additional chief secretary, governor, Mahesh Kumar Gupta. Gupta further said “The committee has suggested that requirement for taking an application from candidates for taking old degrees must be removed and the new relaxations must be advertised to encourage people to take their old degrees.”Further, it has also been decided that universities will make available degrees in Digi Locker, take degree fees from students in the last year of the academic session or along with the fees of the last semester, will obtain no-dues certificate from students before issuing final marksheets or provisional degree certificate, obtain student’s address for the option of sending the degree by post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/governor-directs-uttar-pradesh-universities-to-distribute-old-degrees-to-students-sans-fee-101633195002014.html

A ration card is considered inactive when the beneficiary does not collect the subsidised ration from fair price shops for three consecutive months.“The food and civil supplies department will start a survey from next month to track those beneficiaries who have not been collecting their ration for the past three months. We will check if the person has gone to his hometown or is sick. In such cases, ration cards will not be disconnected. In other cases, it will be made invalid and those in the waiting list will be connected to the public distribution system,” said Delhi food minister Imran Hussain.If the ration card is inactive and the beneficiary does not exit or has left Delhi, the card will be cancelled and new ones will be included, he said. The food minister assured that ration cards will not be cancelled without any valid reason. “There will be some people who must have not come in July, but collected ration in August and some must have skipped August but taken food grains in September. We will spare those cards who did not come to collect ration for one or two months,” said Hussain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/door-to-door-survey-in-nov-to-identify-inactive-ration-cards-delhi-minister-101633192906365.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||100% cut-offs: DU principals say it will help cut over admissions||New Delhi: Even as the first cut-off list released by Delhi University colleges have broken all records, with eligibility scores mostly ranging from 98-100% for popular subjects such as English, Political Science, Economics, Computer Science, and BCom (Honours), principals across colleges urged students to not lose heart and expressed hope that seats may free up in the courses as applicants tend to switch colleges in subsequent cut-off lists.DU Principals’ Association (DUPA) president Jaswinder Singh, who is also the principal of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College which has a 100% cut-off for its BCom course, said that most colleges were being cautious by setting extremely high cut-off as they want to avoid over admissions. This year, 38 out of 54 DU colleges are offering BCom (Honours) to students with a score of 98% and above.“Last year, admissions under popular courses such as English, BCom, and Economics had closed under first list itself and even then, we saw over admissions. We reopened Commerce courses after the fifth list as some of our students had either moved to other colleges or cleared DU entrance tests for other courses and hence cancelled their admission. Another trend is that in off-campus colleges such Kamala Nehru, Gargi, Satyawati, Bharati or Vivekananda colleges, admissions really begin after the second cut-off (as students wait for seats to free up in their desired courses),” he said.On Friday, eight colleges declared 100% cut-off in eleven courses such as Political Science, Computer Science, and BCom.Applicants who take admissions under the first cut-off but wish to change colleges and apply to other colleges under subsequent cut-offs can do so by cancelling their admission and paying a cancellation fee of ₹1,000. This enables movement of applicants between different colleges of the university or to other institutes, freeing up seats in popular courses in some cases and leading to reduced cut-offs in subsequent lists. However, in the second cut-offs, the dips are mostly marginal.Last year, over 34,800 students had taken admissions under the first cut-off for the 70,000 undergraduate seats offered by the varsity. However, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, which had announced 100% cutoff in Political Science, Psychology, and Economics, had not filled its seats under the first cut-off. The college had marginally reduced it in the second cut-off, with a drop of 0.25 percentage points in Political Science and Psychology and one percentage point in Economics.Last year, students seeking admission in Economics – one of the most sought-after courses – could apply to around 25 colleges under the second cut-off list as admissions were closed in 12 colleges in the first list. A few prominent colleges like Hansraj College, Hindu College, IP College, LSR, Miranda House and SRCC still had seats to fill as a result of which the second cut-off list saw a drop between 0.25-1 percentage point.Last year, Miranda House too had dropped cut-offs in the second list by 0.25 percentage points in courses such as Economics (98.50%), History (98.50%) and English (98.75%) even as it closed admissions in Political Science with the 99% first cut-off.In Science courses too, cut-offs in Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics dropped by 0.33 to 0.50 percentage points, ranging between 97% and 98.25% in prominent colleges like Hindu College, Ramjas College, Hansraj College, and Venkateswara College.For courses such as English (Honours), colleges like Daulat Ram College, Gargi College, and College of Vocational Students dropped their second cut-offs by 1-1.25 percertange points, though the dip was only marginal, from 0.25 to 0.50 percentage points, in colleges such as Hansraj College, Miranda House, LSR, Ramjas College, and Kirori Mal College.Vibha Chauhan, principal of Kirori Mal College, said students should take admission in eligible colleges instead of waiting for preferred colleges under the first list itself. “Colleges have no prior knowledge about the number of students who will take admission in different courses or the number of over-admissions. There is no way to gauge whether there will be a second list or not (in their preferred college-subject) so students should take admission in eligible colleges. The drop in cut-off percentage depends on the admissions that take place in the particular subject. If there are fewer seats, the drop in cut-off will be marginal.”With a record number of top-scorers from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools, which constitute around 70-80% of DU applicants, the cut-offs this year have broken all records. A total of 220,156 students scored 90% or more marks in their Class 12 this year, as compared to 196,620 in 2020 — a jump of nearly 12%. Students scoring 95% or more almost doubled to 70,004 from last year’s 38,686. According to data given to principals, around 1,250 students have a score of above 100% (in best of four subjects) in Class 12 exams.Admissions under the first cut-off will be conducted between Monday and Wednesday, and the second cut-off list will be released on October 9. The university is expected to release five cut-offs, followed by a special cut-off to fill vacant seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/100-cut-offs-du-principals-say-it-will-help-cut-over-admissions-101633192841465.html

02-10-2021||Lucknow||Temporary power connections: Inquiry points to nexus between engineers, builders in Noida, Greater Noida||The inquiry report on irregularities discovered in issuing temporary power connections in Noida and Greater Noida points to a strong nexus between local power engineers and builders causing a massive revenue loss to the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL).The UPPCL management has already issued charge sheets to 23 engineers and three clerks after transferring them to distant places on the basis of the inquiry report that HT has accessed.“We will take further departmental action against the accused if they are not able give satisfactory replies to charges framed against them,” UPPCL chairman M Devraj said. He said serious irregularities were committed deliberately in giving temporary power connections with connivance between the department and the consumers. The 13-page inquiry report that makes startling disclosures was signed jointly on August 17 by inquiry officers Anil Kumar Tiwari, chief engineer (Lucknow discom), Vikram Singh, superintending engineer (planning), UPPCL, and Sourabh Kumar, account officer (Lucknow discom). The inquiry report reveals that a large number of temporary power connections of load as low as only 2 kw (kilowatt) were issued to colonisers to construct multi-storey apartments, besides maintaining no record of the date of issuing such connections, their validity period, billing etc. In some other cases, 2 kw temporary power connections were given for running 5 hp tubewell motors for irrigation.In the inquiry conducted to check the status of temporary connections issued between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2021 it was also found that most of the connections were issued off line, billing was done manually and no records were maintained in a majority of cases against the rules. As many as 39 temporary power connections of 2 kw each were found to have been given in one single day in Greater Noida division while 43 similar connections were found to have been given for running 5 hp motors for agriculture purpose.In one case, it was found that a 2 kw temporary power connection was issued for three months. On checking, a four-storey building was found on the site while the power connection was found to have been snapped though there was no record of the permanent disconnection.“No four-storey building can be built in three months,” the inquiry report said.In another case, a 2 kw temporary power connection was given for three months for construction of a three-storey building. The 2 kw connection was found to be connected to a thick 16 mm cable that can bear 70-80 kw load. “Not only is it not possible to complete the construction of the three-storey building in three months but using such a fat cable for a 2-kw load connection also raises doubts,” the report observed.One 2-kw temporary connection was issued for construction purpose in May 3, 2018. The physical inspection by the inquiry team found a township comprising 96 duplex type houses on the site for which the connection was given. Though the township now has a 172 kw residential multi-point power connections, no other records of the temporary power connection and its billing were found. The inquiry committee also found a 2-kw temporary connection being used for an under-construction five-storey building belonging to some Amzad Khan. The meter found installed at the site showed 1133 KWH consumption but no information about the temporary connection was found in the contract register.Yet another 2 kw temporary power connection was found to have been used for the construction of a multi-storey complex comprising 28 flats in Chipiyana Khurd area of Gautam Buddha Nagar. The connection was released on March 7, 2020 for a period of three months only, but no records pertaining to billing and the time extension were found even after 11 months of the expiry of the three months’ period.The committee further found that a bill (TC) of ₹4,06,00,940 was issued as charges to a 1600 KVA temporary power connection to a mobile manufacturing company in Sector 24, Yamuna Expressway on July 15, 2019 after which a revised bill of ₹2,64,58,140 was issued on Aug 18, 2019. The TC was again revised and finally this time it was issued for ₹32,98, 342 on September 9, 2020. UP Rajay Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avachesh Kumar Verma, who has demanded a state-wide inquiry into the status of temporary power connections, said it was a big scam in the power department in Noida.“The engineers-builders’ nexus is clear and it must have caused a revenue loss of more than ₹100 crore to UPPCL,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/temporary-power-connections-inquiry-points-to-nexus-between-engineers-builders-in-noida-greater-noida-101633192540908.html

The incident had led to massive public outrage and protests seeking immediate arrests of the six guilty cops who are on the run after a case of murder was lodged against them on the intervention of chief minister Yogi Adityanath who had assured justice to the victim’s family. The Uttar Pradesh government had on Friday recommended a CBI probe into the case but said that till the time the central agency takes over the inquiry SIT will investigate the matter. The SIT was constituted by commissioner of police Kanpur Asim Arun after the case was transferred to Kanpur from Gorakhpur on CM’s instruction. The CM had ordered transfer of case after meeting the deceased’s widow Meenakshi Gupta earlier this week. The SIT team led by additional police commissioner Anand Kumar Tiwari accompanied by forensic team inspected the hotel, including room number 512, where 36-year-old Gupta stayed with his Gurgaon based friends Pradeep Singh Chauhan, 34, and Hardeep Singh Chauhan,35. “They collected evidence and recorded statements of employees and also took into account missing evidences, including the CCTV footages, which the hotel owner claimed were taken away by the accused cops,” said a senior official who didn’t wanted to be named. The official further said the team reconstructed the scene and carried out photography of the room, hotel gallery and the lift by which the accused took Manish down from third floor to ground floor and then to hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sit-begins-probe-in-kanpur-realtor-s-death-case-101633192480954.html
02-10-2021||Pune||Daily wager falls into open manhole, Punekars cry foul over cover theft||The latest incident - where a daily wage worker, 39, fell into an uncovered, 15-foot-deep manhole in Katraj on Saturday – has angered Pune residents no end besides once again bringing to the fore the menace of stolen/missing manhole covers in major parts of the city.Recalling the incident, Pandurang Tambe, fire brigade officer, said, “In the morning on Saturday, a daily wage labourer Vijay Belbahadur, while walking from the side, went to see how deep the uncovered manhole was only to fall into the 15-foot-deep pit. Luckily, the fire brigade team managed to pull him out in three minutes.”Although there was no major casualty, Katraj residents are worried as there are a couple more manholes with covers missing in the area. Even where manholes have covers, some of these covers have become very old and need replacements.It’s the same story in other parts of the city such as Kalyani nagar, Balewadi, Pashan and Mundhawa. While the police have strengthened night patrol to curb manhole cover theft which is increasingly posing a threat to citizens’ lives, citizens expect a more immediate solution to the problem, both from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune police.Earlier on September 9 in Pimple Gurav, a labourer was similarly saved by a whisker after falling into an uncovered chamber/manhole. He was rushed to the hospital after the accident. In the month of July, 24 chamber covers were stolen from Baner-Pashan road while in August, Kalyaninagar and Mundhwa residents had to deal with the same problem.Madhavi Shah, a resident of Kalyaninagar, said, “A few manholes have been covered by barricades while others remain open. The situation was worse in August but has improved now as there are less open manholes.”An official from the PMC road department on condition of anonymity said, “We have covered manholes in major parts of the city. Wherever work is underway, we have put up barricades. There was a barricade in Katraj as well, where the Saturday incident took place.”As per official data, there are 1.2 lakh manholes spread across 2,300 km of drainage network in the city limits. Of the 1.2 lakh manholes, 1.05 lakh have reinforced cement concrete lids. Since iron lids give more scrap value, thefts continue in major parts of the city. As a solution to this problem however, iron lids have been replaced by fibre lids that are easy to replace - under the new smart city programme.“Fibre lids have very low scrap value. In Baner and Pashan, three manhole cover thefts took place recently. All have been replaced by fibre covers,” said an official from the Pune Smart City Development Corporation.“The police stations of the respective areas have been conducting inquiries about the thefts. A few people were taken in for investigation. Those who have been caught are not involved in other crimes; most of them are first-timers and are stealing covers for the sake of the money,” said a senior police officer from the police commissioner’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/daily-wager-falls-into-open-manhole-punekars-cry-foul-over-cover-theft-101633192421001.html
02-10-2021||Lucknow||Yogi moots fee waiver for one of two sisters studying in same private school or college||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday mooted the idea of tuition fee waiver for one of two sisters if they are studying in the same private school or college.Yogi was speaking at an event to distribute scholarship to students on Gandhi Jayanti in Lucknow.“We should consider this for girls’ education. If two real sisters are studying in the same private school or college, then those institutions should consider waiving the tuition fee of one. At the government level, we should discuss and ask those institutions for the fee waiver of one sister. If they (private institutions) are not willing, then the department should work at the government level so that the government pays the tuition fee (of one sister) to those institutions,” Yogi Adityanath said.The chief minister distributed scholarship totalling ₹1773.5 million to 1,51,215 meritorious students via the online medium during the event. Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, along with deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, and other senior members of the government and officials attended the event.“I hope this scholarship will help the students to continue their education in future without facing any financial trouble. We must ensure that all eligible students get their scholarship by the end of November,” Yogi Adityanath said.The chief minister paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi and recalled how he chose the path of non- violence and forced the British to leave the country.“People were surprised how Gandhiji used simple means to force an empire to withdraw from our country and achieve independence from British rule,” Yogi Adityanath said.Yogi went on to highlight the importance of cleanliness and how it has led to saving many lives that would otherwise have been lost due to diseases caused by the lack of sanitation.“Previous governments used to overlook the deaths caused by lack of cleanliness because of vote bank politics. We have changed this under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our government has saved many lives by ensuring cleanliness as part of the Swachh Bharat Mission,” he said.He also remembered former PM the late Lal Bahadur Shastri and his contribution to the development of Indian society as a wartime prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-moots-fee-waiver-for-one-of-two-sisters-studying-in-same-private-school-or-college-101633191521340.html

The accused was arrested after being blamed by the victim and has been sent to jail. “A 20-year-old woman, of unsound mental state, was admitted to the trauma centre of JN Medical College, in Aligarh. She was admitted to the JNMC by men from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on July 18 after the woman was injured in an accident and had been undergoing treatment here since then,” said Shwetabh Pandey, the Circle Officer (III), Aligarh police. The woman was unable to tell details about her family and thus was alone.Waris, 22, working at the medical store near the Medical College began taking care of the woman recently and developed proximity with her. The victim was not in her bed on Thursday night and thus, the supervisor on duty asked attendants to look for her. These attendants found the woman rushing out of the bathroom in panic and on being asked the reason, blamed the accused inside the bathroom for molesting her. The accused was handed over to the police.“A case of rape has been registered at the Civil Lines police station of Aligarh against the accused and he has been arrested. Waris was presented before the court and sent to jail on Friday,”Pandey said. “Investigation has begun in the case lodged on complaint by the security guard at the medical college.

Avanti has been working for more than 11 years with the State governments of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Under this partnership, shortlisted girls of the aforesaid category shall be enrolled for free online courses. The course will cover all subjects of NEET [National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test],” the DOE said in a notice on Friday.On February 15, Hindustan Times reported that though 569 students from Delhi government schools cleared NEET last year, only around 10% scored the cut-off necessary for admission to government medical colleges. Since these students could not opt for private medical colleges, most of them decided to reappear for the test this year as well.All interested girl students from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes category of Class 12 who have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology will take an objective-type aptitude test on October 8. “The purpose of the aptitude test is to determine the interest of the student in pursuing medical course after class 12 and in order to prepare for the same, free coaching will be provided to such students. The students who qualify the exam and enroll in the program will receive the device support also,” the DOE said.Heads of schools have been asked to appoint nodal teachers who would speak to eligible students about the scheme, facilitate transportation to and from the test centre in each district, and seek consent from parents. The education department has also asked school officials to ensure that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is followed at the 11 government schools where the tests will be held next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-neet-coaching-for-ews-girl-students-in-delhi-govt-schools-101633191167625.html

Acting on a tip-off, sleuths of the city police’s enforcement branch (EB) intercepted a truck loaded with at least 222 sacks, each carrying 50 kilos of kala jeera. “We have arrested one person in this regard. We have also obtained the details of the dealers to whom these were to be supplied. Further investigation is going on,” said a senior police official. In August, EB officials seized a small quantity of kala jeera from Jorabagan area in north Kolkata. The samples were sent for testing. “The results revealed that they were adulterated with rodent excreta and mobil oil. Presumably, the consignment which has been seized on Friday, also contain the same materials,” said an official. The police have been receiving information over the past few days that truck-loads of adulterated kala jeera were being smuggled into the city from the districts. The trucks enter the city early in the morning and unload the material at Posta market, the city’s main wholesale market.

It now looks difficult to get a nod in the committee.”Congress leader Aba Bagul’s response was neutral. “The administration has prepared the proposal. The standing committee and the general body will take a decision on it.”Meanwhile, sources in the administration said that with civic elections inching closer, no political party will touch this issue for the next few months. Even the standing committee will not discuss it; elected members would rather postpone the matter than discuss it. In any case, nearly all political outfits have already taken a stand against the proposal and submitted a letter to that effect to the municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taljai-hill-development-project-likely-to-remain-on-hold-for-next-few-months-101633190622616.html
02-10-2021||Other||Smart city project initiative: Public bike sharing facility launched in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: As part of the smart city project initiative, ‘Public Bike Sharing’ (PBS) facility was launched in the Sangam city on Saturday. The PBS system would allow users to rent out a bike from a designated automatic docking station and deposit it at another docking station located close to his/her destination. The facility would be available at a nominal rent. In the first phase, the city would have 32 docking stations, each having 14-10 bicycles. In this phase, around 300 bikes would be in service for the denizens, according to officials. The facility was inaugurated at an event in Civil Lines. Apart from BJP MP from Phulpur, Kesari Devi Patel and divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, several senior police officers, city Mayor Abhilasha Gupta, municipal commissioner Ravi Ranjan, mission manager of Smart city project, SK Sinha and others were also present during the launch. “We believe that the initiative, which is part of smart city project, would go a long way in providing the cheapest means of transport to the commuters. It will not just help them in maintaining good health but will also bring down pollution level in the city,” said divisional commissioner, Sanjay Goyal, who is also the chairman of Prayagraj Smart City Board. “To start with two docking stations, one at Subhash crossing and second one at gate number 3 of Chandra Shekhar Azad park have been made operational. Over 50 cycles have been docked at these stations which would be available at a minimal cost,” said Goyal. Docks have special bike racks that lock the bikes and only release them by a command generated by computer- controlled system. The user enters payment information and the computer unlocks a bike. The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place. Some of the sites identified for setting up the docking stations, include Nagar Nigam Prayagraj, All Saints Cathedral, Girls High School and College, Hotel Harsh Ananda, Sardar Patel Marg, Hotel Allahabad Regency, PD Tandon Park, Chandra Shekhar Azad Park Gate number 3 and 6, besides Anand Bhawan and Allahabad University among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smart-city-project-initiative-public-bike-sharing-facility-launched-in-prayagraj-101633190621317.html

The police official in question had not taken permission to go to Aligarh and had left Bulandshahar district without any order to do so. A case was registered at Harduaganj police station of Aligarh where the victim trader was thrown back after being ‘abducted’ and thrashed by police inspector Ajay Kumar and his associates. The Aligarh police have begun a probe in the matter. Meanwhile, the Bulandshahr police got the matter probed after allegations were levelled against the inspector. Ajay Kumar was posted at Kotwali Nagar police station of Bulandshahr, said Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh. “The matter relates to a case registered at Kotwali Nagar police station in Bulandshahar on September 16 as Crime No. 1398/2021. The case was lodged by Rajeev Kumar Sharma, a resident of Bulandshahar against Abhishek Tiwari, a trader in Aligarh, after a cheque of ₹6,60,000 issued by Tiwari, in favour of complainant Sharma, bounced. “Inspector Ajay Kumar was the investigating officer in the matter and went to Aligarh without any order or permission from senior authorities and left the district against the rule book. The matter of cheque bouncing does not come within the definition of serious offence, and neither is there a provision for arrest of an accused.“Yet, Ajay Kumar allegedly had trader Abhishek Tiwari in custody for no valid reason and tortured him on Thursday night. These allegations were probed and were found to be true and as such inspector Ajay Kumar was suspended,” said the SSP Bulandshahr. The matter created resentment in Aligarh as trader Abhishek Tiwari was virtually ‘abducted’ by Ajay Kumar and others, who came to Tiwari’s factory in Aligarh on Thursday night. Tiwari was beaten up as he came out of the factory in Harduaganj.It is reported that the in-charge of local police post in Harduaganj had reached the spot to stop the attack but was outnumbered and told that it was a police raid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-abduct-aligarh-trader-thrash-him-cop-suspended-101633189660797.html

02-10-2021||Mumbai||Plastic dominates marine debris in city mangroves: Study||A recent study by researchers at the Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE) has found that plastics dominate the composition of marine debris present in the city’s mangrove forests, comprising 62% of all surface debris items (by number) and 43 percent (by weight).The study — published in July this year in international peer-reviewed Elsevier journal ‘Science of the Total Environment’ — demonstrates how mangrove swamps are more polluted than city beaches, acting as traps that retain debris and rubbish flowing in from the city; and attaches empirical data to an issue that environmentalists and scientists have long been concerned about.“The structural features of the mangrove trees let them hold the sea debris during the high tide and retain it for months to years. The accumulated debris shows a negative impact on the mangrove ecosystem,” the authors state. Trapped debris is a potential risk to mangroves as it creates a barrier over their canopy, blocking out solar radiation needed for photosynthesis. The debris gets entangled within the flora, and masks their pneumatophores (aerial roots) which could lead to oxygen deprivation in the trees and also reducing available space for sapling growth, the researchers posit. Other impacts associated with debris pollution include impact on fauna, such as wader birds and marine line. “The plastic debris after accumulating in sediments impacts the mangrove crabs and also creates an anaerobic condition in the sediment,” the study claims.Environmentalists who reviewed the study on HT’s request said that its findings are no surprise, but clarified that it is confined only to quantification of debris. ““The paper does not present evidence of mangrove growth being hampered because of plastic or other debris. Mangrove cover in the state is actually expanding at a good pace. The paper does not propose any solutions, such as installing nets in drainage outlets to keep the plastic from reaching mangroves. It suggests regular clean-ups, which will be an endless exercise if we don’t stop pollution at its source,” said Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, which is fighting two separate PILs relating to marine debris in city drains and mangrove conservation. The CIFE study uses data gathered from 20 ‘transect surveys’ conducted between September 2019 and March 2020, at six locations including Versova, Gorai, Bandra Bandstand, Sewri, Vikhroli and Elephanta Island. Researchers surveyed a total area of 800 sq mtrs and 35 mangrove trees, collecting 3526 debris items weighing 367.9 kg. These were later classified into ‘surficial’ debris and ‘trapped’ debris, based on where they were collected from. The 35 selected trees were all located at Bandstand and alone yielded 1224 items (88kg in weight) of ‘trapped’ debris.Though the locations showed an “irregular pattern in the distribution of debris”, Versova and Gorai emerged as the most polluted areas, while Elephanta Island was the least. In all locations, plastic dominated the composition and distribution of materials. “By weight and number, plastics contributed highest to the collected surficial debris were about 43% and 62%, respectively. In the collected surficial plastic debris, plastic carry bags (19.2%) contributed more, followed by food wrappers (15.9%),” the study states. Other plastics researchers found in the surface debris included personal care products (8.03%), plastic rope/small net pieces (7.08%), bottle or container caps (6.40%), buoys & floats (5.22%), styrofoam cups (3.95%), beverage bottles (2.86%) others. The majority of collected plastic (31.28% by weight), however, could not be identified and were classified as others, indicating that these materials had remained in the environment and degraded over a period of time. The share of plastics was followed by metal, glass, rubber, processed lumber, cloth and other miscellaneous items, in that order. Further analysis of the 3,526 debris items collected revealed that “recreational/shoreline activities” were the primary source of pollution for city mangroves, contributing 54 percent of all the debris surveyed (including the bulk of plastic carry bags, food wrappers, plastic cups, bottles, plastic caps and similar waste).Researchers also observed that, in terms of weight, the abundance of plastics in mangroves was much more than their abundance in beach plastics, as demonstrated by an earlier 2013 study on marine litter in Mumbai, by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency in Sri Lanka. Compared with similar studies conducted around the work, researchers also note that the mean abundance of surface debris (by area) in Mumbai is seven times higher than the mangrove swamps of the São Vicente Estuary in Brazil.In terms of trapped debris, the study shows that there is a direct relationship between the quantity of debris and the height of a mangrove’s pneumatophores (aerial roots), which physically trap the material. “Larger trees accumulate debris (primarily plastics) in their trunk and branches, which stays in the tree for years and creates a new environment that acts as a shelter for various insects… more debris was found where the height and number of pneumatophores were more,” the paper says.Hindustan Times spoke with two of the study’s researchers, including the corresponding author, who declined to comment citing official protocol. A senior official with the MPCB, too, declined to comment and asked that the matter be directed to the forest department’s mangrove cell. Independent experts, on the other hand, said the study merits further, impact-focused research. “This is a unique study that highlights the vulnerability of mangrove habitat for pollution accumulation... Long-term observations are necessary to reveal the actual impact on the associated biota, especially the edible fishes and molluscs. There is potential harm not just to marine life but also to human populations that consume fisheries products from mangrove mudflats.”“Mangrove Foundation would like to take up further studies as suggested in this paper. We are in talks with many NGOs working on mangrove clean-ups and are finalising SOPs for clean-ups going forward. Mangrove Foundation will provide necessary assistance to stakeholders for such activities,” said Virendra Tiwari, APCCF, mangrove cell.Also, the independent expert quote at the end needs to be attributed to Dr Baban Ingole, former scientist with the National Institute of Oceanography. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/plastic-dominates-marine-debris-in-city-mangroves-study-101633189190402.html

Sitting on dharnas outside district administrative complexes, farmers alleged that the central government was harassing them by making excuses. The Union food and public distribution ministry on September 30 postponed paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana to October 11 from October 1, citing high moisture content in the crop due to rain.Slamming the move, farmers announced that they will intensify the agitation if the government refuses to start procurement by the central agencies immediately.Chamkour Singh Nainewal, chief of the union’s Barnala district unit, said the paddy crop has been abandoned and the central government has not made any arrangements for procurement. “Due to the Centre’s anti-farmer policies, farmers are already under debt in Punjab and are forced to hold protests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sangrur-barnala-farmers-hold-protests-seeking-paddy-lifting-101633188226347.html

They have been working in coordination with us. They haven’t yet taken over the case,” said a Punjab Police official, who didn’t wish to be named. However, Tarn Tarn senior superintendent of police (SSP) OS Ghuman remained silent on the development.Police investigations had found that the trio was working at the behest of one Arshdeep Singh, alias Dalla, of Moga, who fled to Canada between 2017 to 2019. Dalla is a close associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a citizen of Surrey in Canada and chief of KTF. The process to extradite Arshdeep from Canada is also underway.On Friday, the Moga police had arrested Dalla’s four associates with three sophisticated weapons, 14 live cartridges and 300 grams of heroin. The Moga police have also been assisting their Tarn Taran counterparts and the NIA to trace all backward and forward linkages of the module.Sources said the police and NIA have also identified some more suspects ,who are likely to be arrested in the coming days. Recovery of more arms and ammunition is also likely at any time, they said.Earlier, the Tarn Taran police had said that the three arrested men had disclosed that an SSP and two inspectors of the Punjab Police were their main target. Dalla is apparently holding a grudge against these cops as they were behind the arrests of his associates and family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nia-joins-probe-into-ktf-module-busted-in-tarn-taran-101633188222301.html

Farmers struggled to save their crop by covering it with sheets.The Centre on September 30 postponed paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana to October 11 from October 1, citing high moisture content in the crop due to rain.“We were already bound to sell our produce at prices lower than the MSP due to postponement of procurement by central agencies. The rain has further increased moisture level in the crop. As a result, private buyers will offer us much lower prices,” said Kabal Singh, a farmer from Attari village, whose produce was affected by rain at the Amritsar grain market.Another farmer, Harjit Singh, said: “We brought the produce to the market to keep it under the sunshine for a few days so that it become free of moisture, but the rain has spoiled our plan.”The rain also damaged the crop ready for harvest in the fields. “The ripened crop has fallen flat in the fields. This untimely rain will not only affect yield and quality of the crop, but also delay harvesting,” said Kuljit Singh Saini, chief agriculture officer, Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-damages-paddy-awaiting-procurement-in-amritsar-101633188220833.html

The state government has also decided to extend the lease of ghats of various rivers for sand mining in another eight districts — Patna, Bhojpur, Saran, Rohtas, Aurangabad, Gaya, Jamui and Lakhisarai — for a period of six months (from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022) on the deposit of 50% extra of the previously settled lease amount. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary (cabinet secretariat), said Bihar State Mining Corporation Limited had been asked to settle the lease of ghats in districts like Arwal, Nawada, Banka, Bettiah, Madhepura, Kishanganj, Vaishali and Buxar for mining of sand through open tendering. “Ghats of rest of the districts would be open for settlement once cases pending with various courts are resolved,” said Kumar. Prices of sand in Bihar, already very high, have soared following the crackdown on illegal sand mining and officials involved in the racket. Kumar said extension of lease and the mines department’s plan to go for sand mining in new districts were approved by the state cabinet at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar Friday evening. In another decision, the cabinet gave its nod the road construction department’s (RCD) plan of connecting newly built Atal Path — a four-lane high-level road in Patna connecting R-Bloc to Digha Ghat— with the upcoming Ganga Path. Meanwhile, the transport department has extended the deadline for banning the plying of diesel-powered autos in town areas of Patna till March next year owing to the cascading impact of the pandemic on the sector. As per the notification issued in January this year, operation of diesel autos were to be completely shut by the September-end with a view to curbing pollution in the ambient air in Danapur, Phulwari Sharif and Khagaul nagar parishad areas.

Gadkari is a great example of how a people’s representative can work for the development of the country.”“I remember that before Gadkari took over the portfolio of road transport and highways, about 5,000 km of work had been done. But after he took over, the figure has crossed 12,000 km,” Pawar said.Although Pawar and Gadkari share good relations, their parties have been political rivals in Maharashtra for the longest time.In his address, Gadkari said that his ministry is ready to fund various road-related projects provided the Maharashtra government takes responsibility for providing land. “Wherever the government will take responsibility to provide land, our ministry will bear the financial burden of executing the project,” he said.Gadkari reiterated about the proposed greenfield Surat-Nashik-Ahmednagar-Solapur highway that will later connect to the southern regions of the country. “The distance between Delhi and Chennai is 1,600km. But by initiating the Surat-Nashik-Ahmednagar-Solapur route, the total distance will be reduced by 330km to 1,270km,” he said. The cost of the project is Rs50,000 crore and an around 481km stretch will pass through Maharashtra, Gadkari informed. “This route will be access control and complete greenfield corridor,” he said.Gadkari appealed to the Maharashtra government to hand over government-owned land along this new corridor to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). “We will develop industrial facilities and other infrastructure projects alongside. They will be growth engines and generate employment,” he said. Meanwhile, the union minister also said that the government has decided to increase ethanol blending up to 20% in petrol. “I have instructed all vehicle manufacturing companies to build hybrid flex-fuel engines in vehicles which will work completely either on ethanol or electric. Very soon, the transport ministry will issue the order for the same.” Gadkari cited the example of Brazil saying that the country is using ethanol in vehicles and aeroplanes. “We too are planning to go towards green fuel. If farmers generate fuel, our money will be saved on importing petrol. Even this will bring prosperity to farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nitin-gadkari-a-great-example-of-how-people-s-rep-can-work-for-india-s-development-sharad-pawar-101633186720735.html

It is clear that computers were hacked and other candidates also resorted to malpractices to clear the examination. The future of 7 lakh aspirants, competing of 5,500 posts of head constables and constables, has been compromised,” he alleged, adding that fraudulent methods had been used in the test held for recruitment of 560 sub-inspectors.Majithia said even though it was becoming clear that this was a full-fledged recruitment scam, the government was not acting on the issue. “We demand a CBI inquiry into the entire scam or one by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. A number of Congress leaders as well as senior police officials are also involved in this scam,” he alleged.Condemning the complete silence on this issue by the Congress government, Majithia demanded that the entire process should be held anew. “All those who have participated in the examination should be allowed to reappear for the same and they should not be charged any fee for appearing in the same test again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/conduct-high-level-inquiry-into-punjab-police-recruitment-hold-process-anew-majithia-101633185460943.html
02-10-2021||Patna||Nitish aide Ashok Choudhary sceptical of Kanhaiya’s move to Congress||A key aide of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday cast doubts over Kanhaiya Kumar’s induction into the Congress yielding any benefits to either the young leader or the party. which seems riddled with insurmountable crises. Ashok Choudhary, who was himself a dynamic president of the state Congress a few years ago before being done in by a factional feud that played itself out on the streets, nonetheless wished the former JNU student leader well. “Kanhaiya is a young man from Bihar and my best wishes are with him” said Chaudhary, a powerful member of the state cabinet on whom the former JNUSU president had called on here a few months ago intensifying speculations about the ex-student leader’s plans to quit the moribund CPI. Choudhary, however, wondered “What future can he (Kanhaiya) look forward to in a party in which there is something fundamentally wrong. Look at what is happening in Punjab. They humiliated Capt Amarinder Singh, who has decided to quit. And they seem unable to appease Sidhu on the other hand”. He also cited recent crossovers by a host of prominent Congress leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasad and pointed to dissatisfaction among the old guard who are being referred to as “G-23” and “frustrated” young faces like Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan. “So, what benefit a party in such a mess can expect with the induction of one or two people. And what prospects can the new entrants hope for in such a scenario ?”, he asked. Notably, Choudhary had joined JD(U) in 2018 after having burnt his bridges with the Congress. He had earned plaudits after the 2015 assembly election when the Congress had contested in alliance with JD(U) and RJD and performed well. He was inducted into the cabinet from the Congress quota but factionalism reared its head no sooner than Nitish Kumar returned to the NDA in July, 2017 citing irreconcilable differences with the RJD. Choudhary’s detractors accused him of working at the behest of the chief minister to “break” the party which led to his removal from the BPCC chief’s post. Pictures of Choudhary, defending himself before the camera, teary-eyed, had made headlines. He had alleged that the national general secretary in-charge in those days, C P Joshi, was in cahoots with the BPCC “lobby” which was uneasy over his rise in the party. Born to late Mahavir Choudhary, a senior Congress leader of his time, Ashok Choudhary, then an MLC, finally made the much-anticipated crossover in March, 2018. He joined JD(U) along with two other party legislators, effecting a split in the Congress in the legislative council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-aide-ashok-choudhary-sceptical-of-kanhaiya-s-move-to-congress-101633183763400.html

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Fiercely self-reliant, she is the master of her own destiny||Right from childhood, Asifa Mushtaq valued financial independence. So, even when she was in school, Mushtaq would take tuitions for children in her neighbourhood, for pocket money. As she grew up, she realised wouldn’t be happy in a regular job, where she would have to work under someone.“After completing M.Com, I started working as lecturer. It was a comfortable job, but I wanted to do something more. I wanted to be something more,” she recalls.So in 2016, she quit the job and picked up the entrepreneurial hat.After discussions with her family members, she set up a production unit in Industrial Estate, Khonmoh, which deals in school uniforms. It employs around eight skilled and unskilled workers. “In our first year, our annual turnover was in lakhs. There was a huge demand for our products even though we were just starting out. But due to the pandemic the demand for uniforms dipped; so we decided to diversify and started making traditional Kashmiri outfits, such as pherans,” says the entrepreneur who is now in her early 40s.Exhorting others to give entrepreneurship a try, she says, “There is certain sense of freedom that comes with being self-employed. Firstly, you are your own boss and secondly, there is a lot of satisfaction in giving back to the society by way of employment generation.”She advises the youth against becoming obsessed with government jobs. “As an entrepreneur, you are the master of your own destiny. Whatever efforts you make, you will get the outcome accordingly,” she says. She also emphasises on building a strong support network. “As an entrepreneur, you need a strong team. For me, it is my husband and brothers. They encouraged me from Day 1 and till date, they continue to be my support system,” says Mushtaq, adding that she is grateful to her parents – father, who was a school principal, and mother, a homemaker – for providing good education to her and her siblings. Mushtaq is happy that she has been able to inspire her own sisters to follow the same path. For other girls, hoping to do the same, she says, “As a woman trying to make it big in a male-dominated society, it is important to develop a strong will power and never-give-in attitude.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fiercely-self-reliant-she-is-the-master-of-her-own-destiny-101633183900596.html

Of the 350 species, some are endemic to the western ghats while others are on the red data list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Even as the census findings coincided with “Wildlife Week” celebrated across India between October 2 and 8 every year, experts warned that community is important for protecting the flora and fauna of any region.About the census findings, Dharmaraj Patil, programme manager, environment, Raintree Foundation, said that the western ghats are biodiversity hotspots and a UNESCO world heritage site. “Velhe village and an area of around 2,100 hectare falls under the territorial forest area. We have observed that there is fragmentation of forest area in the entire northern ghats as villages are increasing. Fragmentation of forest area leads to islands of species as movement of animals is restricted. This in turn leads to inbreeding within species and finally local extinction of species and break in the species gene pool,” Patil said.“The forest department and local communities can help in corridor conservation. We are trying to protect the area through community initiatives. This is the five to seven year connecting corridor. And mapping is the first step to understanding how the species are scattered. That is a conservation priority area. From July to September, we have carried out mapping of the area. In August itself, a variety of species were found among butterflies, odonates, mammals, birds, reptiles and others. With the help of camera traps, species such as Barking Deer, Mouse Deer, Small Indian Civet, Grey Junglefowl, Red Spurfowl and Common Grey Mongoose were caught on camera,” Patil said.Asha Bhong, assistant conservator forest, Bhor sub-division, said that community is important to conserve a region. “This survey has highlighted once again that the region is rich in biodiversity. Many species we knew that were earlier not seen in the region are now being reported. And this information is crucial in spreading awareness among the villagers. We will be conducting workshops and awareness programmes for community members as and when Covid-19 cases reduce further,” Bhong said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/350-species-found-in-and-around-velhe-village-biodiversity-census-101633183360543.html

Last month, he had also threatened a Panjgrain village resident and sought ₹3 lakh extortion money,” the SSP said.He added, “During interrogation, he has confessed that he wanted to kill Shakti to avenge the sacrilege. Investigation has pointers that show that he had not acted alone there are more people involved. We are also probing their links with the KTF or any other outfit of such nature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bid-on-life-of-dera-sacha-sauda-follower-foiled-faridkot-police-101633183300809.html

The CM’s statement comes at a time when the state police force has been drawing much flack over the recent death of a Kanpur businessman Manish Gupta allegedly due to police highhandedness in Gorakhpur during checking of hotel rooms.“Police have done several good works in the past four and half years but a single fault wipes out everything. Public doesn’t take much time to make a villain of a hero. This fault could be rectified only with better communication and senior police officials should own the responsibility of maintaining better communication with public and media,” he said during ‘Police Alankaran Diwas’. The CM said a person in crisis first approaches police and the entire government machinery has to face embarrassment due to their wrong behaviour and insensitivity towards victims. “Therefore, efforts should be made to ensure that people’s faith in police grow stronger,” he said.The chief minister further said one can befool public or senior authorities only for some time but the truth ultimately comes out when officials meet during ‘Janta Darshan’. “Whatever is happening in different districts comes out in open during the Janta Darshan,” he added.The CM further said that today every police range has cyber police stations and 50,000 police personnel are been trained to tackle cyber crime at large level.Earlier on Thursday also, the chief minister had warned that any illegal activities by police personnel would not to be tolerated and those found involved in “very serious offences” would be dismissed. He had also said no important field postings be given to any tainted police officers and personnel.

A day before its scheduled beginning, the Union food and public distribution ministry on September 30 decided to postpone paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana to October 11. Even as the Centre attributed the move to high moisture content in the fresh stock, farmers and opposition parties are up in arms against the delay. Questioning the timing of the announcement, which came a day after Amarinder met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi, Pargat said: “The BJP government has been harassing farmers... (relations between Amarinder and BJP) have been an open secret now... no leader should opt for such a behaviour.” Pargat, who was talking to mediapersons in his Jalandhar Cantt constituency, said the Punjab government was fully prepared for paddy procurement. He said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, urged him to immediately withdraw the decision to postpone procurement as first 10 days are very crucial for the lifting of paddy. Amarinder, after his meeting with Shah, had denied reports of joining the BJP and claimed that he discussed the ongoing farmers’ agitation with the home minister and urged him to repeal the contentious farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-amarinder-conspired-to-delay-paddy-procurement-alleges-pargat-singh-101633180799801.html

However, bringing the drama on the stage isn’t a cakewalk for the producers.As the theatres and auditoriums are set to reopen, after the second Covid-19 wave, drama and show producers are facing a hurdle in putting together the team of artists, especially backstage artists who have gone back to their hometown or have taken up odd jobs during the lockdown.The theatre industry is also eagerly waiting for the standard operating procedure (SoPs) which is likely to be declared by the state government soon.“After the government announced that theatres and auditoriums would reopen we have geared up for a new beginning. We have contacted the artists and backstage artists such as technicians, costume makers, make up artists, light and sound managers among others. But many of the backstage artists replied that they have gone back to their hometown or have taken up odd jobs because of the unemployment during the lockdown,” said Mohan Kulkarni, head of the Manoranjan group, which produces dramas.Covid-19 curbs snatched away the employment of many backstage artists and folk artists as well.“Many of them started to work as security personnel or put up some vegetable stall. There is still no certainty,” said Sunil Mahajan, president of Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad, Kothrud branch.On September 25, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that theatres and auditoriums would reopen after October 22, while observing all Covid-19 safety protocols. He also announced that the SoPs were under being designed and would be declared soon. However, the government hasn’t yet published the SoPs and stakeholders in the theatre industry have demanded to release the SOPs soon.“Our planning will depend on the rules set by the state government. We are eagerly waiting for the SoPs. Unless the picture is clear we cannot plan the shows. They have to be viable for us as well. There should not be a cap of 50% operational capacity. If only the fully vaccinated audience or the artists are allowed then I am not sure how it would work out,” said Bhagyashree Desai, drama producer.“The theatres and auditoriums are first to be closed and last to reopen. Corporations should reduce the rent for a play,” she said.The producers predicted that entirely new shows and plays are unlikely to come on the stage in near future. “Because of the uncertainty, nobody would take a new project in the hand. Everyone would like to wait and watch for a while and then start working on a new project,” said Kulkarni.There is also scepticism about the response from the audience. “Even if theatres reopen and shows are set to be presented, business depends on how many people would turn up to watch. This remains a concern. But we would like to hope for the best,” said Mahajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/drama-theatres-to-reopen-in-pune-producers-face-a-challenge-to-put-together-team-of-backstage-artists-101633180002604.html

Thus, the decision to reduce the fare was taken.Yogesh Kaduskar, general manager of NMMT, said, “The minimum fare of the air-conditioned Volvo buses is now ₹15 and we have decided to reduce it to ₹10. From next week, the commuters will be able to travel in those buses by paying the reduced fares. We hope more people will board those buses after that.”According to sources, NMMT owns a total of 450 buses at present and 68 of them are air-conditioned Volvo buses. These buses go to different places of Mumbai, Borivali, Bandra, World Trade Centre, Andheri, Mulund, Thane, Dombivli, Kalyan, Badlapur, Kharghar, Kalamboli and Panvel. Manish Patil, 41, a Panvel resident, said, “Presently, to travel to Vashi from my area in the air-conditioned buses, we have to shell out ₹45. If the NMMT reduces the fares by 33%, then we will be able to travel by paying just ₹30 and we will be able to save some money every month. I am sure a lot of people from the city who now prefer to travel in non-AC buses, will start travelling in air-conditioned buses after that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmmt-ac-bus-fare-to-be-cheaper-by-33-from-next-week-101633179587322.html

There have been several instances of mishaps. This is playing with the lives of the people. We have warned the administration that if the potholes are not filled immediately, we will name them after the municipal commissioner, city engineer and executive engineer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mns-demands-repair-of-potholes-in-navi-mumbai-101633177180356.html
02-10-2021||Mumbai||No pre-arrest bail to jeweller booked for fraudulently availing ITC of ₹30 crore||The Bombay high court (HC) has rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a city bullion trader booked by the CGST authorities for fraudulently availing input tax credit (ITC) of about ₹30 crore.“There is sufficient material to deny pre-arrest bail to applicant,” said justice PD Naik, while rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of the bullion trader, Dev Adania.The 36-year-old owner of Gajmukhi Bullion had moved high court for pre-arrest bail, apprehending arrest in the case registered by the Commissioner, Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST), for contravention of section 70 of the CGST Act, 2017.On March 25, 2021, CGST authorities had searched his premises in Zaveri Bazaar and at one more place, after the authorities received information that Gajmukhi Bullion had received ITC worth ₹15.22 crore from a non-existent tax payer, M/s. Karnataka Jewellers.The authorities also claimed that Adania had allegedly also received fraudulent ITC from two more firms, M/s. Kismat Enterprises and M/s. Balaji Enterprises, but no payments were made to these entities.The jeweller had maintained that when the transactions were entered, the firms were active and no material was placed by the CGST authorities to indicate that parties were non-existent at the relevant time. HC, however, refused to accept his contention. Justice Naik noted that during the course of investigation statement of one Gautam Joshi was recorded under Section 70 of CGST Act. “He stated that he was ex-employee of the applicant (Adania) and the firms namely M/s. Karnataka Jewellers, M/s. Balaji Enterprises and M/s. Kismat Enterprises were opened by him on the basis of documents arranged from various sources,” said the court while rejecting the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-pre-arrest-bail-to-jeweller-booked-for-fraudulently-availing-itc-of-30-crore-101633176340183.html

Though handpump tube wells have been installed in my village, many have stopped functioning due to poor maintenance. We used to trek for long distances to fetch water from a stream. Then I spoke to my parents and told them about my idea of digging up a well,” said Sisa.The sisters slogged for about 10 days before they managed to strike water at a depth of 25 feet. A good downpour triggered by cyclone Gulaab filled up the well last week.“Not only my family, other villagers too are using water from the well. We are using the well water for drinking, bathing, and cultivation. We have sorted out the perennial drinking water crisis,” said Sisa.Her father Dhabalu Sisa said she was overjoyed with what his daughters have done. She could achieve her dream through her dedication and hard work. The entire village is benefitting from the well,” said her father.In January 2016, Malati’s father travelled to New Delhi along with his wife Samari as PM Narendra Modi’s guest during the Republic Day function and apprised him about the problems related to road connectivity, drinking water and healthcare facilities faced by his community.Malati completed her MA from a tribal university in Bhubaneswar becoming the first woman from the Bonda community, which is infamous for low literacy level, to become a postgraduate. During last year’s lockdown, she came down to her village where she realised that she needed to do something about the water crisis.She said due to financial constraints, she could not put up concrete rings inside the well. But her effort has inspired other youths in the village to dig up wells. There are around 60 families in the village who are now drawing water from these wells for household chores.The Bonda community, also spelt as Bondo, is one of the very primitive tribal communities living in the uphills of Eastern Ghats. They speak a dialect of the southern Mundari group of Austro-Asiatic language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/girl-from-primitive-bonda-tribe-in-odisha-digs-up-well-in-her-village-inspires-others-101633174780218.html

The rampant construction and developmental activities in these areas have necessitated protecting 17.5% of the bird species in the area. The survey also claimed that without identifying the species of trees in these areas, orders to transplant or cut trees have been noticed by environmentalists.Kolshet region is blessed with a thick green cover of trees that were a part of the forest. There are a number of typha-rich wetlands and a vast creek with mangroves. The survey was conducted from Nandibaba Chowk to Kolshet Creek – the most green cover region.“Many environmentalists visit Kolshet areas to understand their rich biodiversity. They found that permissions were haphazardly granted to hack trees without understanding the species or their importance. In the current scenario, it is very likely that rare and important trees have not been identified correctly and clubbed together as wild by the local authorities,” said Rohit Joshi, environmentalist, Thane.In a permission granted by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), the Thane tree authority has mentioned 46 trees as wild trees. This constitutes around 10% of the 431 trees in Kolshet. Whereas, in the survey conducted by the environmentalists last month, they noticed eight mango trees, seven jamun trees and many banyan, peepal and umbar or gular trees that are likely to be around 50 to 60 years old. Moreover, two amherstia nobilis (Urwashi) trees were observed behind Clariant Bus Stop that seem to be the only trees of this species in the entire Thane.“A fair attempt should be made by local authorities to conserve the remaining trees in their existing locations. In cases where transplanting these non-heritage trees is inevitable, they should be transplanted following proper and scientifically-recommended transplantation procedures and within the geographical area of Thane city. Moreover, monitoring of the transplanted trees for at least three years after transplantation is extremely important,” added Joshi.The green cover of trees within the compounds of a few companies and factories has been a boon for birds, both resident and migratory, for feeding, roosting, nesting and breeding. With the high amount of green cover within the Kolshet area, 37% of the bird count in Thane city is from here alone. Among these, around 17.5% of the birds are to be protected.“The River Tern, Oriental Darter and the Alexandrine Parakeets that are near-threatened birds are resident birds of Kolshet. The yellow-footed Green Pigeon – the State bird of Maharashtra – are also seen here in sizable numbers and there is a record of them nesting on the tamarind trees in Kolshet. There are more than 80 species of migratory birds that visit this region from October to March every year. They will lose their roosting and nesting spots as well,” said Clara Correia, professor and environmentalist who was a part of the survey team.Experts who conducted this survey are keen on providing TMC with support to identify species of trees or conduct any detailed research regarding Thane city’s bio-diversity.A senior official from the Thane Municipal Corporation said, “We always consider the feasibility of the situation, consider with the forest department if need be and take a conscious call before hacking trees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rare-heritage-trees-birds-of-kolshet-in-thane-destroyed-claim-environmentalists-in-survey-101633174485705.html

The court, however, rejected the plea. The court said in such type of cases, maximum punishment should be awarded to the accused not only to deter him from committing such type of offence in future, but also to deter the public at large from indulging in such type of offences.“If the accused is shown leniency then it will send a wrong message in the society,” said the court, adding that, “The offences proved against the accused are serious in nature.”The court said the sufferings of the survivor cannot be ignored. “At the time when the offence happened (2015), the victim was just nine-years-old and now she will have to carry that mental trauma throughout her life,” said additional sessions judge Sanjashree Gharat. The accused was a neighbour of the victim, she said, adding, therefore, the complainant showed trust in him and asked the elderly person to look after his minor niece when he was required to visit railway station to drop his relatives. The accused took advantage of it and sexually assaulted the minor girl and later threatened her not to tell anyone about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pocso-case-63-year-old-gets-20-years-in-jail-for-sexually-assaulting-minor-101633173220406.html

Also read: ‘Post or no post, will stand by Rahul, Priyanka Gandhi’, tweets SidhuThe state election committee of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party will meet in Dharamshala soon to draw a panel of candidates for the October 30 byelections in the three assembly segments of Fatehpur, Jubbal Kotkhai and Arki besides the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency. The Arki seat fell vacant after six-time chief minister Virbhadra Singh died on July 8, while the Jubbal Kotkhai incumbent Narendra Bratga passed away in June and former transport minister Sujan Singh Pathania, who represented Fatehpur died earlier. Though Kangana has not openly expressed her desire to contest the elections, the BJP top brass has already had one round of discussions on the prospective candidates and her name was discussed. One section of the party was averse to allotting the ticket to her. Kangana belongs to Bhambla village in Mandi district and has built a new house in Manali, which is also a part of the Mandi parliamentary constituency. CM’s aide among contenders for Mandi ticket Pankaj Jamwal, the BJP leader from Jogindernagar and the younger brother of BJP organisational secretary for the seven northeast states Ajay, is also vying for the ticket. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s aide, Nihal Chand, who was the Milkfed chairman, is also said to be keen to contest from Mandi. Kargil war hero Brigadier Kushal Thakur has been lobbying to contest the elections from Mandi since long. He was interested to contest in 2017 but the party preferred sitting Lok Sabha member, Ramswaroop Sharma. Ajay Sharma, the BJP spokesman, was also vying for tickets along with state media coordinator Praveen Sharma. The names of state Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh and education minister Govind Thakur also figure among the contenders. Party’s poll committee gathers feedback The party’s state election committee includes Jai Ram Thakur, Union sports minister Anurag Thakur, state party chief Suresh Kashyap, BJP national vice-president Saudan Singh, state party in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna said and co in-charge Sanjay Tandon, BJP organisational secretary Pawan Rana, former state party chief Satpal Singh Satti, former speaker Rajiv Bindal and party general secretaries Trilok Jamwal, Trilok Kapoor and Rakesh Jamwal. The committee will also hold a meeting with in-charges appointed for the byelections, including state industries minister Vikram Singh Thakur, power minister Sukhram Chaudhary, forest minister Rakesh Pathania, health minister Rajiv Sehjal, education minister Govind Thakur, jal shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur and Bindal. The in-charges are to share feedback on the preparations and prospects of the candidates. Frontrunners and challenges Narendra Bragta’s son Chetan is the frontrunner from Jubbal Kotkhai, while former zila parishad member Neelam Seraik is also vying for the ticket. In Arki, the BJP has given the go-ahead to Rattan Pal Singh, while former legislator Govind Ram Sharma has threatened to contest as an independent. The party faces a tough challenge to select the candidate in Fatehpur with former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar besides Baldev Thakur and Rita Thakur vying for the ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kangana-among-himachal-bjp-contenders-for-mandi-ls-ticket-101633172800034.html

Before September, the highest received doses was in April with 1,61,500 Covishield and 20,500 Covaxin doses.In September alone, 2,00,391 people got their first dose and 1,71,048 people got their second dose as well. Till now, 10.57 lakh people in Navi Mumbai have got their first dose, of which 5.17 lakh have got their second dose as well. The highest number of vaccine booths that NMMC could arrange in September was 103, which the civic commissioner intends to raise to 110 in the coming months if the supply remains good.“We have enough staff to handle even 110 vaccination booths. With 103 booths as well, the drive went smoothly. If the supply continues to remain the same way next month as well, we might have 110 booths,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Of the eligible 10.60 lakh population of Navi Mumbai, 10.57 lakh have been vaccinated with the first dose. The civic body believes that 10.57 lakh would also include people getting vaccinated from private hospitals who are actually not Navi Mumbai residents and hence around 15% to 20% of the total vaccinated would be considered as non Navi Mumbai residents.Of the 15 lakh population in Navi Mumbai, 10.60 lakh is eligible for the vaccination, 6.79 lakh people between the age group of 18 and 44 years have received their first dose. Meanwhile, as per the statistics, only 6.10 lakh people are eligible under this age group. “There are working class age group people who work in Navi Mumbai wherein they might have got their jabs done. Hence, the number of people getting their first dose is more than the actual eligible population,” an NMMC officer said.Of the 6.79 lakh, only 2.35 lakh have taken their second dose, which is 34% of those who took the first jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-than-2-lakh-get-first-vaccination-dose-against-covid-in-september-as-navi-mumbai-civic-body-receives-69-more-vaccine-supplies-101633172443052.html

A large number of people from different parts of eastern UP will attend the rally,” said Rai. He said that the party general secretary would expose the BJP’s state government that failed to check the inflation and rise in prices of petro-products, including petrol, diesel and cooking gas. “Farmers and youths are upset with the state government as unemployment is at its peak and growing inflation has left every section upset,” he added. People familiar with the development said that she will stay in UP for five days every month. Political analyst Kaushal Kishore Mishra, Professor of Political Science at BHU, said that the rally is an effort by the Congress to restore its base in Eastern UP where it enjoyed immense support of people till three decades ago. What or how much impact it casts will be clear in near future.“Eastern UP, especially its centre Varanasi, is crucial for several reasons, therefore, every political party is focusing on this region,” Mishra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/priyanka-gandhi-to-address-mega-rally-in-varanasi-on-october-10-101633171720706.html
02-10-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Colleges in tier 2 cities get a ‘community’ upgrade to IIT levels, thanks to Eventbeep||Eventbeep is an early-stage edtech start-up that is two parts Facebook, three parts Microsoft and the rest, all IIT.Consider that Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are the inspiration for founding head honcho Saurabh Mangrulkar, and you can see why. IIT has the blueprint that Eventbeep is aiming to replicate across its target metaverse (cue McZucky) - colleges in India – specifically, in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.Seed funding of ₹1.5 crore is what has put this early-stage edtech startup based in Pune on the way. The back-story, however, is rather Netflix-ish; in terms of an Indian drama with all the necessary ingredients for a multi-serial binge-boiler; A female founder, not supported by her family joins this startup run by a male founder, still on-boarding his family to the idea and their CTO sitting in Bengaluru.Founded by Saurabh Mangrulkar, Rakhi Pal and Venkatesh Prasad in May 2019, Eventbeep is a next-generation virtual community platform, empowering students at every step of their college life through the ever-changing world of education and work.Eventbeep provides space to get inspired, ask questions and network with experts, build connections with students from other colleges, share ideas, gain recognition, and ultimately receive support from people with shared interests and values. Eventbeep also closely works with colleges and universities to transform their campuses by building intra-college communities, “gameifying” the college experience and opening up a a world of opportunities and learning for its students, by connecting them with other college students and campuses.In the beginning…Says Mangrulkar, “My journey started pretty early on. When I was 15-years old, I used to read lot, including listen to audio books. I was inspired by Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. In 2011-12, I started an NGO ‘Nature Lovers’ to organise events for students. I gained lot of practical experience. As I started going to college, I faced another reality. Everything was bookish and students were wasting a lot of time. I thought this was very wrong and these students should come out of the classrooms to make their career. Thereafter, I built a ticketing platform for events for college students and tied up with several colleges. We crossed ₹1.5 crore in ticketing sales volumes on our platform. It was a hit. As I went to other colleges, I realised that the problem was much bigger and lies at the root of our education system.”Winner of the Global Student Entrepreneurs Award, USA, Mangrulkar (CEO at Eventbeep) has done 500+ college tie-ups in India. A student of MIT and COEP, Mangrulkar met the other co-founder Rakhi Pal at a startup pitch event. While he was interested in entrepreneurship, Mangrulkar’s family members felt that that he should study further or get a job. Mangrulkar organised 20+ events with 6,000 participants netting a profit of ₹10 lakh, after which his family agreed to let him pursue his dreams. He says, “Slowly, the resistance from family started to decrease. I showed them inspirational YouTube videos and TV shows, but they were concerned about my income.”Originally from Uttar Pradesh, Rakhi Pal (COO) also faced a similar situation except that her family is still not on the same page. For the first two years, Pal had to hide the fact that she is a startup founder from her family. Investor pitch or other outstation visits for business purposes were “field visits” or “extra lectures”, during those days. A student of Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Pal completed her Mechanical BTech in 2019. She was also selected for a six-month Volkswagen OML program.The third co-founder, Venkatesh Prasad (CTO) hails from Chennai but lives in Bengaluru. He got connected with Mangrulkar and Pal through a mentor. Prasad completed his B Tech CSE in 2019 and has worked at IBM as a developer.Founding EventbeepMangrulkar, Pal and Prasad started their edtech journey in 2019 with the specific aim of changing the lives of students. Says Mangrulkar, “I had observed that the IITs and other colleges had only one differentiating factor – their community with access to top quality alumni, events, opportunities and peers. There were students who liked painting or photography but chose chemical engineering and were pursuing it unwillingly. If there were 500 events per year at IITs, not more than five were organised at other colleges. IIT students have role models who have been to Harvard and founded billion-dollar businesses, but other college students are looking for good placements and jobs. We thought we should build a rich community like the IITs for students from tier 2 and 3 institutes, which accounts for 92 per cent of Indian universities. Through EventBeep we’re democratising this ecosystem.”Tech-firstThe cofounders decided to go with app development first. A mistake. They outsourced the app development. Says Mangrulkar, “Ours is an edtech company so for us, our tech platform comes first. There would be no business if there is no technology. However, initial product development progress slowed down as the agency did not bother to make the changes and iterations on time. So, we decided to have our own tech team. Prasad and his team ensured that all the changes, features, iterations, and new product launches started happening quickly.”Team buildingBeing young student-founders and building a team meant more learning for the trio. When Mangrulkar was exploring his options, he would offer literally any role to his friends. “That was the biggest mistake. My friends had different aims, goals and their family situation was different. Later, I also learnt that skills can be taught, but character of a person is very important. Identifying a good and hardworking human is the most difficult task,” he recalls. With all the hard lessons learnt, Mangrulkar then started visiting colleges and the placement offices. He asked for lists of students who wanted to work with startups. “I made a form and spread it. Chose the best candidates after interviewing them. Some of them left later, but then I realised that hiring professionals is better than hiring students,” he said. Product featuresSays Mangrulkar, “The first set of 5,000 to 10,000 students we on-boarded was from COEP and MIT colleges. We had got the database from the colleges and started inviting these students to use our platform. Soon we realised that we had given such features on our platform that were not required or useful for students. Some features did not work and we started improvising the platform.”Mangrulkar and his team started trials in 10 colleges including some MBA and engineering colleges under the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). Says Mangrulkar, “When we tie-up with any college, they provide student data. We collect information like mobile number, email id, year of passing Based on this data, we start giving them access to the application and later send reports related to attendance, lectures, subjects, interests, to the college management. At present, the app is open for all students without verification. We will take measures like ID card verification at the appropriate stage.”COEP Bhau Institute’s roleEventbeep has received support in terms of services like incubation, infrastructure, mentoring, from the Bhau Institute of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Leadership at College of Engineering Pune (COEP). Although Bhau Institute, which is an approved incubator by Department of Science and Technology (DST), did not seek equity, the services are being provided on rental basis and at discounted rates. Investor experienceSharing their hard journey of seeking investment for their startup, Mangrulkar said, “We were not from IITs. Almost all investors were looking for IITians or experienced founders. It was difficult for us to prove ourselves. We took lot of efforts in the last two years. We pitched to more than 150 investors with emails, decks and interviews. However, the standard response from the investors was “Let the team and product become more mature”. On the other side, we had a product running with good responses but unable to secure funding. We knew we had to work hard.”“Initially we put in ₹10 lakh to ₹15 lakh from the revenue of our previous startups. We did not take salaries, but we were getting stable revenues. Since our costs were zero, we were able to sustain. After Covid-19 outbreak, during the lockdown we did ₹60 lakh revenue in just four months. That was a turning point and investors started noticing,” Mangrulkar said. FundingEventBeep has secured seed funding in a round lead by SucSEED Indovation Fund, Uincept, Palimala Ventures and other angels including Vinit Deo and six others from Pune. “The total VC funding received is ₹1.5 crore which would give us a runway of 12 months. Thereafter we will be looking for another round of ₹10 crore at least,” says Mangrulkar.What’s next?Mangrulkar says, “On the product side, five years down the line we want to create a global community. Students across regions will be able to connect and work on their goals and careers. The app will be made more attractive and valuable for students by introducing new features including a mentor connect. On the growth side, we are onboarding more colleges and students.” “When on-campus colleges will resume, we will offer students a ‘video challenge’. Students completing these challenges and posting videos of their challenge on our platform will be offered coins and rewards. Also, we will enhance the college digitising efforts by introducing more tracking points and upgrades. Based on students’ behaviour about their interest in the subject, teachers will be able to change their teaching methods accordingly.” Investor speak“Before 2020, the Indian universities and colleges were not allowed to offer more than 20 per cent of degrees online, but recently we have seen a disruptive change in the way education is being delivered. EventBeep is currently operational in 10 college campuses, it has received pre-orders from over 75 colleges and universities for bringing the platform to their campuses. We believe that with the distinctive rise of e-learning and the world revolving around digitisation, technology paves the way for education, by empowering students and creating limitless opportunities and making learning eventful. Our investment will further help to grow the technology base and to reach out to thousands of students helping them to reach their full potential,”says Lax Chepuri, Co-Founder and Partner, SucSEED Indovation Fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-colleges-in-tier-2-cities-get-a-community-upgrade-to-iit-levels-thanks-to-eventbeep-101633171600385.html

"When Ramlila and Dussehra can be organised with certain conditions, then Chhath pooja can also be conducted with Covid-19 protocols in place," Chaudhary added."The government should allow people to celebrate Chhath puja at open places on Yamuna Banks, Bawana Munak (canal) and Bhalswa lake.

02-10-2021||Lucknow||Video of girl dancing inside Bada Imambada sparks controversy||The All India Shia Muslim Personal Law Board (AISMPLB), Shia clerics and other Shia youth wing members registered a strong protest after a 30-second video clip of a girl dancing inside Lucknow’s Bada Imambada went viral, officials said.Calling the act ‘un-Islamic’ and ‘breach of sacredness’ of the religious structure, the protestors condemned the act and demanded a ban on the entry of the tourists at Bada Imambada while Shia youths said they are going to lodge FIR into the matter.Initially, Shia Muslims demanded a ban on wedding shoots inside Bada Imambada and also opposed the shooting of ‘tik-tok’ videos in and around the premises.“We strongly oppose the act as it is a breach of the sacredness of the religious structure. We demand the immediate intervention of the district magistrate, the chairman of the Hussainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) that owns the structure, and demand a ban on the entry of tourists in the Bada Imambada. One must not forget that it is not a tourist place, it is a religious structure and such acts hurts our religious sentiments,” said Maulana Yasoob Abbas, senior Shia cleric and general secretary of AISMPLB.Similarly, Maulana Saif Abbas, president, Shia Chand Committee too raised the objection on the video clip and said it is not the first time when such videos have gone viral. “We strongly oppose the act and demand action against the girl. We have written several letters to the administration demanding a ban on such acts which hurts our religious sentiments. The sanctity of Imambadas should be maintained,” said Abbas.However, Shia Muslim youths said an FIR should be lodged against the girl. “Such acts should be banned immediately. We are going to lodge FIR into the matter against the girl and the person who was shooting the video,” said Shamil Shamsi, convener ‘Hussaini Tigers’ — a group of Shia Muslim youths.Besides, he said that they have also written to the ASI and HAT to make all possible arrangements and install CCTV cameras in order to keep a check on such acts.In the 30 second video, a girl in black attire and wearing a mask was seen dancing inside Bada Imambada that is also known as Asafi Imambada. However, it is not for the first time when objections to such acts were raised. In 2019, the ban on pre and post-wedding shoots inside Bada Imambada was imposed after an objection raised by Shia Muslims, including cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad. However, in the year 2020, Shia Muslims demanded a ban on the shooting of ‘tik tok’ videos at Bada Imambada. A Shia Muslim group also demanded a dress code and said that tourists only in decent attires should be allowed to enter the Imambada.Bada Imambada, an over-200-year old Nawabi-era structure, was constructed by the then Nawab Asaf Ud Daulah during 1784-1791 to carry out religious ceremonies. It is among the most popular tourist destinations in Lucknow. If officials with HAT and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) are to be believed, Bada Imambada is among the three most frequented heritage structures of the state capital including Chhota Imambada and Residency.As per the records with the HAT, in 2019 Bada Imambada witnessed a footfall of 80,6854 tourists, of these 5361 were from foreign countries. The same financial year saw a revenue collection of ₹4,92,14,343. However, the tourist movement dipped in 2020 and 2021 amid the pandemic situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/video-of-girl-dancing-inside-bada-imambada-sparks-controversy-101633163199631.html

02-10-2021||Patna||Bihar govt’s focus back on Nitish’s dream project Simultala Awasiya Vidyalay||After a long wait, the Bihar government has turned its focus on chief minister Nitish Kumar’s dream project, Simultala Awasiya Vidyalaya (SAV) - a unique abode of learning in a picturesque hamlet bordering Jharkhand where the elite once spent months in the still existing sprawling villas. The project is billed as Bihar’s answer to the undivided state’s pride Netarhat Vidyalay.The government has also decided to develop ‘Swastho Kothi’, where Swami Vivekanand once lived to recover from illness, as an attraction for visitors and inspiration for students. The premises where the campus is being developed also includes ‘Swastho Kothi’.Last month, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar, director (secondary education) Manoj Kumar, managing director of the Bihar state educational infrastructure corporation Shrikant Shastri, among others, reached Simultala by helicopter to make an on-the-spot review of the infrastructure development work and interacted with teachers, staff and students to get a first-hand feel of the ground realities for taking immediate steps required to make it a pace-setting institution as envisaged.“The school has done well as far as its results in the Bihar board is concerned but the larger objective of holistic education through the Gurukul system to prepare students for future challenges in varied fields is yet to be achieved. It was set up to fill the void, which was felt after Netarhat Vidyalaya went to Jharkhand following bifurcation. There are certain issues, which will be worked upon, viz. infrastructure development, faculty and staff shortage etc. The students also gave their feedback and highlighted loopholes that need to be addressed,” said the minister.In Niti Aayog’s SDG India Index 2020-21, Bihar has been adjudged again as the worst performer. The School Education Quality Index (SEQI) is developed to evaluate the performance of states and Union territories (UTs) in the school education sector.Choudhary said an on-the-spot visit had been planned to take stock of the issues and help the institution achieve its avowed objective as it is close to the heart of the chief minister and was set up with a purpose to give talented students a platform to make their mark. “There are certain limitations right now. The building construction has just begun. As far as vacancies are concerned, they will be filled at the earliest. Students’ grievances will be resolved and officials will soon visit to give positive solutions. ‘Swastho Kothi’ will be protected and developed to inspire the present generation. I visited the place. A statue of Swami Vivekanand will also be installed to make it an added attraction for the SAV and inspiration for the students,” he added.Swami Vivekanand spent a fortnight at the ‘Swastho Kothi’ in 1887 to regain his health. The place has now been taken by the government on lease for developing the school campus. Earlier, some villagers met local legislator Damodar Rawat with a request to keep the rich legacy intact. With the minister’s assurance to further develop it as an inspirational spot, that issue was resolved.Since its inception in 2010, the boarding school, with an annual intake of 120 students (60 boys and 60 girls) through a statewide screening test, has been running from rented buildings having prefab structures, though the SAV project was to be initially completed by March 2012. Now, the fresh deadline for campus development is February 2023 and the minister has asked the contractors to speed up work so that the deadline is not missed. The work was started during the Covid-19 pandemic.In its debut class 10 board exams in 2015, 19 SAV students secured more than 96% - a record since the inception of the Bihar school examination board in 1952. A year later, all 42 students in the top 10 were from SAV. Though the same performance could not be maintained, it remains the best performer in the state. The government spends a handsome budget on SAV which other government schools are deprived of. In the beginning, it was planned to make SAV a CBSE-affiliated school to let the students compete nationally, but later it stuck to the Bihar board. Netarhat has now switched over to CBSE. Earlier, a CAG report also flagged certain issues, including lack of account of the SAV Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-s-focus-back-on-nitish-s-dream-project-simultala-awasiya-vidyalay-101633158340460.html

Besides, we have been promoting several government initiatives for health and cleanliness as well as plantation activities to seek general commitment towards a brighter India,” says ITBP assistant commandant Adheesh Gupta.Pradeep Kumar, ITBP assistant commandant, who joined the rally from Bareilly to Rajghat, says that all cyclists prepared well before the event. “Challenges kaafi the par humara ITBP ka post 9,000-18,000ft ki uchai par hai aur Indo-China border ki upari seemaon ki raksha kar raha hai. Our jawans actively participate in events which are organised for the nation, such as mountaineering expeditions and cycling rallies. For this event, we underwent physical and medical fitness tests. Our medical team also came with us,” he shares.To mark Gandhi Jayanti, cyclists intend to pay a tribute to the Mahatma at Rajghat. BSF officer Ajit Singh, whose team started from Jhansi, tells us, “We will reach Rajghat around 4pm and will attend the pushpanjali there. After this, we will be heading to Red Fort, where the final flagging of the rally will occur.” Meeting the locals of the places where the cyclists made stops was inspiring, says Prashant Nagar, assistant commandant, BSF. “We started from Gwalior and reached Delhi in five days. Everywhere we went, the public greeted us with enthusiasm. We were overwhelmed by the feeling. We could feel their respect for the forces and their sense of nationalism. We held on to the goal of Swachh Bharat throughout the journey. Wherever we stopped, we would try to clean up the place as much as possible. We have a tradition in the forces that if we stop en route, before leaving, we clean up the place. So, we did all this in public areas, to send out a message to everyone to keep our nation clean,” Nagar concludes.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/following-the-mahatma-cycling-for-a-green-india-101633155040124.html

Around 385 mm of rainfall poured across the state bridging the rain deficit, but farmers and experts are not sure if the late rains would help the farming.Meteorologists said in September, 384.9 mm of rainfall was recorded in the state, bringing the deficit down to just 9 per cent less than the normal from 29 per cent deficit by the end of August. September is the month when the monsoon is on a withdrawal phase and sees less amount of rain, but this year, rainfall was higher in that month compared to June, July and August. In June, it rained 181.3 mm, while July saw 275 mm of rainfall. In August it was 204.8 mm.“July and August are the two months when farmers get much of the rainfall they need for Kharif crops. But the prolonged dry phase in July and August was disrupted by a very wet September. Bhubaneswar recorded 195 mm of rainfall over 24 hours while Puri was lashed by 341 mm of rainfall in 24 hours on September 12, an all-time single-day record for September. This is one more evidence of climate change,” said Uma Shankar Das, a senior Meteorologist of Regional Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar.The last time it rained so much in September was in 2007 when Odisha received 401.7 mm rainfall causing a flood. The highest September rainfall record was in 1961 when it rained 483.2 mm.Incidentally, the late burst of rainfall happened when farmers across the state were resigned to their fate over an imminent drought with 24 of the 30 districts recording more than 20 per cent deficient rains. August was worse with an overall deficit of around 63 per cent. Districts like Angul (88 per cent), Kandhamal (85 per cent), Bargarh (83 per cent), Sambalpur (83 per cent), Sonepur (80 per cent), Boudh (79 per cent), Jharsuguda, Puri, Keonjhar (78 per cent each), Bolangir, Deogarh (76 per cent each) and Nuapada (75 per cent) saw rains disappear.On September 1, Odisha agriculture minister Arun Sahoo told the state assembly that in view of an imminent drought, contingency crop plans would be implemented after 213 of 314 blocks in Odisha faced deficient rainfall. “Odisha has experienced drought 8 times in last 20 years. But we are prepared to tackle a possible drought,” said Sahoo in the assembly.The record rainfall in September has somewhat kept the fears of drought at bay, but farmer leaders said the late burst of rainfall is certainly not going to help the farmers in Odisha this year. Incidentally, at least 6 of the 30 districts, including the rice bowel districts of Kalahandi and Sambalpur, are still in the red despite record rainfall in September.“Timing of rains is very important in paddy farming and late rains affect germination to a great extent. While in coastal Odisha, farmers plant kharif paddy around August, in western Odisha, in districts like Sambalpur, Bargarh and Kalahandi, which are major paddy producing districts, farming starts around June. Post-transplantation activities in western Odisha were greatly affected by insufficient rainfall in July and August. Even by the end of September, Sambalpur district as a whole is running deficient by 28 per cent. We would see lesser harvest this year due to late rains,” said Ashok Pradhan of Paschima Odisha Krushak Sangram Samanwaya Samiti, a major farmers organisation in western Odisha.Pradhan said, on Wednesday hundreds of farmers in Jamankira block of Sambalpur held a huge demonstration demanding that the government declare drought in their area which would help them get assistance from the government.In the western Odisha district of Bargarh, farmer Jhasketan Bhoi of Bhatli block said the delayed rainfall gave rise to weed in the paddy field. “By the end of August, Bargarh was rain deficient by 31 per cent. There were several blocks where the rainfall deficiency was higher which led to wilting of paddy seeds. Farmers who had access to borewell or some source of water, managed to stay afloat but others have suffered a lot,” said Bhoi.In the western Odisha district of Sonepur, which had a rainfall deficiency of 34 per cent till August-end, farmers had a major worry as it rained non stop in September. In Jampali village of the district, farmers who earned a livelihood from vegetable cultivation and borrowed from local moneylenders were shattered after their vegetable crop of cauliflower, brinjal, tomato, long beans, bitter gourd, chilly and radish were destroyed in the September rainfall.This time we had cultivated cauliflower and cabbages and wanted to sell them at the start of the winter season at Jampali market. But the September rainfall submerged our farmlands destroying all vegetable plants,” said farmer Binod Bisi.“I don’t know how I am going to pay my loans.”Experts say heavy rainfall in the monsoon season after a prolonged dry phase is going to prove disastrous for a state like Odisha that has not been able to negotiate the adverse impacts of climate change.“For a state like Odisha, such extreme rainfall is going to be disastrous for the farmers who are clearly at their wit’s end. We are doing a vulnerability analysis and risk assessment of Odisha with the help of IIT Mandi,” said senior scientist KC Pal, ecology and environment, working in the forest and environment department.The successive natural disasters have taken their toll on farmer incomes across the state. The All India Debt and Investment Survey, conducted between January and December 2019 by the National Sample Survey Organisation, the reports of which were released this month, showed Odisha farmers had the lowest average value of asset (AVA) per farmer household at ₹6.21 lakh while Delhi topped the list with ₹4.65 million. Odisha performed worse than Assam where the AVA was ₹8.68 lakh and Jharkhand ( ₹9.61 lakh).The Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India, 2019, conducted by the National Statistical Office the report of which was released last week, showed that the average monthly income of an Odisha farmer was ₹5112, the second-lowest after Jharkhand which reported average monthly income of ₹4895.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-saw-record-september-rainfall-in-14-years-farmers-woes-rise-101633152580326.html

These cameras have a tilt angle of 180 to 270 degrees that will help in 360 degrees of an area leaving no blind spot behind. Basically, these cameras will help us keep an eye on the crowd, any abandoned object or trespassing in the stations," he stated."The data collected from these cameras will be beamed through an IP network to 12 surveillance stations and will be further relayed to a unified control command. Through these, all these 30 stations will be under a digital eye," he added.Talking about the cameras with face recognition technology, the CPRO said, "If the cameras recognise a person whose face is stored in our database, then immediately an alert will be sent to the concerned authorities. The recognition can be done through any part of the face like retina or forehead."Elaborating on the monitoring system for the cameras, the CPRO said that there will be a multilayered monitoring network for the cameras and the data collected by the cameras will be stored for a period of 30 days."These cameras are a step towards holistic surveillance as security and safety of the commuters is paramount to us," he said.Thakur informed that the cameras will be installed by the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/western-railways-to-install-2-729-cameras-with-4k-technology-across-30-stations-101633151142131.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||From Nov, Delhi govt to start survey to track inactive ration cards: Minister||From November, the Aam-Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government in Delhi will begin carrying out a door-to-door survey to track ration cards, which have been inactive for the past two to three months, Delhi food minister Imran Hussain has said. “We will conduct a door-to-door survey from next month to check beneficiaries who are not collecting ration for two-three months. We will check if the person has gone to his hometown or is sick. In such genuine cases, ration cards will not be disconnected,” Imran Hussain told PTI on Friday.Hussain also said that if the ration card is inactive and the beneficiary is not existing or has left Delhi, then such card will be cancelled and new ones will be included. The food minister assured that ration cards will not be cancelled without any valid reason. A ration card is said to be inactive when the beneficiary does not collect the subsidised ration from fair price shops for three straight months."There will be some people who must have not come in July but collected ration in August and some must have skipped August but taken food grains in September. We will spare those cards who did not come to collect ration for one or two months," Hussain further said. He added that with the use of electronic-point of sale (e-PoS) machines by the end of this month, the department will have data about beneficiaries who are contentiously not collecting ration.The Delhi government banned the use of e-PoS machines in early 2018 after complaints came in of poor network leading to authentication failures and exclusion of genuine beneficiaries. However, the system was restored in July this year. Delhi currently has around 7.2 million beneficiaries, who are delivered ration through a network of around 2,000 fair price shops under the public distribution system.Delhi food minister Hussain chaired a review meeting on September 9 to issue new ration cards and told officials to ensure that cases of biometric mismatch don’t lead to any problem for beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-nov-delhi-govt-to-start-survey-to-track-inactive-ration-cards-minister-101633144670592.html

I went to his house also, but I couldn’t meet him… they said he is in Tura,” Pala told HT over the phone late night while returning to Shillong from Delhi after a brief detour to share a quick meal with chief minister Conrad Sangma at a premier hotel in Guwahati.He said that even his messages failed to elicit any response from Dr Sangma. “I don’t know why he’s not replying. If you call me and I don’t answer, don’t I always call you back even if it is late?” he said, adding, “It’s ok, let’s leave that behind now, I will meet him at the PEC meeting later.”The PEC (Party Election Committee) meeting is scheduled for 11 am today at the sprawling Windermere Estate owned by Congress legislator from Nongthymmai, Charles Pyngrope.“It’s a brief 10-15 minutes meeting to select the candidates for the three bye-elections, I don’t think it is going to take long. I will meet Doctor after that,” Pala said.When asked about his visit to Delhi, he said it was related to a pre-scheduled Parliament Committee meeting and nothing else. “I did not meet anyone from the AICC, and I returned soon after my work to be on time for the PEC meeting,” he said.On being queried about the news of Dr Sangma possibly parting ways with the party and looking at more viable options, the politician said he was made aware of this through media reports. He replied, “Is it true? I know that he (Mukul) said he was going to Delhi to meet with the AICC leaders, what they discussed I am not aware really.”Meanwhile, all eyes are on the astute politician and his every move will remain under scrutiny. According to a person close to Dr Sangma, who is known to be extremely good at keeping secrets, “this time he is keeping all his cards really close to his chest, I doubt it if even his family knows anything”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pala-wonders-why-mukul-sangma-won-t-take-his-calls-101633145620895.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The pale white Red Fort||Great stories, they say, can also be told backwards, or sideways. Like the Red Fort. You must have seen the Mughal-era monument in all its red glory—the sandstone ramparts spread out along a great length of Delhi’s Netaji Subhash Marg. Now start afresh by heading to the Ring Road, behind. Launch a leisurely walk from Raj Ghat towards Kashmere Gate. Here the Lal Qila is sans its Lal. The Red Fort appears pale white.This is back of the fort. Indeed, the Red Fort has the distinction of being the only monument in the Capital whose rear doesn’t appear like a rear at all (try that with Jama Masjid or Hauz Khas ruins). Instead, it opens up like a book that tells the same story but in a very different style.In the old times, this side of the fort faced the Yamuna—you might have seen it in old paintings. Today the river has drifted further east and the fort has ended up facing this traffic-heavy avenue. Whatever, the much-neglected rear side offers something that the classic frontside doesn’t —a view of the innards of the fort, built by Emperor Shah Jahan as his palace when he shifted his capital to our city some 400 years ago.The fort’s rear is bordered by Dilli Chalo Park. Named after a call raised by freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, this place was until some decades ago the site of a footpath market selling all sorts of bargainable knick-knack.This evening, the gates are locked and the fountains are dry. Beyond the sandstone wall in the distance, above a tall platform, a few pigeons are hovering about a white dome that used to be the emperor’s apartment, the Khas Mahal. It is flanked by his harem, the Rang Mahal. Then there’s the Diwan-e-Khas that had the peacock throne. You see all this from the Ring Road.Walking ahead, you realise that barely anything of the Red Fort appears to be red, except the ramparts. Indeed, almost all the private apartments of the royals were built in white marble. The Lal Qila wasn’t even originally called the Lal Qila. It was Qila Mubarak, the Blessed Fort.In the walk’s final stretches, the fort wall comes so close towards the pavement that you could almost touch the old stones. In certain places, the pathway is home to homeless men, sitting silently in their motionless postures, indifferent to the historic landmark, as if it were nothing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-pale-white-red-fort-101633135716100.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||SC declines plea to keep pvt liquor vendors in Delhi open till November 16||The Supreme Court on Friday closed the doors on 260 private liquor vends in the Capital seeking a last-minute approval to remain operational beyond September 30, the cut-off date prescribed under the Delhi government’s new excise policy for private vends to shut shop for 46 days, before the new liquor regime kicks off from November 17.According to the new policy, the Delhi government required all existing liquor vends to close by September 30. For the period from October 1 till November 16, only government liquor vends will stay open to cater to the festive season rush. The government will exit the retail sale of liquor in Delhi from November 17, and all its vends will shut.In all, there are 849 liquor stores in Delhi of which more than 260 are privately run, holding L7 and L10 licenses. Around 408 liquor vends in Delhi will be operational till November 17.Demanding parity with government liquor vends to operate till November 16, the private liquor vends, mostly operating in malls, told the Supreme Court that there will be chaos at the government liquor vends during Diwali, and to avoid this, it will be “fair and just in the public interest” for private liquor vends to meet the Capital’s liquor demand.The court was hearing separate appeals filed by Radinton Tradex Private Limited and one Harish Chauhan against interim orders passed by the Delhi high court, which refused to stall the roll-out of the new excise policy. The Delhi Liquor Traders Association approached the high court against the excise policy, a matter that is still under consideration.The bench of Supreme Court justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “We are not inclined to entertain these petitions.”“What larger public interest will be served if the private liquor vends are allowed to operate till November 16,” it asked.Senior advocates Vikas Singh and Sidharth Luthra appearing for the private liquor vends told the court, “The rush outside government liquor vends is huge and this can be avoided if we are allowed to operate. Also, the state will earn revenue as we sell top quality liquor for which the customers in the Capital will go to Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.”The Delhi government appeared on caveat and was represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi who argued that the old policy was meant to expire on September 30 to ensure a smooth, seamless transfer to the new excise policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-declines-plea-to-keep-pvt-liquor-vendors-in-delhi-open-till-november-16-101633132568538.html

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ground situation belies BJP govt’s claims of development in J&K: PAGD||The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration on Friday said the ground situation in the union territory (UT) belies the BJP government’s claims of development post-abrogation of special status of J&K.The PAGD in a statement said the claims of the BJP government that the abrogation of Article 370 has paved way for new industries, created new employment opportunities, decreased terror incidents, brought atmosphere of peace and security, nurtured democracy, eradicated corruption, and brought new central laws for betterment of people in this region are nothing but “concocted and fabricated” stories while the ground situation belies these claims. “The claims in a recently released report by the Union home ministry are far from the reality. The reality is that there is a systematic disempowerment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir that is continuing to happen through bureaucratic rule,” PAGD spokesperson MY Tarigami said. He said the projects mentioned in the booklet are mostly approved by the previous governments, but shown to have been the outcome of abrogation of Article 370. “On November 7, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in Srinagar announced a reconstruction programme during the PDP-BJP coalition government of about ₹80,000 crore, known as the Prime Minister’s Development Package, to strengthen the social-economic infrastructure of Jammu & Kashmir. It is claimed that after the reorganisation of the erstwhile state, 53 projects of ₹58,477 crore in J&K and nine projects worth ₹21,441 crore in Ladakh are under progress which are the part of the PM’s 2015 package. How can you attribute this progress to abrogation of Article 370?” he asked. He said that the BJP government was boasting of implementation of various laws, like Land Reforms and the RTI Act, which were claimed to have been effective now.“This is a blatant lie as the state of Jammu and Kashmir was a pioneer in implementing the revolutionary land reforms laws which no other state had done, except Kerala to some extent. Similarly, the erstwhile state’s own RTI Act was stronger than the Union law. Its repeal when Article 370 was read down has led to chaos and complications. Without knowing the facts of the matter, BJP leaders had maintained that the people of J&K had no access to information under the RTI Act until Article 370 was read down,” he added. The spokesperson said that one of the much-touted success stories of the NDA government has been its achievement in getting bank accounts opened for women under programmes to expand their financial inclusion and gender equality. “Before the NDA assumed power, government data reveal that significant progress was made in Jammu and Kashmir in the past one decade. Article 370 was not an impediment in the overall development of the state as claimed by the government. All government data and surveys indicate a marked improvement in almost all human development indices in the state,” Tarigami said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ground-situation-belies-bjp-govt-s-claims-of-development-in-j-k-pagd-101633130978180.html

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||HP sees five deaths, 284 cases of scrub typhus this year||A total of 284 cases of scrub typhus have been detected in Himachal Pradesh and five people have died due to the bacterial disease this year so far. Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj said a total of 2,049 samples have been tested till date for scrub typhus. “A total of 284 people were found infected. The first fatality was recorded on September 8 and since then, four more people have lost their lives to the disease,” he added. Besides chikungunya and dengue, scrub typhus is the third most prevalent disease these days, Dr Raj said. Scrub typhus is a bacterial infection caused by orientia tsutsugamushi bacteria that is fatal. It is caused by the bite of infected larval mite (chigger), which is mainly found in shrubs. It is largely prevalent in the rural areas and occurs mostly during the monsoon season. Its symptoms are similar to chikungunya’s. It is spread by fleas that feed on grass-fed insects. While dengue and chikungunya are more prevalent in urban areas, scrub typhus cases are found more in villages. The symptoms of scrub typhus are fever, muscle pain, headache, cough and gastrointestinal problems. The disease is mostly caused in rural areas. The peak of the disease is August to October. Dr Raj urged people to be aware and said, “People should avoid walking barefoot and wear gloves and gumboots while working in fields. If people notice any symptoms of the disease, they should immediately visit nearby hospital.” He said it is important that bushes and grass do not grow nearby houses. If there is an outbreak of insects in the kitchen garden, steps should be taken to control it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-sees-five-deaths-284-cases-of-scrub-typhus-this-year-101633129778140.html
02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of HP bypolls, Congress steps up offensive against BJP government||Ahead of the parliamentary and assembly byelections in the end of this month, the Congress has stepped up offensive against the Jai Ram Thakur-led state BJP government over rising inflation and unemployment. Members of the Congress, led by its Himachal chief, took out a march in Dharamshala on Friday protesting against jobs given to the non-Himachalis in government departments in recent days. The protest march began from the war memorial and culminated into a public meeting at DC’s office. Rathore said a series of protests is being organised at district level against the “injustice” being done to the youth of Himachal. “I personally came here to participate in the protest as Kangra is an important district,” said Rathore. Taking on the state government, Rathore said there was an unprecedented rise in inflation under the current BJP regime while the public also suffers due to poor law and order situation. “Even the opposition leaders are being attacked,” he claimed. ‘Jobs to outsiders, injustice to Himachal youth’ Rathore said the employment scenario has deteriorated in Himachal since the Covid outbreak. “Instead, of providing relief to the youth of Himachal, the state government is giving jobs to non-Himachalis in public sector which is evident from the recruitments done in departments like electricity board and PWD,” he alleged. Rathore also claimed that the most of the non-Himachalis who have got jobs here were from the states ruled by BJP governments. Demands white paper on loans, expenditure Hitting at the state government over raising loans repeatedly, Rathore said the debt burden on Himachal has risen to more than ₹60,000 crore. “Despite the government borrowing huge amounts, the development is nowhere to be seen. The money collected by way of loans is being spent on luxuries of the ministers,” he alleged. “We demand the state government to issue a white paper on the loans raised and where the money was spent,” he added. Confident of winning bypolls Rathore also expressed confidence that the Congress will win the byelections to the Mandi parliamentary constituency and Arki, Jubbal-Kotkhai and Fatehpur assembly segments.

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||AI-powered traffic management to become reality in Chandigarh by February 2022||With the Integrated Command Control Centre (ICCC) for traffic management inching closer to being fully operationalised, city residents will soon witness Artificial Intelligence (AI) in action. For citizens, this means that traffic lights will work in tandem with road conditions to optimise the flow of traffic.This will be made possible through the Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS), a key feature of the ICCC, that has been set up at 40 junctions with the heaviest traffic volume. The key technology used is AI. With the help of smart cameras and sensors installed by the roadside, the system will monitor individual traffic lanes, number of vehicles and calculate the traffic light duration required to minimise traffic logjams. Chandigarh Smart City Limited is implementing the project through Bharat Electronics Limited. On Friday, CSCL showcased the working of the system, which has been scaled-up gradually over the past one-and-a-half-months. It has already been installed at the Tribune Chowk to good results. “The system will become fully operational in February 2022. Once the ICCC, which is under construction at Sector 17, is ready, the facility will become fully operational,” said Anil Garg, additional chief executive officer, CSCL. Currently, the system is being run from the MC office.NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL, said, “This AI-based system will reduce the travel time within the city. This will reduce the waiting time at intersections and also save fuel wastage due to idling at intersections.”Host of services under ICCCThe ICCC integrates data from different sensors, including cameras, to manage a number of functions like traffic, security, delivery of MC services, disaster management, parking, etc. When started at the Tribune Chowk, the number of traffic violations halved within a day. In addition to the ATCS, the ICCC also includes CCTV surveillance, Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS), e-challan system, Public Address System (PAS) and Dynamic Messaging System (DMS).“There will be phase-wise integration with ICCC of the smart parking, public bike sharing, ITS, SWM, utility management, meteorological department, e-governance solution, etc,” said Sharma. For ICCC, a police command and control centre, and SCADA for MC, a dedicated fibre network (250km) has been laid. CCTVs are being installed at 267 locations.“Over 2,000 smart cameras will be installed to serve different requirements,” said Sharma, adding that 1,700 had already been installed. These are gradually being made online and operationalised. In addition to road junctions, cameras are being installed at waterworks, parks, government hospitals, community centres, parking locations and schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aipowered-traffic-management-to-become-reality-in-chandigarh-by-february-2022-101633125164747.html
02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana chief minister orders payment of dues to Naraingarh sugarcane farmers||Days before farmers attached with the Naraingarh sugar mill in Ambala are scheduled to gherao the office of Haryana cane commissioner for their pending dues, chief minister Manohar Lal on Friday ordered full payment to the farmers.The order came after the CM chaired a meeting with officials concerned, including Ambala deputy commissioner Vikram, in Chandigarh. In two tweets in Hindi, CMO Haryana mentioned about the decisions.“Taking an important decision for the sugarcane farmers of the state, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal has directed the officials to ensure that the sugarcane farmers are paid at the earliest….Apart from this, the Chief Minister gave strict instructions to Naraingarh Sugar Mills that the crushing season should start before November 25, 2021 and at the same time, full payment to the farmers of this mill should be ensured,” the tweets read.Speaking to HT after the meeting, the DC said it will be ensured that the mill operations of the season start on time and the sugarcane attached with the mill wasn’t diverted, as decided earlier. “Payments will be cleared once the mill starts working,” he said.At a large mahapanchayat attended by BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni on September 28, the private mill owner, Rahul Anand, had accepted the demands of employees of the sugar mill, who had been protesting for 16 days, paving the way for timely resumption of the mill.However, there was no consensus on the pending dues worth ₹66 crore, as the owner showed his inability to clear the amount and the government showed no interest, Rajeev Sharma, district media coordinator of BKU (Charuni), said.“We have asked the administration to hold a meeting with the government till October 4, else we will protest the next day in Panchkula. We have no hope that we will receive our dues from the owner and the government wants us to wait for the mill to start, so that our payments are cleared,” Sharma said. Lashing out at the state government, Vinod Rana, president of Ganna Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, said it should clarify who will disburse the payments and by when.“The mill has been sanctioned loan by the government thrice and farmers have agitated several times in the past as well to get their payments released,” Rana said. There are almost 7,500 farm families from Panchkula, Ambala and a few from Yamunanagar attached with the mill that receives 80-90 lakh quintals of the crop annually, from 30,000 acres spread across three districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-chief-minister-orders-payment-of-dues-to-naraingarh-sugarcane-farmers-101633124617709.html

The price of petrol in Chandigarh touched ₹98.08 per litre and diesel’s ₹89.90 per litre, both all time-highs, which are expected to have an adverse effect on the cost of household commodities in the coming days.

In Panchkula, petrol’s cost is ₹99.41 per litre, while diesel is priced at ₹90.68.“This price hike is tied with the spike in fuel rates globally.

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Constable awarded four years in jail in ₹3,000 graft case||Comparing corruption to cancer, which if not detected in time will lead to disastrous consequences, a CBI court on Friday awarded four-year jail to a Chandigarh Police constable for accepting ₹3,000 bribe in 2014.The constable, Balraj Singh, was posted as naib court at the Sector 43 district courts when he was arrested on graft charges in April 2014.“The convict does not deserve the leniency prayed for by him and the same cannot be considered, as the convict was a police official working in the court and well versed with the outcome of his actions. Everyday he used to see the functions of the court and was well aware that all those who do wrong are punished by the courts,” ruled the court of special CBI judge Jagjit Singh, while pronouncing the quantum of sentence on Friday. “Corruption among public servants has always existed in one form or the other, although its shapes, dimensions, textures and shades have been changing from time to time and place to place. At one time, bribe was paid for getting wrong things done, but now bribe is paid for getting right things done at the right time,” the court added.On corruption in society, the court said, “…..many of us think that it is unavoidable. Many see it as normal and not immoral. That is disturbing. The corrupt have turned and twisted the system to suit them, and have thrived, many have prospered. Corruption is social evil, which has eroded the applicability of justness and fairness in society.”Had offered assault accused help in getting bailThe CBI had booked Balraj under the Prevention Of Corruption Act after he was caught accepting ₹3,000 as bribe from an assault accused.The complainant, Rohani, alias Romy, a resident of Milk Colony, Dhanas, had approached the bureau on April 4, 2014, alleging that Balraj had demanded ₹5,000 to help him get bail in an assault case registered at the Sector 11 police station.

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Gandhi Dham in Phillaur serves as route to illegal sand mining||As the country celebrates the 152th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Gandhi Dham in Phillaur, the memorial constructed at the place where a part of his ashes were immersed, has turned into a hotspot for illegal sand mining.Located on the banks of Sutlej River near National Highway-I (NH-I), the memorial is a picture of bureaucratic neglect. But as a yearly ritual, just before Gandhi Jayanti, the memorial and its surroundings are whitewashed to offer a red-carpet welcome to babus and politicians.As many as 50 labourers from the surrounding villages of Phillaur were seen carrying out last-minute cleaning and whitewashing in the area when this reporter visited the spot. One of the workers, while showing the tractor marks on the ground, said, “Visit the place at night and you can see hectic activity of tractors in the area. This place is frequently used as a passage by people involved in illegal sand mining.”“The memorial and its surroundings have become a haven for drug addicts. The nomadic Gujjar community, who are into livestock farming, have encroached upon the green belt around the memorial due to which maintenance becomes difficult,” another worker said.A worker, requesting anonymity, said, “The place has turned into a den of drug addicts. As the place remains secluded, drug addicts and anti-social elements frequent the place throughout the day.” “The neglect of the memorial site speaks of the scant regard governments have for freedom fighters’ sacrifices. Punjab government should save the memorial site from destruction and encroachments,” said PS Gulshan, patron, Peace Mission, and son of freedom fighter Late Ujaggar Singh Bilga.Brij Bhushan Goyal, the organising secretary of Mahatma Gandhi Peace Mission, said, “Successive governments have neglected the memorial since mid 1980s. Earlier, there was direct access to the historic memorial site, but this has been blocked due to encroachments.”He added, “The site should have been developed as a good tourist spot with a library. The grants promised by various leaders for development of the site never saw the light of the day. There should be a direct approach road from the main GT Road.” Narinder Goyal, former president of Phillaur Nagar council, said lack of bureaucratic and political will was the reason behind the sorry state of the memorial. “We have been sending repeated representations to the government for funds to restore the memorial. Sadly, neither the administration nor the politicians have issued funds for the memorial. The memorial does not fall under the municipal limits, but still, we are carrying out the cleanliness work here,” said Goyal.Despite repeated attempts, Member of Parliament from Phillaur constituency, Santokh Singh Chaudhary, who is scheduled to chair the function on Gandhi Jayanti here, was unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gandhi-dham-in-phillaur-serves-as-route-to-illegal-sand-mining-101633120657817.html

02-10-2021||Noida||Yeida launches one-time settlement scheme for property allottees to pay dues||The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Friday started the one time settlement (OTS) scheme for property allottees, who have failed to pay their dues. The window for clearing the dues will be available till November. On September 14, the Yeida, in its 71st board meeting, approved a proposal to bring OTS for all kinds of properties --residential plot, flat, industrial plot, commercial plot or mixed-land use plot. The OTS was planned in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has put people under financial duress. The allottees can apply for OTS by logging on to www.yamunaexpresswayauthority.com and clicking the OTS scheme link. “After November, nobody will be able to avail of this scheme,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yeida. The move comes after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed that the authority should levy only simple interest on the defaulted amount instead of compound interest on defaulted amount. The Yeida considers a plot or flat allottee as a defaulter if he or she fails to pay three instalments. The Yeida imposes a compound interest of 15% on the defaulted amount or even higher, instead of a simple interest, said officials. The move will benefit around 32,000 property allottees, especially those who bought property between 2009 and 2021, said officials. “If property allottees want to avail of the benefit of OTS scheme, they must deposit 30% of the total defaulted amount upfront between October 1 and November. After November, they will have to pay compound interest,” said Singh.  The Yeida allots properties after accepting 30% down payment of the total property cost. The remaining 70% is paid in instalments. If the property allottees keep defaulting the instalments, the Yeida keeps increasing compound interest. The UP government has introduced OTS so that people don’t have to shell out more amid the pandemic, said officials.Plot allottees have welcomed the move. “We have been demanding interest waiver for a long time. The OTS will benefit many property allottees,” said Rishabh Nigam, secretary of the Yamuna Expressway entrepreneurs’ association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yeida-launches-one-time-settlement-scheme-for-property-allottees-to-pay-dues-101633120238093.html

02-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: People offer Friday prayers under police vigil amid several protests||Amid threats of disruption from a group of people, members of the Muslim community offered prayers under police vigil at around 24 places in Gurugram on Friday.Police said their deployment in Sector 47 was high as many people gathered near the prayer spot to protest against the practice. “We have asked the protesters to hold a meeting with the district administration to resolve the matter,” said the police.Over the past two weeks, offering prayers at public places like parks, parking areas on Fridays has become a major issue after a group run by members of the Hindu community in Gurugram started appearing at these sites to oppose the practice. The issue was widely discussed on social media, which made the police department issue a clarification to the people on September 27, in which it said that “the matter was in cognisance, and asked the people to refrain from spreading misinformation”. Members of the Muslim community, who were present in Sector 47 on Friday, said that the prayer spot was away from the nearby residential area. “Muslims offer congregation prayers only on Fridays, Eid, and Eid al-Adha. There’s only a small mosque in Sector 57, New Gurgaon, and everyone can’t go there on Fridays or on these occasions... Lands have not been allotted for mosques for quite a long time now. We want the Haryana government to allot us land for mosques in every sector, so that we can comfortably offer prayers there,” said Altaf Ahmad, founder member, Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch -- a Gurugram-based civil society organisation.Ahmad said that opposition to prayers is becoming a regular affair, and some vested persons have been engaged in this. “We faced similar problems earlier in March-April this year, and it hurt the religious sentiments of the masses,” he said, calling for strict action against such elements.Gurugram Police, meanwhile, said that prayers at designated spots took place peacefully on Friday, and the police maintained a close watch there. “Police personnel were deployed in Sector 47, as it was expected that people might protest there against offering of prayers. A team, led by an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), maintained law and order in the area,” said Subash Boken, spokesperson of the Gurugram Police.Aman Yadav, ACP (Sadar), who was on duty in Sector 47 on Friday, said, “The residents have the right to protest peacefully... and they have agreed to our suggestion to hold a meeting with the district administration to discuss this matter.”Raman Malik, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader, who has written a letter to the Gurugram administration on this issue, said that the Haryana Waqf Board has ample land, and it should use some of that for religious purposes. “Offering prayers is a private affair, and in a secular country like India, it should happen either inside homes or at religious places, not at public parks and parking areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-people-offer-friday-prayers-under-police-vigil-amid-several-protests-101633119877628.html

With 30,984 people being vaccinated in a day, the district achieved more than 50% of the target for the vaccination drive on Thursday itself.According to the data, nearly 6,178 first doses and 25,506 second doses of vaccines were administered on Friday. With this, over 3.1 million have been vaccinated in the district so far.According to officials, people will be vaccinated at 139 centres across the district on Saturday. The first dose of Covishield will be administered at two centres, and second dose at 103 centres.The health department, meanwhile, has also increased the number of vaccination sites for Covaxin from five to 34, for Saturday. This will maximise the chances of a complete vaccination in the district as the gap between the two doses of Covaxin is lesser compared to Covishield.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “At present, we aim to ensure that the maximum number of people get both the doses, so we have increased the number of sites for the first dose of Covaxin as the gap between its two doses is lesser. With this, we will be able to vaccinate a greater number of people during the festive season.”The first dose of Covaxin will be available at all 34 centres, and the second dose at 10 centres. Doses of Sputnik V vaccine will also be available at the Polyclinic in Sector 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-crosses-60-000-target-set-for-3-day-mega-coronavirus-vaccination-drive-101633119818791.html
02-10-2021||Gurugram||New panel to address issues at Iffco Chowk, Rajiv Chowk pedestrian underpasses||The Gurugram administration has formed a four-member committee for carrying out field visits at two pedestrian underpasses -- Iffco Chowk and Rajiv Chowk -- in the city, for identifying and addressing the issues and resolving those accordingly, said officials on Friday. Deputy commissioner Dr Yash Garg took this decision during a meeting on the district road safety on Thursday.“During the meeting, officials of Gurugram administration, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Raahgiri Foundation, and Gurugram traffic police had raised the issues faced by pedestrians at the two underpasses. The issues need a thorough assessment, so as to resolve those. Hence, a committee comprising representatives from each of the four departments concerned has been formed for this task,” said Garg.Garg had directed the committee officials to assess the design feasibility of the Rajiv Chowk underpass, and make proper arrangements for lighting, CCTV cameras, and signboards at the Iffco Chowk underpass.Ishan Gogoi, programme coordinator, Raahgiri Foundation -- who also attended the Thursday meeting, said that officials of the foundation, NHAI, Gurugram administration, and Gurugram Police had visited the two underpasses on Wednesday.“During the visits, we conveyed our observations to the district road safety committee, which led to the formation of the four-member committee. The committee’s main task is to check if the two underpasses can be revived, and also come up with alternatives to facilitate the crossing of pedestrians at both the junctions,” said Gogoi, adding that the committee is exploring possibilities of introducing traffic signals at these junctions, and it will take a call on recommending that depending on the feasibility.The non-motorised transport (NMT) underpass at Rajiv Chowk has been closed since July 19, when an auto-driver had allegedly drowned inside it after the facility was flooded with water following spells of heavy rainfall. Pedestrians said that the underpass, near Jaipur bus stand, is unlit, and empty alcohol bottles and cigarette filters are often found inside it, which deterred them from accessing it.During the committee’s Wednesday visit, the NMT underpass was also found to be closed, said Gogoi. Following which, the contractor of the underpass was served a notice and given a one-month deadline to reopen the facility after ensuring it is properly lit and clean. The underpass was, however, closed on Friday.Due to the prevailing issues, both the underpasses see little to no users. “Even when the NMT underpass was open, I never used it because of safety concerns... people consume liquor or drugs inside it quite often,” said Rajiv, who works at a nearby hotel.The Iffco Chowk underpass, near Sulabh Complex, is also unlit. However, unlike the NMT underpass, this underpass is more compact, with air circulation and lack of daylight being major issues, according to the pedestrians. “Even during daytime, I have to turn on my cellphone’s torch to get a view of the underpass. The air circulation inside it is poor, due to which people feel suffocated there,” said Kunal Yadav, a resident of Sukhrali village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/new-panel-to-address-issues-at-iffco-chowk-rajiv-chowk-pedestrian-underpasses-101633119817418.html
02-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram administration issues guidelines to combat air pollution this winter||The Gurugram administration on Friday issued directions to nearly 40 city-based agencies to combat air pollution in the district, ahead of the winter. The air quality plummets across the national capital region (NCR) during winters, every year.According to the directions, which came into effect from Friday, all the departments concerned have to appoint nodal officers for ensuring enforcement of the action plan within 15 days.It mentioned that large construction projects, including highways and metros, will provide undertakings to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) within 15 days, that they will assure adherence to the prescribed norms for dust management in the district. Industries have also been instructed to provide an undertaking to the board that they will only use authorised fuel, and will not operate without adequate pollution control measures.“Compliance of action plans on the identified pollution hotspots in Gurugram shall be ensured by all those concerned, and night patrolling shall also be done by teams constituted at the district level. Further, there should be enhanced vigilance at sources such as industrial stacks and garbage dumping as well as use of illegal fuels. All technologies to control dust emission, including smog-guns, should be used extensively,” according to the order.The Gurugram administration order also mentioned that solid waste dumping issues have to be addressed on a priority basis. Along with these measures, the authorities concerned have been asked to sprinkle water on roads and streets in shifts -- both during days and nights -- and use mechanised sweeping machines to control the dust.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of HSPCB, Gurugram (north), said that directions have been issued to 40 agencies in the city, including Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, Haryana transport department, among others.“All the authorities concerned have been asked to comply with the guidelines, and the nodal officers will submit action reports daily. With strict enforcement of all measures and regular night patrolling, we will be able to keep the air quality in check during the winter months. Strict action will be taken against the violators,” said Singh.The main causes for pollution in Gurugram have been identified as dust pollution due to construction and demolition activities, vehicular pollution, and solid waste burning.The pollution control board has identified 18 hotspots for vehicular air emissions or traffic congestion, 13 hotspots for road dust, 10 areas used for rampant solid waste disposal, and seven hotspots for industrial air emissions.The board has now proposed a meeting to be attended by all the NCR districts, along with the Centre, for air quality management, within the next 10 days. They will review and finalise further action in this regard. The board has also set up dust control and management cells on the directions of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).In January, 2021, the CAQM had reviewed the problems of road dust -- a major source of pollutants contributing significantly to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM 10) in its second meeting. In a letter to all the NCR states, it had said, “Controlling dust pollution has been a major challenge and needs much more focused attention across the NCR.”The commission had said that dust control and management cells must be set up with the specific task of monitoring and implementing dust control measures. Some dust control measures include mechanical cleaning and sweeping of roads and water sprinkling to reduce the dust pollution.In December last year, the CAQM had also stressed on the need to develop and implement a standard set of methods across the NCR and adjoining areas for monitoring fire events.The issue of stubble burning in these states becomes a major issue during the paddy harvesting season between October and November over the past years due to spikes in air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR. Farmers set their fields on fire to clear them of crop residue left behind after harvesting paddy and before cultivating wheat and potato. Farmers continue stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana as there is a short time window between paddy harvesting and sowing of wheat. Farmers also cite the high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw as a reason behind their preference to burn stubble.Meanwhile, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data, the air quality in Gurugram dipped to the ‘moderate’ category on Friday, as compared to the ‘satisfactory’ category on Thursday. The city recorded an AQI of 102, with PM2.5 and PM10 as prominent pollutants on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-administration-issues-guidelines-to-combat-air-pollution-this-winter-101633119757587.html
02-10-2021||Admission||100% cutoffs the new normal for Delhi University?||When Shri Ram College of Commerce first announced a 100% cut-off for BCom (Honours) in 2011, the move evoked strong reactions from stakeholders, including parents and students who believed the course was beyond their reach. A decade later, the college has announced 100% cut-offs for two courses yet again. But this time, so have seven other colleges, both off-campus and south campus.Last year, Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College had announced 100% cut-off for three courses – political science, economics, and psychology. All three were among the most sought-after courses in DU.In 2015, two colleges, College of Vocational Studies and Indraprastha (IP) College for Women, fixed their cut-offs at 100% for BSc (Honours) in Computer Science. This year, three colleges have declared 100% cut-offs for computer science due to the high demand. Across colleges, principals attributed the soaring cut-offs to multiple factors, including a change in the evaluation pattern for Class 12 students, cancellation of end-term exams due to Covid-19 pandemic, a lack of subject-wise data for admissions, and most importantly, double the number of Class 12 top scorers as compared to last year.A total of 220,156 students scored 90% or more marks in their Class 12 this year, as compared to 196,620 in 2020 — a jump of nearly 12%. Students scoring 95% or more almost doubled to 70,004 from last year’s 38,686.Around 70-80% of applicants in DU are from CBSE-affiliated schools.In 2019, when the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) last managed to conduct exams for all papers o Class 12 without hindrance, 111,992 students scored between 90% and 100%. That means, the number of high scorers has increased by 96% between 2019 and 2021 – indicating the impact of the revised assessment schemes on board results.This year, Class 12 students were evaluated on the basis of their Class 10 board exam scores and internal marks of classes 11 and 12, with around 70% weightage being given to internal assessments.In the past, colleges have set 100% cut-offs for students seeking admission to those subjects that they may not have studied in school.This year, Jesus and Mary College kept 100% cut-off for psychology for those students who excluded psychology from their best-of-four combination. In contrast, students who included the subject in the best-of-four calculation need 99% to be eligible for admission.Hindu College principal Anju Shrivastava said in the past two years, the college has seen an average of 100 students seeking admissions to various courses with 100% cut-offs. The college has kept 100% cut-off for Political Science (Hons) this year.“Along with the CBSE, several other state boards, including Kerala and Telangana, also had more students getting 100% marks this year. Last year, with a cut-off of 99.5%, we admitted double the number of students in the unreserved category. As per the data we have, we knew there would be a rush for political science; so we wanted to play safe and avoid over-admissions, which affect the teacher-student ratio and put additional infrastructure burden on colleges.”The high cut-offs, year after year, have also given rise to the demand for a common entrance test. To that end, the modalities for Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) have been submitted to the education ministry this year. However, since the approval for CUCET is pending, DU continued with its merit-based admission process.Suman Kumar, who teaches political science at Rajdhani College, said, “A central entrance test for applicants or at least a combined weightage of Class 12 scores and entrance test is the only way to counter high cut-offs. The government should also open more colleges, create infrastructure, and hire more teachers to meet the higher education demand.”Since there is no first-come, first-served policy in Delhi University, colleges are required to give admissions to all applicants who meet the announced cut-off criteria, leading to over-admissions. This essentially means that colleges end up admitting more students than the number of sanctioned seats.In the previous years, the DU admission process allowed applicants to select courses they wished to apply for. Since the process was changed last year, colleges are in the blind about the number of applicants for a particular subject and have to rely on trends to gauge which courses will receive more applicants.Principal of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, Jaswinder Singh, who is also the president of the DU principals’ association, said, “Many outstation students earlier applied to only a few colleges. This meant that off-campus colleges often could not fill their seats. That is why the university decided to do away with the option of selecting colleges. Later, the option to select courses was also removed. While this gave students more options, colleges were left with no data on ascertaining the preferred courses, which is a metric for deciding cut-offs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/admissions/100-cutoffs-the-new-normal-for-delhi-university-101633119697567.html

02-10-2021||Kolkata||‘BJP deployed CBI under Mamata’s nose’: BJP leader Rahul Sinha at Bengal event||KOLKATA: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has deployed the Central Bureau of investigation (CBI) in Bengal “right under Mamata’s nose” and she is not able to do anything, senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha claimed at an event in Kolkata, prompting the Trinamool Congress to hit back contending that the statement was an acknowledgement that the BJP was using CBI to hurt Bengal’s ruling party.“Thousands of our workers were driven out of their homes after the poll results were announced on May 2. Women were tortured. More than 40 BJP workers were killed. They thought they could get away with anything. The BJP has shown what it can do. The BJP deployed the the CBI right under Mamata’s nose. She is not being able to do anything now,” Rahul Sinha, a former president of BJP’s West Bengal unit, said on Friday evening.“The CBI is probing the post-poll violence. It is arresting the perpetrators. If we continue to struggle, we will surely establish BJP rule in Bengal,” said Sinha. Rahul Sinha was speaking at an event organised by the Bengal BJP unit to felicitate Sukanta Majumdar, who was appointed the party’s state president on September 20.Sinha’s statement drew an immediate reaction from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “The BJP has admitted in public that BJP is using the CBI. The probe agencies are being used because the BJP could not politically defeat us.”To be sure, the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench, headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal, ordered the CBI probe into post-poll violence on August 19 on a bunch of petitions including one filed by Priyanka Tibrewal, the BJP who contested the by-elections against chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Bhabanipur on September 30The high court ordered CBI to probe serious allegations ofof rape and murder while a special investigation team of the state police was told to investigate allegations of arson and loot under the court’s supervision.The West Bengal government has faulted the high court order and appealed to the Supreme Court, accusing CBI of framing functionaries of the ruling Trinamool Congress in false cases and questioning the high court’s reliance on the report of a committee that had three lead members with alleged links with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party in power at the Centre.The Supreme Court on Tuesday admitted the West Bengal government’s petition and will hear the case on October 7.Rahul Sinha also targeted the Election Commission (EC) for holding the by-poll at Bhawanipore on September 30, and not later that would have forced Mamata Banerjee to step down.“The EC was yearning to make Mamata Banerjee the chief minister. It did not have Bengal’s culture and the Puja festivals in mind while selecting October 30 as the date for the bypolls at four other seats. It insulted Bengal’s people. Even so, couldn’t the Bhawanipore by-poll for Mamata Banerjee be held at that time? What was the hurry?” said Sinha.The bypolls he referred to will be held because the winners either died or resigned. “Even if Mamata Banerjee wins from Bhawanipore, her government will not last till 2026. West Bengal will witness a Taliban-like regime if we cannot oust her,” said Sinha. Other BJP leaders who spoke at the event skipped the two points that Sinha made.Dilip Ghosh, who preceded Sukanta Majumdar as state BJP chief, said: “The TMC came to power because we failed to convince people that we could form government. People thought the BJP cannot win more than 100 seats and hence chose as the opposition party. Till the day we win their confidence, we have to go forward as a formidable opposition,” said Ghosh. Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP in December last year, stressed on the need to strengthen the party at the polling booth level.“We will not be able to form government as long as we do not have strong committees for all 77,000 polling booth areas in the state. In our elections, 51% vote means 100 (victory) and 49 % means zero. We hit the streets in a big way and our campaigns were a grand affair but we fell behind because of weakness at polling booth level organisations.”“However, it has been proved that Bengal will have only two parties for the next 20 years,” Adhikari added.Majumdar called for a relentless struggle against the TMC. “We have nothing to lose. If Himanta Biswa Sarma could oust the government in Assam, can’t we do it in Bengal? We have to protect the homeland of the Hindus. We will not appease anyone. We want the votes of all Bengalis, they may be Muslims or Hindus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-deployed-cbi-under-mamata-s-nose-bjp-leader-rahul-sinha-at-bengal-event-101633118918848.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court asks LG to act against prosecutor missing case hearings||A Delhi court has directed the Lieutenant Governor (LG) to take appropriate action against the special public prosecutor (SPP) for not appearing during the hearing of some northeast Delhi riots cases.The court noted that all its earlier directions to higher officials, including the police commissioner, regarding the non-representation of the state, have fallen on deaf ears.On September 29, chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Arun Kumar Garg noted that when one of the cases — FIR 104/2020 — was listed for arguments on charges, the state sought an adjournment on the ground that the SPP was not in the country. This irked the court, which recorded that the SPP had last appeared in court on November 28, 2020 and thereafter only on August 13 this year for the case pertaining to rioting, unlawful assembly etc. in the Dayalpur area.The judge noted that the court had issued repeated directions to the deputy commissioner of police (N-E) as well as the commissioner of police, Delhi, to ensure the presence of the SPPs at every hearing so that proceedings are not stalled.It said that officials had also been directed to depute a substitute SPP in unavoidable cases.“However, all the directions have fallen deaf ears...I deem it appropriate to bring the aforesaid fact to the notice of the lieutenant governor of Delhi with a request to him to take appropriate action so as to ensure that the State is properly represented in all the riots cases before this court on each and every date fixed in the matters,” the judge said in his order.Delhi Police did not comment on the matter. Of late, the roles of Delhi Police and the SPPs have come under the courts’ scanner, prompting Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana to form a special investigation cell (SIC) to monitor the progress of the riots cases.On September 29, the judge also directed the DCP (N-E) to provide “coloured photographs and CCTV footage to all the accused in all the matters pertaining to N-E riots pending before this court...within three days”, noting that the prosecution is not supplying it without specific directions from the court, which in turn delays committal/trial of the cases.Meanwhile, in a separate case, the court sought an explanation from the investigating officer for dropping Indian Penal Code section 436 (arson) from the supplementary charge sheet after cognizance had already been taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-asks-l-g-to-act-against-prosecutors-missing-case-hearings-101633118917617.html

The high court bench of Justice Avneesh Jhingan took the decision after hearing all the parties. Ranjit Singh’s son Jagseer Singh had approached the court in August seeking directions for the transfer of the case to any other court in the region. Ranjit Singh was murdered in 2002. According to the CBI, Ranjit was killed as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter on sexual exploitation of female disciples on the dera premises. Jagseer had questioned adjournments granted by the CBI judge a number of times since joining and also levelled allegations against a CBI public prosecutor for “interfering” in the “administration of justice” and “influencing” the proceedings. The CBI has denied allegations against its public prosecutor. Acting on the plea, the high court on August 24 had restrained the special CBI court, Panchkula, from pronouncing the final verdict, two days before the final order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ranjeet-singh-murder-hc-reserves-judgment-on-plea-seeking-transfer-of-trial-101633118557624.html

Tiwari, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Purvanchali face in Delhi, said the decision has hurt the sentiments of the community.The former Delhi BJP chief met members of Chhath Puja committees on Friday to discuss the recent ban on Chhath Puja celebrations by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority. The Delhi government cancelled the celebrations for the second consecutive year.Addressing the gathering, Tiwari questioned the ban and said that the situation has returned to almost normal (the number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital is low) and all services are being reopened, including weekly markets, and large gatherings are being allowed.He later tweeted, “1.8 crore people have got vaccinated…weekly markets, Metro, buses, theatre, liquor vends etc. are all open, then why can’t people celebrate Chhath while following Covid-19 restrictions, @ArvindKejriwal? Please meet and provide a solution.”The spokespersons of the Delhi government and office of the lieutenant governor did not respond for comment .In a recent order, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority banned Chhath Puja celebrations, while allowing Ramleela and Dussehra, Durga Puja celebrations in the Capital, though with restrictions.Chhath Puja, a three-day festival, will be celebrated between November 8 and 10 this year. It is popular in states such as Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and parts of Madhya Pradesh.

All the mining contracts are in place as per the existing policy, the government told the court. Terming the plea premature, the court allowed withdrawal of the plea.The plea was filed by Mahadev Enclave Private Limited, a mining firm, which had approached the high court last week seeking quashing of the September 20 state cabinet decision. In the first cabinet meeting, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had sought a survey of the prices of sand and how to provide sand at cheaper rates, it was claimed. In the meeting, it was also decided to allow landowners to do mining in their areas. The contractor termed the decision a “political gimmick” ahead of the assembly elections and claimed that the decision was totally illegal and arbitrary as it is against the law laid down in various judgments. The firm had also told the court that the move would lead to an “environmental disaster”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petition-in-high-court-against-punjab-government-s-new-mining-policy-withdrawn-101633118257313.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC closes over 1,000 cases petty crimes involving kids||The Delhi high court has closed 1,108 cases of petty crimes allegedly committed by juveniles and ordered their immediate release, noting that enquiry in the cases has been pending or inconclusive for over a year.On Wednesday, a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani gave two weeks to the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) to pass a formal order in each of the cases, and directed that the children “be released immediately without waiting” for the formal orders.Petty crimes under Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act are defined as those which entail a maximum imprisonment up to three years. These include offences such as assault, theft, forgery etc.Noting that the pendency of petty offences involving children has increased by 44% in the last six months, the court, in its 15-page order, said, “In all cases alleging petty offences against children/juveniles, where the inquiry has been pending and remains inconclusive for longer than 1 year, regardless of whether the subject child/juvenile has been produced before the JJB, all such inquiries shall stand terminated with immediate effect…”The order comes while hearing a criminal reference, concerning the circumstances when a child in conflict with law also happens to be a child in need for care and protection, by the principal magistrate of the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB)-2, Delhi Gate. The criminal reference was tagged with a petition filed through the NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA). Appearing for BBA, advocate Prabhsahay Kaur highlighted the pendency of petty crimes at JJBs.The DCPCR had first in March, recommended the release of the children under section 14 of the JJ Act which mandates that the inquiry pertaining to petty offences against a child in conflict with law shall stand terminated if it remains inconclusive after four months, which can be extended by two more months for valid reasons.During the hearing, DCPCR told the court that a total of 1,108 such cases were pending for over a year as on June 30, and 795 cases were pending for a period between 6 months and a year.Anu Grover Baliga, secretary of the Delhi State Legal Services Authority, had informed the court that cases remain pending before JJBs for over six months as determining the age of the juvenile takes substantial time.“Worse still...by reason of the truncated functioning of courts resulting from the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, juveniles were not being produced before the JJBs at all... and, since it was understood that the time of four months stipulated in section 14 would begin to run only after the date of first production of the child before the JJB, hundreds of matters relating even to petty offences have been languishing at various stages...,” the bench noted in its order.“...we direct that in consonance with the spirit of Section 10, the child must be so produced before the JJB...within a period of 24 hours of the child becoming subject of processes under the JJ Act,” the court said.The court said even though most of the children are not “apprehended” by the police, or are handed over to their parents immediately if apprehended, the pendency of the case is “stigmatic and impacts the dignity of the child”.“Therefore, this situation must not be allowed to continue...,” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-closes-over-1-000-cases-petty-crimes-involving-kids-101633118141069.html

Interacting with mediapersons, he said that education and sports are interconnected fields through which the talent in youngsters can be tapped to channelise their energy in a right way. “Ultra-modern facilities will be provided to youngsters. A special movement would be started in the villages in the coming days to connect people in villages with sporting activities as it would act as a catalyst against the drug menace,” he said. Also, the minister called upon the Punjabi diaspora to join hands with the state government to take the state’s development to a new scale. Special committees will be formed to get inputs from renowned professionals and technical experts to make functioning of both the departments more effective, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-introduce-major-reforms-in-education-sports-sectors-in-punjab-says-minister-pargat-singh-101633118017355.html
02-10-2021||Delhi||PM Modi says ‘garbage mountains’ need to be wiped out||While launching the second phase of government’s flagship programme, Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid emphasis on wiping out the “mountains of garbage” from India’s cities by processing all legacy waste.Indirectly alluding to the Ghazipur landfill, one of the largest dumps in India, Modi said, “While on the subject of clearing these huge mounds of garbage from cities, there is one such mountain of garbage in Delhi too. It has been sitting there for years, waiting to be removed.”Urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri, who was also at the event, was seen nodding in agreement as the PM spoke.Dubbed the tallest waste mountain in the country — in 2019, before bio-mining began in Ghazipur, the mounds were as high as 65 metres, just eight shorter than the Qutub Minar — the Ghazipur landfill was established in 1984 and reached capacity in 2002. But the city’s waste continued to be dumped there even after that. The result 70-acre landfill now holds more than 14 million tonnes of legacy waste, said municipal officials.To put this volume in perspective, the amount of garbage in Ghazipur is more than the combined volume in both Okhla and Bhalswa landfill sites. A section of the mound collapsed in September 2017, killing two travelling on the road adjacent to it.In July 2019, the Prime Minister’s office tasked the principal scientific advisor to the government of India with finding a solution to the Ghazipur waste problem. Some initial steps towards resolving the problem have been taken, civic body officials said. Based on directions issued by the National Green Tribunal, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) launched a bio-mining exercise in 2019 to flatten the garbage mountain.Shyam Sunder Agarwal, mayor, EDMC, said the corporation has set a December 2024 deadline to clear the landfill. Bio-mining is currently being done using trommel machines that separate the waste into plastic, paper, cloth, sand and bricks.A senior EDMC official said,“The mixed legacy waste is fed into the main trommel through a conveyor belt. The trommel consists of a cylindrical rotating sieve into which air is blown from one end. Heavy stuff like soil and stones fall through the cylindrical sieve while lighter components such as plastic and paper fall at the farthest end.”“The various components of mixed waste can also be separated in this manner by simply varying the size of sieves in the trommel machines,” the official said, asking not to be named.Agarwal said the corporation has been facing problems in disposing of the recovered inert material. “We have decided to appoint a single company for the removal of at least 50 lakh [5 million] tonnes of legacy waste as well as the disposal of recovered material. The company will also set up an engineered landfill site on a 10-acre recovered site as well as a leachate plant,” he said.The east body has, so far, deployed 20 trommel machines in Ghazipur, with a capacity to process and remove at least 3,000 tonnes of legacy waste a day. The EDMC claimed it has removed 775,000 tonnes of legacy waste since 2019. Agarwal said the height of the Ghazipur landfill has now reduced by 15m.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/swachh-bharat-2-0-pm-modi-says-garbage-mountains-need-to-be-wiped-out-101633117897341.html

They allegedly manhandled a few policemen before other personnel responded to the situation, fired some rounds in the air, and chased away the mob, senior police officers said.The incident was captured by a local resident on his cellphone.Additional deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Vikram Singh said, “We have registered a case of attempt to murder, creating ruckus, damaging property and obstructing police personnel from performing their duties. So far, 53 people have been arrested.”A senior police officer said the foreigners were angry over the death of a man of African origin at a private hospital near Dwarka Mor, where he was brought in an unconscious state on September 26. Doctors declared him dead on arrival and told his friends that since it was a medico-legal matter, they had to inform police. They were not in favour of this, which led to an altercation and police were called. “When the police tried to explain the legal procedure, the men became aggressive and left. Around an hour later, 70-80 foreigners gathered at the Mohan Garden police station and resorted to violence,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/53-foreigners-arrested-for-violence-vandalism-at-police-station-in-delhi-101633117666397.html

The SAD leader, who reached the Food Corporation of India (FCI)’s regional office with a trolley of fresh harvested paddy, said the crop was well within permissible moisture limits and the government should start procurement at the earliest. According to the earlier schedule, the procurement was to begin on Friday. The Union ministry of food and public distribution has put okayed the postponement on the basis of report by FCI. “The arrangements for paddy procurement were not made on time due to infighting in the ruling Congress. The state does not have gunny bags. Labour and transport tenders have not been finalised,” alleged Sukhbir. Also, the level of moisture in a test conducted in the presence of FCI officials was recorded at 12.9% against the permissible limit of 17%. Sukhbir asked the FCI officials to push for advancing the date of procurement there was no issue with regards to moisture level in the grain. “In case, the central government did not withdraw its decision and start procurement, we will launch an agitation,” he announced.“Paddy has started reaching the ‘mandis’. Postponing purchase of paddy will spell a doom for the state’s economy and will result in harassment of farmers,” said former deputy chief minister.Former minister Daljit Singh Cheema also accompanied him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/start-paddy-procurement-as-per-previous-schedule-sukhbir-badal-to-punjab-government-101633117597408.html

Along with this, provision for video fencing equipped with remote connectivity technology will have to be incorporated on the web portal for effective and round-the-clock monitoring of compliance of dust mitigation measures by the project proponents,” the statement read.It added, “Further, the project proponents are required to install reliable and low-cost PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) sensors at construction sites.”The air quality monitoring body said this move will help agencies self-audit and certify their compliance with the stipulated dust control measures and will also strengthen the monitoring of dust control measures at construction and demolition sites.“The project proponents will have to upload the self-declaration on a fortnightly basis. Further, directions have been issued to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and other state pollution control boards (SPCB) of NCR to strictly monitor compliance of dust mitigation measures by project proponents,” they said.Rai says CP smog tower cut pollution by 80%The Delhi government’s first smog tower installed at Connaught Place has reduced air pollution in the vicinity by up to 80%, environment minister Gopal Rai claimed on Friday.While inspecting the smog tower installed at Baba Kharak Singh Marg in CP on Friday, Rai said the preliminary reports of the filtered air quality shows that the smog tower was cleaning up to 80% of the polluted air in the area around it.“We have constituted a 16-member committee today (Friday) to closely monitor the smog tower.

The level of PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) of 166µg/m3 was also brought down to 41ug/m3 after purification, he claimed. Experts have, however, expressed apprehension about effectiveness of smog towers. “The measurements reported to substantiate the effectiveness of the smog tower seem to be capturing the difference between the quality at the inlet and outlet. However, to truly determine if the device has any impact on a substantive area in the surrounding, measurements must be made at various distances from the device in different directions to assess how far its impact zone is. This is anyway slated to happen over the coming months. What would be useful would be to mount measuring devices and display monitors to create public evidence,” said Karthik Ganesan, Fellow and Research Director, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the smog tower, which was set up on the directions of the Supreme Court, on August 23. The government had ordered a one-month trial to assess if the tower is beneficial. The government said that about 10,000 filters and 40 fans are installed in the smog tower, which is designed to clean polluted air in a one kilometre radius, at a rate of about 1,000 cubic metres per second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/antismog-tower-in-delhi-s-cp-reduced-pollution-by-80-env-min-gopal-rai-101633117057422.html

This road is pending due to a delay in land acquisition by the PMC. We have decided to knock on the doors of the High Court for justice,” said Rajendra Chuttar, president of the trust.Protests have been going on demanding completion of the link road since 2014. HT reported this issue in 2017 and in 2019.Seema Agrawal, vice-president of the trust and a resident of Baner Pashan link road, said, “In 2005 when we booked a flat in the area we envisioned this place being close to Pashan and Baner, via the link road. It’s been over 10 years that we are staying here and still there is no progress on the link road.” Speaking on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Satya Muley, who will move the motion before the Bombay High Court next week, said “The fundamental Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees full enjoyment of life, which includes the right of enjoyment of proper roads, streets. The Supreme Court has held - right to life, includes civic amenities like roads. The residents of the region have exhausted all other remedies. They are moving the Bombay High Court to enforce their fundamental rights”Dinkar Gojare, PMC’s road department official said, “I just got to know about the PIL through a message, but PMC has been working on acquiring land through TDR, FSI with many properties on that link road. The stretch is a total of 1200 metres and we are now facing a problem with three property holders. They are not cooperating with the authorities.

02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Congress slams BJP government for postponing paddy procurement||Slamming the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Haryana for delaying the procurement of paddy, the Congress on Friday said postponement of procurement will prove detrimental to farmers’ interests.Addressing a press conference, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala also demanded relaxation in moisture parameters for government procurement.Attacking the BJP government’s decision to postpone procurement of paddy till October 11, Surjewala said the anti-farmer face of the Modi-Khattar governments has been exposed once again.“The state government had announced to start paddy procurement from September 25 but the government is deferring it time and again. It is tormenting the farmers by announcing a new date every other week. Consequently, about 20 lakh quintal paddy is lying under the open skies in Haryana mandis,” Surjewala said.The former minister said paddy had started arriving in mandis from September 20. “But 11 days have passed and not a grain of the crop at minimum support price (MSP) has been procured in Haryana. This is a clear conspiracy to end paddy procurement at MSP and leave farmers at the mercy of open markets,” he said.Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in a statement described the new government order on paddy procurement as a cruel joke on farmers.“The government itself had fixed September 25 for start of procurement. Later, it was shifted to October 1 and now the purchase has been postponed till October 11,” Hooda said.He said the farmers are bearing the brunt of the weather on one hand and the government’s shifting policies on the other.Former minister Sampat Singh in a statement said the anti-farmer policies of the central and state governments are causing untold misery to the peasants. He said there will be utter chaos in the mandis if the crop is not lifted immediately.The former minister said the government had set a target of procuring 60 lakh tonne of paddy. But the way procurement is being delayed, it might not even touch the half-way mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-slams-bjp-government-for-postponing-paddy-procurement-101633115437020.html

They said farmers cannot afford another 10 days’ delay in harvesting as this will cause huge losses to them.They alleged that the government is intentionally delaying procurement so that private traders can purchase paddy below the minimum support price (MSP).Aulakh announced that farmers will gherao the CM’s residence in Karnal on Saturday.Similar protests were reported from Kaithal, Kurukshetra and Panipat districts as farmers locked the gates of market committees to express their resentment.In Kaithal, BKU (Charuni) leader Hoshiar Singh Gill demanded resignation of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala as he had announced that procurement will start from September 25 but he did not have any say in this coalition government.Even the arhtiya association has demanded the government to start procurement without any further delays. The association’s Karnal district president Rajneesh Chaudhary said thousands of quintals of paddy have already arrived at various grain mandis in district as this may cause a glut situation in the mandis.BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni has already announced to gherao houses of all MPs and MLAs of the ruling parties on October 2 if the procurement is not started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-protest-delay-in-paddy-procurement-threaten-to-intensify-agitation-101633115137518.html
02-10-2021||Noida||Residents of Gautam Budh Nagar go green to make city garbage free||From advocating against single-use plastics to starting a crockery bank to replacing everyday plastic products with its sustainable alternatives, residents of Gautam Buddh Nagar have been on a mission to ensure a cleaner and greener city. On October 1, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the phase 2 of the Swachh Bharat Mission aiming to make all cities garbage free, HT brings you a list of green initiatives initiated by residents of Gautam Budh Nagar aspiring to achieve the same dream. Since the past three months, at least 100 households in Noida’s Arun Vihar have been recycling their dry waste and about 30 of them are composting their wet waste, essentially moving closer to zero-waste homes. The initiative was started by Arun Vihar residents’ group ‘Saaph’ (Sustainable Alternatives and Awareness against Plastics and Household waste), led by seven women. “We have registered with an organization, about which we got to know about a year ago, that recycles dry waste and takes it from us every fortnight. The minimum requirement for a locality to get registered for pick up of dry waste was 30 households and we had only seven such interested households. We took it as a challenge and encouraged more households in the neighbourhood to get registered and start recycling dry waste. Today, 100 households from Arun Vihar are a part of the initiative,” said Radhika Gulati, a resident of Arun Vihar and a member of SAAPH.“Not all households registered for dry waste are composting wet waste at home as of now. We continue to create awareness and encourage people to create home compost using wet waste. As of now, 30 households in the locality are actively using home compost kits for their wet waste and we hope more people join in,” said Supriya Sardana, another resident of Arun Vihar and a member of SAAPH who also runs a ‘crockery bank’ to cut the use of disposable plastic utensils.A ‘crockery bank’ lets people borrow steel utensils for free on different occasions like birthdays or festivals. People can then wash and return the utensils, reducing their dependency on disposable plastic plates, spoons or glasses.A similar initiative is run by Madhu Mittal, a resident of Sector 50, who has been actively advocating against the use of single-use plastic for over four years now. “I have over 800 units of steel utensils which are often rented out free of cost across the city for community lunches, religious gatherings or birthdays,” said Mittal, who runs the initiative Jan Jagran Sangathan, under which underprivileged children from nearby settlements also create awareness against single-use plastic by conducting marches and performing street plays. Jan Jagran Sangathan is a group of over 50 residents from Noida actively working towards promoting sanitation and cleanliness. “We are holding a cleanliness campaign in Sector 50 on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on Saturday, where we will carry out a march from 7am to 9am to educate and inform people about the importance of sanitation,” said Mittal.Shail Mathur, a resident of Sector 55, has also been advocating against the use of single-use plastic for the past six years. Mathur has created a residents group ‘TREE’ (taking responsibility for earth and environment) that works on distributing cloth bags.“Under TREE, we have been mobilizing local children to confiscate any polythene or polybags found with any shopowner or vendor in the sector and in turn provide them with free cloth bags provided by us. With our continuous efforts, the weekly market in Sector 55 has become plastic-free now. Moreover, in the last six years, we have collected over 3,000kg of polythene from weekly markets,” said Mathur.In March this year, the Noida Authority had recognised Sector 55-56 market as ‘plastic free’. “We hope such initiatives of residents continue to make our city cleaner. Moreover, Noida Authoruty has always encouraged environment-friendly activities,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO of Noida Authority. Meanwhile, with more people across NCR taking interest in environment-friendly products, Noida’s Sector 37 residents Sumit Khanna and Paramveer Khosa started a venture to replace everyday plastic products with its sustainable alternatives two years ago.“While people want to avoid using plastic, they struggle with finding its alternatives. That is how we came up with the concept of making products out of bamboo under the name Indibam. Here we sell bamboo toothbrushes, bottles, straws, serving trays, tongue cleaners and more. The market for sustainable products has been expanding and we are trying to do our bit,” said Khanna, who was earlier working as an international business manager with a private firm. He added that 10% of their profit goes to feed underprivileged children.In a similar initiative, Sector 51 resident Tarunima Bajpai provides and promotes sustainable lifestyle alternatives to customers under her social enterprise Ecoswop Solutions.“From recycled paper pens, bamboo and stainless steel straws to coconut shell soap stands and coconut coir dishwash scrubs, all the sustainable products are made by women from self-help groups located in small villages of western Uttar Pradesh. The raw material is sourced from northeast and south India. With this initiative, we hope people can move towards a zero-waste future,” said Bajpai, who is a lawyer by profession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-of-gautam-budh-nagar-go-green-to-make-city-garbage-free-101633115017277.html

The government will exit the retail sale of liquor in Delhi from November 17, and all its vends will shut.In all, there are 849 liquor stores in Delhi of which more than 260 are privately-run, holding L7 and L10 licenses. Around 408 liquor vends in Delhi will be operational till November 17, as the city transitions to a new excise regime.Demanding parity with government liquor vends to operate till November 16, the private liquor vends, mostly operating in malls, told the Supreme Court that there will be chaos at the government liquor vends during Diwali, and to avoid this, it will be “fair and just in the public interest” for private liquor vends to meet the Capital’s liquor demands.The court was hearing separate appeals filed by Radinton Tradex Private Limited and one Harish Chauhan against interim orders passed by the Delhi high court, which refused to stall the roll-out of the new excise policy. The Delhi Liquor Traders Association approached the high court against the excise policy, a matter that is still under consideration.The bench of Supreme Court justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “We are not inclined to entertain these petitions” and asked, “What larger public interest will be served if the private liquor vends are allowed to operate till November 16”.Senior advocates Vikas Singh and Sidharth Luthra appearing for the private liquor vends told the Court, “The rush outside government liquor vends is huge and this can be avoided if we are allowed to operate. Also, the state will earn revenue as we sell top quality liquor for which the customers in the Capital will go to neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.”The Delhi Government appeared on caveat and was represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi who argued that the old policy was meant to expire on September 30 to ensure a smooth, seamless transfer to the new excise policy. Singhvi said that the state had power to bring the new excise policy under the Delhi Excise Act 2009 and the corresponding Rules and this challenge was pending before the Delhi High Court.The Delhi government had earlier stated that the new policy was introduced to usher in reforms to boost revenues, give a better experience to customers, and crack down on the liquor mafia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scdeclines-plea-to-keep-private-liquor-vends-in-delhi-open-till-november-16-101633114777382.html

Please meet and provide a solution.”In a recent order, DDMA banned Chhath Puja celebrations, even as it allowed Ramleela and Dussehra, Durga Puja celebrations, with restrictions.Chhath Puja, a three-day festival, will be celebrated between November 8 and 10 this year. It is popular in states such as Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and parts of Madhya Pradesh. There is a significant presence of the Purvanchal community in Delhi.Spokespersons from the Delhi government and the Lieutenant Governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/restrictions-on-chhath-celebrations-have-hurt-community-says-manoj-tiwari-101633114289851.html

Hindu College principal Anju Srivastava said that last year, the college admitted double the number of students across courses in the unreserved category under the first cut-off, despite the college setting the highest cut-off at 99.5%.“Over-admissions burden infrastructure, and disrupt the teacher-student ratio in colleges. Under the sanctioned strength, we only need to have one section, but most popular subjects in our college have two to three sections,” she said. Most colleges, including Kamala Nehru College, Rajdhani College, Aryabhatta College and Deshbandhu College saw a jump of up to four percentage points in the political science course this year. North campus colleges such as Miranda House, Kirori Mal College, and Daulat Ram College have set cut-offs over 99%.Tanvir Aeijaz, who teaches political science at Ramjas College, said it has emerged as an in-demand subject. “Most students want to know about politics and understand the social situation. The subject too has evolved over the years to include multidisciplinary papers such as feminism, citizenship, and public policy. It also helps students prepare for the civil services, to join research institutes, or to work in the development sector. Public policy has also emerged as an interesting discipline.” According to Aeijaz, who has analysed the admissions data, around 4,500 students of Humanities background got around 100% in their class 12 results this year.In English too, the cut-offs have increased from between 0.50 and three percentage points in institutes such as Gargi College, Ramanujan College and Shivaji College, ranging between 96-99.75%. Top DU colleges such as Miranda House, Hindu College, LSR and Hansraj have also set English cut-off at 99% and above. For History, most of the colleges have set cut-offs ranging between 95-99.75% including Hansraj College (99%) and Hindu College (99.50%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/humanities-subjects-stay-popular-two-courses-feature-100-cut-offs-in-du-101633114251702.html
02-10-2021||Kolkata||Why protest if you’ve come to court: Supreme Court to farm unions||There cannot be protests by farmer unions when the validity of the farm laws is pending judicial consideration, the Supreme Court said on Friday, expressing its anguish over the manner in which the present stir by the farmer unions has “strangulated” Delhi by choking traffic on the Capital’s borders.Expressing its angst in response to a petition by Kisan Mahapanchayat seeking permission to hold a peaceful protest against the farm laws at Jantar Mantar, the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “There is no question of holding protests when you have come to the courts.”Lawyer Ajay Chaudhary, who represented the Mahapanchayat, told the court that Delhi Police granted permission to some 200 farmers of Samyukta Kisan Morcha to hold protests in the Capital in July this year, but denied them similar permission despite repeated requests.The bench said, “You have strangulated the entire city and now you want to enter the city and hold protests.”“You are freely and without fear holding protests. You block trains and highways, and you say your protest is peaceful. This business should stop. You are heckling security personnel and stopping businesspersons going for work. Have you considered if citizens are happy with this kind of protest?”Chaudhary told the Court that Kisan Mahapanchayat is not part of the protesting farmer groups and is in favour of peaceful, non-violent mode of protest by staging a satyagraha. He also claimed that it was the police that are blocking highways, not farmers.“You cannot isolate yourself from the protests,” the bench said. “You file an affidavit declaring that you are not part of the protests being carried out in blocking national highways at the borders leading to the Capital.” Based on this conditionality, the bench agreed to hear the matter next Monday and directed Chaudhary to supply a copy of the petition to the office of Attorney General and the Centre through the Central Agency office.The Court was clear that protests and litigation cannot go hand in hand. “Once you have made up your mind to approach this court, have faith in us and trust in the system. How do you say we will still hold protests and satyagraha? The entire public transport system has been affected by your protests,” the justices observed.Since November, farmers have been protesting three farm laws enacted last year, Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.The government says these will make it easier for farmers to sell their produce, and free them from the clutches of middlemen; farmers fear that the laws will simply replace middlemen with large companies and also crimp sales through the government channel.The validity of the farm laws have been challenged in multiple petitions before the Supreme Court by MPs, farmer bodies and private individuals. Among those who have challenged the farm laws are MPs Tiruchi Siva from Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Manoj Kumar Jha from Bihar’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, farmer unions, and individual farmers.While the top court is yet to examine the validity of these laws, in January, it stayed their implementation and constituted an expert committee to hear the grievances of the farmers and address the same by suggesting suitable amendments to the law.This committee submitted its report in a sealed cover in March. The matter has not come up for hearing since.Kisan Mahapanchayat is a party to the proceedings pending in the top court. In addition, this union, through its president Rampal Jat , approached the Rajasthan High Court challenging the validity of the three farm laws where the matter is still under consideration.The Mahapanchayat first requested the Delhi Police in March this year for permission to stage a protest at Jantar Mantar. This request was later renewed in April and June. On June 30, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, New Delhi refused permission citing Covid guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.On July 2, DDMA relaxed restriction following which the Mahapanchayat farmers, numbering 15, entered the Capital and sat on satyagraha on July 5. They were later detained by the police.They renewed their request for continuing with their peaceful protest but received no response. On learning that the Delhi Police granted permission for protest to another farmer union on July 21, the Mahapanchayat moved the apex court on July 26 to allow space at Jantar Mantar for at least 200 farmers to hold a peaceful protest.The petition relied on an order passed by the Supreme Court in December last year in the proceedings challenging the farm laws. The court then said: “The right to protest is a fundamental right and can, as a matter of fact, be exercised, subject to public order. There can certainly be no impediment in the exercise of such rights as long as it is non-violent and does not result in damage to the life and properties of other citizens and is in accordance with law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/why-protest-if-you-ve-come-to-court-supreme-court-to-farm-unions-101633113335640.html
02-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Four full-grown trees axed, environmentalists blame former mayor||At least four full grown trees were chopped illegally outside the house of former mayor Ashu Verma in Sector 9, Raj Nagar. Although forest department officials have registered a case in this regard, they did not disclose any names, saying they were not authorised to speak to the media. Meanwhile, environmentalists who visited the spot alleged that the tree-felling took place at Verma’s behest. According to the forest department, it is an offence to fell full-grown trees without department approval. Officials of the department said the four trees belonged to the alstonia genus and were growing outside a sealed house adjacent to Verma’s home in Sector 9 of Raj Nagar, a prime locality. Ashutosh Pandey, the sub divisional officer from the district forest department, confirmed that the department registered a case. “The incident came to our knowledge on Friday morning, and we have registered a case. No permission was taken from the forest department for chopping the trees,” he said, while declining to reveal names of the suspects. Officiating range forest officer Ashok Gupta added, “The name of the former city mayor has cropped up... I cannot tell the names of persons against whom a case has been registered under provisions of the Tree Protection Act, 1976,” he added. City-based environmentalist Akash Vashishtha, who lives nearby, said he rushed to the spot after receiving information about the logs of the fallen trees lying on the road. “I received information from a source in the horticulture department of the municipal corporation that the trees were felled on the behest of the former city mayor and that some staff of the horticulture department carried out the activity. Moreover, the forest department detained some of the staff in this connection and the former mayor played a crucial role in their release,” said Vashishtha. “Moreover, the civic staff was also told to immediately clear the felled wood logs... The forest department officials said they have registered a case in connection with the incident but are not revealing any names. Hence, I have raised complaints with the senior officers of the UP forest department,” added Vashishtha. Dr Anuj Singh, the horticulture department in-charge of the municipal corporation, denied any involvement of his staff. “No one from the corporation is involved in the incident. We have issued clear instructions to our staff that they will not get involved in any such activity which is done without the permission of the forest department,” he added. Former city mayor Ashu Verma said he did not order the trees to be chopped. “The alstonia trees were 25-30 foot high and were right outside a house adjacent to my home. The adjacent house is sealed, and we park our cars just outside it. The trunk of the alstonia trees developed cracks and posed a risk to commuters. Moreover, the trees had more foliage after the monsoon. The trees have not been felled but only pruned, leaving 10-12 feet of the trunk. I did not order any such activity... it could have been done by someone else,” said Verma. Ganga Prasad, conservator of forests (Meerut division), said he was aware of the chopping of trees. “I have directed the district officials to investigate and registered a case. I will direct them to reveal the names,” he added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-four-full-grown-trees-axed-environmentalists-blame-former-mayor-101633114177257.html

02-10-2021||Pune||Covid vaccination drive: PMC floats tenders to get syringes amidst shortage||Pune: Since the past few days, the state government has stopped the supply of syringes along with the Covid vaccines. Hence, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is looking out to buy syringes to ensure that the Covid vaccination drive is not affected. The civic body has floated tenders to ensure continuous supply of syringes to match the regular supply of doses. PMC has vaccinated about 4,550,043 vaccines since January in the city, including both first and second doses. Until now, the state was providing the vaccines along with syringes in proportion and also accounting for the possible wastage. However, now as the dose supply has been streamlined, the supply of syringes has become a problem for the local administration. Dr Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer, PMC, said, “The state has stopped sending syringes along with Covid vaccine doses unlike earlier since the past five-six days and we used PMC’s syringes to fill the gap. On Thursday, we even purchased one lakh syringes to ensure that the drive runs smoothly. We have also floated tenders to get more syringes. On Monday, we received 0.1 million vaccine doses from Bajaj group who also gave us 0.110 million syringes considering the wastage buffer. As of now I have over 60,000 doses of Covid vaccines and about 65,000 syringes. We need about 50,000 syringes and about 40-45,000 doses daily.” Deokar said that despite using PMC syringes for Covid immunization drive, the routine drive would not be affected. The shortage of syringes has begun a political war of words as Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol accused the state of stopping supply of needles without informing while opposition party Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), an alliance at the state government, said that the BJP has proved to be inefficient in managing the drive. Mohol said, “Since the beginning, both needles and doses were being supplied by the state government and then few days ago the state stopped the supply of syringes without prior intimation. Moreover, this needle is unavailable in the open market. This naturally had an effect on vaccination drives and we had to immediately purchase 0.1 million alternative needles to continue the vaccination drive. The people in Pune know that PMC has handled both the waves competently.” Prashant Jagtap, NCP Pune city president, said, “While the citizens are trying their best to get the vaccine, PMC has failed to provide syringes (needles) required for vaccination. It is a great tragedy that the civic body which has a budget of Rs8,500 crores is not able to provide syringes to vaccinate its citizens. The fact that the BJP is a disruptive organisation is being underlined once again. While many distributors in Pune city have the capacity to supply syringes from manufacturing units across the country, these distributors do not even have the confidence in BJP leaders that they can provide syringes to the city in case of emergency. So, it has been proved once again that the BJP cannot handle the municipal corporation.” PCMC’s 75-hr Covid vaccination drive The PCMC administration announced to keep their vaccination centres open for 75 hours non-stop from September 30 to October 3. The drive would be called “Aazadi ka Amrut Mohatsav” wherein three vaccination centres run by PCMC would be kept open for more than three days so that residents can visit the centre at any time, even during night hours, and get themselves vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-vaccination-drive-pmc-floats-tenders-to-get-syringes-amidst-shortage-101633113877197.html

Thorat said, “There were differences over panel structure. Some are in favour of two seats and some three, and some are in favour of the existing four-member panel. Chief minister given the nod for three and it has been accepted by the cabinet.”The NCP’s Ajit Pawar, also in the city on Friday, backed the state government’s decision on two-member wards. Ajit Pawar said, “ Cabinet took the decision on three members in a ward. As chief minister had made the decision now elections will held as per the decision taken by the state government.”Pune voters not happy with three-member wardsParivartan, a Pune-based NGO has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against the state government’s decision to have three -member wards.Civic activist Qaneez Sukhrani has also challenged this decision. In her letter to the state government, Sukhrani said, “State government’s decision is creating confusion among voters. Every election there are different panel structures. Ideally the principle is to decentralise power, but by creating multi-member wards, no elected member remains answerable to the citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/congress-ncp-back-down-on-opposing-three-member-ward-system-101633113638693.html

He also appealed to them to use the I-Khet app to book these machines.Chief agriculture officer Narinder Singh Benipal and DDPO Sanjiv Kumar were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-dc-flags-off-awareness-vans-to-sensitise-farmers-against-stubble-burning-101633113637153.html

Post the meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar announced that there would be only one dedicated Covid hospital in every tehsil and other facilities would be used to treat non-Covid patients. Pawar said that the requirement of dedicated facilities in cities would be decided upon the number of Covid cases. He said that a 75-hour non-stop special vaccination drive would be conducted in Pune city and rural parts. “Non-Covid patients also need hospitals for treatment. Though there is no binding on private hospitals, for government and corporation hospitals, it has been decided to keep one Covid hospital and rest for non-Covid cases considering the number of patients,” said Pawar. He also informed about the special vaccination drive on the occasion of the 75 years of independence. “Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation is already conducting the continuous vaccination drive for 75 hours. I have instructed Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and rural administration to conduct the drive,” said Pawar. On the surge in Covid cases in Ahmednagar district, Pawar said, “I was informed that almost 40% of patients in Sassoon hospital are from Ahmednagar district. I have spoken to authorities from Ahmednagar and assured them of help from Pune and also instructed them to undertake strict steps to bring the infection under control. An analysis of rest of the 60% of patients in Sassoon would be done in order to take precautionary steps in related areas,” said Pawar. Pawar said the positivity rate in PMC, PCMC and rural parts has come down as compared to last week and there has been decline in number of active patients as well. “We conducted a survey about the number of infections after the vaccine doses. It turned out that after the first dose 0.19% people were infected and 0.25% after the second dose. Experts said it is because after being fully vaccinated, people stop to follow the Covid prevention protocols. So, everyone should not behave recklessly,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/each-tehsil-to-have-only-one-dedicated-covid-hospital-rest-for-other-cases-ajit-pawar-101633113397133.html

Lawyers in Surajpur court abstained from work on Friday in solidarity with him. Shyam Singh Bhati, president of Akhil Bharatiya Veer Gurjar Mahasabha (Gautam Budh Nagar chapter), and vice-president of Samajwadi Party in Gautam Budh Nagar, was on his way to Lucknow on Thursday with four supporters to meet party leaders. Lucknow’s Kakori police stopped them on the way and were taking the men to the local police station when Bhati allegedly jumped off the moving police vehicle and went on the run. Advocate Seema Bhati, Shyam Singh Bhati’s wife, tweeted on Friday, “There is no whereabouts of my husband.... Dadri police has been harassing Shyam Singh Bhati and his family members. We request you to help us trace him.” Harendra Mavi, general secretary of the district bar association, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the association called a meeting on Friday to discuss the issue. “We took notice of Seema Bhati’s tweet and held a meeting. We found that Noida Police are harassing his family and conducting frequent searches at his home. Bhati is an advocate and not an absconder. If he is wanted in a case, the police should operate in a more professional manner. Advocates abstained from work on Friday in solidarity with Bhati,” he said.Ashutosh Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, Kakori, Lucknow, said that Noida Police had shared information with them about the “movement of some suspects in Lucknow”. “Kakori police stopped the suspects’ car at Agra-Lucknow Expressway on Thursday evening. There were five persons, including Bhati, in the car. The police team was bringing them to the local police station but Bhati jumped off the vehicle and fled,” he said. Abhishek, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Bhati is not in police custody. “Of the four persons arrested in Lucknow, only two persons – Mohit Nagar and Prashant Bhati - are wanted in a case in Dadri. The Gautam Budh Nagar Police brought the two suspects back to the district and produced them before a court. They were sent to judicial custody,” he said. The controversy over a statue of ninth-century king Mihir Bhoj started on September 20 after some posters were put up welcoming Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to the district for the unveiling for the statue on September 22. A group of men from the Gurjar community allegedly pulled down several posters claiming Bhoj was a Gurjar king but the word ‘Gurjar’ was missing from all posters. On September 22, the Adityanath unveiled the statue. While organisers of the programme had told the Gurjar community that the word ‘Gurjar’ would be added to the plaque, it was allegedly missing on the day of the programme. On September 28, unknown persons, allegedly from the Gurjar community, smeared the names of the UP CM and other Bharatiya Janata Party leaders on the plaque with black paint. Ramchandra Verma, secretary of Gurjar Vidya Sabha, a trust which manages the Dadri college, filed a complaint against unknown persons after the incident and police booked 150 persons in connection with the case. Dadri police confirmed that advocate Shyam Singh Bhati is wanted in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/advocate-wanted-in-mihir-bhoj-case-missing-from-lucknow-2-arrested-101633113338416.html

However, penalty and interest waivers were announced only for the defaulters pertaining to the year 2020-21. The defaulters pertaining to the period starting from 2013-14 to 2019-20 were provided a 10% rebate on the outstanding amount including penalty and interest. Citing the financial crisis being faced by the residents due to the ongoing pandemic, Aggarwal demanded that penalty and interest waiver should also be announced for those whose payment was pending since 2013-14. As per the MC officials, the officials stated that over 92,000 property owners had failed to pay tax since 2013-14. Out of these, over 23,700 defaulters pertain to the year 2019-20. In total, the defaulters have to pay around ₹14 crore (excluding interest and penalty) to the MC. Aggarwal demanded that the matter should be taken up at the state level.Mayor Sandhu said, “We will table the demand in front of the local bodies department. The final decision will be taken at the state level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-seeks-waiver-of-pending-property-tax-interest-101633113277068.html
02-10-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh health dept discontinues services of 81 contractual health workers||The outsourced healthcare workers, who were recruited by the UT health department to handle the Covid-19 outbreak, protested on Friday after the department decided to discontinue the services of 81 of them due to unavailability of funds.The UT health department had outsourced as many as 351 healthcare workers, including nurses, sweepers, data entry operators, security guards and others, to handle the outbreak.“Keeping in view the ebbing Covid-19 cases and financial situation of the National Health Mission (NHM), Chandigarh, the UT health department has decided to discontinue the services of 81 additional workers. Due to unavailability of funds, the department cannot pay salaries to the staff after September. The contracts of staff will not be renewed in a phased manner,” said the director, health services, in a letter to the staff on September 30.The letter further read that, “In the first phase, the services of the staff of PU International Hostel (converted into Covid care centre) will be discontinued. In the next phase, services of 20% more staff will be terminated. If need arises, the situation will be assessed every 15 days and decisions will be made accordingly.”After receiving the letters, the outsourced staff staged a protest at Government Multi-Speciality Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. The healthcare workers, who are demanding renewal of their contracts, will continue their protest on October 2.“The staff was hired during an emergency situation. Each and every healthcare worker has worked around the clock to provide medical services during the Covid-19 surge, especially during the peak of the second wave in May this year. Now, the UT health department is terminating our services. The Covid warriors must be respected and their contacts should be renewed,” said one of the protesters.UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “During the Covid crisis, the healthcare workers were outsourced for a short period of time, three or six months. The department is facing financial issues and we cannot pay salaries to employees. Also, we do not have any vacant posts available for regularising their jobs. Since the employees were told in advance about their temporary hiring, there is no point in protesting. We will outsource them again, if need arises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-health-dept-terminates-services-of-81-contractual-health-workers-101633113220578.html

Stating that people in the state were already unhappy because of some “unfulfilled promises” during Captain’s decade-long regime, Warring said any “wrong step” at this time will invite the citizens’ ire.Captain had stepped down as the chief minister (CM) two weeks back, leading to a political turmoil in the state. On Thursday, after returning from Delhi, where he met Union home minister Amit Shah, Captain had said that he will end his 52-year-long association with the Congress. Even as the former CM had denied that he was joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the announcement and his meeting with Shah further fuelled the rumours.“There are rumours that the BJP will make Capt Amarinder Singh agriculture minister and farm laws could be repealed. Why were the laws not scrapped earlier? I advise Amarinder Singh that he should not take any step that he ends up regretting,” said the transport minister, who was in Sangrur to inspect the bus stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/warring-advises-captain-amarinder-against-quitting-congress-101633112917056.html
02-10-2021||Chandigarh||RS Bains to represent Punjab govt in courts over sacrilege violence||Human rights lawyer, senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains, has been named as special public prosecutor by the Punjab government to appear before trial courts and the Punjab & Haryana high court in the politically sensitive sacrilege violence cases of 2015, according to a government notification on Friday.The move appears to be part of the steps being taken to assuage state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi because it effectively keeps the state’s advocate general, APS Deol, out of the sacrilege cases.On September 27, Sidhu objected to the appointment of Deol because the senior advocate had in the past appeared for some of the accused in the matter, including former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini. Sidhu cited Deol’s appointment as one of the reasons for his sudden decision to quit as Punjab Congress president on September 28, only to change his mind after a meeting with CM Channi on Thursday.To be sure, Deol could not have represented the state in the matter in any case because of his previous appearances for some of the accused.Bains, son of former Punjab and Haryana high court judge Ajit Singh Bains, is a well-known criminal and constitutional lawyer and has appeared in cases from across the political spectrum, including cases of human rights violation in Punjab’s terrorism days in the 1980s.However, former SIT member and AAP leader Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh questioned the appointment. “Another big fraud with Punjab and Punjabis by Congress government. Appointment of Special Public Prosecutor in Kotkapura -Behbal Kalan cases is only an eyewash. The intention of the government is very clear, to continue with the present advocate general.”In 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhs, were reported from Punjab’s Faridkot. Days later protesters broke out in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan, where two people were killed in police firing. The incident is one of the issues driving the feud between former chief minister Amarinder Singh and Navjot Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ropes-in-human-rights-lawyer-rs-bains-as-special-public-prosecutor-101633112862618.html

They used to cook and provide. So, when we came to know, we suggested that instead of cooking, they can look at getting the leftover food as well. The city generates a lot of food waste from banquet halls, restaurants and parties. Instead of throwing them, they could be reused for the needy. So, NMMC provided a refrigerator that will be used to store the food that people donate. The NGO will continue to distribute the food by doing a quality check and then making packets for individuals.”Richa Sameet from LCF said, “The initiative was inaugurated on Wednesday and on Thursday we had donated food for almost 150 people. The donation can be done from 12.30pm to 2.30pm and from 7pm to 9pm. We have informed about the initiative to all restaurants and banquet halls in the vicinity and have asked them to donate the leftover food. We had been distributing food packets to around 300 people daily earlier and with the help of the donations, we are able to reach half of the target.”They also have an initiative to encourage people to give food to beggars instead of money. “We sell food coupons that people can buy and give them to the homeless and the needy. They can come here with the coupons and we will provide them dosas that we make here. Every time the needy come here with the coupon, we encourage them to demand food coupons from people instead of money and encourage children to take up education instead of begging,” Sameet said. Rajale appealed that every resident of Navi Mumbai, who has leftovers, be it for one person or 10 persons, should not throw it and instead donate to the ‘food bank’ and reach out to the needy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmmc-starts-food-bank-for-homeless-and-needy-in-navi-mumbai-101633098342829.html

He mocks car owners lined up at the petrol station and says, “I am on a horse, I don’t need petrol because he runs on carrots. He runs on carrots, he runs on carrots, I don’t need petrol because I’m on a horse,” Dolphin says in his video.A post shared by Gus Lee-Dolphin (@gusleedolphin)Panic buying gripped the UK as it faced fuel shortages last week after the government said that there were not enough truckers to transport fuel to the nation’s petrol stations. Shell, ExxonMobil and Green Energy, the nation’s largest fuel suppliers have said that not fuel but labour shortage has led to a chaotic week where social media platforms were filled with videos of people getting into fights in gas stations and car owners were seen filling petrol on bottles as a reserve.The UK government on Saturday, in a bid to mitigate the crisis, extended an emergency visa programme for truck drivers. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent filling stations, told news agencies that they saw a ‘distinct improvement' in the conditions, though the situation did not improve in several regions, including London.“In London and the Southeast, and possibly parts of eastern England, if anything, it has got worse,” PRA’s Brian Madderson was quoted as saying by news agency BBC.

All you need to know||Merck & Co’s molnupiravir, the Covid-19 pill, claims to help nations which are struggling to vaccinate their citizens. According to an analysis based on a late-stage trial conducted by Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, the pill reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by 50%, news agency Bloomberg reported.Unitaid, the global health agency, is also hoping that an agreement could be reached so that lower and middle-income nations struggling to vaccinate their citizens can benefit from the pill.Molnupiravir is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus and would be the first oral antiviral medication for Covid-19, news agency Reuters said. Merck chief executive Robert Davis said that this aspect of the pill will ‘change’ the conversation regarding how to treat Covid-19. Another expert from the University of Liverpool who is familiar with the developments told news agency Bloomberg that the drug could be very cheap to manufacture and made available at a low price in developing countries.The results of the Phase III trial were promising enough for the company to stop enrolling patients and start the process of getting regulatory clearance.Molnupiravir, according to experts, is less challenging logistically compared to Gilead Sciences’ infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone. These medicines are also administered when the patient is hospitalised.Which countries are interestedMerck and Co earlier this year announced that it signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with five generic manufacturers in India. It was done to make sure that the availability of the drug in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries could be accelerated following approvals from their regulatory agencies.Malaysia health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said that negotiations between Merck and the Malaysian government have begun to procure the new drugs.

Deputy governor of the province Mullah Nisar Ahmad Ahmadi said the battalion is named Lashkar-e-Mansoori, or "Mansoor army". The battalion is the same as the one that would conduct suicide attacks targeting the security forces of the previous Afghan government, he said.Crediting the suicide bomber battalion for the success of the Taliban against the United States, Ahmadi, as reported by Khaama Press, said, "The defeat of the US would not be possible if not for this battalion. These brave men would wear explosive waistcoats and would detonate the US bases in Afghanistan. These are people with literally no fear who devote themselves for the consent of ALLAH."Afghan interpreters who worked for Netherlands summoned by Taliban: ReportThe announcement is significant at a time when the Taliban and Tajikistan are openly engaging in a battle of words as Tajikistan is demanding more representation of ethnic Tajiks in the Afghanistan government. In his address to the UN General Assembly, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon said, "Various terrorist groups are actively using the unstable military-political situation in Afghanistan in order to strengthen their positions...We are seriously concerned and regret that Afghanistan is once again on its way to becoming a platform for international terrorism."The Taliban have also replied to the Tajik attack and said the Taliban will not allow any neighbouring nation to interfere in the internal matters of Afghanistan.A Reuters report said Tajikistan held military parades in two provinces bordering Afghanistan this week, while Russia has urged both Tajikistan and the Taliban to resolve any dispute in a mutually acceptable manner.Tajikistan, which has become the base of Afghanistan's Resistance Force leaders, has also condemned the violations of human rights in Panjshir province.The Taliban have also deployed tens of thousands of Afghan special forces fighters in the Takhar province, adjacent to Tajikistan, reports said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-deploy-suicide-bombers-at-borders-eye-on-tajikistan-report-101633185276591.html

"We are now going to wait a few days and then try to get witness testimony from the little girls."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mommy-is-sleeping-2-girls-spend-days-with-deceased-mother-in-france-101633176861164.html
02-10-2021||World||Dubai Expo 2020 organisers say 5 workers died on site during preparations||Dubai’s Expo 2020 on Saturday acknowledged that five workers had been killed on site during construction of the massive world’s fair, revealing for the first time overall statistics for worker fatalities.Expo previously said that its 200,000 laborers who built the site worked some 240 million hours in its construction. It had not offered any overall statistics previously on worker fatalities, injuries or coronavirus infections despite repeated requests from The Associated Press and other journalists.The admission comes after the European Parliament last month urged nations not to take part in Expo, citing the United Arab Emirates' “inhumane practices against foreign workers” that it said worsened during the pandemic. Ahead of Expo, businesses and construction companies are “coercing workers into signing untranslated documents, confiscating their passports, exposing them to extreme working hours in unsafe weather conditions and providing them with unsanitary housing,” the resolution said.At a press conference a day after the event’s opening, Expo spokesperson Sconaid McGeachin claimed the information about fatalities was previously available but did not elaborate. The AP previously had repeatedly asked for the information and received no response from the Expo.She also said authorities would offer more information about casualties at a later, unspecified time.McGeachin also acknowledged that authorities were aware of cases involving contractors “withholding passports” and engaging in suspect “recruitment practices" and workplace safety violations on site.“We have taken steps to ensure those have been addressed and very much intervened in cases on that,” she said, without elaborating.The UAE, an oil-rich sheikhdom that relies on low-paid migrant labor from Africa, Asia and Arab countries to keep its economy humming, faces long-standing criticism from human rights groups for treating those workers poorly. But officials have battled to present a positive image for Expo, the first world’s fair in the Middle East that seeks to show off Dubai’s pride and draw millions of foreign visitors.Laborers in the UAE are barred from unionization and have few protections, often working long hours for little pay and living in substandard conditions.Dubai's searing early autumn heat proved hazardous even for those visiting the site on its opening day Friday, with some tourists fainting in the 40 degree Celsius (104 degree Fahrenheit) humid weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-expo-2020-organisers-say-5-workers-died-on-site-during-preparations-101633176497890.html
02-10-2021||World||Trump asks Florida judge to force Twitter to restore his account, says it allowed Taliban||Former US President Donald Trump has asked a federal judge in Florida to force Twitter to restore his account, Reuters reported. Trump's Twitter account was permanently suspended in January this year following the Capitol Hill riots on January 6. Other social media companies too followed suit and took action against the former US President. In July,  Trump sued Twitter, Facebook and Google, as well as their chief executives alleging that their action against Trump was unlawful. In Florida, Trump has filed a request for a preliminary injunction against Twitter arguing that Twitter was coerced by US Congress members to suspend his account. Twitter "exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate," Trump's lawyers said in the filing. Twitter declined to comment on the filing when contacted by Reuters.In the court filing, Trump argued Twitter allowed the Taliban to tweet regularly but censored him even during his presidency by labelling his tweets as "misleading information" or indicating they violated the company's rules against "glorifying violence", Reuters reported. On January 8, Twitter said in its blogpost that after a close review of the recent tweets from Donald Trump's account and the context around them, the company took the decision to permanently suspend the account due to the risk of further "incitement of violence"."Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behaviour from this account in recent weeks," Twitter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-asks-florida-judge-to-force-twitter-to-restore-his-account-says-they-allowed-taliban-101633167455698.html

It said Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them."China has been wantonly engaged in military aggression, damaging regional peace," Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Saturday morning.The first wave of incursions comprised 18 J-16 and four Su-30 fighter jets plus two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and an anti-submarine aircraft, while the second had 10 J-16s, 2 H-6s and an early warning aircraft, the ministry said.The first batch of Chinese aircraft all flew in an area close to the Pratas Islands, with the two bombers flying closest to the atoll, according to a map issued by the ministry.The second group flew down into the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines, a key waterway that links the Pacific with the disputed South China Sea.China has yet to comment. It has previously said such flights were to protect the country's sovereignty and aimed at "collusion" between Taiwan and the United States, the island's most important international backer.The previous largest incursion happened in June, involving 28 Chinese air force aircraft.China's latest mission came less than a day after its government launched a attack on Taiwan's foreign minister, evoking the words of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to denounce him as a "shrilling" fly for his efforts to promote Taiwan internationally.China has stepped up military and political pressure to try and force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty.Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedom and democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-angers-taiwan-after-it-commits-largest-ever-incursion-into-island-101633166448199.html
02-10-2021||World||Qatar votes in nation's first legislative election||Qataris began voting in the emirate's first legislative election Saturday in a symbolic nod to democracy that analysts say will not lead to power shifting away from the ruling family.The vote is for 30 members of the 45-strong Shura Council, a body with limited powers that was previously appointed by the emir as an advisory chamber.Polls opened at 0500 GMT and will close at 1500 GMT with the results expected the same day.At a polling station in the Jawaan bin Jassim school in the Onaiza district of the capital Doha, Qatari citizens wearing white thobes signed in to vote at a registration desk.After queueing briefly, they cast their ballots into a semi-transparent plastic box emblazoned with the dhow boat, crossed swords and palm tree emblem of Qatar.Observers say the decision to hold the election, required under the 2004 constitution but repeatedly delayed in the "national interest", comes amid heightened scrutiny as Qatar prepares to host the 2022 World Cup."It's a way to show that they are moving in the right direction, that they want to achieve more political participation" before the World Cup, said Luciano Zaccara, an assistant professor in Gulf politics at Qatar University.The Shura will be allowed to propose legislation, approve the budget and recall ministers. But the emir, all-powerful in the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, will wield a veto."This is a historic day to participate, choose and vote in the first elected Shura Council, and I feel very happy... I hope that the next council will keep pace with the developments that Qatar and the world are experiencing," voter Ali Abdullah al-Khulaifi, 44, told AFP.The streets of Qatar's towns have been speckled with billboards adorned with beaming candidates sporting national dress.Beyond single-candidate town hall meetings, posters and TV spots, the country's introduction to democracy has been limited, with no change of government possible and political parties outlawed.Candidates have uniformly avoided debate about Qatar's foreign policy or status as a monarchy, instead focussing on social issues including healthcare, education and citizenship rights.'Deliver our voice'All candidates had to be approved by the powerful interior ministry against a host of criteria, including age, character and criminal history.Candidates have also been required to register official campaign events with the ministry in advance, as well as the names of all speakers as authorities seek to clamp down on possible sectarianism or tribalism.The candidates are mostly men, with just 28 women among the 284 hopefuls running for the 30 available council seats. The remaining 15 seats will be appointed by the emir.One woman casting her ballot Saturday, Sabeeka Yousef, said she was not concerned about this imbalance."The most important thing for me in this process is to choose a candidate who is able to deliver our voice," she said.Most of Qatar's 2.5 million residents are foreigners, ineligible to vote.Candidates have to stand in electoral divisions linked to where their family or tribe was based in the 1930s, using data compiled by the then-British authorities.Diplomatic sources suggest families and tribes have already conducted internal ballots to determine who will be elected for their constituencies."When you don't have political parties... people sometimes will tend to vote for people they know, or for members of family or members of tribe," said Courtney Freer, a fellow at Emory College.Qataris number about 333,000, but only descendants of those who were citizens in 1930 are eligible to vote and stand, disqualifying members of families naturalised since then.Some members of the sizeable Al-Murrah tribe are among those excluded from the electoral process, sparking a fierce debate online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-votes-in-nation-s-first-legislative-election-101633165299100.html

Shahid was responding to a question on whether any Covid-19 vaccine should be recognised and considered or only the ones validated by the World Health Organization or any other group. "On vaccines, that's a very technical question you have asked me. I got Covishield from India, I’ve got the two doses. I don't know how many countries would say that Covishield is acceptable or not, but a large portion of the countries have got Covishield,” Shahid said at his first press conference in Washington on Friday, PTI reported.“And I have survived.

02-10-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau faces flak for holidaying on truth and reconciliation day||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing flak from the indigenous community for vacationing on the first-ever National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to commemorate the tragedy of children and survivors of the erstwhile residential school system.That day was observed on Thursday and Justin Trudeau’s official schedule stated he was having private meetings in Ottawa. However, he had actually flown off to the resort of Tofino in British Columbia for a family holiday and was photographed on the beach by the outlet Global News. Trudeau’s office later updated his itinerary to reflect that reality.That action drew criticism from groups like the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC). Condemning that decision, it issued a statement on Friday expressing “shock and dismay” over Justin Trudeau holidaying in Tofino. NWAC CEO Lynne Groulx said that the “decision to duck out entirely” on this particular day was “astounding for its sheer level of callousness”.Ironically, the day was made a federal statutory holiday by the Justin Trudeau government earlier this year. Trudeau did attend an event with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation on Parliament Hill in the capital on Wednesday.Emotions over the historic treatment of Canada’s indigenous people have been especially high this year due to the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves of children at or close to the location of residential schools that were operated by the Catholic Church across the country from the mid-19th century into the 1970s.This summer, 182 such graves were found near the town of Cranbrook in British Columbia, 751 in Saskatchewan and 215 in Kamloops, also in BC.In a statement datelined Ottawa and released by the prime minister’s office on Thursday, Justin Trudeau was quoted as saying it was a day “to reflect on the painful and lasting impacts of residential schools in Canada, and to honour survivors, their families, and their communities” and “to remember the many children who never returned home”, adding that it “recognises that at least 150,000 Indigenous children from across the country were forcibly separated from their families and their communities”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-faces-flak-for-holidaying-on-truth-and-reconciliation-day-101633151139216.html

02-10-2021||World||Top US official calls for Pakistan action on militants before Islamabad visit||A top US official called Friday for Pakistan to take action against all extremist groups ahead of a visit to Islamabad, which has sought reconciliation with militants both at home and in Afghanistan.Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will meet on October 7-8 with officials in Pakistan, which has long faced US accusations of playing a double game in Afghanistan where the Taliban swept back to power in August."We seek a strong partnership with Pakistan on counterterrorism and we expect sustained action against all militant and terrorist groups without distinction," Sherman told reporters."Both of our countries have suffered terribly from the scourge of terrorism and we look forward to cooperative efforts to eliminate all regional and global terrorist threats," she said from Switzerland, her first stop on a trip that will also take her to India and Uzbekistan.Pakistan points to its efforts against militants and the thousands who have died in attacks at home, but it has also faced criticism for not doing more to curb Islamist radicals that target neighbor and arch-rival India.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, a longtime critic of US military campaigns, said in an interview aired Friday that his government had opened talks with Pakistani Taliban about laying down their arms."Some of the Pakistani Taliban groups actually want to talk to our government for some peace, for some reconciliation," he told Turkey's TRT World television.He said the discussions were taking place in Afghanistan with sections of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which has waged years of deadly attacks."I repeat, I do not believe in military solutions," Khan said.Khan has encouraged the world to engage Afghanistan's Taliban and provide economic support, although he has stopped short of backing recognition -- a step opposed by the United States.Sherman praised Pakistan's calls for an inclusive government in Afghanistan."We look to Pakistan to play a critical role in enabling that outcome," she said.Pakistan, a Cold War ally of the United States, was one of only three nations to recognize the Taliban's hardline 1996-2001 regime but quickly backed the US-led war to oust them after the September 11, 2001 attacks.US officials say segments of Pakistan's powerful intelligence service maintained backing for the Taliban, in part due to the former Western-backed Afghan government's close ties with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-official-calls-for-pakistan-action-on-militants-before-islamabad-visit-101633141181830.html

02-10-2021||World||US Covid-19 death toll nears 700,000 just as cases begin to fall||The United States reached its latest heartbreaking pandemic milestone Friday, eclipsing 700,000 deaths from Covid-19 just as the surge from the delta variant is starting to slow down and give overwhelmed hospitals some relief.It took 3 ½ months for the US to go from 600,000 to 700,000 deaths, driven by the variant’s rampant spread through unvaccinated Americans. The death toll is larger than the population of Boston.This milestone is especially frustrating to public health leaders and medical professionals on the front lines because vaccines have been available to all eligible Americans for nearly six months and the shots overwhelmingly protect against hospitalizations and death. An estimated 70 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, providing kindling for the variant.“You lose patients from Covid and it should not happen,” said Debi Delapaz, a nurse manager at UF Health Jacksonville who recalled how the hospital was at one point losing eight patients a day to Covid-19 during the summer surge. “This is something that should not happen.”Despite the rising death toll, there are signs of improvement.Nationwide, the number of people now in the hospital with Covid-19 has fallen to somewhere around 75,000 from over 93,000 in early September. New cases are on the downswing at about 112,000 per day on average, a drop of about one-third over the past 2 1/2 weeks.Deaths, too, appear to be declining, averaging about 1,900 a day versus more than 2,000 about a week ago.The easing of the summer surge has been attributed to more mask wearing and more people getting vaccinated. The decrease in case numbers could also be due to the virus having burned through susceptible people and running out of fuel in some places.In another development, Merck said Friday its experimental pill for people sick with Covid-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half. If it wins authorization from regulators, it will be the first pill for treating Covid-19 — and an important, easy-to-use new weapon in the arsenal against the pandemic.All treatments now authorized in the U.S. against the coronavirus require an IV or injection.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, warned on Friday that some may see the encouraging trends as a reason to remain unvaccinated.“It’s good news we’re starting to see the curves” coming down, he said. “That is not an excuse to walk away from the issue of needing to get vaccinated.”Unknowns include how flu season may strain already depleted hospital staffs and whether those who have refused to get vaccinated will change their minds.“If you’re not vaccinated or have protection from natural infection, this virus will find you,” warned Mike Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, began seeing a surge of Covid-19 hospitalizations in mid-July, and by the first week of August, the place was beyond capacity. It stopped elective surgeries and brought in military doctors and nurses to help care for patients.With cases now down, the military team is scheduled to leave at the end of October.Still, the hospital’s chief medical officer, Dr. Catherine O’Neal, said the rate of hospitalizations isn’t decreasing as quickly as cases in the community because the delta variant is affecting more young people who are otherwise healthy and are living much longer in the intensive care unit on ventilators.“It creates a lot of ICU patients that don’t move anywhere,” she said. And many of the patients aren’t going home at all. In the last few weeks, the hospital saw several days with more than five Covid-19 deaths daily, including one day when there were 10 deaths.“We lost another dad in his 40s just a few days ago,” O’Neal said. “It’s continuing to happen. And that’s what the tragedy of Covid is.”As for where the outbreak goes from here, “I have to tell you, my crystal ball has broken multiple times in the last two years,” she said. But she added that the hospital has to be prepared for another surge at the end of November, as flu season also ramps up.Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, system medical director for hospital quality at Ochsner Health in Louisiana, said this fourth surge of the pandemic has been harder. “It’s just frustrating for people to die of vaccine-preventable illnesses,” she said.At the peak of this most recent wave, Ochsner hospitals had 1,074 Covid-19 patients on Aug. 9. That had dropped to 208 as of Thursday.Other hospitals are seeing decreases as well. The University of Mississippi Medical Center had 146 hospitalized Covid-19 patients at its mid-August peak. That was down to 39 on Friday. Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia, South Carolina, had more than 190 in early September but just 49 on Friday.But Kemmerly doesn’t expect the decrease to last. “I fully expect to see more hospitalizations due to COVID,” she said.Like many other health professionals, Natalie Dean, a professor of biostatistics at Emory University, is taking a cautious view about the winter.It is unclear if the coronavirus will take on the seasonal pattern of the flu, with predictable peaks in the winter as people gather indoors for the holidays. Simply because of the nation’s size and diversity, there will be places that have outbreaks and surges, she said.What’s more, the uncertainties of human behavior complicate the picture. People react to risk by taking precautions, which slows viral transmission. Then, feeling safer, people mingle more freely, sparking a new wave of contagion.“Infectious disease models are different from weather models,” Dean said. “A hurricane doesn’t change its course because of what the model said.”One influential model, from the University of Washington, projects new cases will bump up again this fall, but vaccine protection and infection-induced immunity will prevent the virus from taking as many lives as it did last winter.Still, the model predicts about 90,000 more Americans will die by Jan. 1 for an overall death toll of 788,000 by that date. The model calculates that about half of those deaths could be averted if almost everyone wore masks in public.“Mask wearing is already heading in the wrong direction,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the university. “We need to make sure we are ready for winter because our hospitals are exhausted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-nears-700-000-just-as-cases-begin-to-fall-101633138078791.html
02-10-2021||World||International Day of Non-Violence: Know its history, significance||The International Day of Non-Violence is observed on October 2, the birth anniversary of India’s Independence movement hero Mahatma Gandhi. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in a resolution adopted on June 15, 2007, established the commemoration as an occasion to spread the message of non-violence through education and public awareness. The resolution reaffirms the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence and the desire to secure a culture of peace, tolerance, understanding and non-violence. "Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man," Gandhi had said.History of International Day of Non-ViolenceThe resolution in the UNGA was passed with a goal to secure a culture of peace, tolerance and understanding with the help of the teachings of Gandhi who inspired millions to adopt the path of non-violence. It was in January 2004 that Iranian Noble Laureate Shirin Ebadi proposed the idea for the day. The idea attracted many Congress leaders, who in 2007 called upon the UN to adopt the idea.The then minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma introduced the resolution in the General Assembly on behalf of 140 co-sponsors. Sharma said that wide and diversified sponsorship of the resolution was an acknowledgement of the universal respect for Gandhi and his philosophy.Significance of International Day of Non-ViolenceThis day is observed across the world to give the message of non-violence. Gandhi has been an inspiration for non-violent movements across the globe. He remained committed to his belief in non-violence even under difficult challenges and led India to freedom. The UN hosts official events around the world to commemorate the resolution of 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-non-violence-know-its-history-significance-101633135203671.html

Why is the country not ready for anything?" said Ata Uriakhil, a 47-year-old Afghanistan-born taxi driver who was first in a line of more than 40 cars outside a closed supermarket petrol station in Richmond."When is it going to end?," Uriakhil said. "The politicians are not capable of doing their jobs properly. The government should have been prepared for this crisis. It is just incompetence."Uriakhil said he had lost about 20% of his normal earnings this week because he has been waiting for fuel rather than picking up customers.The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said members reported on Friday that 26% of pumps were dry, 27% had just one fuel type in stock and 47% had enough petrol and diesel."Independents, which total 65% of the entire network, are not receiving enough deliveries of fuel compared with other sectors such as supermarkets," Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retail Association, told Reuters.Ministers say the world is facing a global shortage of truck drivers and that they are working to ease the crisis. They deny that the situation is a consequence of an exodus of EU workers following Britain's departure from the bloc, and have dismissed concerns the country is heading toward a winter of shortages and power cuts.Though there are shortages of truck drivers in other countries, EU members have not seen fuel shortages.Pig farms strugglingThe Conservative government this week changed tack on immigrant workers, to allow some foreign workers to come in for three months to drive trucks and fill gaps in the poultry sector.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said the government wasn't moving fast enough."The Prime Minister should be taking emergency action today but yet again he’s failed to grasp the seriousness of the crisis. If it needs legislation, then let’s recall Parliament," he said.In addition to the chaos around gas stations, farmers are warning that a shortage of butchers and abattoir workers could force a cull of tens of thousands of pigs.The pig industry implored retailers to continue buying local pork and not cheaper EU products, saying businesses would go bust and livestock would be culled if producers are not given immediate support.The weekly slaughter of pigs has dropped by 25% since August after the pandemic and Britain's post-Brexit immigration rules combined to hit a meat processing industry that was already struggling for workers."As a result of the labour supply issues in pork processing plants, we currently have an estimated 120,000 pigs backed up on UK pig farms that should have gone to slaughter," the National Pig Association said in a letter to retailers."The only option for some will be to cull pigs on farm."The Pig Association said that despite attempts to persuade the government to ease immigration rules, it appeared to have reached an impasse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-gas-pumps-still-dry-britain-brings-in-army-tanker-drivers-to-deliver-fuel-101633133606063.html
02-10-2021||World||Afghan interpreters who worked for Netherlands summoned by Taliban: Report||Afghan interpreters who worked for the Netherlands have been summoned to appear in court by the Taliban who have threatened their families, Dutch public television NOS reported on Friday.The interpreters are in hiding but their family members will be held responsible if they fail to show up in court "and severely punished to teach other traitors a lesson," said a letter from the Taliban, which was aired by the broadcaster.NOS said the recipient, who worked for the EU's policing agency Europol in Afghanistan, was accused of taking "dishonourable and forbidden money" from foreigners."We will take revenge. If we are not able to get hold of you, we will settle scores with your near ones," said another letter to an interpreter whom the Taliban accused of being responsible for the deaths of some of their fighters.All indications show that the letters, which bear official seals, were despatched by the Taliban, NOS said.It said it had contacted about 10 interpreters or people who had worked for the Dutch and who all said their situation was becoming increasing difficult.The Taliban in June urged interpreters who had worked for foreign forces to repent but urged them to stay on in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of foreign forces and assured them they would not be harmed.Just after taking power, the Taliban declared a general amnesty for Afghan government and military officials.But despite their pledges not to avenge themselves, a confidential United Nations report said the Taliban were tracking down people who worked with foreign forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-interpreters-who-worked-for-netherlands-summoned-by-taliban-report-101633126576620.html

She noted that the Covid-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted marginalised populations, according to a statement from the USISPF. She also highlighted the difficulties women have accessing financial services to increased pressures balancing unpaid care and domestic work while working, and increased underemployment and business closures.USISPF CEO Mukesh Aghi said, “We look forward to working with our member companies to boost entrepreneurship and job opportunities that will enhance economic prosperity and inclusion in India.”The alliance is expected to focus on three areas of action: accelerating women’s entrepreneurship, fostering leadership in the workforce and providing access to career enhancing education and skills building opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-initiative-to-help-women-entrepreneurs-in-india-101633113339589.html

02-10-2021||India||Next round of LAC row talks soon: Army chief||NEW DELHIThe next round of talks with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to cool tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh could take place in the second week of October, Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Saturday.The situation on the contested LAC was under control and outstanding problems with the Chinese army could be resolved through talks, Naravane told reporters in Leh, Ladakh’s capital. The dialogue will be held at the level of brigade commanders, division commanders and corps commanders, he said.Naravane was in Ladakh for a security review. His itinerary included visits to forward areas. The Indian and Chinese armies have been locked in a border standoff for almost 17 months. Both sides are negotiating to reduce tensions.The two armies have so far carried out 12 rounds of talks to resolve the border row that erupted in May 2020. “The 13th round of talks will take place soon,” the Indian army chief said. “Things move forward with every round of talks and gradually problems can be resolved through talks.”Outstanding problems at Hot Springs, or Patrolling Point-15, which is one of the flashpoints on the LAC, could be taken up during the 13th round of talks, officials familiar with the development said, asking not to be named.“Engagement is always good for future course of action, and whenever there is a dialogue, the outcome will be embedded with a certain amount of reconciliation to move forward,” said former Northern Army Commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).The rival armies carried out the second round of disengagement in early August, when the two sides pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrolling Point-17A, with the breakthrough coming after the 12th round of talks.Earlier, India and China wrapped up the disengagement process in Pangong Tso area in mid-February, with their armies pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at LAC after 45 years. The previous recorded incident when bullets were fired at the LAC was in October 1975, when PLA ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.Naravane said PLA has built a lot of infrastructure on the Chinese side of LAC to accommodate more troops and the Indian army was monitoring the developments and taking countermeasures, including the induction of modern weapons such as the K9 Vajra-T self-propelled guns, artillery guns. Private defence firm Larsen & Toubro and South Korea’s Hanwha Techwin (HTW) have built the mobile guns in India. The guns were meant to be deployed in the plains, but the army has carried out some minor changes to deploy them in high-altitude areas. The problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff. Even after the disengagement from Pangong Tso and Gogra, the two sides still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh area. A day before he left for the Ladakh visit on Friday, Naravane said in Delhi that developments along LAC in Ladakh added to challenges faced by the Indian military on the “active and disputed borders” in the western and eastern fronts. The “unprecedented” military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, he had said. Naravane’s Ladakh visit also came a month after multiple PLA patrols consisting of around 100 soldiers crossed LAC in the central sector in Uttarakhand on August 30 and damaged a foot bridge before they went back. The area in which the intrusion took place is manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-round-of-lac-row-talks-soon-army-chief-101633198182025.html

He launched the Jal Jeevan Mission app on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The app is expected to boost awareness and increase transparency and accountability of the government’s water and sanitation schemes. “This (Jal Jeevan Mission) is a village-driven, women-driven movement. Its main base is a mass movement and public participation,” Modi said. “It has been my constant effort that this thinking of gram swaraj (village republic) should move forward towards accomplishment.”From India’s Independence in 1947 to 2019, only 30 million households had access to tap water, he said. “Since the launch of Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019, 5 crore households have been connected with water connections,” Modi said. “Today, water is reaching every household in about 1.25 lakh villages in about 80 districts of the country. In the aspirational districts, the number of tap connections have increased from 31 lakh to 1.16 crore.” Modi also launched the Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh, a government charitable trust. “Any individual, institution, corporation, or philanthropist, be it in India or abroad, can contribute to help provide tap water connection in every rural household, school, anganwadi (day care) centre, ashram shala, and other public institutions,” the government said in a statement. The Prime Minister spoke with members of village councils and water committees from across the country to assess the issues they face to make clean water available. Girijakant Tiwari of Umaree village in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh said safe and clean water is now available in his village, which has improved the lives of women.Sudha from Vellery in Tamil Nadu told Modi that all houses in her area have received a piped water connection. The availability of water improved their lives, giving them time for other productive activities, including construction of check dams and ponds, she told the Prime Minister.Modi also stressed on the need for cleanliness, highlighting the government’s flagship scheme, Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, which was launched earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jal-jeevan-is-women-driven-plan-of-decentralisation-pm-101633198180580.html

They said that now they don't have to worry about extraneous considerations. That is the biggest attraction, they said. One company said I want to invest in 25 locations in India to set up operations. I asked how do you find it when you are working in India. He said that the best part of working it is absolutely clean," the minister said.Goyal said the investor told him that he had set up a big project in Lucknow and "had no problem at all, seamless implementation".The minister said investors in India have a lot of positivity about the country's future."I would like to express my gratitude to the investors in India who have let bygone be bygones but have a lot of positivity about the future. They have appreciated the role of bureaucracy in India, whose mindset has also changed significantly," he said."Many investors spoke about at dinner last night and during my bilaterals. This new India that they are seeing I think is a source of inspiration for them to look at engaging with India in a much bigger way," he added.The ninth meeting of the UAE-India High-Level Joint Task Force on Investments on Saturday discussed ongoing efforts to amend the longstanding Bilateral Investment Treaty and noted the importance of concluding the negotiation process as soon as possible.The meeting was co-chaired by Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Member of the Executive Council of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.Senior officials representing government authorities and various investment entities from both countries took part in the meeting.Piyush Goyal on Friday inaugurated the Indian Pavilion at Dubai Expo 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-companies-feel-process-to-invest-in-india-has-become-clean-honest-seamless-piyush-goyal-101633197516902.html
02-10-2021||India||Congress appoints Bhupesh Baghel as senior observer for UP assembly polls||Even as 25 MLAs from Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel’s camp are in Delhi amid the speculation of a possible change of guard in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh, the party on Saturday, appointed Baghel as a senior observer of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. “Honourable National President Sonia Gandhi ji (Sonia Gandhi) has instructed me to be the party observer for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections… It is a big responsibility and I will try my best to live up to the expectations of the top leadership,” Baghel tweeted after his appointment. Earlier this year, Baghel was appointed as observer for the Assam assembly elections, in which Congress got 50 seats out of a total 126 seats. In the 2016 assembly polls, Congress won 26 seats in Assam. The movement of MLAs to Delhi comes two months after the Congress high command reserved its decision, on August 28, over the alleged two-and-a-half-year power-sharing agreement between Baghel and health minister TS Singh Deo. Baghel’s appointment is seen as an important development but both the camps are still to figure out the exact interpretation. Close functionaries of Baghel believe that it is an important development which reflects that the party and senior leadership want Baghel to play an important role in UP elections as a CM while people from Singh Deo’s camp are hoping for a change after the appointment. “Baghel ji’s (Bhupesh Baghel) appointment is a positive indication amid the current political scenario of the state. We believe that the high command wants an Other Backward Caste (OBC) chief minister to woo the OBC voters in UP, who are in sizeable number… Secondly, the move also puts a halt on any type of speculation about change of guard,” said Baghel’s close functionary. Notably, for the last few months, a group of leaders close to the CM and his two advisors were working with the team of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh. The CM’s other team was engaged in providing booth-level and district-level training to the local leaders of eastern Uttar Pradesh. “After today’s appointment, Baghel will be visiting Uttar Pradesh in the second week of October and will be addressing a gathering with Priyanka Gandhi,” another Congress leader close to the CM said. Meanwhile, after the appointment of Baghel, the political corridor in Chhattisgarh has been rife with speculation and many are not able to understand the indication of the high command. People close to Singh Deo claimed that the appointment should not be seen as a relief for Baghel and could be the party’s strategy. “It is still not clear from today’s appointment whether it is some kind of ‘package deal’ or a promotion of Baghel ji. We are waiting for the high command’s decision for change of guard,” said a close aid of Singh Deo. On the other hand, more than 25 MLAs close to CM Baghel are camping in Delhi reportedly to express solidarity with Baghel. On August 28, after a long meeting with the high command, Baghel seemed to have bought some time. He said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will visit the state next week, especially Bastar, to see for himself the work that was being done. The next day, when Singh Deo returned, he said he too had spoken to the leadership and they had “reserved their decision” on the matter. Nearly a month later, on Wednesday, 10 MLAs led by Baghel’s loyalist and MLA Brihaspat Singh reached Delhi and told the media that the MLAs are in Delhi to meet the party’s state in-charge PL Punia with a message for Rahul Gandhi. Singh Deo too played down the Delhi visit of MLAs and said it should not be made an issue. About the possible leadership change, Singh Deo had reiterated that the decision is reserved for the party high command. On Saturday, Baghel made another statement and said that Chhattisgarh can never become Punjab. “Chhattisgarh will always remain Chhattisgarh. It cannot become Punjab. The two states have only one similarity that both have numbers in their names,” he told reporters here at the helipad when asked that the BJP has equated Chhattisgarh and Punjab over turmoil in the ruling Congress. Punjab is derived from Pun (five) aab (water) which means the land of five rivers. Similarly Chhattisgarh has derived its name from ‘chattis’ (thirty six) ‘garh’ (fort). Political commentators of the state believe Baghel’s appointment for UP elections is not giving any clear indication regarding execution of power-sharing formula. “The fact that Baghel proved himself to be a successful election manager in the recent past makes Bhupesh Baghel an asset for the Congress party in any election going state. However, the performance in Chhattisgarh was largely the result of team work. Baghel’s appointment for the UP elections has come at a time when the doubts over his continuance as the CM are yet to be cleared. Baghel’s supporters are bound to be elated by the public display of confidence of the Gandhi siblings in his organisational capabilities. Baghel’s detractors, however, would understandably like to look for rays of hope in this development and consider it a prelude to a formal distancing from the state,” said Parivesh Mishra, a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-appoints-bhupesh-baghel-as-senior-observer-for-up-assembly-polls-101633196141280.html

The senior doctor also noted that some states in the country still have a positivity rate of more than 10 per cent. Hence it is important that people remain cautious and take all necessary precautions to prevent respiratory disease, he said."It is not easy. Many countries are still fighting battles. So we have to be very cautious as this can come back with a vengeance," Dr Wig said as per the ANI report.As of Saturday, more than 90 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country, marking a major milestone in the battle against the disease. Commenting on the same, Dr Wig said, "We have to go far ahead of 100 crores and have to make everybody double vaccinated." He further emphasised maintaining vaccination pace and ensuring that all beneficiaries are fully vaccinated, according to the report."That is how we are going to win this war. It is not an easy war, still, we cannot be overconfident, we have to be a little underconfident so that we don't lower our guard and take all precautions," Dr Wig also said.Noting a rise in the cases of dengue and typhoid fever, Dr Wig requested people to wear a mask and practise social distancing as much as possible. "We are seeing cases with dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever and airborne diseases. So, it is very difficult for doctors to decide if it is Covid or flu, dengue, typhoid fever, or viral hepatitis. My request is that till festival season, please go slow, wear your mask and avoid social gatherings." he said.India on Saturday logged 24,354 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the overall tally to 33,791,061. While the active cases declined to 273,889, which is the lowest in 197 days, according to the Union health ministry's data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-can-come-back-with-vengeance-aiims-task-force-chief-warns-against-lower-101633195008140.html

Baghel said that the programme will see women and youth get opportunities and also will be a step towards realizing Mahatma Gandhi's dream of 'Gram Swaraj' (village self rule).“The entire world is worried over global warming. There is talk of green energy everywhere, so our government has decided to make electricity from cow dung. In every village, such a unit will be set up in gauthans (a place in rural areas where cattle are kept), where cow dung is procured under the Godhan Nyay Yojana scheme,” Baghel said.“Gauthans will produce electricity from cow dung, besides manufacturing organic manure, doubling the benefits and incomes of Gauthan Samitis and women self-help groups,” the state government said in a press release.Electricity generation from cow dung will begin from October 2, the press release said. “In the first phase, units for power generation from cow dung were set up at Rakhi in Bemetara district, Sikola in Durg and Bancharoda in Raipur district. One unit will produce 85 cubic cubic meters of gas. Since one cubic cubic meter produces 1.8 KW of electricity. 153 KW of electricity will be produced in one unit. In this way, about 460 KW of electricity will be generated from the biogas genset units installed in the above three Gauthans, which will power the lighting system in the Gauthans as well as the machines installed,” the release said.On the occasion, the government also launched = cow dung powered units set up at Sikola gauthan in Durg, Bancharoda gauthan in Raipur and Rakhi gauthan in Bemetara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-launches-cow-dung-based-power-generation-project-101633194612169.html

02-10-2021||India||Assam forms panel to prepare framework for implementation of Assam Accord||An eight-member committee was set up by the Assam government on Saturday to prepare the framework for implementation of Assam Accord and all of its clauses. The committee will also focus especially on the Clause-6 report which will be prepared by a central panel in a bid to protect the cultural, social and linguistic identity and heritage of the indigenous people, officials told news agency PTI.The commissioner and secretary of the Implementation of Assam Accord Department, GD Tripathi, said that the sub-committee will submit its report within the next three months.“The Governor of Assam is pleased to constitute a sub-committee to examine and prepare a framework for implementation of all clauses of Assam Accord in general with special emphasis on Clause-6 (High Level Committee Report)," the notification said.The notifications also said that emphasis will be placed on Clause 7, 9 and 10 along with updating the National Register of Citizens, issues of flood and erosion, rehabilitation of families of martyrs and victims of Assam agitation.The sub-committee will be headed by the Implementation of Assam Accord minister Atul Bora. It will also consist of three ministers and five members from the All Assam Students' Union (AASU). State finance minister Ajanta Neog, parliamentary affairs minister Pijush Hazarika along with AASU president Dipanka Kumar Nath, general secretary Sankar Jyoti Baruah, chief adviser Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya, and advisers Prakash Chandra Das and Uddip Jyoti Gogoi are part of the committee. Deputy secretary of the Implementation of Assam Accord Department Sujata Suchibrata also was appointed as the convener of the sub-committee.The decision to form the committee was taken last month after chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma met members of the AASU.The Assam Accord was signed in 1985 after a six-year-long violent anti-foreigners movement which stated that names of all foreigners settling in Assam on or after March 25, 1971 be deleted from electoral rolls along with taking measures to deport them.Successive state governments also formed a series of committees to implement the pact in letter and spirit but many clauses including the controversial Clause-6, remain unfulfilled.Clause-6 of the Assam Accord states that constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.Clause 7 of the Assam Accord states, “The Government take(s) this opportunity to renew their commitment for the speedy all-round economic development of Assam, so as to improve the standard of living of the people. Special emphasis will be placed on education and science and technology through establishment of national institutions.”The Clause 9 of the Assam accord seeks sealing of the international border, increasing patrolling on land and river routes, building adequate check posts to stop future infiltration and building a road along the border to facilitate patrolling by security forces."It will be ensured that relevant laws for prevention of encroachment of government lands in tribal belts and blocks are strictly enforced and unauthorized encroachers evicted as laid down under such laws," Clause 10 of the Accord states.The High-Level Committee (HLC) constituted by the Union ministry of home affairs and headed by Justice Biplab Kumar Sarma submitted its report in February 2020 to then chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal for handing it over to Union home minister Amit Shah. However, the chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, ahead of the Assam assembly polls in February said the government cannot implement the recommendations of the HLC citing that they were far from ‘legal reality’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-forms-panel-to-prepare-framework-for-implementation-of-assam-accord-101633191106770.html

02-10-2021||India||UK updates advisory for people coming to India, mentions 10-day quarantine||The UK government has updated its advisory for people travelling to India a day after India made 10-day quarantine mandatory, in a reciprocal move to the UK's stand on recognition of India's vaccination certificate."Travellers irrespective of their vaccination status, arriving in India will undertake COVID-19 RT-PCR test on arrival at the airport and on day 8 after arrival at their own cost and will undergo mandatory quarantine at home or at the destination address for 10 days after arrival in India," the updated advisory said adding that the new rules will come to force from October 4.A UK government spokesperson told PTI that the government is in "close contact" with India and the travel advisory will be updated with the latest information on any change to the rules.On Friday, India made 10-day quarantine mandatory for all travellers coming to India from the UK, irrespective of their vaccination status. It was an exceptional move as India has not announced such restrictions for any country so far.The travel restriction was in response to the UK government's new travel rules which too will be implemented from October 4. Despite recognising Covishield, a formulation of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, the UK government has so far refused to accept India's vaccine certificate. This makes a doubly vaccinated Indian traveller in the UK similar to an unvaccinated traveller as both of them will have to undergo 10-day mandatory quarantine.Reports said the UK is looking at expanding the role that vaccination can play more widely for those who have been fully vaccinated elsewhere to enter the UK. “We are working with an array of international partners and look forward to continuing the expansion of the policy to countries and territories across the globe in a phased approach. Extension of vaccine certification will be reviewed approximately every three weeks,” sources said to PTI.As the engagement between India and the UK government is still going on and no resolution to the issue has been found, from October 4, 10-day quarantine will be mandatory in both the countries, irrespective of the vaccination status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-updates-advisory-for-people-coming-to-india-mentions-10-day-quarantine-101633188755932.html

02-10-2021||India||'Comedy of errors': Amarinder Singh replies to Surjewala, says Congress is in total disarray||Punjab's former chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday lashed out at the Congress amid the political crisis and accused it of spreading "preposterous lies... in a clear bid to cover up their mishandling of the crisis in the state." Singh also said that Congress is "in total state of panic" ahead of the legislative assembly elections.Responding to the party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala who claimed that Singh lost the support of 78 MLAs, out of 79 MLAs, Singh said, it is a "comedy of errors." The statement came soon after Surjewala shared the numbers and said, "When a chief minister loses the trust of the MLAs, he should step down from the post." "If we wouldn't have changed the CM, it would have been termed as a dictatorship."In his statement, Singh also targeted Sidhu with whom he was locked in a long battle over various differences and said, "It seems the entire party has become imbued with Navjot Singh Sidhu’s sense of comic theatrics." "Next they will claim that 117 MLAs wrote to them against me!" he further said in a jibe against Surjewala.Singh further said that the Congress was "in a total state of disarray, and the crisis seemed to be escalating by the day, with a large majority of its senior leaders completely disenchanted with the party functioning.""The fact of the matter was that the 43-odd MLAs who had signed the said letter had been forced to do so under duress," he clarified.Amarinder Singh also claimed that the "entire affair was orchestrated by Navjot Singh Sidhu and his aides." "I have won every election in Punjab since 2017. It was not the people who'd lost trust in me... Don't know why they're allowing him to dictate terms even now," he said.The outburst of Singh comes in the backdrop of a series of political developments taking place in Punjab ahead of the legislative assembly elections. After two months of Sidhu's elevation as chief of Punjab Congress, the cricketer-turned-politician resigned from his post on September 28. It was done even as Singh continued to express his opposition to the party's decision.Meanwhile, Amarinder Singh, who resigned from the post of chief minister last month, said on Thursday that he will leave the party but will not join the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/comedy-of-errors-amarinder-singh-replies-to-surjewala-says-congress-is-in-total-disarray-101633184172565.html
02-10-2021||India||HT This Day: October 3, 1955 — Nehru inaugurates railway coach factory||The Perambur Integral Coach Factory went into production today when Mr. Nehru performed its inaugural ceremony in the assembly shop in the presence of a large gathering. As the Prime Minister pressed the button to unveil the first coach to be assembled in the factory, from a crane overhead rained rose petals. Instantly, the coach moved out of the shop to the strain of loud clapping. Mr. Nehru’s thoughts were dominated by the significance of the occasion which was to commemorate the anniversary of Gandhiji’s birthday. He said Gandhiji was not opposed to industrialization and, therefore, there was no contradiction between the celebration of his birthday and the inauguration of the coach factory. The bulk of India comprised villages which had to be reconstructed if the country was to progress. Community projects had already covered more than 1, 00,000 villages and would cover the entire countryside within a few years. The Prime Minister denounced casteism and the classification and stratification of society. The distance between officers and workers must go and anybody who considered manual labour beneath his dignity did not deserve his respect. He declared that the new factory at Perambur “is another great step in our march” and “represents fairly our march towards industrialization.”VILLAGE INDUSTRIES This factory, like all other factories, did not come in the way of development of village industries and the raising of the standard of living of the rural and urban population. Some people took a rather narrow and a lop-sided view of Gandhiji’s ideals without understanding all the aspects of their many-sided character. Many, he thought, laid emphasis on the philosophy for which Mahatma Gandhi stood, without understanding the spirit underlying it. For the functioning of a great movement in India and as the leader of the great struggle against a mighty empire, Gandhiji laid stress on the village industries. The Prime Minister said there could be no real advancement in the material stature of India without big factories. We cannot even maintain the freedom and independence of the nation without factories and all they represent.” At the same time, he did not think there could be well-being of India, large-scale employment, without widespread village industries. “There is no conflict about this in my mind,” he said.LATEST TECHNIQUES “Occasionally there may be some conflict. Basically we have to advance simultaneously and not one after the other. We cannot keep pace with the modern world unless we adopt the latest technique, whether it is for the big factory or for the small village industry. We cannot keep pace with the modern world unless we utilize the sources of power available in thy world today.” “Today we stand on the threshold of an atomic era. Atomic energy places an enormous new source of power at our disposal and you cannot ignore it. Even if you ignore it, others will not ignore it but will use it for their advantage. Therefore, we have to use all sources of power. We shall have to have this atomic energy when the time comes. At the same time, everything has ultimately to be judged in terms of the human welfare-in terms of the welfare of the millions of our country.” Therefore, the Prime Minister said, he was glad to come here on this auspicious occasion of Gandhi Jayanti and perform the opening ceremony. In India new factories were coming up and great changes were taking place, through great river valley and power projects. MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE The Prime Minister said he was impressed with the “magnificent structure,” which had been built with considerable ability and efficiency. He said he saw the big machines working in the factory. Most of these machines had come from foreign countries. “There can be no real progress or real industrialization in our country till the machines themselves are made in this country. So long as we have to rely upon other countries for the wherewithal, we are dependent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-3-1955-nehru-inaugurates-railway-coach-factory-101633183780739.html

The family members of Central government employees are entitled to ex-gratia lump sum compensation, the amount of which gets revised from time to time.The payment of gratuity, GPF balance and Central Government Employees Group Insurance Scheme (CGEGIS) amount after the death of an employee are made in accordance with the nominations made by the government servant during service. But the ex-gratia compensation is made to the member of the family who is eligible for extraordinary family pension under the CCS (Extraordinary Pension) Rules, 1939 since provision for a nominee didn’t exist before.Also Read | Gujarat hikes dearness allowance for state govt employees by 11%The department of pension and pensioners welfare examined the matter in consultation with the finance ministry and decided that payment of ex-gratia compensation may be made to a member or members of the family in whose favour a nomination is made by the employee during service. If an employee fails to make anyone a nominee, the ex gratia amount will be divided equally among all eligible family members, according to an office memorandum published by the department of pension and pensioners.“Since the ex-gratia lump sum payment is payable to the family only, no nomination shall be made in favour of a person who is not a member of the family, even where the Government servant has no family,” the memo said.“If no nomination has been made or the nomination made by the Government servant does not subsist, the ex-gratia lump sum compensation will be shared equally by all eligible family members, as in the case of Gratuity, in accordance with Rule 51 of the CCS (Pension) Rules,” it added.The office memorandum was issued on September 30, 2021. The latest instructions will be followed in case the employee dies on or after the date of issue of the memo. Cases of payment of ex-gratia compensation on government employee’s death before the date of issue of the office memo will be dealt with as per the previous rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7th-pay-commission-govt-changes-rules-of-ex-gratia-compensation-payment-to-employee-s-family-101633180972472.html

When a chief minister loses the trust of the MLAs, he should step down from the post, Surjewala added, stoking the ongoing fiery exchange between Amarinder Singh and Congress leaders.This is the first time that an exact number was revealed by the Congress after Amarinder Singh's resignation as the chief minister as it was reported that around 60 MLAs wrote to the high command. Amarinder Singh refuted the allegation and issued a statement saying Harish Rawat had earlier said 43 MLAs had written to the high command.  Amarinder Singh admits he was under pressure. ‘Of loyalty to Congress,' he saysThe political blitzkrieg has escalated after Amarinder Singh's Delhi visit where he announced that he would resign from the Congress as he has been humiliated by the party leadership.Ex-Punjab CM Amarinder Singh gearing up to float own party, may tie up with BJPFacing questions from G-23 leaders, the group of rebel Congress leaders who pushed for massive reforms in the Congress starting with the election to the post of the party president, the Congress countered Amarinder Singh's claims and Harish Rawat, on Friday, said the Captain was not at all humiliated and was actually wielding a free hand in Punjab. Harish Rawat alleged that Amarinder Singh did not even take into consideration the recommendations a Congress panel made for Punjab.Amarinder Singh's exit has projected a narrative that the Congress is sidelining its senior leaders while projecting junior comparatively junior leadership like Sidhu at the front. Surjewala on Saturday clarifies that the party had no other way except to remove Amarinder Singh as he lost the trust of his MLAs.Amarinder Singh, however, challenged the figure that 78 MLAs turned against him and said, "Next they will claim that 117 MLAs wrote to them against me!"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-lost-support-of-78-mlas-out-of-79-surjewala-s-swipe-at-captain-101633180214763.html

Pawar also said that he came to the event only because it was Nitin Gadkari's project and Gadkari wanted him to be present. "I remember that before Gadkari took over this responsibility (of the ministry of road transport and highways), about 5,000 km of work had been done. But after he took over, the figure has crossed 12,000 km," the NCP chief said at the inauguration project at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra where Gadkari was also present at the dais."I am attending this function because I was told that Gadkari was going to inaugurate many projects in Ahmednagar which would solve long-pending issues of the city, and he wants me to be present," Pawar said.Pawar said that most of the times nothing happens after the stone-laying ceremony of a project is over but this is not true for a project that Gadkari is overseeing. "But when it comes to Gadkari's projects, within a few days of the function one sees the work starting," Pawar said.Gadkari and Sharad Pawar share a close bond beyond politics on which Gadkari spoke on an earlier occasion. "Once (Samajwadi Party leader) Mulayam Singh asked me how was it that I and Sharad Pawar were seen together at Murli Manohar Joshi's felicitation in Parliament though we are from rival parties. I told him that in Maharashtra, politics happens only during elections, afterwards we become friends," Gadkari had said.Road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari is mostly busy reviewing the works of his ministry. At such an event recently in Haryana where he went to review the progress of the New Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he said he managed to keep himself busy with work during the lockdown. He delivered so many lectures online that he now earns ₹4 lakh from his YouTube channel per month, he said. One of Nitin Gadkari's next projects is to make it mandatory for all vehicle manufacturers to make flex-fuel engines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-it-comes-to-gadkari-s-projects-sharad-pawar-praises-nitin-gadkari-101633179371819.html
02-10-2021||India||PM Modi slams oppositions for ‘political deceit’, ‘intellectual dishonesty’||Accusing the opposition of "intellectual dishonesty" and "political deceit" in its criticism of his government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said tough and big decisions need to be taken to bring benefits to citizens who should have received them decades ago.In an interview to Open magazine, Modi took on his political rivals over their attack on him for decisions like new farm reform laws, rollout of the GST and Aadhaar, and construction of a new parliament building, as he accused them of doing a U-turn and launching a malicious campaign for political reasons after earlier promising or advocating similar measures.Look at those who are opposing the pro-farmer reforms today, and people will see the real meaning of "intellectual dishonesty and rajneetik dhokhadhadi" (political deceit), he said.It is one thing if a political party makes a promise and is unable to deliver on it but what is a "particularly undesirable" and "detestable" trait is some of these parties made promises on the lines of the reforms enacted by his government and have now done a U-turn and spread "the most malicious kind of misinformation on the promises they themselves had made", he said."These were the same people who wrote in their manifesto that they would enact the same reforms that we have brought. Yet, just because some other political party, blessed by the will of the people, is enacting the same reforms, they have made a complete U-turn and in a brazen display of intellectual dishonesty, completely disregard what will benefit the farmers and only seek what they think will benefit them politically," Modi said.He asserted that his government is committed to empowering small farmers.The ruling BJP has said that several opposition parties, including the Congress, had promised similar farm reforms that the Modi government has enacted but are now backing protests against the new laws for selfish political reasons.A section of farmers, especially in Punjab and part of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting against the laws, whose implementation have been put on hold.The prime minister said similar "political deceit" can be seen when it comes to Aadhaar, GST, farm laws and even crucial matters such as arming our security forces."Don't you think political parties were making a mockery of themselves when their members spoke about the need for a new parliament, previous speakers said that a new parliament was needed? But if someone tries to do it, they oppose it by making some excuses, how correct is this?" he replied to a question about his government's reforms in fraught sectors like agriculture and labour.He said, "The things that people of India are entitled to, those benefits that they should have received decades ago, have still not reached them. India shouldn't be put in a situation where it has to wait any longer for the things that this country and its citizens are entitled to, we should give it to them. And, for this, big decisions should be taken and if need be, tough decisions should also be taken."The prime minister noted that his government has been saying right from the beginning that it is ready to sit together with the protesting farm bodies and discuss on those issues on which there is a disagreement."Many meetings have also been held in this regard but no one till now has come up with a specific point of disagreement that we want this to be changed," he said.Modi said politics in India had seen only one model under which governments were run to build the next government, while his fundamental thinking is different as he believes in running the government to build the nation."The tradition has been to run the government to make your party win but my purpose is to run the government in a way to make our country win," he said.Referring to his government's measures like cooking gas cylinder distribution and building toilets for the poor or push to digital payments, he said many sections of India's political class view people through the lens of "Raj Shakti" (government's power) while he sees them as "Jan Shakti" (people's power).He also drew a distinction between his government and the previous governments saying earlier ones were fundamentally formed under the leadership of a person from "Congress Gotra"."And that is why, for each of them, there was no difference between their political thought process and economic thought process. Atalji was given an opportunity by people but he didn't have a full majority. It was a coalition Government. I am fortunate that this is the first non-Congress government that was given a full majority by the people. This means that the people of this country voted for complete change," he added.The prime minister also asserted that India has done better than many developed countries in handling the Covid pandemic.In an apparent attack on those who have criticised his government's handling of the Covid pandemic, he said, "However, we have in our midst vested interests whose only aim is to tarnish India's name. Covid was a global scourge with all countries equally affected. In this scenario, India has done better than its peers and many developed countries, notwithstanding such negative campaigns."The biggest lesson from the Covid fight has been that India has an unparalleled ability to unite, find a common purpose, come together, and a tremendous capacity to deliver when a need arises, he said.From being a net importer of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, India has now become one of the biggest manufacturers across the globe, he said."Imagine if our country had not come up with a vaccine. What would be the situation? We know that a large population of the world doesn't have access to Covid vaccines. Today, our success in vaccination is thanks to India being Atmanirbhar (self-reliant)," he said.Modi also said that he attaches a big importance to criticism as it is his conviction that this helps in his own healthy development."I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very few. Mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. And, the reason for this is that, for criticism, one has to do a lot of hardwork, research and, in today's fast-paced world, maybe people don't have time. So sometimes, I miss critics," he said.After years of compulsive reforms, his government has ushered in reforms through conviction, Modi said, noting that it undertook the exercise during the Covid period too in established sectors like insurance, agriculture and labour, or in futuristic sectors like telecom and space."Our reforms are not only aimed at achieving our economic objective of Atmanirbhar Bharat but also focused on Ease of Living, unlike earlier governments which viewed economic reforms through a narrow prism of facilitating business ventures," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-slams-oppositions-for-political-deceit-intellectual-dishonesty-101633178258158.html

This comes days after the Centre delayed the procurement of Kharif crops till October 11, sparking protests in Haryana and Punjab by farmers.According to the previous order by the Union ministry, widespread rainfall has been experienced across Punjab and Haryana during the second fortnight of September and untimely showers have affected the standing paddy crop in both the agrarian states. Paddy procurement for 2021-22 Kharif marketing season in Punjab was to commence from October 1, while in Haryana it officially started from September 25."The procurement of Kharif crops will start from tomorrow (October 3) in Haryana as well as Punjab," said Choubey after holding a meeting with Manohar Lal Khattar, chief minister of Haryana.The Haryana chief minister also confirmed the change in the government order. "Due to delay in monsoon, the central government had postponed the start of procurement of paddy and millet to October 11 from 1 this year... the procurement will start tomorrow," news agency ANI quoted Khattar as saying.Following the change in order, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a coalition of over forty farmers' unions, withdrew their demonstrations for the early start of procurement of Kharif crops.Earlier in the day, Haryana police baton-charged the people protesting over delay in paddy procurement in Panchkula. Protesters broke barricades and gathered outside the residence of the Haryana Chief Minister in Karnal as they agitated against the previous order.Similar protests were also reported on Friday from Kaithal, Kurukshetra and Panipat districts as farmers locked the gates of market committees to express their resentment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-farmers-protest-govt-says-it-will-begin-paddy-procurement-in-haryana-punjab-from-tomorrow-101633177320829.html

Sibal, who has lately been critical of the grand old party's functioning, said the violence was never the part of statecraft during Congress rule and that the party is making all the efforts to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, according to news agency ANI."The Congress party is making efforts to follow the principles of Gandhiji. Even the Congress party had formed government at Centre but violence was never part of statecraft," the former Union minister said while visiting the Sabarmati Ashram.Taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) claims of bringing India on the path of development, Sibal said India came into existence only after 2014 and all IITs, IIMs, and other reputed institutions were built by the BJP government, reported ANI."Leaders from Gujarat who've reached Delhi, maybe they know little about Gandhi ji. He (Gandhiji) has always said there is only god and the god is the truth. I want to ask Modi Ji, where is the truth? There are lies in words, even in work," ANI quoted Sibal as saying.Also Read | 'Those tweeting Godse zindabad irresponsibly shaming the nation': Varun Gandhi on Gandhi JayantiEarlier this week, Sibal renewed criticism of the Congress after Captain Amarinder Singh had to step down from the post of Punjab chief minister amid turmoil in the party’s state unit. The veteran Congress leader said he wasn’t aware who takes the decision in the party since it has no president.Congress workers gathered outside Sibal’s Delhi residence to protest against his remarks and reportedly damaged his car. Several Congress leaders, including Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari, condemned the incident."Those who are trying to defend the command performance last night, this is what happened at Kapil Sibal's house. They damaged the car. Stood on top so it caved in. Threw tomatoes both outside and inside the house. If this is not hooliganism then what else is it?"

Reports said the UP government put Paramhans Acharya under house arrest to stop him from going to the Sarayu, but according to a video that is now viral, the seer will now take Jal Samadhi by immersing his nose in the Sarayu water that he had already arranged for, he said showing a white water can in the video. Jal Samadhi is choosing to end life by immersing in water."I earlier announced to take Jal Samadhi if India is not declared as Hindu Rashtra by October 2. Now the administration has put me under house arrest. But even under house arrest, I will take Jal samadhi as I have brought Sarayu water. Let's see. God willing, I will be successful because the country comes before life. India will be saved only after it's declared a Hindu Rashtra," he said. भारत को हिन्दू राष्ट्र घोषित करने की मांग कर रहे महंत परमहंस ने चेतावनी दी है कि आज रात 12 बजे जल समाधि ले लेंगे। उन्होंने आश्रम में ही सरयू के जल में नाक डुबोकर समाधि लेने की घोषणा की है। जिला प्रशासन के निर्देश पर उन्हें हाउस अरेस्ट कर दिया गया है#UttarPradesh #Ayodhya pic.twitter.com/iTU7tTYApOOn September 28, Paramhans Acharya Maharaj demanded that apart from declaring Hindu Rashtra, the Centre should also terminate the nationality of Muslims and Christians.Earlier, Paramhans Acharya Maharaj took a 15-day long fast with the same demand and had also wanted to self-immolate in a pyre.

There has been an increase in the deployment and it is a matter of concern for us. We are also carrying out matching developments in terms of infrastructure and deployment of troops.

The new guidelines will come into effect on October 3 and will remain in force in the state till October 16.The fresh guidelines focus on easing economic and other activities in Aizawl Municipal Corporation (AMC) area and other parts of the state.The order issued on Friday night said that it has been felt necessary to give more focus on providing better treatment to Covid-19 patients than imposing stringent restrictions despite a spurt in infections.Here are the key points of the guidelines issued by Mizoram government:• The new order allowed the re-opening of churches in Covid-19 affected AMC area and also in other parts of the state only on Sunday and Sabbath (Saturday) during daytime with 50 per cent seating capacity.• Churches in Covid-19 free towns and villages outside AMC area have been already re-opened on August 22.• School and other higher education institutions will continue to remain closed in AMC area. Training institutes will, however, be allowed to re-open with 50 per cent seating capacity in the state capital, the order said.• Re-opening of public parks is now allowed even in AMC area with 50 participants subjected to permission of local level task force of the locality where such park is located.• Social or public gatherings like anniversary or birthday celebrations and other gatherings are now allowed in AMC area with either 50 per cent of the seating capacity or 50 attendees, whichever is less, the order said.• The number of attendees in funerals and weddings in AMC area has been increased from 30 to 50 or 50 per cent of the seating capacity, whichever is less, it added.• The government has now allowed full re-opening of all business shops, market places, hawker stalls, hotels, restaurants (with 50% seating capacity) and tourist lodges, among others, across AMC area.• All government offices in the state will now open with full staff, the order said.• Intra-state movement is allowed under exceptional cases.• Night curfew will continue to be imposed in all district headquarters between 8pm and 4am.Covid-19 situation in MizoramMizoram on Saturday reported 1,626 new Covid-19 cases pushing the state's tally to 96,456, the state health department said. The death toll rose to 314 as three more persons succumbed to the infection in the last 24 hours, an official said.The state now has 16,361 active Covid-19 cases and its positivity rate is above 20 per cent.The state has so far conducted more than 11.12 lakh samples tests for Covid-19.On Thursday, Mizoram recorded 1,741 new cases of Covid-19 infections.On Tuesday, the number stood at 1,846, Mizoram's highest-ever single-day tally. On September 21, the state had reported its previous highest single-day spike of 1,731 Covid-19 cases.What's behind Mizoram's high Covid-19 infections?The small state with just over 1.1 million people (according to the 2011 census) has been recording over 1,000 new cases every day for nearly three weeks. Almost untouched by the first wave last year, it has now seen its infection tally go up rapidly.The state government conducted some studies to understand the reson behind this increasing trend. Based on their findings, the government claimed that lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) in a close-knit society where visits to each other’s houses are common, is one of the main reasons for the high prevalence of infection in the state.Dr Pachuau Lalmalsawma, state nodal officer and spokesperson, added that strict contact tracing and mass testing have also added to the increase in the number of daily cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-release-fresh-covid-19-guidelines-more-relaxations-offered-10-points-101633171848713.html

The EC said that both factions will not be allowed to use the party name unconditionally, nor can they use the ‘Bungalow’ symbol that the LJP has used till now.The Election Commission asked both the factions to choose three free symbols in order of preference before 1pm Monday. The Commission will then allocate the symbols.Union minister Pashupati Nath Paras, with the help of Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser, ousted Chirag Paswan from the position of party chief. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in June recognised Pashupati Kumar Paras as the leader of the party in the Lower House.Chirag Paswan, who said that he was betrayed by his uncle, blamed Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and also hinted that even the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may have played a role in deepening the rift between the party. “It is Nitish Kumar and his partymen who have targeted not only my party but also my family members,” Paswan said while speaking to HT earlier this year.He also said that the silence from the BJP could also mean that their state unit too played a role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eci-freezes-ljp-s-party-symbol-as-paswan-paras-feud-continues-101633169685555.html

CM Bhupesh Baghel says not becoming Punjab||With more Congress MLAs from Chhattisgarh joining their colleagues in New Delhi amid speculation of a leadership change in the state, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Saturday reiterated that there is no political movement and the MLAs are going to Delhi on their own wish as they are all independent individuals. Reacting to former chief minister Raman Singh's statement that Chhattisgarh is going the Punjab way, Baghel said Chhattisgarh can never become Punjab.The speculation is Chhattisgarh Congress is split between two camps, one belonging to Bhupesh Baghel and the other belonging to health minister TS Singhdeo, who is demanding a change of guard in the state. On Friday, Singhdeo said, "The tussle is not as bad as is being portrayed. The high command will take the decision according to the current situation and no new situation has emerged."6 more Chhattisgarh Congress MLAs arrive in DelhiThe development in Chhattisgarh comes at a time when the Congress is facing a crisis originating from Punjab. Captain Amarinder Singh's exit from the chief minister post over his disagreement with Navjot Singh Sidhu has got senior Congress leaders speaking out against the functioning of the party.Baghel has completed 2.5 years as the chief minister in June and now the supporters of Singhdeo are demanding a change in the guard in favour of Singhdeo, though the Congress never talked about rotational chief ministership when it came to power in the 2018 election. As of now, around 30 Chhattisgarh MLAs are already in Delhi. Baghel has been downplaying the movement though the number of Chhattisgarh MLAs visiting Delhi together is quite surprising.  “Tell me one thing - can't legislators go anywhere. Every step should not be seen as politics. Anybody can go anywhere. Even you (mediapersons) tour with your friends and it doesn't mean every time the purpose is getting news,” Baghel said on Thursday. The Congress high command had summoned both Baghel and Singhdeo to Delhi in August to resolve the feud and the leadership issue was solved for the time being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-happening-in-chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel-says-not-becoming-punjab-101633164575930.html

Apparently miffed over not having a say or being consulted in several key decisions, Sidhu sent is his resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.The resignation has still not been accepted an in this four days since his sudden decision, the Congess has held several rounds of hectic parleys to bring the situation under control ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab.Among the several rounds of churning, reports have emerged that Harish Rawat could be replaced by Harish Chaudhary as in-charge of party's affairs in Punjab. Chaudhary is currently the revenue minister in Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan and is considered as close to Rahul Gandhi.When asked about the buzz, Chaudhary told news agency ANI, "Whatever opportunity I would be given, I'll take it. Sidhu is with Congress, it's party's internal matter."He added, "The decision (on Sidhu's resignation) will be taken by state in-charge and party president."Chaudhary has already been appointed as as an observer of the party’s affairs in Punjab by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. He was part of the Congress legislature party (CLP) held last month along with another observer, Ajay Maken, where Charanjit Singh Channi was chosen as the leader.Chaudhary was part of the meeting called by Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Chandigarh on Thursday to resolve issues raised by Navjot Singh Sidhu. The meeting at Punjab Bhawan, which lasted for three hours, was also attended by state cabinet minister Pargat Singh and leaders like Pawan Goyal and Kuljit Nagra.It was decided in the meeting that a coordination committee will be formed that will be consulted on all major policy matters and decisions of the government in Punjab. People familiar with the matter have said that the panel is likely to be headed by a central leader (most likely Chaudhary) and may comprise Channi, Sidhu and a third leader.A senior leader said that Sidhu will continue as Congress Punjab unit president.The Punjab Congress has already sent the proposal to the party's top leadership. An announcement regarding this is expected to be made soon after the nod from the Congress high command.Sidhu's resignation as state party chief intensified the crisis in the Punjab Congress. A minister and three Congress leaders, considered close to him, also stepped down from their posts.Sidhu was made Punjab Pradesh Congress Committed (PPCC) chief by the Congress leadership in July to stem infighting in the state unit ahead of next year's assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harish-chaudhary-to-be-cong-s-punjab-affairs-in-charge-this-is-what-he-says-101633161870294.html

This came as the crisis within the Congress' Punjab unit continued to remain in the media spotlight amid the ongoing infighting. "If a big political party like Congress remains without a head, then it naturally causes confusion. I am sure the Congress party will soon resolve its internal matters," news agency ANI quoted Sanjay Raut as saying.On Friday, the Shiv Sena said the confusion prevailing over the leadership in the party was as much responsible for the political crisis in Punjab as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Sena also claimed that although Rahul Gandhi was trying to resolve the issues faced by the Congress, the old-timers in the party were in a secret pact with the BJP to stop him from doing so with the aim of sinking the party, reported PTI.Also Read: Harish Chaudhary to be Cong's Punjab affairs in-charge? This is what he says"The Congress needs a full-time president. What is the use of a body without a head?... The Congress is ailing and it is being treated, but whether that treatment is right or not needs to be reviewed," the party said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’."Rahul Gandhi is trying to fix the leakages in the old mansion (Congress), but some old feudal lords are not letting the new people work. They have started claiming ownership over several things in the mansion… It is now confirmed that the party's old guard is in a secret pact with BJP and they are trying to sink Congress," it alleged.The remarks come against the backdrop of ongoing turmoil in Punjab ahead of the assembly elections slated for next year.Upset that his commands were not being followed after the cabinet expansion in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned as Congress president in the state on September 28, the position he was elevated to only in July. Shortly after, a minister and three Congress leaders, considered close to him, stepped down from their posts.Before that, Amarinder Singh tendered his resignation as the chief minister of Punjab on September 18 following months of infighting between him and Navjot Singh Sidhu. He said that the Congress leadership had let him down. And when Sidhu resigned from his post, Singh sought to take a dig at him and called him an "unstable man".Charanjeet Singh Channi took oath as the 16th chief minister of Punjab on September 20, days after Amarinder Singh stepped down from the top post in the state.In the Congress-led Chhattisgarh too, a political crisis seems to be brewing with state health minister TS Singh Deo demanding a change of guard. After the Bhupesh Baghel-led government completed two-and-a-half years in office in June, the supporters of TS Singh Deo raised the issue of rotational chief ministership. On the other hand, more than a dozen Congress MLAs are now camping in Delhi to extend their support to current chief minister Baghel to continue his post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-a-big-political-party-sanjay-raut-s-advice-to-congress-amid-punjab-turmoil-101633161386553.html

He also slammed a counter trend being popularised by a section of Twitter praising Nathuram Godse who assassinated Gandhi, popularly known as the Mahatma."India has always been a spiritual superpower,but it is the Mahatma who articulated our nation’s spiritual underpinnings through his being & gave us a moral authority that remains our greatest strength even today. Those tweeting ‘Godse zindabad’ are irresponsibly shaming the nation," Varun Gandhi said in his tweet.India has always been a spiritual superpower,but it is the Mahatma who articulated our nation’s spiritual underpinnings through his being & gave us a moral authority that remains our greatest strength even today.Those tweeting ‘Godse zindabad’ are irresponsibly shaming the nationHe did not use any hashtag, but his post received close to 1,000 retweets and over 5,000 like within an hour on Gandhi Jayanti.#नाथूराम_गोडसे_जिंदाबाद (Nathuram Godse Zindabad) is among the top trends on Twitter on Saturday. Though this may come as a surprise for many Twitter users, the micro-blogging website has an algorithm which enables a particular topic to trend.Twitter has said that the trends is served to users based on a combination of factors, including the geographical location, their interests and the handles they follow. But the trends tab - from where Varun Gandhi picked up the Godse trend - is based on the number of tweets being posted on a particular topic, or name.

His son, Anil Shastri, was also seen paying tributes at Vijay Sthal.Lal Bahadur Shastri was born on October 2, 1904, in the Mughalsarai district of Uttar Pradesh. Being involved with politics at a very young age, Shastri played an important role in India’s freedom struggle from the British Raj. Shastri, who was regarded as a secularist who rejected the mixing of politics and religion, also emphasised fighting for the country’s poor population.He was appointed as the Prime Minister in 1964 after Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s death and held charge of the top post till 1966. He led India during the Indo-Pak war of 1965 and gave the slogan ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’.

WhatsApp said in its report released on Tuesday that 20,70,000 Indian accounts were banned during the said period. WhatsApp also said it received 420 user reports spanning across account support (105), ban appeal (222), other support (34), product support (42) and safety (17) during August and that 41 accounts were "actioned" or took remedial action during this period. According to the messaging platform, taking action means it has either banned an account or restored a previously banned account as a result of the complaint.More than three million Indian accounts were banned by WhatsApp, which also received 594 grievance reports, between June 16 and July 31. The company has said in the past that more than 95 per cent of bans are due to the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging or spam. The global average number of accounts that WhatsApp bans to prevent abuse on its platform is around 8 million accounts per month.Also read | Blocked 2 million accounts in India in 1 month, says WhatsApp in new reportIt also said that it may have reviewed the reports but may not have included them as “actioned” for reasons, including the user needing assistance to access their account or to use some features, user-requested restoration of a banned account and the request is denied, or if the reported account does not violate the laws of India or WhatsApp's terms of service.The government’s new IT rules, which came into effect on May 26, require large digital platforms with more than 5 million users to publish compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken. WhatsApp has emphasised in the past that it has no visibility into the content of any messages as it is an end-to-end encrypted platform. It said that besides the behavioural signals from accounts, it relies on available unencrypted information, including user reports, profile photos, group photos and descriptions as well as advanced AI tools and resources to detect and prevent abuse on its platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banned-over-2-million-indian-accounts-in-august-says-whatsapp-101633153579946.html

Just as Indian Army-Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) stand-off on Gogra in East Ladakh was resolved in the 12th Corps Commander meeting on July 31, India intends to take up all the remaining issues one by one with China while not allowing PLA to unilaterally change the status quo along the 3,488-kilometer Line of Actual Control (LAC). Next on the table are resolving stand-off at Hot Springs near Kongka La, Demchok and restoration of patrolling rights in the Depsang Bulge.It is understood that India has identified 18 friction points on the LAC that needs to be resolved between the two armies before peace and tranquillity is restored along the undemarcated border. “We intend to take up each friction point one by one so that both sides are clear about the arguments in support of their posture,” said a former foreign secretary.The future of bilateral relations between the two countries will depend on the time taken to resolve the border issues. In May 2020, the PLA threw the 1993-1996 bilateral border agreement out of the window and decided to militarily change the status quo in East Ladakh with transgression on north banks of Pangong Tso, Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs with the intention of superimposing an already rejected 1959 line (as proposed by then Chinese PM Zhou En-Lai) on the 1597km LAC in East Ladakh. The situation flared up in Galwan on June 15, 2020, when the PLA tried to be belligerent with the Indian Army at patrolling point 14, resulting in the loss of 20 Indian soldiers, including Col Santosh Babu, in hand to hand combat.Both the PLA and Indian Army are deployed on the LAC and continue with patrolling with the perceived border with the PLA troops brought down to East Ladakh for military exercises in June 2021 having gone back to their respective bases. There is no unusual activity in the Central sector.While Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane is reviewing its deployment before the onset of winter in East Ladakh, the national security planners have strengthened the Central Army Command, given the proximity of the Barahoti LAC to New Delhi. Unlike the past when the Central Army Command had been virtually reduced to a training command with two deployed brigades in the central sector, the present formation is robust with three full-fledged divisions under its Lucknow based command. The situation is no different in the eastern sector with the Indian Army matching the increased PLA deployments east of Lhasa to Nyingchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-take-up-border-friction-points-one-by-one-with-china-101633151195974.html

I call on all countries to work together, harmoniously, to sign a mutually agreed pact. At the very least, we can acknowledge a certification programme using vaccines approved by the World Health Organization (WHO),” Livemint quoted Poonawalla as saying, citing the Serum CEO's exclusive interview with The Telegraph.Under the new rules announced by the UK government, Indian citizens travelling there will be considered “unvaccinated” even if they are fully inoculated or, in other words, taken both doses of a Covid-19 jab. Covishield is the Indian variant of Britain's AstraZeneca vaccine and the SII manufactures it locally under that name. It is among six vaccines approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). Due to their “unvaccinated” status under the new norms, Indians will have to undergo a mandatory 10-day quarantine upon arriving in the UK.

He participated in the 1942 Quit India Movement as India raised its demand for the British to leave.3. He became the Prime Minister in 1964 after Jawaharlal Nehru's demise and led India during the war with Pakistan in 1965. As the prime minister, he stopped drawing his salary during the war between India and Pakistan in 1965, when the nation was facing a food shortage.4. Shastri was also responsible for the White Revolution, a campaign that supported the production of milk. In 1965, he also promoted the Green Revolution in India with the aim of farmers' prosperity and to make India self-reliant in foodgrain production. Green Revolution remains the model operation in India that benefited the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.5. Shastri continues to inspire India's farmers and soldiers as he is the man behind the iconic slogan of "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan".6. "India will have to hang down her head in shame if even one person is left who is said in any way to be untouchable," was one among his many inspirational quotes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lal-bahadur-shastri-s-117th-birth-anniversary-remembering-india-s-2nd-pm-101633136812356.html

02-10-2021||India||On Gandhi Jayanti, know the importance of forest satyagraha||Forest satyagraha emerged as an important part of India's freedom struggle during 1930 when Mahatma Gandhi started the Civil Disobedience Movement. It was from Chhattisgarh's Tamora village that the tribals of that area followed Gandhi's path of non-violence through forest satyagraha against the British. The movement was led by Dayabati, a girl from the Tamora village.History of forest satyagrahaForest satyagraha was a unique feature of the Gandhian movement in Chhattisgarh in 1930. The forest law of British started in 1930, under which the entry of animals into the forest for fodder was banned and there was a compulsion to keep animals at home. It is said that while implementing the forest law, the British captured most of the cattle of Tamora and the surrounding villages. The cattle owners were also accused of breaking the forest law and the tribals were harassed in the name of the law.In the forest satyagraha, the forest laws were disobeyed in several ways, such as by leaving the cattle for grazing in the prohibited forests, by collecting wood and leaves from these forests without obtaining permission from the forest authorities and by a social boycott of the forest and revenue departments employees of the British. The main theme was to cut grass and twigs from the forests so as to protest and disobey British laws. The peasants, villagers and tribal men and women played an active and important role in this movement.The satyagrahis urged the British officers to release the animals and when they did not obey, the forest dwellers passed a resolution. The movement was started by Yeti Yatanlal and Shankar Ganoudwale, who were looking after the proceedings of India's freedom struggle for Chhattisgarh. On September 6, 1930, the last resolution to break the forest law was passed.Forest rightsChhattisgarh has emerged as a leading state in recognition of individual and community forest rights. More than 441,000 individuals and over 46,000 community forest rights have been distributed to the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. Under the Forest Rights Act, 2006, 1,158 hectares of forest land has been provided to various departments for conducting 2,309 projects regarding 13 purposes including roads and community centres, schools, dispensaries, Anganwadis and fair price shops, reports news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-gandhi-jayanti-know-the-importance-of-forest-satyagraha-101633131489931.html

02-10-2021||India||Pay ₹10 lakh to families of 2 girls who died at aaganwadi centre: HC to Odisha||BHUBANESWAR: More than nine years after two 4-year-old girls playing at an anganwadi centre drowned in a pit, the Orissa high court has ordered the government to pay ₹10 lakh each to the parents of the children ruling that their death was a violation of the constitutional right to life of the two young children. Asking the state government to pay the compensation within a month, the bench of chief justice S Muralidhar and justice BP Routray said death of two little children was entirely avoidable and would not have occurred if barricades had been erected around the excavated pits where the two kids drowned.On September 7, 2012, bodies of Monalisa Naik, the daughter of Jambeswar Naik and Priyanka Das, daughter of Pitabas Das, were found in the waterlogged pits excavated in the anganwadi centre operating in the premises of Tentulihata Project upper primary school under Banarpal Block of Angul district. Both the girls fell in the 4.5 feet deep pit that was dug for construction of additional classrooms.Their parents approached the high court seeking action to fix responsibility on those responsible for the death of their children as well as compensation.The high court said the photographs proved that that the rainwater filled pits were left unguarded with no warning sign anywhere.“With there being no barricades, no warning boards or signs, there is no way the two young children would have known that there were water filled pits, of 4 ½ feet which they had to avoid stepping into. The lack of barricading of the pits or any warning sign appears to be the reason why they met with a tragic death. There can be no doubt therefore that there was gross negligence on the part of the school management and the district administration in not barricading these pits. There was a complete absence of any standard of care or even anticipation of the likely danger posed by an unguarded excavated pit 4 ½ feet of depth,” the court said.The court said the State has to “endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years” and a safe and secure environment should have been provided even to children attending anganwadi centres.It also asked all district collectors to ensure strict compliance with the Supreme Court’s 2009 guidelines for prevention of fatal accidents involving children. The guidelines were issued after a 6-year-old child, Prince, was stuck in a 60-feet borewell in Haryana’s Kurukshetra district. Prince was rescued after a 50-hour-long operation by National Disaster Response Force and army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-rs-10-lakh-to-families-of-2-girls-who-died-at-aaganwadi-centre-hc-to-odisha-101633121199799.html

Sandesh Nagaraj, the JD(S) legislative council member, on Friday said that there was no “doubt” that he wanted to join the BJP. “I was not in contact with JD(S) for the last one and half years and will remain their legislator till January 5, 2022. No doubt about it,” Nagaraj said on Friday. Nagaraj’s term in the upper house of the state legislature ends on January 5 next year. The statements come days after Srinivas Gowda, the sitting MLA from Kolar decided to part ways with the JD(S) on September 21 and is expected to join the Congress. Srinivas Gowda on Friday said that he was “neglected” by the party because of the “father and sons”. At least two other legislators have also hinted at the possibility of departing from the JD(S), which its detractors and members have often attributed to the family-centric style of politics. “We have a factory that produces political leaders. Like vision 123, from 1983 we have continued to produce them, they take training from us and after completion they go wherever they get a higher salary,” HD Revanna, Deve Gowda’s son and senior JD(S) leader said on Friday.He, however, said that he will not like to comment on Srinivas Gowda or his comments.JD(S) had lost power in 2019 after three of its legislators and 14 others from the Congress, its alliance partner, defected to the BJP after the Lok Sabha elections that helped reinstate BS Yediyurappa to a fourth-term as chief minister. The simmering dissent within the JD(S) started to boil over since its alliance with the Congress in 2018 to keep the BJP out of power. The cadre of the JD(S) and Congress have fought bitter and bloody battles in the Old Mysuru region and were willing to move towards the BJP when the two decided to fight out the 2019 Lok Sabha elections together. This was further compounded when former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy imposed the candidature of his actor son, Nikhil, from Mandya over several other aspirants in which the JD(S) lost by a huge margin against a BJP-backed independent, Sumalatha. Former Prime Minister Deve Gowda too lost in the 2019 assembly elections after he decided to give his Hassan seat to his other grandson, Prajwal Revanna, and decided to contest from Tumakuru, in which he lost to a relatively unknown BJP candidate. The BJP won an unprecedented 25 out of the 28 parliamentary seats in Karnataka, reducing the JD(S) and Congress to just one each. The BJP and Congress are both gaining from the dissent within the JD(S) that draws its strength from the Old Mysuru region in Karnataka, where the dominant Vokkaliga community continues to back the regional outfit. The developments come barely a month before the two bypolls--Hanagal and Sindgi--on October 30 and the soon-to-be held Zilla and Taluk Panchayat elections that would serve as a good indicator for the 2023 assembly elections. The BJP is looking to make inroads into the old Mysuru region to help the saffron outfit return to power on its own in the 2023 assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-jd-s-mlc-may-quit-party-likely-to-join-bjp-next-year-101633120717675.html

Basava Jaya Mruthyunjaya Swami, the pontiff of the influential Kudalasangama Panchamasali Peetha said that the community would not undertake the satyagraha after assurances made by the chief minister.The pontiff said that the community leaders would request the government to get the report of the backward classes commission and once handed, they would wait three months before they revive their struggle.“The state government should get the report from the backward classes commission at the earliest. After the report comes, we demand that the government give us our reservation within three months to which they have agreed. If not, we will revive our protests and continue our satyagraha in Bengaluru,” the seer said on Friday.Bommai and other senior leaders from the government held discussions with the seer and other prominent leaders of the struggle on Friday morning in what has become a successful bid to get the latter to forgo the agitation.The overt assurances made by the Basavaraj Bommai-led government feeds into and from the same politics in which dominant communities continue to be prioritised over marginalised groups who have sought to block the Panchamasali into the 2A category as it would further deprive the latter of reservation-assured opportunities.“We had requested the seer not to go ahead with the Satyagraha,” CC Patil, Karnataka’s minister for public works and a member of the Panchamasali sub-sect said on Friday.He said that the government was committed to help the community and was the only one to have reciprocated to their demands.This development comes as a major relief to Bommai who has been battling one crisis after another and has tried to keep all of them under check to avoid adding more challenges to his already challenging term in office. The decision by the community comes a month ahead of the two bypolls in Hanagal and Sindgi on October 30 which the BJP is hoping to win and add to its overall tally.The Panchamasalis have kept up their struggle to be included in the 2A category from the existing 3B in the state reservation list to get better opportunities for its followers.Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, a Lingayat himself, has long depended on this community to propel his and the BJP’s fortunes in the southern state over decades.In Karnataka, caste-groups are believed to back one of the three major political parties--BJP, Congress and JD(S)--which allows these outfits to pander to the interests of these specific communities which continues to bolster the dominant-caste political culture in the state.The BJP is believed to have the backing of the Lingayats and Brahmins while the Congress counts sections of the backward classes, scheduled caste and minorities as its support base. The Vokkaligas, another dominant community, have stood firmly behind former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and his former chief minister son, HD Kumaraswamy-led JD(S).The statements come at a time when several caste groups have intensified their respective demands for better reservation opportunities in employment and education.Caste plays an important factor in Karnataka’s political and social life as well as targeted policy to help get the backing of such communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panchamasalis-call-off-plans-for-hunger-strike-over-reservation-demands-after-karnataka-cm-bommai-s-assurance-101633120064503.html

Police said that there were signs of torture, especially burn marks on the girl’s body. The girl was under treatment for burn injuries at the Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS), however, she died in the hospital on Friday morning. “She was found by some farmers who had heard her crying. They took her to a private hospital. From there she was shifted to the BIMS after her condition worsened,” said a senior district police official. According to officials, initially, sexual assault was suspected as there were cigarette burns on the body. However, a medical test report confirmed there was no sexual assault. “During the investigation, we realized the burns were made using camphor and almond oil. Since they were commonly used in black magic and the patterns on the body suggested the same, we are investigating the same,” the officials added. Police said they were unable to identify the girl yet. Police had circulated photographs of the child and requested people for any information about her or her family. She wasn’t able to give a statement to the police either since she was unconscious. “To identify her we have circulated her photograph in neighboring districts. We have asked all stations to provide details of the missing complaints reported in the station,” said police officials. The investigators are suspecting that the parents of the girl could be involved in the case, since no missing complaints have been filed in any of the stations. “We have even sent her photos and requested information from police departments of Maharashtra and Telangana police, but there was no information,” added Athani police officials. On March 21, two grandchildren of a former MLA were found dead under mysterious circumstances near a lake at Ballatagi village in Sirwar taluk on Monday, triggering suspicion of witchcraft behind their death. Varun (9), and his younger brother, Sannaiah (5), who went missing on March 19, were found dead the following day, sending shockwaves through the village, which has seen unabated incidents of children being allegedly killed by those performing black magic. Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and Black Magic Act, 2017 received the assent of the governor on December 6, 2017, and was formally notified by the current BJP government on January 4, 2020. However, activists say that instances of black magic are still reported in the region. “These are not first instances of black magic in the district and particularly in north Karnataka. As of now, police are only acting when there is pressure on them, and no proactive steps have been taken by them. The situation is such that the mobile numbers of black magicians are easily available in Belagavi but no action has been taken,” said a Belagavi-based activist and lawyer, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twoyearold-girl-found-dead-in-karnataka-village-police-suspect-human-sacrifice-101633119698673.html

He said that instructions to demolish these buildings were given in 2019 itself, but no action was taken. Fresh instructions have been issued to demolish these buildings within seven days and to conduct a fresh survey to identify more old buildings which are at the risk of collapse, he added. “Even though there are 185 such old buildings, only 10 of them have been demolished so far,” said the minister. He said that instructions and a deadline have been given to authorities regarding these instances. “We have given them seven days to time to issue notices to these buildings. The deadline is just for one week,” said Ashok. The minister added if these buildings are not demolished within the seven days, respective departments have been asked to demolish the buildings with the help of the police. He also added that the cost of demolition will be added to the existing property tax dues of the owners. The revenue minister further added that while the seven-day notice was issued to the building identified in the survey conducted in 2019, a fresh survey will be conducted to find buildings that are in a dangerous condition that didn’t come under the 2019 survey. “We have given 15 days to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to identify any building that is in a damaged state and could collapse. A deadline has been given to concerned departments to provide this report within 15 days and notices should be issued at the earliest,” the minister added. According to Ashok, action will be taken against BBMP officials, who have allowed construction near old buildings. “It has come to our notice that construction has been allowed near buildings that are old. Several buildings have collapsed in the past after the builders undertook digging work to construct new buildings. We will identify officials who have given permission for such construction without adequate protection,” added Ashok. BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that orders have been issued to conduct a fresh survey in the city to identify buildings at the danger of collapse. The statement comes two days after two old buildings in the city collapsed. A day after a building collapsed in south Bengaluru’s Lakkasandra, another three-storied building collapsed in the same locality on Tuesday. Though suffered major injuries, however, according to eyewitness accounts some occupants of the building escaped in the nick of time. Three people sustained minor injuries in the incident. According to the department of fire and emergency services, the building was located on the premises of the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) at the dairy circle and it was occupied by the staffers of Bangalore Milk Union Limited (Bamul). Residents noticed cracks in the building on Tuesday morning and the department was alerted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-issues-fresh-order-to-raze-old-buildings-in-bengaluru-101633119463446.html

At that point of time neither my wife nor me were part of the trust and I was working under the Central Government as its employee. During 2020, the said trust requested my wife to become a trustee to promote its public activities and my wife with an intention to serve (the) public at large accepted the said offer. Thereafter, as per the process of law the Karnataka Housing Board has executed an absolute sale deed,” Jadhav said in a statement on Friday.He added that the entire process was done according to the law.“My wife has no pecuniary interest in the matter and as a philanthropist she wanted to assist the trust,” he added. The Karnataka high court on Thursday had quashed an absolute sale deed executed by the Karnataka Housing Board (KHB) in favour of a trust headed by the MP’s wife.The court alleged favouritism and even imposed a ₹1 lakh fine on the KHB as well as ordered to hold an inquiry into the alleged transaction and recover the cost from erring officials.The petitioner had alleged that there was collusion in the transaction which was executed 16 years after the allotment to circumvent the conditions of the original allotment.The land in question is a 278 square meter parcel of land in Yelahanka New Town which was originally allotted in August 2004, but the KHB had executed the sale deed only on July 28 last year.The petitioner, Adinayarana Shetty, had claimed that the land costing upwards of ₹10 crore was sold for just under ₹22 lakh.Jadhav had won Kalaburagi MP seat in 2019 after he managed to hand Congress heavyweight, Mallikarjun Kharge, his very first electoral defeat.“My political opponents have set up an alleged public spirited person to challenge the granting of such CA site in favour of the trust on the ground that the trust has not complied the condition of the conditional sale deed of putting up construction within two years, which the trust has complied and the condition is also not mandatorily required to be complied. Whether my wife is a trustee or not, the activity of the trust would go on for public purpose(s) as was done from 2004 to 2020, in her absence,” Jadhav said.He added that a prevailing market value of the site as of 2004 was duly paid.“Further the trust was also entitled for marginal land which it had possession right from the year 2004. Accordingly, at the present rate an amount of Rs. 18,00,000 crore is paid in addition. The high court has allowed the Writ Petition and has quashed the sale deed of the trust, but unnecessarily my name is dragged in though I have no interest in the matter. The trust is at liberty to take appropriate action as per law and I have nothing to say in the matter,” the MP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-no-role-in-charity-trust-land-allotment-case-kalaburgi-mp-umesh-jadhav-101633119037822.html

According to the fresh guidelines issued by the Basavaraj Bommai-led government, all schools with classes from 6 to 12 can operate with full capacity as Covid-19 positivity rates continue to remain on the lower side. BC Nagesh, Karnataka’s minister for primary and secondary education on Friday said that the government has given instructions to schools to hold classes from morning till evening. “We have also said that there students should not be compelled to attend since there is no lunch served,” Nagesh said on Friday. Students have started returning to schools since their phase-wise reopening since the last week of August. The Karnataka government has also allowed cinema halls, schools and other categories of institutions to resume 100% operations from Friday in places where the positivity rate is below 1%. Pubs will also resume operations with 100% capacity from October 3. There was an average of over 63% attendance in classes above class 9 as against just over 50% in classes from 6 to 8, according to government data on Friday. Karnataka recorded 589 new Covid infections in a 24-hour period, taking the active case load to 12,469, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Friday. The average positivity rate of Karnataka stood at 0.46%. However, 13 more people succumbed to the virus, taking the death toll to 37,807 with a case fatality rate of 2.20%. There are at least three schools in Bengaluru, Mandya and Kolar thay have been closed down as several covid positive cases were detected in them over the last week.

The said decision had directed all WSSCOs who secured over 60% marks to be eligible for permanent commission, subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance.A bench of justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna directed the Centre and Army to file their response by October 8 and ordered that none of the 72 WSSCOs be released from service.The women officers had filed contempt petitions against the decision of the army to deny them permanent commission (PC) after the results of the Special No 5 Selection Board (SB-5) held in September 2020 were declassified earlier this week.Senior advocates Huzefa Ahmadi, Meenakshi Arora and V Mohana, who represented the 72 officers, claimed the army had been “unfair” in denying the WSSCOs their right to PC by rejecting them on grounds such as “disobedience of orders, lapses in government procurement, forging medical documents, poor work ethics, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct, poor performance in courses”, which were not laid down as grounds in the March 25 judgment by the SC.They said the Centre pointed out that of the 529 WSSCOs who opted for PC, 514 fulfilled 60% marks criteria and 72 among them were held ineligible on other grounds. The court said, “You must implement the judgment (March 25) as it stands...”Additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain sought time to file response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-army-centre-s-reply-on-denial-of-permanent-commission-to-72-women-officers-101633118437387.html

02-10-2021||India||Army chief General Naravane reviews security in Eastern Ladakh||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh and reviewed security in a sensitive sector where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a border standoff for almost 17 months and both sides are carrying out negotiations to cool tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), officials familiar with the matter said.Naravane visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh where he was briefed on the prevailing security situation and the army’s operational preparedness, the army said in a statement. The army chief interacted with the troops and complimented them “for their resoluteness and high morale,” it added.The two-day visit came barely two months after the rival armies carried out the second round of disengagement in early August and pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the friction points on the LAC. The breakthrough came after the 12th round of military talks held on August 2.Earlier, India and China wrapped up the disengagement process in Pangong Tso area in mid-February, with both armies pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the LAC in 45 years. (The last recorded incident when bullets were fired at the LAC was in October 1975, when the PLA ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La and shot four soldiers dead).Problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff. Even after the disengagement from Pangong Tso and Gogra, the two sides still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre. The dates for the 13th round of talks to discuss the other friction points along the LAC are yet to be announced.The visit also came a day after the army chief said that developments along the LAC in Ladakh added to challenges faced by the Indian military on the “active and disputed borders” in the western and eastern fronts. The “unprecedented” military standoff with China required large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, addressing the annual session of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.On Thursday, he also visited the Rezang La War Memorial in eastern Ladakh and paid homage to soldiers killed in action during the 1962 India-China war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-general-naravane-reviews-security-in-eastern-ladakh-101633116877467.html

Eligible families will receive ₹50,000 each.The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on September 25 revised the items and norms of assistance under the SDRF, making a provision for grant of ex gratia payment to the next of kin of the deceased due to Covid-19.On June 30, the Supreme Court ruled that families that lost dear ones to Covid-19 were entitled to ex gratia payment under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. After the government informed the apex court about paying the compensation ex gratia from SDRF, the court last week said it was happy underlining that “we are certain what India has done, no other country in the world has done”. “We are happy that something has been done to wipe out the tears of persons who have suffered due to Covid-19,” a bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna had said.The MHA in a statement on Friday said “this step of Narendra Modi government will facilitate state governments to have enough funds in their SDRF.

The total outlay of the two projects was about ₹4.4 lakh crores.“We have to remember that maintaining cleanliness is not just for a day, a fortnight, a year or for a few people, it is a mega campaign for every day, every fortnight, every year, for everyone and a continuous programme from one generation to another,” the PM said.In its second phase, Swachh Bharat will focus on foolproof waste management while AMRUT will focus on enhancing sewerage and septic management and to make all Indian cities water secure. In the second phase, all statutory towns will become at least ODF+ and all cities with less than 1 lakh population would be ODF++, as per the sanitation protocols set by the urban development ministry.The Amrut 2.0 will extends coverage from 500 cities under the first phase to 4,700 cities and towns and provide water tap connections to 26.8 million urban households. The Swachh Bharat Mission will focus on completing liquid waste management in cities with less than 100,000 population and process to remove all legacy dump sites.The government said 4,798 municipal bodies have already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Centre.Additionally, around 350,000 individual, community and public toilets will be constructed.Modi, who took a personal interest in making the Swachh Bharat mission a success, said, “If we look at seven years before 2014, only ₹1.25 lakh crore was allotted for urban development. Under our government, we have allotted nearly ₹4 lakh crore for urban development. This investment has been done on cleanliness, waste management and new sewage treatment plants,”Modi dedicated the schemes a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, whose 152nd birth anniversary will be celebrated on Saturday, and said, “The journey of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and AMRUT Mission has instilled pride in every countryman.” proud. He hailed the missions for encapsulating respect, dignity, the people’s ambition and the “unmatched love for the motherland”.The PM said that toilet facilities brought about social changes. “Earlier, many women couldn’t go to work and many girls opted out of the school in the absence of toilets,” he added, noting that not just personal hygiene but social hygiene had also changed, highlighting the example of the Indian Railways.Union ministers Hardeep Singh Puri, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Prahlad Singh Patel, Kaushal Kishore, Bishweswar Tudu and ministers from states were present on the occasion.Modi also underlined that the venue, the Ambedkar International Centre, assumes significance as “Babasaheb believed in urban development as a great means of removing inequality.”“Many people from villages come to cities with an aspiration for a better life. They get employment but their standard of living remains in a difficult situation even compared to their lives in the villages. This is like double jeopardy of staying away from home, and after that to stay in such a difficult situation,” the PM added.He once again relied on people’s participation to make the schemes successful and said, “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas is critical” for the next phase of cleanliness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-launches-second-phase-of-swachh-bharat-mission-amrut-101633115618561.html

The 20-year-old student,who is a fresher in the nursing college, has in his complaint said that four students from the second year locked him up in a room, slapped and ragged him. “All of them stay outside the college in shared rental rooms and not in hostels. They dragged the complainant and hit him with their hands. There are no injuries. They have also ragged him for some time,” said S Murugavel, the assistant commissioner of police of Coimbatore, The student had been attending classes online and when colleges were allowed to reopen from September 1 onwards, he had come to the campus. The alleged ragging happened on September 20. Disturbed and shocked by the incident, the student went back to his family living in Kerala. On his family’s insistence, he returned to file a complaint. On September 29, the student returned to Coimbatore and filed a complaint at the Singanallur police station. The four students, all from the second year in the private nursing college, were arrested on Wednesday.

02-10-2021||India||SC refuses to entertain plea of ex-Kerala minister against Lokayukta report||New DelhiThe Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain an appeal by former Kerala minister K T Jaleel seeking to stay the Lokayukta findings that he had “abused” his position as a public servant to obtain a favour for a relative.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao declined to consider the plea challenging the Kerala high court order.The top court said it could have considered the case if it was a case of vague or ambiguous allegations but it is a clear case of a relative being favoured. Sensing disinclination of the bench, also comprising Justice B R Gavai, the minister’s counsel withdrew the appeal and the matter was dismissed as withdrawn.Senior advocate Gopal Shankaranarayanan, appearing for the ex-minister, argued that the findings of Lokayukta were reached without hearing him.He submitted that the complaint was filed after the kin of the ex-minister initiated proceedings against members of the rival Muslim League party for recovery of arrears from NPA accounts.There were no procedural lapses from the Lokayukta as alleged by the petitioner, the high court had observed.It said the Lokayukta report was furnished after examining all the files and documents in connection with the appointment of his kin as general manager in a state financial institution.Jaleel had resigned as the minister from the LDF government on April 13 after the Lokayukta held that he violated oath of office by appointing his relative to the post of general manager of Kerala State Minority Development Finance Corporation (KSMDFC).Jaleel had argued that the Lokayukta did not have powers to consider the matter as it concerned prescription of qualification and appointment to MDFC, which is specifically excluded from the purview of the probe under the Kerala Lokayukta Act.The state government had also supported Jaleel, saying he was not given an opportunity to present his views before the Lokayukta.In his plea, Jaleel had alleged that the report was prepared without conducting any preliminary inquiry or regular investigation.A division bench of the Lokayukta had recently submitted the report against Jaleel to the chief minister and had held that the allegation of abuse of power, favouritism and nepotism against the minister was proved.The Muslim Youth League had on November 2, 2018 alleged that Adeeb K T, a cousin of Jaleel, was appointed general manager in Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation, flouting rules.Adeeb was serving as manager of a private bank when the appointment was made.The Lokayukta had found that the minister had changed the qualifications for the post of general manager in the Corporation to add “B Tech with PGDBA” also as a qualification for the post to enable his second cousin, eligible for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-of-ex-kerala-minister-against-lokayukta-report-101633115139336.html

02-10-2021||India||TN wildlife officer orders hunting of tiger that killed a man||Chennai: Tamil Nadu chief wildlife warden Shekar Kumar Niraj issued an order on Friday to hunt a tiger as it has “become very dangerous to human life in the area”. Yet to be confirmed reports say that the tiger has killed four human beings, including a 55-year-old man, on Friday, in Nilgiris district. The tiger, identified as MDT 23, is present in the human habitation of Gudalur and has been preying on livestock too since July 2021. In the order, the district forest officer of Gudalur also confirms the tiger killed one man on Friday and a 56-year-old man on September 24. Since then teams have tried to capture the tiger but the big cat has been eluding them. “The said tiger MDT 23 has become dangerous to human lives in the area. People of that area are also demanding capture or killing of the tiger,” read the order from Niraj. “Today, as per the report received from Conservator of Forests and Field Director, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve through WhatsApp and other media, it has now been informed that the tiger MDT 23 has killed one person in the Masinagudi area today.”He authorised the Conservator of Forests and Field Director, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Udhagamandalam to take immediate action to “hunt the problematic tiger” under Section 11 (1) (a) of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The section says the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if he is satisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedule I has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or deceased as to be beyond recovery, by order in writing and stating the reasons therefor, permit any person to hunt such animal or cause such animal to be hunted. Niraj has ordered that the entire operation be photographed and video recorded and a detailed report to be submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-wildlife-officer-orders-hunting-of-tiger-that-killed-a-man-101633114846879.html
02-10-2021||India||Tamil Nadu plans to vaccinate 15mn against Covid in October mega drive: Govt||Chennai: Tamil Nadu has set a target to inoculate 15 million people in October through mega vaccination camps, state health minister M Subramanian announced on Friday. “We have come to a situation where people are coming forward to be vaccinated,” Subramnian told reporters. Tamil Nadu has so far conducted three mega-vaccinations camps on Sundays and a total of 14.2 million people were vaccinated in September. This is the highest since the vaccination drive began on January 16 across the country. In the mega vaccination camp held for 12 hours on September 12, the state surpassed its target of 2 million and achieved vaccination of 2.89 million people. The second camp on September 19 saw over 1.64 million people being vaccinated. This led to exhaustion of the vaccine stock in the state with nothing left for the next day on Monday. In the third drive held on September 26, over 2.49 million people were vaccinated . The state is now gearing up for a fourth camp to be held this Sunday. Tamil Nadu presently has more than 2.89 million vaccine doses in hand, the minister said. “We will utilise these doses during the fourth camp on Sunday. Like previous weeks, there will be 20,000 camps for the driver which will go on from 7am to 7pm,” he said.While the minister will tour the state to oversee the vaccination drive, state health secretary J Radhakrishnan will carry out inspections in Chennai. The capital city has been at the top of the number of vaccinations administered in every drive where vaccination during the mega drives are conducted in streets, beaches, shopping malls and public spaces. Simultaneous home vaccination for senior citizens above the age of 80 years and people with disabilities also continue.“So far, only in September maximum vaccinations have reached people where we covered more than 1.4 crore through the three Mega Vaccination Camps in the history of our vaccination”, the minister said. “Because of this we have received more than 37-lakh vaccines from the union government. So for October, 1.23 crore of vaccines are expected from the union government and we hope we can vaccinate more than we did in September by vaccinating 1.50 crore people,” About 800,000 doses were received on Friday evening. He said that the aim is to vaccinate at least 70% of the population as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and insisted by chief minister M K Stalin.Tamil Nadu officials have been using the achievements of these camps to seek more vaccines from the Centre. “We have proven that we have the capacity to vaccinate 50-lakh people per week if we get ample vaccines,” the health secretary had said earlier. On September 20, Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking allot 5 million vaccine doses every week to ensure that the entire eligible population can be covered by October.The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine also directed its officials on Friday via a circular to attend gram sabha meetings on Saturday across the state and create awareness among people, including on the importance of vaccination. Initially, there was widespread hesitancy in Tamil Nadu for taking the Covid-19 vaccines due to fear of side effects, among other factors. The perception began to change only during May and June when the second wave of Covid-19 had peaked and the state was under duress much like other regions due to shortage in medical oxygen. But vaccination numbers were still low but this time officials said that it was due to shortage in supply. But July onwards, there has been a steady supply of vaccines from the union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-plans-to-vaccinate-15mn-against-covid-in-october-mega-drivegovt-101633114718363.html
02-10-2021||India||Ashtamudi Lake, gateway to Kerala’s backwaters, now a sewage dump site||Kollam Kerala’s once scenic Ashtamudi Lake, described as the gateway to the state’s backwaters and preferred by tourists world over for houseboat rides, has become a dump site for sewage, which is slowly choking it to death, according to an inspection by the state legal services authority on the Kerala high court’s direction.“Very pathetic” is how the Kerala State Legal Services Authority’s (KeLSA) report to the high court describes the condition of the lake spread over an area of around 1,700 sq km and surrounded by swaying coconut groves and palm trees and spotted by several small islands.The report also said that sewage from nearby residences and government establishments was the main reason for pollution of the lake and also for putting its unique wetland ecosystem under risk of permanent damage.According to the Kerala Tourism website, cruises would give a “deeper look at the heart and spirit of the backwaters.”“The 8 arms or channels of the Ashtamudi Lake are what gave it its name. It is the entrance to the famous backwaters of Kerala and the houseboat rides here are extremely famous. The Kollam-to-Alappuzha route is considered among the best in the backwaters. Cruises here give you a deeper look at the heart and spirit of the backwaters,” the tourism site claims.However, the ground reality is something else according to local resident K M Salim, who said that no one would want to walk alongside the “highly polluted” lake let alone go for a “cruise” on it when it is reeking with the smell of decades worth of municipal solid waste and sewage.Incidentally, it is based on his letter sent to the high court that it decided to examine the issue, initiated a PIL on its own and asked KeLSA to inspect the water body which is the second largest lake in the state.Salim said tourism too has contributed to the lake’s pollution as effluents from the house boats are also discharged into the water body.District judge and KeLSA member secretary K T Nisar Ahammad, who inspected the lake, said the filth and garbage floating in the lake and choking its ecosystem, which includes thousands of years old mangrove trees, also includes “legacy waste” dumped there over the past several years.On being asked whether the filth in the lake was being termed as such due to it being “the legacy we are leaving” for future generations, he laughed and said, “Maybe”.The judge said that people do not realise that polluting the water body could very well affect the underground water in the area and eventually the general public health in the long run.“This situation is not just confined to Ashtamudi lake, it is prevalent in many other places in the state. People don’t realise that the quarrying of mountains and dumping of filth in rivers and lakes would have serious environmental consequences. There has to be awareness on this issue,” he said.The judge further said that with a little bit of effort the corporation could have cleaned up some portion of the lake, especially the part close to the KSRTC bus stand where the situation is really bad, but no one, including the local body, appeared to be bothered.He said that a few years back the government had sanctioned funds for cleaning up the lake, but it never took off and now there was another project, worth over ₹100 crore, in play for the same purpose.Salim said that the garbage and filth were being dumped in the area for years and as a result the more than 100 species of fishes, mangroves, coconut groves and palm trees were being adversely affected.A resident of the area for decades, he remembers his younger days when along with his friends he used to take a dip in the lake.“Now you cannot even dare to dip your hand in the water, as if you do you could end up having rashes or blisters or some other infection,” he said.Even fish, like Karimeen, found in the lake no longer taste the same as they used to during his younger days when Ashtamudi was not as polluted as it was presently, he said.“You cannot walk along the lake side without your olfactory senses being overwhelmed by the stink emanating from there,” he added.Photographs attached along with the KeLSA report, filed through advocate Santhosh Mathew, show all kinds of garbage and waste floating in the lake, along with the house boats, turning its colour to a murky green.In some photographs, which according to the judge “speak volumes”, the waterbody looks more like an open drain and less like a lake whose borders are also lined in many places with garbage.What is more anguishing, other than the inaction of the local bodies and their contribution in polluting the lake, is the fact that Ashtamudi despite being a Ramsar site -- a wetland site designed to be of international importance under Ramsar Convention which is also known as the ‘Convention of Wetlands’ -- nothing was being done by anyone to remedy the situation, both the judge and Salim said.The Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty adopted in 1971 by UNESCO and which came into force in 1975, provides for national action and international cooperation regarding the conservation of wetlands and wise sustainable use of their resources, according to the KeLSA report.The report by KeLSA further states that inspection of the lake revealed that the main reason behind its pollution was the direct dumping of sewage into it from the nearby government institutions, residences and a public toilet, very near to the waterbody, meant for passengers arriving at the KSRTC bus stand close by.It also said that while the Secretary of the District Panchayat denied dumping of sewage waste in the waterbody from a nearby district hospital, “the fact remains that the lake is highly polluted and its present condition is very pathetic.”Pollution of water bodies, like Ashtamudi Lake, in this manner was a “common scenario” in the whole of Kerala, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashtamudi-lake-gateway-to-kerala-s-backwaters-now-a-sewage-dump-site-101633114717277.html
02-10-2021||India||India ready to take lead in reviving global growth: Piyush Goyal at Dubai expo||A resurgent India is ready to take on the responsibility of being the frontrunner in reviving the global economy from the devastating impact of Covid-19 pandemic, Union minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday.Inaugurating the India Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai, Goyal said: “India is already a leading player in the global markets in IT, pharma and space technology, and with the development of research and innovation capabilities, the country’s prowess in these areas would help reap the benefits of new-age technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.”The pandemic, Goyal said, could not stop the momentum of reforms that the Narendra Modi-led government ushered in seven years ago. The fiscal and policy measures taken by the government are set to boost the country’s manufacturing and exports’ potential and make India a global economic hub, besides strengthening its capabilities in the technology space, he added.“The lessons learnt from the pandemic have also emboldened our confidence of surpassing any challenges in the future with the help of our scientific and entrepreneurial research and development capabilities. Whether it is development of pharma and healthcare products or running of the world’s biggest vaccination program banking on the two indigenously-produced vaccines, India has set several examples,” he told the crowd.From here, productivity will play a big role in achieving a sustained high growth phase that India has already embarked upon, leaving behind the impact of the coronavirus, Goyal said, citing the 20.1% gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of FY-22. The Indian economy had contracted 24.4% in the same quarter of FY-21 due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.This not only signals a strong revival but also the potential for economic rebound in a big way, the minister said. “We have a huge advantage in our young populace, and with the help of the New Education Policy (NEP), and its focus on skill development, the productivity levels in the country are set to rise substantially to support the growth objectives,” he added.Congratulating the UAE leadership for being able to deliver the event amid difficult times, Goyal said: “It is happening at a time when India is celebrating 75 years of its independence, and UAE is celebrating the 50th year of its foundation. UAE is one of India’s most valued partners and a close friend. EXPO 2020 will prove to be a landmark in strengthening the relationship between the two countries further”.Goyal also said that a proposed free trade agreement between India and the UAE holds huge potential for both the countries to boost trade and investment and that investors here are “very” positive about doing business in the Indian market.“I see a huge potential in this (deal) between the two countries. The UAE is a gateway to all of Africa and many other parts of the world. UAE also has a huge Indian diaspora, has a huge market for products like textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, footwear, and food products, which are labour oriented and provide economic opportunities,” he said.Last month, the two countries had formally launched negotiations on the pact, officially dubbed as Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). “I think the partnership will be a win-win for both the countries,” he added.While India-UAE trade has also been impacted by the pandemic, it was valued close to USD 60 billion in 2019-20 with UAE being India’s third-largest trading partner and being India’s second-largest export destination after the US, with an export value of approximately USD 29 billion in 2019-20.UAE is also the eighth largest investor in India and has invested USD 11 billion between April 2000 and March 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubai-expo-2020-india-ready-to-take-lead-in-reviving-global-economy-says-piyush-goyal-101633114657694.html
02-10-2021||India||Cyclone Gulab may have caused damages worth ₹2,000 crore||The economic impact of cyclone Gulab that hit Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts is estimated to be around ₹2,000 crore, with much of it being borne by farmers, according to RMSI, a global disaster risk management firm.“Gulab is a very unique cyclone as it made landfall in AP, crossed large parts of India and moved out into the Arabian Sea over Maharashtra and intensified again,” said Pushpendra Johari, senior vice-president-sustainability, RMSI.The bulk of the losses is estimated from agriculture (about 70%), followed by damages to buildings at about 20% (including 50% residential, 32% industrial and 18% commercial), according to RMSI’s assessments. Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts in Andhra Pradesh and Ganjam and Gajapati districts in Odisha faced maximum winds due to Gulab while East Godavari, West Godavari, Guntur, Krishna, Prakasam, Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts in Andhra Pradesh saw floods. In Odisha, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Puri, Jajapur, Jagatsinghpur, Baleswar, Khorda and Cuttack also saw flooding, according to RMSI.“The governments of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh proactively took measures to reduce impact. Odisha’s chief minister Naveen Patnaik set a ‘zero casualty’ target in the coastal districts of the state as the Odisha government evacuated as many as 3,049 people and shifted them to 204 relief shelters. Forty-two teams of the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force and 24 squads of the National Disaster Response Force, along with about 102 teams of fire brigade personnel were dispatched to seven at-risk districts,” RMSI said.However, there are reports of several fishermen from both Andhra Pradesh and Odisha missing, despite early warnings issued by nodal agencies.And agriculture bore the brunt. “Crop was in its final stages in Andhra Pradesh. Due to heavy rain, standing crop fell. There was a lot of water stagnation because of which other than paddy, all crops, including vegetables which were in flowering stages, are damaged. I think the loss is huge for farmers,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad.Gulab, though it did not intensify into a severe cyclone, came during the harvest season, compounding the effect of the cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-may-have-caused-damages-worth-rs-2-000-crore-101633114418467.html
02-10-2021||India||Telangana registers 40% excess rain during monsoon for second consecutive year||Hyderabad: For the second consecutive year, Telangana has received nearly 40% excess rainfall this south-west monsoon season which ended on Thursday, officials said on Friday.According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS), the normal average rainfall in the state during the monsoon that commences on June 1 and ends on September 30 is 720.5 mm. But this year, the state received an average rainfall of 1009.7 mm, which is 40% more than the normal, a bulletin from the society said.Out of 122 days of monsoon season, there were rains across the state for as many as 105 days. “This is only for the third time in the last 15 years that the state witnessed such abnormally high rainfall during the season. However, the rainfall last year was the highest – it was 46% more than the normal,” an official in TSDPS said.Out of 33 districts, six – Nizamabad, Warangal (urban), Karimnagar, Rajanna Siricilla, Siddipet and Narayanpet – received abnormally excess rainfall, ranging from 63% to 94%. Another six districts – Mancherial, Peddapalli, Jogulamba Gadwal, Nagarkurnool, Suryapet and Mulugu -- received normal rainfall.“All the remaining 21 districts received excess rainfall, ranging from 26% to 51%,” the official said.Except for a few days of dry spell in August, the rest of the season witnessed heavy rainfall due to active south-west monsoon and also impact of Cyclone Gulab. The entire July and as many as 28 days in September received heavy rains.“Some parts of the state witnessed 12 cm to 21 cm of rain in a span of 24 hours, which is a rare phenomenon. Such a huge rainfall was recorded for a period of 33 days this season,” he said.Telangana continues to witness rains despite the ending of south-west monsoon on Thursday. “The monsoon continues to be active and it is likely that the state will witness widespread rains till October 15,” Hyderabad meteorological department director K Nagaratna said.Due to continuous rainfall, all major reservoirs on Krishna and Godavari rivers continue to receive huge inflows up to their brim. Srisailam reservoir on Krishna river received an inflow of 71,000 cusecs by Friday evening and the irrigation authorities are letting out 75,000 cusecs to the downstream, as the water level in the reservoir reached 883.76 ft as against the full reservoir level of 885 ft.Nagarjunasagar dam is receiving an inflow of 97,000 cusecs and the authorities are releasing the same quantity of water to the downstream.All the reservoirs in Godavari basin are full and the irrigation department are letting out the heavy inflows into the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-registers-40-excess-rain-during-monsoon-for-second-consecutive-year-101633114297189.html
02-10-2021||India||Run off the road, Ford workers face up to a grim reality||He remembers that October morning as the most important of his life. One month after Ford unveiled its new hatchback, Figo, in September 2009, 19-year-old Vijay Kumar waited in line with many others at the company’s factory on the outskirts of Chennai, nervous and fidgety. He was hungry, having arrived on a bus from his home town of Theni, tucked away in the hills over 500km kilometers away. The first question the interview panel asked him was if he had eaten. He told them he hadn’t, because he didn’t want to be late.After testing his knowledge on the technicalities of automobiles, about the company, and the specifics about the entry level job he was applying for, the panel closed the interview. The last thing they told Kumar was that there was a nice canteen with free food, and he should eat before he headed home. “I loved that they cared,” said Kumar. Twelve years later, Kumar found out that Ford, the company that was his life for over a decade, would soon be shutting down. Via WhatsApp.“I thought it was a fake message,” he said. “This is what our relationship has come down to? They couldn’t even inform us in person.” After his day shift which ended at 3.15pm, he gathered with his colleagues at the Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) office, 1km from Ford’s plant. The sense of helplessness was universal.On September 9, Ford Motor Company announced that it would be shutting down its manufacturing facilities in India. “As part of the plan, Ford India will wind down vehicle assembly in Sanand by the fourth quarter of 2021 and vehicle and engine manufacturing in Chennai by the second quarter of 2022,” the company said in a statement. The Michigan-headquartered company arrived at this decision to close down due to the accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion over the past 10 years in India, a $800 million non-operating write-down of assets in 2019, persistent industry overcapacity, and lack of expected growth in India’s car market.Ford’s exit follows other global majors Harley Davidson and General Motors that quit in 2020 and 2017 respectively. Despite exploring several restructuring options, the company wasn’t able to find “a sustainable path forward to long-term profitability that includes in-country vehicle manufacturing,” said Anurag Mehrotra, president and managing director of India, in the statement.Ford entered India in the early 1990s, ahead of even Hyundai, but never acquired the scale of operations or range of products that could make it profitable. It was late with its small car; did not become a serious player in sedans; and missed the economy-SUV (or popular SUV) boom that benefited latecomers such as Renault.The statement on its exit was issued by the company at 3:28 pm from its Gurugram office. In Chennai, first word from the management to the Chennai Ford Employees Union came half an hour before that. Selvaraj Kannan, former president of the CFEU which has 2,450 members, said, “They asked five officer-bearers from the union to come to the company at 1pm on September 9 and told them that they’re going to close down and there will be no change in that decision.”With no time for the information to disseminate, most employees, like Vijay, learnt about the news that would change their lives through a phone call, or a WhatsApp message.Ford employs about 182,000 people worldwide. In Chennai, there are 2,638 permanent employees and around 2,000 employees on contract. Besides them, there are a sizable number of employees from other ancillary companies who work exclusively to supply parts for Ford vehicles.Experts estimate that at least 4,000 MSMEs will be affected by Ford’s decision to close. “In any auto industry, the ratio is that for every one direct employee, there will be four indirect employees and two gig workers from service providers. Close to sixteen thousand workers overall face an income loss,” said KE Raghunathan, Convenor of Consortium of Indian Associations (CIA) who was formerly the national president of the All-India Manufacturers’ Organisation.There are about 2,700 auto ancillary units in Tamil Nadu for which the entire turnover is contributed by Ford, Raghunathan estimated. Besides, the shutdown will also take away jobs of services providers that had mushroomed around Ford’s now iconic address in Maraimalai Nagar.Mohammad Meeran, for instance, runs a tyre shop and makes ₹3,000 a day, on the highway that connects Chennai to other districts in Tamil Nadu. Right next to his shop is a bus stop that is a landmark. The Ford bus stop. Half his business, he said, comes from Ford’s employees.Since the factory reopened on September 13, Meeran has had company – local police stationed on Henry Ford Road, anticipating trouble. On September 14, CITU led a two-hour protest, beseeching the company to change their minds. “Zero-chance, the management told us,” said Selvaraj.The Good DaysThe sense of an impending layoff seems surreal because of what Ford stood for in Tamil Nadu. There was social capital attached to working for the company, paid back in no mean measure by the organisation itself, according to employees. Kumar’s first salary in 2009 as a 19-year-old was ₹1,750 a month – enough only for rent and food. When a roommate, earning twice as much, offered him a job at his company, Kumar declined. The decision paid off. Three years later, Kumar was made a permanent employee, earning ₹18,000 a month, while his friend earned less than half of that. Cut to 2021, and Kumar earns a salary package of ₹8 lakh a year. In Tamil Nadu, progression like that was unheard of. “My family is really poor but Ford was my backbone,” Kumar said. In his time at Ford, Kumar paid for his younger sister’s wedding, provided for his parents in the village, got married, and is now father to a one-year-old boy.His shifts alternated between morning and evening, giving him the flexibility to study further. He came to Ford with a diploma in automobile engineering and has been studying a part-time B.Tech course in mechanical engineering at SRM university.It was after 2005 that Ford began to focus on hiring those like Kumar, with a diploma in automobile engineering. But between 1998, when Ford launched, and 2003, they largely hired unskilled workers who had studied up to Class 12, training them exclusively for work with the company.Joseph (who goes by one name), from Dindigul district, was hired from a recruitment camp in Madurai in 2000. It changed not just his professional life, but his social status. In 2005, the company sent Joseph to their automobile plant in the Philippines. “It’s a royal company,” his father would say. Banks were calling them to avail home loans. Families were happy for their daughters to marry a man from Ford. The employees even got to show off their work life. Annually for one day, each employee was allowed to bring invitees who could be family and friends to tour the company. Even if Joseph wanted to complain about the company, his family always reminded him Ford had changed his life. “Everyone is now dismayed,” he said.The rise in Tamil NaduFord entered the India market four years after the country’s 1991 reforms push, the first global car maker to invest near Chennai when the late J Jayalalitha was chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Soon after, even as the ruling dispensation changed and M Karunanidhi took over, other global giants such as Hyundai, BMW, Daimler, and Renault-Nissan, followed, making the city a car-making hub. Official estimates show that the industry grew to 200,00 direct employees, and 600,00 indirect employees. According to the state industries department, Tamil Nadu accounted for 45% of India’s motor vehicle/car exports in 2017-18 and 35% of India’s auto component production and is the largest tyre manufacturing state.Though Ford partnered with Mahindra & Mahindra during its entry, the company chose to set up outside Chennai, after it was actively wooed by a state government that ensured a supportive political environment, and reassured by the connectivity of an international airport, two seaports, and plenty of local labour.The Anxious NowWith Ford sure to exit Chennai by June 2022, most employees believe that no monetary package can compensate for the loss that is on the anvil, with the employee union set to argue for job guarantees. “Now the workers will have to go back to their villages and struggle again. We have all ended up with health issues like back pain and knee pain due to long hours,” P Senthil Kumar, general secretary of the employees union said.The union has approached the state government to intervene to ensure that the plant isn’t closed down. In the middle of September, Stalin met with industries minister Thangam Thennarasu but the government has thus far kept its cards close to its chest. “Ford is in talks with a few potential buyers and it is for them to decide on the sale of their manufacturing facilities,” said a senior government official who didn’t wish to be named. “Since Chennai has an ecosystem for automobile manufacturers with ancillary units in the surrounding regions, we hope someone will buy the factory and run it. The situation is evolving.”A spokesperson for Ford said that they had started discussions with the employees union. “We will work closely with unions to arrive at a fair and balanced separation package for represented employees who will leave our business,” the spokesperson said. “We plan to serve customers in India with must-have, iconic vehicles, including the Mustang coupe. Customers in India in the future will also benefit from Ford’s plan to invest more than $30 billion globally to deliver all-new hybrid and fully electric vehicles, such as Mustang Mach-E that we look to bring to India in the future,” the representative added.Raghunathan said that the need of the hour is intervention by the state to protect jobs. “The government can provide a one time subsidy of 10% of an MSME’s last turnover to reduce their burden of settlement. If the 300-odd ancillary units partly dependent on Ford want to improvise their infrastructure by reinvesting in their tools for a different client, they could be given a subsidised rate of interest and enhanced loan repayment capacity. If a new company is willing to re-employ the existing workers, the state could offer incentives like paying the employees’ provident fund and ESI for five years,” he said.In the here and now, P Senthil Kumar, general secretary of the Employees Union is worried about the immediate future of the workers. Three men, employed by Ford, have seen their engagements called off, a throwback to when Standard Motor Products of India Limited shut shop in 1994. Back then, “marriages were called off and people died by suicide,” another trade union member said on condition of anonymity. “That’s what is worrying us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/run-off-the-road-ford-workers-face-up-to-a-grim-reality-101633114179862.html
02-10-2021||India||Cyclone Shaheen turns into severe cyclonic storm, says IMD||Cyclone Shaheen over central parts of north Arabian Sea, which turned into a severe cyclonic storm on Friday, is likely to intensify further and move towards Oman coast before weakening gradually, officials at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.Though Shaheen may not cross the Indian coast, sea conditions will remain rough along Maharashtra and Gujarat coasts, and high (6-9m wave height/62 to 87 kmph) to very high (9-14 m wave height/70 to 116 kmph) over north Arabian Sea.Shaheen, which was formed from the remnants of cyclone Gulab, is likely to cross the Oman coast on the morning of October 4 but its trajectory can be confirmed only in a day or so, the officials added.“There may be some perturbations along the Maharashtra coast and seas will be very rough all along the Makran and Oman coasts. Fishermen have been advised not to go towards the north Arabian Sea. Conditions are favourable for intensification of Shaheen as the vertical wind shear is low and sea surface temperatures are slightly high, about 28 to 29 degree C,” Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD, said. At 5.30 pm on Friday, the cyclone lay centred about 570 km west-northwest of Devbhoomi Dwarka (Gujarat), 370 km east-southeast of Chabahar Port (Iran) and 540 km east-southeast of Muscat (Oman), officials said. It is very likely to intensify further in the next 12 hours and move west-northwestwards, skirting Makran coast, during the next 36 hours. Thereafter, it is likely to recurve west-southwestwards and move towards Oman coast, across the Gulf of Oman, and weaken gradually, the officials added.It is likely to cross the Oman coast as a cyclonic storm in the early hours of Monday, they said.Shaheen was formed after the remnants of Gulab, which crossed north coastal Andhra Pradesh and south coastal Odisha on September 26, traversed central and west India and emerged into the Arabian Sea on September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shaheen-turns-into-severe-cyclonic-storm-imd-101633114179340.html
02-10-2021||India||8 DU colleges announce 100% cut-off in 11 subjects||Eight Delhi University colleges on Friday announced 100% marks as the eligibility criteria for admission into 11 graduation programmes, a record for the number of courses that require a perfect score for a college seat. Cut-off scores have inched up over the years, and this year’s are a particular outlier, although not entirely surprising since a no-examination academic assessment for Class 12 students this year pushed the pass percentage and peak scores to new levels. Since 2015, there have been only three colleges in which 100% cut-offs were set: Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR) did it for admission to BA (honours) in political science, economics and psychology last year, and College of Vocational Studies and Indraprastha College for Women set it for BSc (honours) in computer science in 2015.This year, Ramjas College has set a 100% cut-off in three subjects – BA (honours) in political science, BSc (honours) in physics, and a combination BA programme including two popular subjects. Compared to last year, the three courses have seen an increase of one, two, and four percentage points in the eligibility threshold respectively.Like the past few years, BA (honours) in political science, economics, English, history, and psychology have emerged as some of the most sought-after courses, with cut-offs in the 96-100% range. Two DU colleges – Hindu and Ramjas – have set their cut-offs for political science at 100% while 19 DU colleges have set their cut-offs in the subject between 98-100%.Computer Science has also emerged as a popular course. Hansraj College, Deen Dayal Upadhyay College, and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies announced 100% requirement for the course. Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College also kept a 100% cut-off for its BCom course. Jesus and Mary College has kept a 100% cutoff for its BA (honours) in psychology for students who do not include psychology in their best-of-four subject combination.One of the most sought-after commerce colleges in the country, Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), has announced 100% cut-off in both BA (honours) in economics and BCom (honours), recording a jump of one and 0.5 percentage point respectively compared to last year’s score requirements. Most of the commerce courses across colleges are in the range of 97-100% with 38 out of 54 colleges offering BCom (honours) to students with a score of 98% and above.Since DU colleges do not follow a first-come, first-serve policy, all students making the cut have to be admitted, leading to the risk of more students being admitted than a college’s sanctioned capacity.Since there was no final end-term board exam, due to the Covid-19 second wave this year, the results of the Class 12 exams for most boards, including the bellwether Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), were prepared on the basis of a student’s past performance. A total of 220,156 CBSE Class 12 students scored 90% or more this year, compared to 196,620 in 2020 — a jump of nearly 12%. The number scoring 95% or more has almost doubled to 70,004 from last year’s 38,686.Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said the high cut-offs were a precautionary measure to tackle over-admissions. “This was a precautionary measure as political science was one of the most sought-after courses last year as well. We ended up admitting more than 200 students as against the 93 seats for the course. Even the BA programme saw surplus admissions last year. Covid-19 protocols are also here to stay and if students are called back on campus for blended learning, we have to ensure we have enough space to accommodate all students. This is why we just could not have over-admissions this year.”Khanna also said that lack of data sets affected the ability of colleges to understand or predict admission demand. “If we allowed students to apply for colleges and courses like previous years, colleges would have had some data points to understand what students prefer. In the absence of that, colleges are left with little information to predict trends and tend to be on the cautious side,” he said. For the past two years, DU application form allows students to select their courses and college after the cut-offs are declared.DDU College principal Hem Chand Jain said: “Colleges are left with no choice when they receive data sets stating that around 1,250 eligible students have scored around 100% as their best-of-four subjects. Computer Science has emerged as a popular subject as it has a lot of scope and only 20 colleges in the university offer the course so we had to keep the cut-offs high to avoid over-admissions. Till a few years ago, when students went to specific colleges to apply, it was easier for colleges to decide cut-offs because we had a data set knowing how many students want to study a particular subject at a particular college. But online admission forms now allow students to apply to all courses at one go. Lack of that specific data set also contributed to the high cut-offs. However, students should not be disheartened and try for the subsequent lists”.Hansraj College principal Rama Sharma said, “We had an extensive discussion with our department and analysed the data for previous years. Computer science has emerged as a popular course and we had over-admissions last year as well. As far as commerce courses are considered, students scoring 100% will prefer SRCC. We want to admit more students so we have kept the cut-offs lower so that students who do not have 100% get an option to study here.”Cut-offs for St Stephen’s College are announced separately. Admissions under the first cut-off will be conducted between Monday and Wednesday, and the second cut-off list will be released on October 9. The university is expected to release five cut-offs and a special cut-off. Officials said DU received over 250,000 applications, for around 70,000 undergraduate seats this year. The applications received are approximately 100,000 fewer than last year.So far, there is no clarity on the mode of classes to be conducted for these students when they begin their academic session in November. DU is currently only allowing final-year students to come to campus for practical work.Former Dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said this mode of admissions is not sustainable. “We cannot announce a cut-off higher than 100% or keep doing over-admissions. This is why an entrance test has been in demand for too long. Due to over-admissions, there is a distortion between the number of available seats and the number of students admitted in these courses affecting the teacher-student ratio, workload on teachers, and even infrastructural demands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-du-colleges-announce-100-cut-off-in-11-subjects-101633113996497.html

The panel, Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM), is headed by home minister Amit Shah; finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, and commerce minister Piyush Goyal are its members.The ministries of finance, home and civil aviation did not respond to email queries on the matter. While a Tata group spokesman did not respond to HT’s queries, its external spokesperson declined comment.A second person said the financial bids had been vetted by the core group of secretaries on disinvestment (CGD) headed by the cabinet secretary this week and the matter will now be considered by the AISAM. “No official announcement can be made before the ministerial group formally approves the name of the winner,” he said.Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), said in a tweet: “Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI [Air India] disinvestment case are incorrect. Media will be informed of the Government decision as and when it is taken.” Dipam is an arm of the Union finance ministry.Once AISAM gives formal approval to the winning bid by the Tatas, only formalities may be left for the salt-to-software conglomerate to take over control of Air India, founded by JRD Tata in 1932 as Tata Airlines.“The full handover process may, however, take some time,” a third person said.After the first attempt to divest Air India did not attract investors’ interest in 2017, the government launched the disinvestment process again in January 2020 and sweetened the deal by reducing the debt burden for the prospective owner as the airline was running into losses after its merger with domestic carrier Indian Airlines in 2007. According to Dipam, the airline had a total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019 and the successful buyer is expected to absorb about ₹23,286 crore.The Air India disinvestment process was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Financial bids were invited in April 2021 and bidders were asked to submit offers by September 15. The government wants to sell off its entire 100% stake in the company, including 100% stake in Air India Express Ltd (AIXL) and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt Ltd (AISATS).AIXL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, operated a low-cost carrier and is headquartered in Kochi. AISATS is a 50:50 joint venture between AI and SATS Ltd, Singapore. SATS is a leading provider of food solutions and gateway services with over 70 years of ground handling and catering experience.According to Dipam, AI is one of the most extensive flight service providers in India with network coverage of 98 destinations (56 domestic destinations with around 2,712 departures per week and 42 international destinations with around 450 departures per week) as of November 1, 2019. AI offers 75 additional destinations through its secondary network of code share operations covered under 25 agreements with foreign carriers. During FY2019, AI carried around 22.1 million passengers. The airline has a fleet of 121 aircraft (excluding four B747-400s), mainly comprising Airbus and Boeing planes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tatas-lead-race-to-acquire-air-india-101633113639137.html
02-10-2021||India||Ex-Punjab CM Amarinder Singh gearing up to float own party, may tie up with BJP||Former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh is set to launch his own political party and may even consider an alliance or seat adjustment with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, people familiar with the matter said, detailing a development that could alter radically the electoral landscape in the upcoming polls in Punjab.The former CM, who has announced his intent to quit the Congress, did not confirm or deny the information shared with Hindustan Times by people aware of his thinking after his recent meetings with home minister Amit Shah and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. The people couldn’t tell, however, whether the proposed tie-up would be predicated on the Union government taking steps to break the impasse over the three farm laws which are a hugely emotive issue in the state and have eroded the BJP’s popular base.For his part, the Captain merely said that he’s not the one to do politics through media statements.“I’d fight my battle in the field, in the court of the people,” he said, adding that he intends travelling to Delhi again and will sit down with senior Congress leaders (known as G-23) who are upset over the party’s shambolic state and the way its affairs are being run.Technically, the Captain is still in the Congress, but he has said that he does not intend to stay in the party. The formal parting of ways could come once his political plans are in place. “I’m going to tell the G-23 to hit the field, to reach out to people rather than expressing concerns in social media,” he said. The impact within the Congress of his outreach to similarly disaffected leaders will have to be assessed as most of them are seeking organisational changes, not an avenue to exit the party.Singh denied that he has been contacted by anyone on behalf of the Congress after he went public that he would quit. But a well-informed party functionary revealed that (in response to media reports of the Captain saying he felt humiliated), Congress president Sonia Gandhi messaged him to convey that she wished him well; and that it was never her intention to make him feel the way he did. She reportedly said that it wasn’t her way as she’s incapable of humiliating people or colleagues.Commenting on his September 20 resignation after receiving a call that morning from Gandhi who asked him to demit office, the Captain said “publicly I felt humiliated and personally I was hurt because my relations with the Gandhis go back to the days when Rajiv Gandhi and I were in Doon School in 1954”. He said he couldn’t figure out why the leadership chose to sack him rather than letting him gracefully leave three weeks earlier when he offered to resign. That was at a meeting with Gandhi and Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee incharge of Punjab.Singh wanted to put in his papers -- and said so at that meeting -- as there was no effort by the central leadership to rein in the new state party unit president Navjot Sidhu, who was attacking him publicly and relentlessly. But at that time, he said, Sonia Gandhi asked him to continue.Singh said he was unable to decipher as to why such shoddy treatment was meted out to him, ignoring his long service to the party and the electoral record of winning eight of 13 Lok Sabha seats, the local bodies polls, and the panchayat elections in the state. He had harsh words in that context for some AICC functionaries who, he believes, misled the leadership the way they blindsided him about the congress legislature party (CLP) meeting in Chandigarh. “They even made calls stopping legislators who wanted to meet me before the CLP meeting. Is that the way you treat the CLP leader?” He said he played fair till the very end, asking 30-odd leaders who had assembled at his residence to attend the CLP meeting while he called on the Governor to tender his resignation.“Can you imagine my sense of disbelief when a party MP telephoned me to inquire whether I had called the CLP meeting?” he said. Sonia Gandhi was on the line with him shortly after that, asking him to quit. On being reminded that just three weeks back she had wanted him to continue, the Captain said she simply said:“I am very sorry Amarinder, you should resign now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-will-form-own-party-may-tie-up-with-bjp-101633113577650.html
02-10-2021||India||Can’t force anybody for DNA test, impinges on right to privacy: Supreme Court||No one can be forced by courts to undergo a DNA test, the Supreme Court said on Friday, noting that it not only impinges on an individual’s privacy but can also lead to major societal repercussions for the person.The order came on a petition filed by a man who was directed by the Punjab & Haryana high court to undergo a DNA test to prove his claim for a share in the property of his biological parents.His claim was disputed by the couple’s three daughters, who denied that the man was their brother, and said that he was not the son of their parents. The women first demanded a DNA test of the man in a court in Kalka, and moved the high court after the trial judge declined to grant their request.When a DNA test was allowed by the high court in March 2019, the petitioner Ashok Kumar approached the top court.While deciding the appeal, a bench of justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy said, “In circumstances where other evidence is available to prove or dispute the relationship, the court should ordinarily refrain from ordering blood tests. This is because such tests impinge upon the right of privacy of an individual and could also have major societal repercussions.”Setting aside the HC order, it added, “When the plaintiff is unwilling to subject himself to the DNA test, forcing him to undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty and his right to privacy. Seen from this perspective, the impugned judgment merits interference and is set aside.”In its order, the Punjab & Haryana high court held in 2019 that a DNA test is a “double-edged sword”, and since Kumar was so sure about his parentage, there was no reason for him to shy away or shirk from taking it.Kumar, however, refused to undergo the test, and said he was willing to defend his suit on documentary evidence.“The DNA test is directed in civil cases only in exceptional circumstances as a matter of last resort. Its evidentiary value is considered along with the entire circumstances of the case. A person can choose not to undergo the DNA test. In such cases, the courts can draw an adverse inference against the party for refusing the test. But by this judgment, the court has examined the DNA test in the light of right to privacy. It will now be difficult for courts below to insist upon DNA test,” Supreme Court advocate Anirudh Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-force-anybody-for-dna-test-impinges-on-right-to-privacy-supreme-court-101633113457024.html

The team left for the summit from Mumbai on September 3. On Friday morning, 10 of them had left to scale the peak from camp-3. However, after reaching a height of 6,700 metres, they were caught in an avalanche following which six members went missing,” Col Bisht said.“Five of 10 naval personnel from the expedition team were rescued. The rescue team reached Joshimath, which is about 33 kms away from Mount Trishul. In view of bad weather, we have not been able to leave for the peak as of now,” he added. According to a Navy official, the remaining 15 remaining members of the expedition are also involved in the search and rescue operation.Meanwhile, another rescue team, comprising personnel of the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), left for the spot to trace the missing personnel.“Search and rescue operations for five members of the Indian Navy mountaineering expedition to Mt Trishul, caught in an avalanche near summit camp, are being progressed by the ground rescue team and helicopters from Army, Air Force & State Disaster Response Force (SDRF),” the Navy said in a statement.Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral R Hari Kumar had flagged off the expedition from INS Trishul on September 3. The event is part of the ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’ celebrations to commemorate 50 years of victory in the 1971 war with Pakistan. The theme of the expedition is “Trishul Yudhpoat Se Trishul Parvat Tak” (from Trishul warship to Trishul mountain).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-navy-personnel-go-missing-after-avalanche-hits-trishul-expedition-101633113222194.html
02-10-2021||India||Have reservations at how police officers are behaving in country, says CJI Ramana||New Delhi: Flagging alleged nexus between politicians and the bureaucrats especially police officers, the Supreme Court Friday said it was once considering setting up of standing committees headed by Chief Justices of high courts to examine complaints of atrocities committed particularly by the police officers.“I have a lot of reservations at the way as to how bureaucracy particularly, how the police officers are behaving in this country,” observed Chief Justice N V Ramana. “I was at one time thinking of creating standing committees to examine atrocities and complaints against bureaucrats particularly police officers headed by the Chief Justices of the High Courts. Now, I want to reserve that, I do not want to do it now,” the CJI said. The CJI made the observations while heading a bench that was hearing three separate pleas of senior IPS officer Gurjinder Pal Singh, suspended Director of Chhattisgarh Police Academy of Chhattisgarh, against three FIRs lodged against him by the state government for offences of sedition, corruption, and extortion respectively.The bench, which reserved the orders, indicated the outcome and said that it would grant protection to the suspended officer from any coercive action in two cases lodged for the offence of sedition and extortion respectively and requested the Chhattisgarh High Court to decide his pleas expeditiously within eight weeks.In the third case lodged under the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly amassing disproportionate assets, the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, said that the police officer would be at liberty to avail appropriate legal remedy as he had only sought its transfer to the CBI and the stay of the ongoing probe being conducted by the state police. At the outset, senior advocate F S Nariman, appearing for Singh in the sedition case, said that vexatious allegations have been made against the police officer for refusing to conspire to frame former Chief Minister and BJP leader in the state.Another senior advocate Vikas Singh, who also represented the police officer in corruption and the extortion case, said after being granted protection by the apex court, the state government on September 12 invoked a non-bailable provision in the third FIR for the offence of extortion for an alleged incident that had taken place in 2016. Singh said that the police officer has been a decorated one who is required to be protected and the government cannot be allowed to hound him.Senior Mukul Rohatgi and lawyer Sumeer Sodhi appeared for the state government and urged the bench that the police officer does not deserve any kind of protection because of the allegations and materials collected by the police during the probe.Rohatgi referred to the recovery of objectionable torn hand-written materials near the residence of the police officer and said that they indicated that he was actively involved in the seditious activity and wanted to overthrow the state government. Earlier also the bench had raised the issue of nexus between politicians in power and the police officers and had asked as to why the courts should protect such officers in criminal cases after the regime change.The counsel for the officer had said that honest and upright officials, having outstanding service records, needed to be protected against whom as many as three FIRs have been lodged by the government.The latest FIR was lodged on July 28 for offences of extortion, criminal intimidation under the IPC on the complaint of one Kamal Kumar Sen concerning an alleged incident of 2016.Gurjinder Pal Singh, the 1994-batch IPS officer who had served as the IG of Raipur, Durg, and Bilaspur during the earlier BJP rule, has been facing the probe in as many as three criminal cases.The top court, on August 26 this year, had granted Singh the protection from two criminal cases of sedition and amassing of disproportionate assets.Singh was initially booked in the disproportionate assets case following raids at his premises by the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and Economic Offences Wing (EOW).Another case of sedition was invoked against him later on the grounds of his alleged involvement in promoting enmity and hatching a conspiracy against the government.According to the police, the documents recovered during the ACB/EOW raids revealed that Singh was allegedly involved in promoting enmity and hatching a conspiracy against the established government and public representatives and was booked under sedition charges.Singh was booked under IPC sections 124-A (sedition) and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) of the IPC at Raipur’s City Kotwali Police Station.He has sought the case be handed over to the CBI or other independent agencies to ensure a fair probe.The director of the state police academy was suspended on July 5 after the ACB/EOW, on June 29, registered an FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act in connection with the disproportionate assets he had allegedly amassed. The ACB/EOW, which carried a three-day search at around 15 locations linked to Singh from July 1 to 3, claimed to have discovered movable and immovable assets worth around ₹10 crore.During the raid at the official residence of Singh, torn pieces of paper were also found from the backyard of the house and when the pieces were rearranged, serious and sensitive contents were found to be written and typed on it, the FIR said.

02-10-2021||India||Supreme Court notice to govt on Aadhaar for Covid-19 vaccination||The Supreme Court on Friday sought a response from the central government on public interest litigation (PIL), which claimed that the Aadhaar card was being mandatorily insisted upon for administering vaccination against Covid-19.A bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by Pune-based lawyer Sidharthshankar Sharma, claiming that apart from seven identity documents mentioned in the CoWIN portal, Aadhaar was still being insisted upon.Initially, the bench was not inclined to entertain the petition as it was under the impression that other photo identity documents such as PAN card, drivers’ licence, Voter I-card or passport could be valid documents to register for Covid-19 vaccination.However, advocate Mayank Kshirsagar, appearing for the petitioner, told the court: “There are seven documents listed on CoWIN app for registration. But when you go to the vaccination centre, they insist on Aadhaar without which they do not allow vaccination. All policies are there on paper, but people are facing problems.”Hearing the arguments, the bench issued notice to the Union government and the Unique Identification Authority of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-aadhaar-requirement-for-covid-19-vaccination-101633112977197.html
02-10-2021||India||Cop injured in attack on Rajiv Gandhi gets blood-stained cap back on last day of work||On Thursday, Prateep Philip retired as Director General of Police (Training) wearing a blood-stained cap and the same name badge he was wearing 30 years ago when, as an Assistant Superintendent of Police, he was on duty at the Sriperumbudur election meeting where a suicide bomber killed former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Two days before his retirement, a Chennai court allowed him to retrieve the cap and badge, submitted as material evidence in the case. “It was a defining and refining moment for me,” says Philip, who was only a few feet ahead of Gandhi when a woman suicide bomber detonated a powerful bomb. Philip, who still carries around 100 small pieces of shrapnel in his body, wanted to sign off wearing the cap and badge, both so-called material objects in legal terms. An additional sessions court judge, T Chandrasekaran ordered on September 28 that Philip could take interim custody of his cap and badge. Both are to be returned to the court in a month.Understanding Philip’s sentimental attachment to his cap and badge, a team of lawyers led by Sanjay Pinto told the court: “This is his last professional wish.” “He almost died in the blast. He was in the line of duty. I said (in the court) that the cap and the badge symbolise blood, sweat and tears.”Philip was 30 years old when as ASP of Kancheepuram district he was part of the police detail for Gandhi who arrived in Sriperumbudur for an election rally to campaign for Congress candidate Maragatham Chandrasekar. Philip says on May 19, two days before the incident, the organisers led by Chandrasekar changed the venue from secure school ground to an open temple ground. Philip went to see her and objected to the change, citing security concerns, but the organisers were adamant.Philip had just returned from a two-day break to see his newborn daughter in Kochi (she was born on May 11). His superior and the then SP Mohammed Iqbal asked him if a horoscope had been drawn up for her (a common practice in many parts of the country). “Someone had told the SP that May 21st was not a good day for the VIP according to his horoscope,” recalled Philip referring to the former Prime Minister only as the VIP. “As a man of faith, I said a prayer for our protection.” He remembers Gandhi stepping out of a bullet-proof car wearing a white kurta. “He looked very charismatic. He went towards the people and began shaking hands.”Philip controlled the crowd using a cane. He also put two women police officers in the women’s section. “It was a kind of a premonition because usually, we don’t bring in women for security because we don’t expect trouble from the women,” Iqbal told Philip to move ahead. They were next to the women’s section and when Philip looked back, a crowd of women surrounded Gandhi. “From the photos we can tell that’s how the assassin got close.”A suicide bomber, Dhanu akaThenmozhi Rajarathinam, belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) triggered an explosive-laden belt she was wearing as she bent down to touch Gandhi’s feet. Sixteen people, including Gandhi and Dhanu, were killed in the blast and around 45 including Philip and Iqbal were critically injured. The LTTE had orchestrated the assassination to avenge Gandhi’s decision to send the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka.“I was thrown up in the air,” said Philip. “Initially I was unconscious but because I was young, I gained consciousness in a few minutes and I found there was fire and smoke everywhere. There was blood all over my face. I was beginning to realise there was a blast.”A young inspector rushed to Philip. “I asked him how the VIP was”. Chacko responded to him in Malayalam “VIP poyi” meaning the PM was dead. Philip lost a lot of blood; he had 20% burns, from his face all the way to his ankles; and he had multiple fractures.Philip was in the hospital for 28-days. His SP Iqbal died due to internal bleeding. Now that he has retired, Philip said he plans on writing a book-- a survivor’s tale from the assassination that shook the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-cop-prateep-philip-injured-in-attack-on-rajiv-gandhi-gets-blood-stained-cap-back-on-last-day-of-work-101633112801330.html
02-10-2021||India||Mukul Sangma to meet loyalists amid reports of moving to TMC||Speculation over former chief minister of Meghalaya and Congress leader, Mukul Sangma, joining the Trinamool Congress gained momentum on Friday, with Sangma saying that he “will meet first”, but “nothing concrete” has yet been decided.“Who told you this?... Why do you people speculate so much when there’s nothing concrete yet? I said we will meet first, so there’s nothing else I can tell you now,” he said over the phone.A Congress MLA close to Sangma, however, confirmed that he would meet his loyalists late on Friday to chalk out a future strategy.Another Congress leader said that the former CM has visited Delhi twice in September, but failed to meet the party high command. “Can you imagine, he (Mukul) went twice to Delhi but met only junior party functionaries the first time and the second even after he had sought an appointment with Madam (Sonia Gandhi) in advance, she did not see him...,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-buzz-over-his-joining-tmc-meghalaya-former-cm-mukul-sangma-says-don-t-speculate-101633112739778.html

But it is very unfortunate that amid the ongoing situation in the Punjab unit, he is forwarding the theory of his humiliation by the party leadership. He was not humiliated at all... It seems he is under some pressure and doing that on someone’s provocation,” Rawat said at a press conference in Dehradun.The comments came a day after Singh said he was going to quit the Congress over the humiliation meted out to him by the party. He also met Union home minister Amit Shah and national security adviser Ajit Doval in Delhi, but insisted that the meetings weren’t political.Singh quit as CM last week after months of tussle between him and rival Navjot Singh Sidhu for control of the party. Sidhu on Tuesday quit as state unit chief, plunging the party into further turmoil, but meetings with new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday appeared to have resolved the deadlock.Hours after Rawat’s press conference, Singh hit back.He said that three weeks before stepping down as CM, he had offered his resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi but she asked him to continue. The “humiliating manner” in which he was pushed into resigning was a matter of public record, he added.“The world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet Rawat is making claims to the contrary,” he said. “If this was not humiliation then what was it?” he asked.Rawat urged Singh to not support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said: “His recent meetings with Shah and other BJP leaders are putting a question mark on his whole life’s political capital and secular credentials which have been the core of his politics all these years. He should not help anti-Punjab BJP both directly or indirectly as they are trying to make him their mask in Punjab which is against his stature,” said Rawat.Rejecting the charge, Singh said even his worst critics could not doubt his integrity in this regard. “But I am no longer surprised that a senior and seasoned Congress leader like Rawat is questioning my secular credentials. It is quite evident that I am no longer trusted and respected in the party that I have served loyally all these years.”Rawat said the Congress had always given Singh respect. “Thrice he has been the state president of Congress and twice he has been made the CM for a tenure of about nine and a half years. In comparison to that, the other senior leaders in the state didn’t get that much,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-never-humiliated-former-punjab-cm-says-harish-rawat-amarinder-singh-calls-it-blatant-lie-101633111477088.html

All these MLAs are said to be close to Baghel. “There is no political motive behind my Delhi visit today ... It is purely personal visit as I have some personal work,” MLA Shishu Pal Sori told reporters at Raipur airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-11-chhattisgarh-congress-legislators-camping-in-delhi-6-more-reach-capital-101633109377136.html
02-10-2021||India||Australian govt gives nod to Covishield for international travellers||Australia on Friday declared Covishield, the Indian variant of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot, as a “recognised vaccine” for international travellers as part of measures aimed at safely reopening the country from November.The Australian side, however, indicated that Indian students will have to wait some more time before being granted permission to return. Australia’s visiting trade and tourism minister Dan Tehan said foreign students will be able to start “returning towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year”, ahead of the start of the first semester in February-March 2022.The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia listed Covishield and China’s Coronavac (Sinovac) as “recognised vaccines” after an initial assessment of data on protection offered by the two jabs.Covishield, made by the Serum Institute of India, and Coronavac “should be considered as ‘recognised vaccines’ for the purpose of determining incoming international travellers as being appropriately vaccinated”, said a statement issued jointly by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and several ministers.The statement outlined the next steps to be taken by Australia to lift a ban on international flights and to make changes at the international border. “Our government is setting out the framework for how international travel will look in coming months,” it said.India has been pressing the Australian side to open up travel for Indian nationals, especially students wishing to join courses at universities and educational institutions. India is the second largest source of foreign students in Australia, behind China. During 2019-20, Indian students contributed $6.6 billion to the Australian economy.Tehan told reporters in New Delhi: “We are on track to see [the] reopening [of Australia] occur in November. This is so important in a number of areas...it means the pathway for Indian students to return to Australia is there again.” “We are warmly looking forward to welcoming the Indian students.”Australia’s recognition of Covishield also creates a pathway for Indian businesspeople to return, Tehan said. In response to a question on Australia possibly recognising India’s Covaxin shot, Tehan said this could be considered once the vaccine is approved by the WHO.The Australian government plans to move forward on foreign travel only after 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated. More than 78% of Australians have received the first dose and double dose rates are at 55%, with some areas on track to reach 70% over the next week.In the initial stages, Australia will allow travel to reunite Australian families. It will also work towards allowing in tourists.The statement further said the declaration of Covishield as a “recognised vaccine” for international travellers did not mean it had been approved for use for vaccination in Australia. “The recognition of these two additional vaccines is a major milestone towards more Australians vaccinated overseas getting home sooner,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-approves-covishield-for-international-travellers-indian-students-will-have-to-wait-to-return-101633078176289.html
02-10-2021||India||‘Congress a better platform... in tune with idea of India’: Jignesh Mevani||An independent legislator from Gujarat and a Dalit leader, Jignesh Mevani, is expected to join the Congress soon. Mevani spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about why it is the right platform for him even as the party has faced a series of defections. Edited excerpts:What is it about the Congress that has drawn you when many have left the party?Whatever we’ve witnessed, as a nation, as a society, in the last 6-7 years, is nothing but the destruction of democracy. [There has been an] attack on our social fabric, our idea of India, and the Indian Constitution. The way RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) have been operating, there is every chance that they will amend the Constitution and keep destroying our democratic institutions. In this situation, I feel that my duty is to do everything that I can do to protect the Constitution and our idea of India. For that, I need a platform. What better platform, than a platform with the legacy of the Indian freedom movement, which is in tune with our idea of India, and which celebrates the Constitution. I believe that Rahul Gandhi is a man who never compromises with the RSS and BJP, and therefore I’m joining Indian National Congress.But isn’t what Kapil Sibal and other Congress leaders have been saying bothering you?Internal contradictions will be there in all the political parties. My duty as a beginner is to bring more people on board rather than being concerned about the ones who are leaving. Kanhaiya Kumar (who joined the party recently) and I will be reaching out to thousands and thousands of young people in every state. And I’m really optimistic and hopeful that seeing Hardik (Patel), Kanhaiya, and me, many people will join. People who left the party haven’t been able to create an impact, but our joining has tremendously excited people.Gujarat has seen much political activity of late. The BJP’s assessment is that by changing the entire cabinet, they are getting rid of anti-incumbency. What is your assessment?Their move of changing their entire cabinet, in a way, is an admission on their part that there is tremendous anti-incumbency. This anti-incumbency has two dimensions: anti-incumbency of the last 27 years, and anti-incumbency generated out of the monumental mismanagement of the Covid crisis. So, there is a great chance for the Opposition, there is a great chance for Congress. Last time we lost by 10-12 seats, this won’t be the case this time. I’m really optimistic and I’m greatly hopeful.In the 2017 polls, Congress performed the best it has in Gujarat in years. Don’t you think that the momentum that the opposition and the Congress built then has gone?I must admit that there have been ups and downs. But, as the elections come close, there will have momentum in our favour... and Hardik and I have planned to do something big on the issue of unemployment. We will be reaching out to the masses and things will change very soon.If GST was the big issue in 2017, unemployment will be the issue in 2022?Yes.The next big election is in Uttar Pradesh. Do you think the Dalit leadership base is consolidated in Uttar Pradesh or fragmented?Fragmented, and it is fragmented not just in UP Uttar Pradesh but everywhere. But my primary focus will be more on Gujarat. I will be going to various parts of the country only after 2022. Definitely, 2024 (national polls) is a gigantic task before all of us, but I’ll be focusing more on Gujrat. As far as the case of Uttar Pradesh is concerned, I don’t see any role for me initially, but in the coming days and years, I will go there definitely.How does BJP still retain the Dalit vote?As far as Gujarat is concerned, they haven’t been able to gain much out of Dalit votes. But in Uttar Pradesh, they could manage, and the Dalit Bahujan movement has also come down weakened and let us not forget that BJP is operating as a corporate party. They have enormous money. So, paid media, social media, buying people in Rajya Sabha elections... It has purely become a game of money in which BJP is able to do better than all the political parties. The movement, however, cannot get away with this argument, we also need to rethink our strategies, about what we have been doing. And we will try to work on that and how to bring Dalits back to our fold.Would you say that your attempt is going to be to renew the KHAM (Kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi and Muslim) alliance that Congress had in Gujarat?We will be talking about inflation, unemployment, public health, education, and the fruits of the Gujarat Model that have not reached most people. I want to talk about the revival of the small and medium scale industries, how the entrepreneurs can be supported and promoted. I want to talk about providing resources to Dalits and tribals, how those who have suffered due to GST and notebandi (demonetisation). I want to talk about prosperity for all. So, culturally progressive, socially just, and economically prosperous Gujarat is my vision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-is-in-tune-with-idea-of-india-celebrates-constitution-mevani-101633071820275.html
