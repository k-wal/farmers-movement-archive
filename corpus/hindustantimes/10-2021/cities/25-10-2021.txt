25-10-2021||Delhi||Enforce norms to avoid crowding in markets: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday said that it expects the authorities to enforce their guidelines and standard operating procedures to avoid overcrowding in the marketplaces in wake of the festive season.A bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, while hearing a plea it initiated on the overcrowding and flouting of Covid-19 norms in marketplaces, said that it does not want to see penalties being collected from people for violating Covid-19 norms. Instead, it wants the authorities to manage the crowd properly.“We expect from the respondents (Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police) that these guidelines, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Covid-appropriate behaviour, and controlling of the crowd at market places are executed by them scrupulously in this festive season.”“All the steps mentioned by the authorities in their respective status reports must be taken and a further status report must be filed by them before the next date of hearing on November 30,” the court said, adding that strict compliance is required.The bench also noted that in the status reports filed with the court, the authorities mentioned the steps taken by them on Covid-appropriate behaviour and how to control the crowd at marketplaces as well as how to engage volunteers for implementation of guidelines and sanitisation of public utilities.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel said that they issued appropriate guidelines timely and also shut down markets where protocols were not being followed properly. To this, the court said the authorities should ensure that these guidelines are strictly complied with.The Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, also said that they filed a status report on the directions to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.The high court, in June, had initiated proceedings on its own after taking note of certain photographs sent to one of its judges on WhatsApp by an AIIMS doctor showing scant regard for Covid-19 protocols by street vendors in markets.The court had observed that such breaches would only hasten the third wave of the pandemic, “which cannot be permitted at all”, adding that if this behaviour of flouting Covid-19 norms continues, “we will be in great trouble”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/enforce-norms-to-avoid-crowding-in-markets-delhi-hc-101635186552407.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||No space to walk in Connaught Place, agencies show London dreams: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday observed that the authorities intend to make the national capital akin to London even though there is no space for people to walk in Connaught Place due to street vendors and hawkers.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while hearing a bunch of pleas challenging the Street Vendors Act, 2014 said that it would look into the matter and hear arguments before passing an order.The Act says that the Town Vending Committee shall conduct a survey of all existing street vendors within its jurisdiction and a subsequent survey shall be carried out, at least once in every five years.“We talk about making it (Delhi) London, but how will we do that? You can’t even walk in Connaught Place as there are vendors occupying the space; it has become a business…”“We will look into the challenge to the Street Vendors Act, 2014. We are willing to take the bull by the horns. If we find the Act to be alright, we will give a go-ahead; if we find shortcomings, we will give suggestions. We are not against street-hawking,” the bench said.Expressing its displeasure on the encroachment by vendors in the Nehru Place market, the court said that the area has become like a slum.“In Nehru Place, people can’t even walk as street vendors have made it their permanent place of business. We had to take suo motu cognizance of an incident of fire at Nehru Place.Condition of Nehru place market is like a slum. The need is to decide the number of vendors permissible in a particular area...” the court said.It, however, added that street vendors belong to the lower strata of the society and the court is in no way against the vendors. It said that there should be a balance among the rights of hawkers, those who rent shops, and people who shop at markets.“We all have grown up buying from street hawkers….We still go to kirana (grocery) shops, street food vendors for our day-to-day needs. We don’t go to malls for that. Nobody is against street hawkers…We just want the city to not be unreasonably crowded due to them,” the court observed.Senior advocate Collin Gonsalves, for the impleaders, said that even though the Street Vendors Act, 2014 is a good legislation, it is not being implemented rightly. He contended that the vendors are not issued Identity cards. He also said that a survey of the street vendors to be conducted under the Act of 2014 has not been done and the regulations of the Town Vending Committee are not properly followed. Meanwhile, the bench also sought the response of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) on a plea by the National Hawkers’ Federation. The hawkers’ body sought that they be heard when the court considers a plea by New Delhi Traders’ Association (NDTA) seeking the removal of vendors in the Connaught Place area.On October 11, the court had directed the removal of the vendors without license and asked to put display boards in different parts of CP and Connaught circus.The court said that the municipal body is doing “mere paper exercise” as the situation on ground is not changing and hawkers keep squatting illegally. The court said that the authorities are not actively pursuing the matter and not monitoring the movement of the unauthorized vendors. The plea by the hawkers said that NDTA has given misleading information to the court which is affecting their rights.The court fixed four days for hearing the matter: October 30, November 18, November 23 and December 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-space-to-walk-in-connaught-place-agencies-show-london-dreams-delhi-hc-101635186550863.html

Some of the pedestrians had a narrow escape as they jumped out of the way of the rashly driven car. Scores of people then chased and stopped the car, overpowered its driver, damaged his vehicle and handed him and his fellow occupant over to the police.The errant car driver was identified as Pratik Tiwari, a resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi. His friend was with him in the car when the accident took place, police said. They were going towards an eatery to have dinner when their WagonR car hit a Santro that was coming out of the hospital gate, police said, quoting the two suspects. Some locals raised slogans in the neighbourhood soon after Tiwari was caught, but senior police officers clarified that there was no communal angle to the incident.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said around midnight, the police received information regarding an accident and a crowd near Gate Number-1 of Jama Masjid. The police found a grey WagonR there, in a damaged condition.

25-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai high-rise fire: Sprinklers’ location was changed, suspect officials, developer||The Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB), which is investigating the level-4 fire at the 60-storeyed Avighna Park, on Monday said that certain illegal alterations – including changing the location of water sprinklers for firefighting – have likely been made on the 19th-floor apartment, which might have helped the blaze spread further to the other floors. Hemant Parab, MFB’s chief fire officer, said, “We are still investigating, but it looks like several illegal alterations were made inside the flat, including changing the location of the sprinklers. We will have to verify with the actual plan [of the building] and also question the flat owner. The process is on, but primarily, some illegal alterations have been noticed.”The developer of the high-rise also alleged on Monday that the location of the sprinklers inside the 19th-floor flat, where the fire broke out, was changed and the water supply was shut.Nishant Agarwal, managing director, Avighna Group, in a statement issued on Monday, said, “All equipment and pumps were fully functional and were the key factor in bringing the fire under control at the earliest.However, there seems to be non-compliance and violations by the flat owner in executing internal work. Our facility team has received many emails from the owner of the flat, asking us to approve various changes, which we have not permitted. The flat owner had specifically asked us [for] approval to relocate the sprinklers. This being a gross violation, we have not permitted the same. However, during site review on Sunday, 24 October 2021, prima facie, it appears to us that the flat owner has gone ahead and done these changes regardless (sic).”Agarwal added, “It is evident that the location of the sprinklers has been changed. It seems that he has used a third-party contractor to do this work without our knowledge. In order to carry out this work, he seems to have shut the water supply to the sprinklers on his own, and [that] could possibly be the reason why the automatic response sprinklers did not activate when the fire broke out, as claimed by the owner. In the instant case, it seems that the flat owner has violated and ignored the guidelines issued by us and has executed unauthorised changes within the flat premises (sic).”Rohit Rathod, the owner of the flat on the 19th floor, was not available for comment despite repeated attempts. The building is being managed by the developer currently, as the process of handing it over to the society has not been completed yet.Meanwhile, a meeting was held between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and MFB, wherein it was decided to take up regular inspection of high-rises to check fire compliance and come up with ways to ensure that more citizens become more fire-safety conscious.A 30-year-old security guard had lost his life after the fire broke out at the Currey Road high-rise on October 22, while dozens of residents were rescued safely from the building.MFB had said that the primary cause behind the incident is a short circuit, owing to which the furniture on the 19th floor of the B-wing had caught fire. However, the exact cause will be known after a thorough investigation, said MFB officials.BMC and MFB had allowed all the residents, except those on the 19th floor, to move back to their flats. The power supply to both the wings of the building was also restored on Saturday.MFB to get 24 fire bikesFor quick response and easy access in congested areas, MFB is set to get fire bikes for firefighting. In a first, BMC will procure 24 fire bikes that will be inducted in MFB’s fleet. A proposal of ₹3.15 crore, which includes procurement, assembling, maintenance and operation of fire bikes for five years will be tabled in standing committee for approval on Wednesday. The fire bikes will cost ₹2.76 crore. MFB will spend ₹28.32 lakh on services for five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-high-rise-fire-sprinklers-location-was-changed-suspect-officials-developer-101635185709987.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Gopal Rai announces anti-cracker campaign from October 27 in Delhi||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday announced the launch of an anti-firecracker campaign, ‘Patake Nahi, Diye Jalao’, from October 27, and said teams have been formed to ensure on-ground implementation of the cracker ban in each of the 15 police districts in the Capital.The minister said citizens can also report the illegal sale of firecrackers or bursting of firecrackers in any part of Delhi by calling 112. “If someone does not comply with the cracker ban, then the police and SDMs (sub-divisional magistrates) will act as per the IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) and section 5/9B of the Explosives Act against them. Those selling, hoarding or bursting firecrackers can all be penalized under these sections and acts,” said Rai, adding that the offences entail a jail term up to three years.The minister said in addition to the 15 central teams consisting five to seven members each, a dedicated team of two people will be present at each of the 157 police stations across Delhi to identify and deal with the sale or bursting of firecrackers.“The campaign has two parts -- one, preventing people from bursting crackers and two, for the police and SDMs to collaborate with RWAs to encourage people to celebrate Diwali by lighting diyas instead,” said Rai.He said that SDMs have been asked to conduct awareness meetings on October 28 and 29 with RWAs, market organisations and NGOs over the impact of firecrackers on health and air pollution.Asking for diyas to be associated with Diwali instead of firecrackers, Rai said brands publishing advertisements around the festival should avoid the usage of firecrackers in their visuals this time around.“The Delhi government appeals to all the people of Delhi. Please celebrate Diwali using diyas and not crackers. Diwali is celebrated by lighting diyas and crackers only contribute to pollution. Stubble burning incidents go on a steep rise around Diwali. When their pollution mixes with the pollution of firecrackers, it can prove fatal for our senior citizens and children. No matter how much the officers enforce the norms, we cannot win this battle unless and until everyone contributes towards this fight,” said Rai.Earlier during the day, the environment minister joined the Delhi government’s ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign at the Barakhamba road crossing, asking people to switch off vehicles at red lights to help reduce air pollution in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gopal-rai-announces-anti-cracker-campaign-from-october-27-in-delhi-101635185708835.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi BJP leader Manoj Tiwari to hold special vaccination drive for Chhath Puja||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Manoj Tiwari on Monday announced a special vaccination drive for people who will perform Chhath Puja next month. Meanwhile, the BJP, which governs all the three municipal corporations, has also asked its councillors to start cleaning the ghats and make necessary arrangements at places where the puja is usually organised.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will take a call on Chhath Puja celebrations in the Capital on October 27.Tiwari said, “The Chhath Puja special vaccination drive will be inaugurated by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday at Burari. To begin with, 10,000 people will be vaccinated. We want people to celebrate the festival after taking all the necessary precautions against Covid-19.” A private organisation has been roped in for the vaccination drive, Tiwari said.Tiwari, who is the BJP’s Purvanchal face in the Capital, has been advocating for Chhath Puja in the city ever since DDMA banned public celebrations of the puja while allowing Dussehra, Ramlila and Durga Puja celebrations in the Capital.Earlier this month, Tiwari met with puja committees and held rath yatra in areas with a large presence of the Purvanchali community to galvanise support.“Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal supported the ban initially. Following protests by the BJP and the people, the CM wrote a letter (to Delhi lieutenant governor requesting the celebrations be allowed) to take credit. But we don’t want to politicise the festival,” said Tiwari, who is the former chief of the Delhi BJP.With municipal elections in the Capital scheduled next year, all political parties are trying to woo the Purvanchali community, which constitutes 30-35% of voters in Delhi, according to government data. While there are several communities in the city, the Purvanchali community has emerged as a dominant force in electoral politics. While the community was dominant in just a few pockets in west Delhi in the early 1990s, today it plays a decisive role in 25-30 assembly seats, including Kirari, Burari, Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Sangam Vihar, Nangloi Jat, Badli, and in parliamentary constituencies such as West Delhi, East Delhi, North East Delhi, North West Delhi, and South Delhi, according to several political analysts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-leader-manoj-tiwari-to-hold-special-vaccination-drive-for-chhath-puja-101635185589372.html

25-10-2021||Mumbai||BJP demands CBI probe into Sail’s allegations; ruling parties bat for SIT||A day after a key witness in the cruise drug bust case, Prabhakar Sail, levelled allegations against NCB sleuths, ruling parties have demanded for a high-level inquiry, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked for a CBI inquiry into the claims, saying the ruling parties were behind the retraction of the witness. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday lauded the “bravery” of Sail and demanded security as he is a key witness in the case. The Sena leader also demanded a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) on the recent developments, stating it was a conspiracy to defame Maharashtra by BJP and central agencies “under the garb of nationalism”. Sail, on Sunday alleged that he was made to sign on blank papers as panch (witness) on the night the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official conducted a raid at the International Cruise Terminal, Green Gate,on October 2 and arrested Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and fashion designer Munmun Dhamecha. Sail, 40, claimed that he used to work as a bodyguard of KP Gosavi, one of the nine witnesses in the case. “He is a key witness in this case and the home department must provide him security. I have spoken to home minister Dilip Walse-Patil. The witness has brought to light this conspiracy by one political party with the help of a few officials to defame Maharashtra. Prabhakar Sail has done a great service to the country and the state. Therefore, the state must provide him security and I am confident it will be provided.” In the backdrop of the developments and demand of the probe by the Maharashtra police, Walse Patil held a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Walse Patil said that Sail has been given police protection after his request. “I will speak to Malik about his allegations after he is back in Mumbai. I am not aware about the allegations. There is no formal complaint lodged by Sail to begin any investigation into it,” he said. According to officials from the home department, Walse Patil discussed the new turn in the cruise drug-bust case with the CM. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and water resource minister Jayant Patil said that appropriate steps will be taken (by state government)in this entire episode. “The revelations related to the Sameer Wankhede’s certificates, allegations levelled against him by Prabhakar Sail are very serious. Nawab Malik has produced all the required documents to corroborate the claims. It appears that Wankhede used his (forged) birth certificate to get the benefits of backward class quota in service. I think after the use of CBI, enforcement directorate, Income Tax failed to destabilise the government, they are using UCB to defame Mumbai, Maharashtra and the film industry here. There will appropriate steps taken in this,” he said. Referring to a video, Sanjay Raut said that the entire case is also about money laundering. “Sam D’Souza is the biggest money-laundering player of Mumbai and the country. He launders money for political leaders, IAS-IPS officers. It’s a big game which has just started. The facts which came to light are shocking. Under the pretext of nationalism, some people are extorting money, lodging fake cases,” Raut said. The Sena chief spokesperson added that the “thread” of case will go “right up to Delhi”. “The things that have come to light are startling and it is now seen what under the garb of nationalism by political parties, administration and central agencies. I think there should be a SIT probe on this matter,” he said. Reacting to the letter by NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede to “ensure that no precipitate legal action is carried out” against him by “unknown persons” with “ulterior motives” to frame him, Raut said, “If he’s not done anything then he need not worry.” BJP has hit back raising questions over the intention of the leaders from the ruling parties and has demanded a CBI probe in the entire episode of Sail’s retraction from his earlier stand. BJP has hit back at the ruling parties questioning as to who is behind the rebuttal of witness Prabhakar Sail. “It needs to come to the light that who is behind Sail’s statement and in which hotel the statement of Sail recorded? Shielding the drug mafia is the real intention behind it? Is Sail being threatened to become part of the extortion ring of ruling party? The entire episode needs to be investigated by CBI to check all these links. His mobile locations and call records need to be check to find out who were in the contact of the witness for last 22 days. We firmly believe that the truth will prevail,” said BJP leader Ram Kadam. BJP leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya said that the NCB and its officer Wankhede are being targeted to divert the attention from the corruption cases against state government ministers. “There are 23 cases of corruption worth Rs25,000 crore by the ministers and leaders from the ruling parties in the state. By propping up things related to Aryan Khan, the ruling parties are trying to divert the attention of the people from corruption cases. The top leaders of the ruling parties have seen the action coming straight them in these cases and hence the non-issues are being blown up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-demands-cbi-probe-into-sail-s-allegations-ruling-parties-bat-for-sit-101635184990557.html

A few residents even had to return dejected, as there was no one to address their grievances. Among them was a 90- year- old blind woman whose son had disowned her and asked her to leave the house.The woman, who identified herself as Krishna Devi, is currently living at a shelter outside her house in Ayali village.She said that she had visited the DC office to seek redressal of her grievances but, no staff employee was available due to the strike, and she was asked to visit again next week.“It rained heavily on Saturday evening. It was difficult for us to spend the night in the shelter amid rain and dipping temperature,” said Surinder Kaur, her daughter, who had accompanied her to the DC office.While DC Varinder Kumar Sharma was unavailable for comments, Kewal Krishan Kalra, sarpanch of the village, said Krishna Devi’s son had abandoned her due to some property dispute.“Krishan Devi wants to keep her daughter Surinder in the house but, her son and other family members are against it.

25-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 889 new Covid-19 infections||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 889 Covid-19 cases, its lowest single-day caseload in 511 days (841 infections were reported on May 5). The test positivity rate in the state, too, has dropped significantly during this period to 1.05%, from 12.82% on May 5 last year. However, the caseload is also low because of the fewer tests in 24 hours owing to the weekend. Less number of people are tested on weekends, while the turnaround time of the test reports also widens, resulting in a relative rise in cases on Tuesday onwards. Only 84,460 tests were done in the past 24 hours. On May 5, 2020, 6,561 tests were done at a positivity rate of 12.82%. The state tally of Covid-19 reached 6,603,850 on Monday.Dr Rahul Pandit, intensive care specialist at Fortis Hospital and member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, attributed two reasons for the fall in numbers. “The number of cases is definitely decreasing. In addition, we always get less cases on Monday as fewer tests are conducted on Sundays. The factual indication is the numbers from Wednesday onwards,” said Dr Pandit.Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, attributed the decreasing numbers to vaccination. “The mass vaccinations taking place in Maharashtra have been effective in containing the virus. The vaccine has been able to blunt the effects of the virus significantly,” said Dr Mandot.Maharashtra on Monday recorded 12 deaths, bringing the toll to 140,028. Pune is leading with 19,576 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 16,220 and Thane with 11,419. Mumbai’s tally of new cases is 263, along with seven deaths, thus bringing its toll to 16,220.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 23,184. Pune tops with 6,923 patients, followed by Mumbai with 4,979 active patients and Thane with 3,431.Similar to state and Mumbai’s Covid-19 figures, the figures in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), too, has seen a marked decrease, according to the state government’s figures on Monday. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has recorded 23 cases on Monday, the lowest after April 13, 2020, when the city recorded 23 infections. This means the cases have stooped to a new 18-month-low. In August though, the daily cases had come down to 28 cases, but 23 is the lowest since the second wave. The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) and Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on the other hand saw zero cases on Monday, as per the state’s figures. However, as per Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli civic body figures, these cities recorded 39 and 29 infections respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-889-new-covid-19-infections-101635184810102.html

He even blamed the school authorities for committing fraud amounting to lakhs in connivance with senior education officials.He alleged that the education department had unlawfully released a grant of ₹24 lakh for the construction of the classrooms in the school, which is built on the land owned by GLADA.He further alleged that the school head, along with a senior teacher, to commit financial fraud, had decreased the size of the classrooms.Kang stated that while there should be at least four windows in a classroom as per the state guidelines, the authorities have constructed only two in each of them. He also said the authorities constructed fewer pillars and beams than the number set by the state.Darshan, in his complaint, stated that one JE Jagjit Singh visited the school to probe the matter but didn’t take any action against the school authorities.Taking note of the complaint, the complaint cell of director, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan Authority, Punjab, has sought a detailed report from Jaswinder Kaur, DEO, elementary.Kang criticised the move and stated, “The inquiry has been marked to the DEO, elementary. She was the first officer to be informed about the fraud, and she didn’t even take any action then. Senior officials are shielding the school authorities. It is useless to mark the inquiry to Kaur.”Aman Deep Singh, head, GPS, Sukhdev Nagar, stated that he is unaware of any such inquiry against the school. Jaswinder Kaur, DEO, elementary, claimed that she will conduct a transparent probe into the matter and take necessary action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-deo-to-conduct-probe-into-illegal-construction-at-school-101635184808727.html

Policemen are approaching villagers in trans-Yamuna area of Prayagraj, infamous for illegal hooch trade, and convincing them not to make and consume hooch as it would not only affect their health but also ruin their families. On the instructions of senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj, Sarvshrestha Tripathi, who has started the ‘Pahal’ initiative, cops under their jurisdictions have launched a drive under which licensed ‘bhang’ shops are being checked to stop the sale of marijuana and illegal liquor. In a recent campaign against hooch, a team of Ghoorpur police reached Beekar and Kanjasa village on the banks of river Yamuna. Villagers were at first scared of the police presence assuming it to be a raid for arresting bootleggers. However, they were surprised when policemen assembled them at an open space and listed the harmful effects of hooch consumption. The cops said, not only hooch affects their vital organs but also triggers family disputes which results in women reaching police stations to lodge complaints against their husbands. Moreover, the policemen also cautioned the villagers to stay away from locally manufactured hooch and addiction of liquor, marijuana, bhang etc. Besides, policemen have also launched a rigorous drive in the district against marijuana and other narcotics which are often sold at licensed ‘bhang’ shops illegally. Policemen under their jurisdictions are carrying out regular checking drives at ‘bhang’ shops and also keeping an eye near these shops as drug peddlers have often been found active around these places. The SSP said, “The continuous drive against hooch, marijuana and other addictions will definitely bring about a change. Regular checking drives are being carried out against their sale across the district, and action is being taken against those involved in it. Moreover, awareness drives are being conducted among villagers in rural areas, especially, in those villages which are infamous for hooch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-police-launch-awareness-drive-to-combat-drug-and-alcohol-menace-101635184688759.html
25-10-2021||Mumbai||Untraceable for 5 months, Maharashtra govt starts process of declaring Param Bir Singh an ‘absconder’||The Maharashtra home department on Monday initiated the process of declaring former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh as an “absconder.”In a communication to the Intelligence Bureau, the department said the IPS officer was untraceable. The state department has also sought legal opinion on the process of announcing Singh as an absconder.The development came a week after the state government informed the Bombay high court that it was unwilling to continue with its earlier statement of not taking any coercive action against Singh, including his arrest.Earlier this month, the home department officials told Hindustan Times the state government had begun the procedure for suspending Singh, but wanted to make the case “fool-proof by giving reasoning that stands the legal scrutiny”.Singh is wanted in an investigation into a money laundering case where he has levelled allegations against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and dismissed Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze. He is also wanted in the bomb scare case outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiren, following which he was removed from the top post in March.The last time Singh had responded to a summon was on April 7 before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to record his statement in both the cases. He had last attended office on May 4 and went on leave the next day citing medical reasons.Since then, Singh’s whereabouts have been unknown to the Maharashtra government, Mumbai Police and probe agencies.In July, a lookout notice was issued against him and investigating agencies have said that Singh fleeing India could be a reason behind his continued absence in the country. An official had earlier told news agency ANI that the former Mumbai Police chief either left India before the lookout notice was issued or by using a forged passport.Last week, a Maharashtra crime investigation department (CID) team visited many known addresses of Singh, including his family home in Chandigarh. Another Mumbai Police team visited the former cop’s private residence in Vile Parle. They have also reportedly sent several emails to Singh’s known accounts but those have not been responded to either.An IPS officer said on condition of anonymity that Singh’s last known location was Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-govt-starts-process-to-declare-ex-mumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-absconder-101635183668921.html

25-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad traders in fix over cracker licence delay||With less than 10 days left for Diwali, the traders dealing in green crackers in Ghaziabad are in a fix over the delay in getting licences for selling such firecrackers. The district administration officials said that they are waiting for directions from the Uttar Pradesh government. Members of the retail cracker association, Ghaziabad, said that the traders have made a huge investment in green crackers this year. “We are pursuing the district administration for issuance of trading licenses. But the officials have not replied to us so far. There are hardly 10 days left for Diwali, and if there is further delay, our business will suffer. This is because it takes another three-four days to get required no-objection certificates from different departments,” said Ashutosh Gupta, president of the association. The officials of the Ghaziabad administration said they are not accepting any application for now. “We are waiting for the directions of the state government and will act accordingly. For now, no licence is given for the sale of crackers,” said Vipin Kumar, additional district magistrate (city). Meanwhile, manufacturers from Farrukhnagar/Asalatpur near Loni said that most of them have suffered severe losses in the past two years. “Many traders and manufacturers had to shut shops due to ban on crackers by the Supreme Court in 2018. Despite facing odds, they are still waiting for trading licences this year. I had shut my manufacturing unit and opened up a shop in Delhi to earn livelihood. Since it is my family business, I am waiting if the district administration starts issuing licences for sale of green crackers,” said Asif Ali, a manufacturer from Farrukhnagar. In Noida, the administration officials said that any issuance of licence will be taken up by the police department after the commissionerate system was put in place. When asked, Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP, Noida, said, “There has been no discussion on the matter of issuance of licences to firecracker vendors as yet.” While taking note of high levels of air pollution, The Supreme Court, in 2018, had encouraged the community bursting of crackers within fixed timings on Diwali and festival days. It also held that only green crackers and improved crackers with reduced emissions will be allowed to be manufactured and sold. Recently, the sub-committee constituted by the Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR directed the agencies concerned to strictly enforce the orders of the Supreme Court regarding firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-traders-in-fix-over-cracker-licence-delay-101635183608775.html
25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers in Haryana hold protest over short supply of DAP fertiliser||A group of farmers owing allegiance to Bharatiya Kisan Union on Monday held a protest at Hansi near Hisar against alleged inadequate supply of di-ammonium phosphate fertiliser, as farmers were seen waiting in long queues in couple of Haryana districts to get the DAP. Farmers held a protest at Hansi, with one of the protesters sitting on an indefinite fast over alleged shortage of the DAP. "There is a shortage of DAP. If adequate supply is not ensured at the earliest, our protest will continue like this," a protesting farmer told reporters at Hansi. He said due to “shortage” of DAP fertiliser amid Rabi season, farmers have to wait for hours daily in front of offices of cooperative societies and outlets of private dealers to get the fertiliser. In Charkhi Dadri and Shahabad in Kurukshetra, long queues were witnessed on Monday as farmers waited for hours to purchase the fertiliser. There were reports that farmers also blocked a road on Mahendergarh-Rewari route for a brief period to protest inadequate availability of the fertiliser. Some farmers had allegedly forcibly taken away over 100 bags of DAP fertilisers lying outside a shop of a private dealer in Mahendergarh district's Ateli town a few days ago.Opposition parties have alleged that farmers are running from pillar to post as there is a shortage of DAP. In a couple of districts including Charkhi Dadri, the fertiliser was being distributed to farmers from police stations under strict watch of the cops. The state government has maintained that there is no shortage of the fertiliser. Last week, Haryana Agriculture Minister JP Dalal had claimed that there is no shortage of DAP fertiliser in the state and added that black marketeers are trying to project an artificial shortage. Earlier on Sunday, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a meeting to review the availability and demand of DAP. Khattar had said that although DAP fertilizer available in the market this year is 1,100 metric tons more in quantity than last year, yet in view of the demand of farmers, he spoke to Union Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya over phone on Sunday and urged the central minister for six additional (train) rakes of the fertilisers and the Centre has agreed to it, an official statement had said. Chief Minister Khattar had asserted that there will be no shortage of DAP fertilisers in the state. Directions had also been given by the chief minister to take strict action on the borders of the state to keep check on black marketing of DAP fertilisers from Haryana to other states, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-in-haryana-hold-protest-over-short-supply-of-dap-fertiliser-101635182936602.html
25-10-2021||Lucknow||Sensing defeat in Uttar Pradesh, BJP on project-launch spree: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday claimed that the BJP government was laying foundation stones and inaugurating a large number of projects as it had sensed a defeat in the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Akhilesh’s statement came soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated nine medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh and blamed the previous government in the state for “ignoring” basic medical needs of the people of the Purvanchal region while “filling the coffers” of their families.Akhilesh attacked the BJP government at the press conference he held at the party’s state headquarters soon after several leaders from various political parties joined the SP.“Today they are opening new medical colleges. But they had left the people on their own to die. People were dying in droves during the second wave of the Covid pandemic. The entire health system in UP had collapsed under this government. For four-and-a-half years, this government cultivated lies (jhooth ke phool),” the SP president alleged.“Even this opening of medical colleges is a sort of a lie. They are opening new medical colleges but have drastically cut the budgets of the existing medical colleges in the state. Even the medical university they made in the name of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was functioning from the ninth floor of Ram Manohar Lohia Institute (Lucknow) and not getting funds,” he further alleged.“Why medical colleges in Saharanpur, Budaun, Agra, Kanpur, Jaunpur, Firozabad, Jhansi, Banda, Azamgarh and even King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, are not getting funds,” he asked.When reporters asked him to respond to CM Yogi Adityanath’s announcement to distribute tablets to students, Yadav said, “What was he doing for over four and a half years?” Akhilesh once again claimed that the Purvanchal Expressway and the recently inaugurated Kushinagar airport were also given by his regime.“They (BJP leaders and PM) were not there to inaugurate the airport. They are here to survey it. They might sell it in the days to come. They are selling everything including railways, airports, etc,” he alleged.

At 2:15pm on October 9, when Tomar returned to her housing complex from work, she saw a car parked at her reserved parking area.“I asked the security guard to call the car owner and vacate the parking space. Three persons -- the car owner and two other men -- came and refused to remove the vehicle from there. This led to an argument, and they started abusing me. When I took out my cellphone to record the incident, one of them tried to snatch it away from me... Meanwhile, some of the residents reached the spot and helped me,” Tomar said, adding that the trio even threatened her with consequences.“I have been an international shooter for the past 17 years... I am surprised that the suspects abused me, and even tried to attack me inside my housing complex. I called the police, and filed a complaint in the matter,” she said, adding that there was, however, a delay in filing the complaint.I had to visit the police station three times before the officials registered a case in the matter on Saturday, Tomar said. “The registration process of FIRs needs to be smooth and timely.”A case has been registered against the three suspects under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 352 (assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) at the Bisrakh police station on Saturday, said the station house officer (SHO), Anita Chauhan.“The complainant had not met me in person, and it seems that she had filed the case at the local police check post.

25-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body begins survey to find illegal parking lots||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has started a survey of parking areas across the city to identify any illegal parking lot, officials said on Monday. The move comes after the state urban development department issued directions to all the local bodies and municipal corporations to stop such parking lots from operating, else officials concerned would be suspended. The corporation officials said that they are operating 24 parking lots across the city and they have not received any complaint this month so far about an illegal parking lot being operated in the city. “Apart from these 24 parking lots, we are trying to come up with parking spaces at 15 other locations. There was an illegal parking lot at Apsara border, which was shut down last month. To find out any such instance, we have deployed our officials for a survey who will submit a report soon,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. Tanwar “Further, we are also trying to come up with temporary parking lots ahead of the festival season,” he added. In its letter issued on October 11, the state urban development department said it received complaints that local bodies were illegally charging parking fees in different areas. The letter also said that through the department’s previous communication on August 25, it had directed to shut all illegal parking lots and also those operating on footpaths. In Ghaziabad city, auto-rickshaw drivers last month complained to the corporation that they had to shell out at least ₹20 per trip to unauthorised persons. “Near Apsara border, some people used to show us fee slips, saying that they were from the municipal corporation. From every auto driver, they used to take ₹20 as parking fee. We last month gave a complaint to the corporation. The corporation officials took action and the illegal parking was shut down,” said Dilshad Ahmad, a member of the Ghaziabad Auto-rickshaw Chalak Sangh. “We also want more parking lots for our autos otherwise they have no option but to stand roadsides where traffic police issues challans. The list of authorised parking lots should also be made online for transparency,” he added. Meanwhile, Rajendra Tyagi, a councillor from Raj Nagar and an activist, said that illegal parking lots are operating in different areas which the corporation has allegedly failed to rein in. “There are several illegal parking lots which are operating outside hospitals and malls. If the corporation takes up a detailed survey, they will come to know about such parking lots,” Tyagi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-begins-survey-to-find-illegal-parking-lots-101635182588489.html

Now, the monetary help should be provided at the earliest. This is what the BSP seeks,” Mayawati tweeted. To avail ex gratia, it would be mandatory to get “death due to Covid-19” listed in the death certificate. A Covid-19 death ascertaining committee (CDAC) comprising the additional district magistrate, chief medical officer, additional chief medical officer, principal or head of the department of medicine in medical college and a subject expert would be set up at the district level. This committee would ascertain the cause of death and testify the same. All applications received at the office of the district magistrates would have to be uploaded on the relief commissioner’s website rahat.up.nic.in after which, on completion of all the necessary formalities, the ex-gratia would be electronically transferred to the account of the kin of the Covid victim. To avail ex gratia, an application in the prescribed format, along with a death certificate stating Covid as the cause of death, would have to be made before the district magistrates who would be required to set up a cell to receive such applications. Government employees, who died due to Covid, while on panchayat duty and whose kin are eligible for ₹30 lakh ex gratia as well as such employees who succumbed while on Covid duty and whose kin are eligible for ₹50 lakh ex-gratia are exempted from the ₹50,000 ex gratia as per order. The BJP government at the centre has already decided ₹50,000 ex gratia to the next of kin of those who succumbed due to Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-demands-quick-disbursal-of-covid-death-ex-gratia-101635182353385.html
25-10-2021||Other||No flights to Nanded, Rome from Amritsar starting Oct 29||Amritsar Air India has suspended operations on two of its major routes from the holy city, the thrice-a-week direct flight to Nanded and the once-a-week Delhi-Amritsar-Rome route, from Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport in its winter schedule that will be in force from October 29, 2021 to March 26, 2022. The bookings of these two flights are not available on the website of the airline. Airport director VK Seth said, “The booking of Amritsar-Nanded flight is not available in the winter schedule of Air India. I have called up officials of Air India. We will work to ensure that the suspension is cancelled.”On the Rome flight, he added, “The Amritsar-Rome flight was not a scheduled flight. It was a special flight being operated under the Vande Bharat Mission. Under this mission, we got permission for a limited number of flights. The approved number of flights might have been completed.”Pilgrims and flyers, however, are upset at the decision of the airline. Global Convener of Fly Amritsar Initiative Sameep Singh Gumtala said he had already drawn the attention of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur to the issue. He added he had requested them to approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to ensure the routes remain operational.Gumtala added, “The Nanded-Amritsar direct flight, which connected the two important Sikh Temporal seats is a popular route. Suspending it is a major setback to the international and domestic connectivity of airport. Air India, just before privatisation, appears to have pulled the plug altogether on the route.”“Nanded is also an important pilgrimage destination for the Sikh community. With the direct flight, we completed this journey in just two-and-half hours, but the suspension will cause grave inconvenience to the devotees. It has been in operation for over three years and fulfilled a long-standing demand of pilgrims, non-resident Indians and tourists,” he added.Yogesh Kamra, secretary, Amritsar Vikas Manch (NGO), said. “With the winter season approaching, when thousands of Punjabi NRIs spend winter time in Punjab, the cancellation of this route is very disappointing for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-flights-to-nanded-rome-from-amritsar-starting-oct-29-101635182108592.html
25-10-2021||Gurugram||Dengue: MCG to carry out fogging under residents’ supervision||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) decided to carry out fogging and larviciding operations in the presence of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and local ward councillors, following complaints of poor preventive actions by the civic body.A senior MCG official, who attended a meeting held in this regard on Monday, said, “We had received complaints from various RWAs, councillors and residents that workers had not carried out fogging or anti-larvae activities in various areas despite stating otherwise. Hence, to ensure there is greater accountability, it was decided that such operations should now be conducted in the presence of RWAs and local councillors.”The MCG’s meeting at its Sector 34 office on Monday was aimed at strategising plans to curb the spread of dengue cases, under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.The city has seen a surge in dengue cases this month. On October 6, the first time that the district administration issued a dengue and malaria bulletin, the city’s dengue count stood at 83, which has rapidly increased to 217 as of Monday, when five fresh cases were reported. The tally is also a six-year high, as reported by HT on Monday.The MCG started its citywide fogging drive on October 20, before which it was only acting on complaints received from residents.As per the agenda list of the meeting, a copy of which is with HT, the MCG has deputed 156 workers for fogging and anti-larvae operations. Of the 156, 39 are multi-purpose health workers (MPHW) and 117 are multi-task workers (MTW).In the meeting, officials said that 19 MPHWs and 57 MTWs, each, would be assigned to carry out the activities in two shifts, from 9am to 5pm and from noon to 8pm. The MCG has set a target of covering 54 RWAs per day.“Including RWAs will not only increase accountability, but also ensure fogging and anti-larvae operations are carried out properly. RWAs have local knowledge of mosquito breeding spots as well as areas with stagnant water, which will further help MCG eradicate and reduce mosquito-borne diseases,” Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city, said.For carrying out fogging drives, the MCG has 35 handheld fogging machines and 10 vehicle-mounted fogging machines. Besides these, they also have 43 hand-held machines for spraying anti-larval solutions and 43 three-wheelers for carrying out the drives.“During the meeting, workers were directed to add black oil (mosquito larvicidal oil) to stagnant water or water bodies for anti-larvae purposes. The oil will be procured from the health department’s malaria office,” a second MCG official, who also attended the meeting, said.In the meeting officials also disclosed that so far, the MCG carried out fogging activities at 212 locations in August, 197 in September, and 309 this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-mcg-to-carry-out-fogging-under-residents-supervision-101635182054856.html
25-10-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram crime: T20 betting racket busted in DLF Phase-1||Cracking down on cricket betting rackets in the city, the crime branch of Gurugram arrested four people from DLF Phase-1 on Saturday night for allegedly facilitating bets on matches of the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup since October 17.According to the police, the suspects are repeat offenders and were allegedly running a huge network across north India from Gurugram. The suspects were identified as Luxman Singh (53), Satpal Singh (36), Pardeep Singh (31) and Neeraj Kumar (31), all from Delhi. They were allegedly working together for the past four years.Luxman was earlier arrested by Palam Vihar and Sector 65 police, in unrelated incidents, and was out on bail since July, the police said. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Luxman is the kingpin of the gang and is linked to other bookies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the cricket tournament is taking place. “They rented a two-bedroom floor in Block E of DLF Phase-1 and set up the laptops in a room, where operators were receiving calls,” he said.Sangwan said that the bookies used software that connected over 500 people to the digital scoreboard for placing bets. “We are conducting an investigation and cyber teams are tracking all people who were in touch with them and were involved in betting from different cities,” he said.The police estimate that the gang had placed bets up to ₹3 crore so far and were set to receive bets amounting to ₹6 crore for the India-Pakistan match, but were caught.Explaining the betting process, the police said that the betting system comprises a main bookie, two sub-bookies and punters. Each stakeholder has a fixed commission based on the match.This year, the police have arrested 16 bookies so far, while over 64 groups of bookies were busted last year. The police said that the suspects were booked under relevant sections of the Public Gambling Act. The bookmakers were on the police radar since last year after they were arrested from Palam Vihar and Sector 65 in two separate instances.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that such operations mushroom during cricket tournaments. “The bookies earlier operated out of Delhi, but for the past three years, they have shifted their base to Gurugram and are mostly operating out of residential areas to escape police attention,” he said.The police recovered 45 mobile phones, five laptops and two 60-inch television sets, which were used to telecast the matches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-crime-t20-betting-racket-busted-in-dlf-phase1-101635182053633.html
25-10-2021||Gurugram||March 2022 deadline for delimitation survey of wards||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has set a March 2022 deadline to complete a delimitation survey of its wards, to cover all areas under its jurisdiction before next year’s civic polls. MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja issued directions in this regard to officials during a meeting at the MCG’s Sector 34 office on Monday. Officials privy to the matter said that the process to hire a private agency to carry out the survey will start this week, and that it will assess the need for an increase, as the MCG added 16 villages and areas located near the Dwarka Expressway and Manesar border under its ambit last December. The MCG has 35 wards at present.“As per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, I have directed officials to start the process of ward delimitation. The survey will be carried out on the basis of the actual population falling within the MCG limits. For this, the process of hiring a private agency has been started. The survey has to be completed latest by March 2022 so that the survey report can be sent to the Haryana government the following month for perusal,” Ahuja said.The meeting was attended by officials of the MCG’s town planning branch and administrative wing. MCG officials privy to the matter said that in the survey, data on caste, blocks and maps will be detailed following a door-to-door assessment. Officials have been assigned duties for monitoring the same. According to a senior MCG official who attended the meeting, the delimitation process will be initiated well in advance so that there is no delay in conducting the MCG elections next year. “The municipal councillors have just around a year left on their tenure. The delimitation of wards was a major crisis back in 2016, due to which municipal elections had to be deferred for nearly 17 months. Hence, to avoid a repeat of a similar scenario, preparations are being made in advance. It is likely the total number of municipal wards would be increased to 37-38, taking the latest population figures in mind,” the official cited above said.The MCG elections in 2016 were deferred as there was a difference in the 2011 census and an MCG survey of the city’s population. The census figures pegged the city’s population around 0.9 million while the MCG pegged it at 1.15 million.In March 2016, the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB) notified an order stating that as per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Delimitation of Wards Rules, cities with a population between 0.8 to 1 million can have 32 municipal wards. However, since its inception, the MCG has been operating with 35 civic wards.An ad-hoc committee of the Haryana government later found the city’s population to be above 1 million and the MCG elections finally took place in September 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/march-2022-deadline-for-delimitation-survey-of-wards-101635182050097.html
25-10-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow gets its own IPL team||It’s official. Lucknow has its own Indian Premier League (IPL) team as the Sanjiv Goenka-led RPSG group on Monday won the bid for “Lucknow Team” at approximately ₹7000 crore (over 932 million USD), while private equity firm CVC Capital (also referred to as Irelia) got Ahmedabad at nearly ₹5200 crore (over 692 million USD). It is learnt that the RPSG group also owned the Rising Pune Supergiant team that played two seasons (2016 and 2017) when Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were banned. It is also the owner of Indian Super League (ISL) franchise ATK Mohun Bagan.In December last, Hindustan Times had reported about the prospect of the Uttar Pradesh state capital getting its own Indian Premier League team under the headline “Lucknow’s IPL team a possibility in 2021” on the front page.There were anxious moments since Monday morning as Lucknowites waited with bated breath even before the start of the IPL Governing Council meeting in Dubai.Both Lucknow and Ahmedabad were considered the favourites in terms of their stadium capacity as well as facilities. Lucknow’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium is one of the best stadiums in the world with a top-class drainage system and seating capacity of 55,000. The Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera, Ahmedabad, has a seating capacity of more than 100,000. The other cities in the fray were Indore, Guwahati, Cuttack, Dharamsala and Pune.“It is good to be back in the IPL and I am delighted,” RPSG owner Sanjiv Goenka was quoted as saying soon after the BCCI’s announcement.“It is an initial step. We now have to build a good team and perform,” he said.Udai Sinha, managing director of Ekana Sportz City, which owns the Ekana Stadium, expressed happiness over the Ekana stadium getting the hosting rights for IPL matches.“It’s a great honour for us that RPSG Group has chosen the Lucknow stadium as their home ground for the IPL team. I was waiting for this to happen ever since this stadium came into existence in 2018,” said Sinha on the phone from Dubai.“I am thankful to BCCI vice-president and UP Cricket Association director Rajeev Shukla for his support to the stadium in getting the hosting rights of the IPL matches,” he said.“I was quite sure about this as BCCI secretary Jay Shah, in his only visit to the stadium early this year, had praised the facilities. The stadium already has the ICC status for both Test and other formats of the game,” he said, adding, “It’s like a dream come true for Lucknowites as they always kept asking for an IPL team.”Former India cricketer Gyanendra Pandey, too, hailed the RPSG Group for choosing Lucknow as the venue for its IPL team.“We did see IPL matches for two seasons at the Green Park Stadium when Gujarat Lions had opted for it and now, we will see the magic of “fatafat” cricket in Lucknow also,” he said.The 2022 edition will not be the first time the IPL will comprise 10 teams. That already happened a decade ago. It has been confirmed that the tournament format will follow the 2011 model, which scrapped the simple home-and-away format, and included a total of 74 matches (instead of the current number of 60). In the 2011 edition, the 10 teams were split into two loose groups, and the tournament comprised 70 league matches and four playoff games, with all the teams ranked in one composite league table. During the league phase, every team played the same number of league matches, which was 14.Each team played the other four in their group both home and away (eight matches), four of the teams in the other group once each (four matches, either home or away), and the remaining team in the other group twice, both home and away.A random draw decided the composition of the groups as well as who played whom across the groups once and twice.The last time more than eight teams played in the IPL was in 2013, when nine teams took part and played a total of 76 matches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-gets-its-own-ipl-team-101635182048534.html

Beri has also been fined ₹2,000, the non-payment of which will lead to additional jail time of one month. The detailed order is yet to be uploaded on the website. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) had filed a complaint in the Jalandhar court on November 4, 2019, after more than four years of the incident. Beri was released on the bail by then special railway magistrate, Rahul Kumar and this will continue, as his bail will continue. In February 2020, the court framed charges against Beri under Section 174 of the Railway Act (obstructing the running of train) to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. According to the prosecution Beri, along with co-accused, had sat in the middle of the railway tracks on May 2, 2015, in protest against the then state and the Central governments at the Dakoha railway crossing over the issue of runaway inflation, as a result of which train number 15707 (Amarpali Express) had to be detained at the Chiheru (CEU) railway station in 2015. In July 2021, Beri filed a plea under Section 468 of the CrPC for for dismissal of the present complaint by RPF. He contented that the complaint has been filed before the magistrate after more than four-and-a-half years and drew attention of the court towards limitations on taking cognizance for an offence under Section 174 of the Railways Act. The special railways public prosecutor, however, contented that the present application is liable to be dismissed only on the ground that this court being criminal court has no power to recall its own order. The court said that the notice of accusation had already been served upon the accused on February 18, 2020 and at that stage no such objection was taken by the accused. Once the cognisance has been taken, it is not open to the criminal court to recall its own order. “Undoubtedly, the legal proposition raised by learned counsel for the accused is correct, but the proceedings of the present case cannot be thrown out at this stage on the ground of limitation and the said ground is well available with the accused at the time of final adjudication of the matter,” added the court in its order. It added that since this court cannot recall its own order, the present application stands dismissed with no orders as to costs.“I will appeal before the district and sessions judge in the matter as I have full faith in the judicial system,” Beri said, adding that he had protested for the people and would continue to fight for the common man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cong-mla-gets-one-year-jail-for-obstructing-train-in-2015-101635181328409.html

25-10-2021||Pune||Afghan students may get ICCR scholarships on sympathetic grounds||PUNE: Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Rajya Sabha MP and president of the Council for Indian Cultural Relations, on Monday said that they are considering on sympathetic grounds to grant scholarships to Afghan students in India planning to take admission to new academic courses. He was at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) for a programme after which he interacted with the media.“In case of Afghan students who are here in India and have completed their studies, their visa extension is a matter which can be addressed only by the union home ministry and we cannot comment on it. But in case of those students who are planning to take admission to a new academic programme or course, we are thinking of giving them ICCR scholarships on sympathetic grounds,” Sahasrabuddhe said.“Afghan students will get admission on the basis of merit and if they get admission, we are certainly thinking of granting them scholarships. Once they secure admission, we will consider them even though they have not come through proper channel. We receive names from the embassy for granting scholarships and this year as a special case, we need to take the decision here itself for Afghan students who have already come to India and are finishing their earlier courses,” he said.There are more than 4,000 Afghan students studying in various universities and colleges in Pune but more than 70% have returned to their homeland in the past one year. The Afghanistan Students’ Association in Pune is coordinating with the Indian- government, embassy and universities regarding student-related issues and visa extension for a majority of Afghan students.Before the press interaction, Sahasrabuddhe spoke about implementation of the new educational policy (2020) at the prize ceremony of the university-level open essay competition.“In terms of education, the country needed a new policy to come out of its colonial mentality and carry the fragrance of its own soil. This fundamental change has been adopted in the new education policy and emphasis has been placed on mother-tongue education. Language is related to our beliefs and worries, hence the emphasis in the policy on mother-tongue education. This policy has been formulated by including Swadeshi, Swabhasha, Swabhav and Swadharma,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/afghan-students-may-get-iccr-scholarships-on-sympathetic-grounds-101635180848323.html

PM Modi also said the facilities developed in BHU will help the students. For instance, the hostel facility developed for the women students will help realise the dream of BHU founder Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, he said. Referring to infrastructure development in Varanasi, he said there used to be traffic jams due to the absence of a ring road in Varanasi and local people had got accustomed to waiting for the jams to end. Construction of the ring road has ended this problem and traffic movement will get momentum till Prayagraj, Lucknow, and Bihar, he said. Even people who go to Vindhyachal (in Mirzapur) for darshan of Maa Vindhayavasini and those who go to Bhadohi will be benefitted by it, he said. Stating that work is being done for the cleanliness of the Ganga, he said eight drains have been tapped in Ramnagar and a sewage treatment plant is working there.He also said the Varuna was losing its existence earlier due to neglect but now clean water was flowing into this river. Pathway railings are installed on both sides of the river, he added.A packaging centre and a perishable cargo centre have been set up in Varanasi and the facility will be useful for the farmers of Kashi and Purvanchal, he said.PM Modi inaugurated a bio gas-CNG plant built in Shahanshahpur in Varanasi.

The home department has informed the Intelligence Bureau that the IPS officer is no more traceable and also sought the central agency’s help to search him. According to the officials in the home department, the legal process of declaring Singh an absconder has begun. The department has sought legal opinion to make the proposal foolproof by complying with the legal formalities. The state has already proposed to suspend the officer after he went untraceable since May this year. The home department has also initiated departmental inquiry against him for the lapses in the Antilia explosives scare case. “We have informed the IB that the former CP of Mumbai is no more traceable and he has not reported to work for more than three months. While seeking their help, we have also initiated the process of declaring him absconding. We are taking legal opinion for it,” said a senior official from the department. Singh has been untraceable since May after he went on leave for health reasons. The officer was sent multiple letters to his Chandigarh home and emails enquiring about his whereabouts. The communication has gone unanswered. Last month, home minister Dilip Walse Patil had said that they were looking into the provisions under All India Services (conduct) Rules to take action against the IPS officer. The Thane police issued lookout notices against him in July. He has repeatedly failed to appear before the Chandiwal commission constituted by the state government to probe the allegations of corruption by him against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-home-department-begins-process-to-declare-param-bir-singh-absconding-101635179108080.html

25-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan cruise drugs raid case: NDPS court rejects NCB’s plea for restraint amid Sail’s allegations||A special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court on Monday rejected the plea filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), seeking orders to not allow anyone to take cognisance of the purported affidavit of Prabhakar Sail, a panch witness in the cruise ship drug bust case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan has been arrested along with others, or initiate any action on the basis of the affidavit without prior permission of the special court. The court observed that such blanket orders cannot be passed. Sail alleged he was made to sign on blank papers as pancha (witness) on the night the NCB raided the International Cruise Terminal, Green Gate, on October 2 and arrested Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and fashion designer Munmun Dhamecha. Sail, 40, claimed he used to work as a bodyguard of KP Gosavi, one of the nine witnesses in the case. Sail, in a notarised affidavit, alleged that he overheard a conversation between Gosavi and another person, wherein they were discussing about an amount of ₹25 crore, of which they had to pay ₹8 crore to a senior official in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). In his affidavit, Sail claimed that he collected two bags containing ₹50 lakh each and gave them to Gosavi. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik, too, has made extortion allegations against Sameer Wankhede, Mumbai zonal director of NCB. Wankhede has denied all allegations. Citing the recent events, the NCB moved the special NDPS court. The agency’s counsel, advocate Advait Sethna, urged the court to take up the plea for urgent hearing. “Sail’s affidavit is already forwarded to Delhi office of the NCB for further legal action,” said Sethna. In the affidavit filed before the special court along with the plea, Wankhede claimed the allegations “are not only false but misleading, mischievous and maligning”. “I have been personally targeted especially by a known political figure for reasons best known to him. The only justification that I can fathom is that one Sameer Khan, a relative of the political honcho was arrested in a NDPS case in accordance with law and later enlarged on bail by this court. From that time there are series of personal vendetta targeted at me and my family members who are victims of such defamatory attacks and false, frivolous and vexatious allegations,” stated Wankhede’s affidavit. “I was threatened to be arrested and to be dispelled from my service. There is a lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interest just for conducting and honest and impartial investigation. I am ready to face all that is in law to establish my innocence. In this case highly influential people are involved so I request the court to pass appropriate orders to preserve and protect the sanctity of a fair and unbiased investigation, which not to be interfered in any manner,” it added. Wankhede, who was present for mentioning of the plea, stepped in the witness box and informed the special judge Vaibhav Patil that his personal details, details about his family members were being made public. “In my entire career I haven’t done anything wrong and I am ready to face any enquiry,” said the officer. “They are targeting my family, my deceased mother and father. Today, they have also posted some photographs,” said Wankhede. “They are threatening officers, panch witnesses and their family members. In this regard, a panch has already filed a complaint,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aryan-khan-cruise-drugs-raid-case-ndps-court-rejects-ncb-s-plea-for-restraint-amid-sail-s-allegations-101635176347697.html

Mahant Dharam Das had organised the event for the Delhi CM, who shared a video of the ‘aarti’ on Twitter. Addressing a gathering after the aarti, Kejriwal began his speech with the chant of ‘Jai Shri Ram’. “I am fortunate to be in Ayodhya and seek blessings from Maa Saryu for the prosperity of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and the rest of the country,” he said. “The country is facing pandemic, but the situation has been under some control over the last few days. With blessings of Maa Saryu and Lord Ram, soon we will be free from this pandemic,” said Kejriwal. “Our country should have achieved much more, but it is facing several problems. I pray to lord Ram to make ‘Bharat Varsh’ the number one country. Together, 130 crore people of this country, can make this possible,” said Kejriwal. “I am much younger to many people present here. But with my experience of running the Delhi government over the past five years, I can assure that 130 crore people this country together can make this happen, if they work like a family,” he added. Kejriwal reached Lucknow on Monday morning and left for Sultanpur, from where he reached Ayodhya on a two-day visit. Sanjay Singh, AAP’s UP incharge and Rajya Sabha MP, was accompanying the Delhi chief minister. Kejriwal will stay in Ayodhya on Monday night. According to Vaibhav Maheshwari, AAP state spokesperson, the Delhi CM will pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at Ram Janmabhoomi and Lord Hanuman at Hanuman Garhi temple on Tuesday. On Kejriwal’s visit to Ayodhya, BJP MLA from Ayodhya Sadar assembly constituency, Ved Prakash Gupta, said: “AAP was opposing Ram temple. They wanted a university instead of the mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi.” “Now, in Ayodhya, they are talking about lord Ram. Delhi riots have exposed the AAP. They have no political base in Uttar Pradesh,” said Gupta. Meanwhile, the Kejriwal-led AAP announced that it would contest the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh due to be held next year. The party informed that it would contest all 403 Assembly seats in the 2022 Assembly elections.The party formally kicked off its poll campaign in September this year with its senior leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh offering prayers at the Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi shrine in the temple town of Ayodhya.The party had also taken out a ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in Ayodhya from the 18th-century mausoleum of Nawab Shujaudaulah to the Gandhi Park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kejriwal-performs-aarti-on-banks-of-saryu-in-ayodhya-101635176052404.html
25-10-2021||Mumbai||Thane police constables save biker from falling on busy road||Along with manning the heavy peak hour traffic congestion, solving crime and patrolling the city, the Thane city police are busy saving lives of people. In one such incident, police officials of Kongaon in Bhiwandi saved a biker who suffered sudden seizures while riding.The biker was about to fall off the bike on a major highway but constables, Pandit Rathod and Rajendra Dhumal, who were behind him saw him tilting to one side and realised something was wrong and rushed to drag him off the bike.The biker, a 19-year-old resident of Vikhroli (name withheld to protect identity) was on his way to a water park with 20 of his friends on October 19 at 9.15am. Near the Pimplas Railway Bridge, he suffered seizure and rammed onto a divider. His bike turned left and he was almost about to hit the ground. But the two constables in a police van behind the bike stopped and rushed in time to hold him before he completely slipped off his bike.Dhumal said, “We were on VIP escort duty on October 19 near Anand Nagar area of Pimplas Bridge. I saw this boy on a bike. His body was shaking and he was about to lose control of his bike. I realised that something was wrong. So Rathod and I took the car to one side. He dashed the divider and almost fell off on the road, hit his head on the other side when I held him and stopped him from skidding. The road is always full of heavy vehicles and therefore my main concern was to stop him before he hit any big vehicle.“People didn’t realise what happened to him but through his behaviour and unconsciousness, I realised it was a seizure. I stopped everyone from giving water to him and took him to the nearby hospital. Till then, I held his face in the fresh air. He felt fine after he was taken to the hospital and was discharged within two days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-police-constables-save-biker-from-falling-on-busy-road-101635176050863.html
25-10-2021||Mumbai||Dip in number of local train commuters caught without masks in October: Railways||With a rise in the number of passengers travelling on suburban local trains after easing of coronavirus restrictions, the count of citizens travelling without facial masks seems to have decreased on central and western railways.In October, 1,395 passengers were fined on the Western Railway (WR) network for travelling without masks, as opposed to 1,606 travellers fined in September and 1,816 commuters penalised in August. WR has recovered fines worth ₹1.64 lakh from people travelling without masks in October.On the Central Railway (CR) network, 240 passengers were fined in October for travelling without masks and ₹48,000 was collectively recovered from them. From January to September, 2,342 passengers have been fined on the route for the offence. “There has been a decline in the number of people found travelling without facial masks. There has also been a dip in those travelling on fake essential workers’ identity cards. We conduct surprise checks on both the railway networks as well inside local train premises,” said a senior railway official. The Maharashtra government had authorised the Government Railway Police (GRP) to collect fines from passengers travelling onboard local trains and at railway stations without masks.The fine amount is ₹200 and is charged on the basis of a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) notification on fines to be levied on citizens for not wearing masks and spitting.Passenger associations are, however, unsure if the number of commuters without masks has declined and have asked the railways to increase checking inside its premises.“There are images of passengers travelling without facial masks inside local train compartments. The railways and BMC should conduct stringent checks as the number of passengers [without masks] is on the rise,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.As the Maharashtra government eased coronavirus restrictions, schools, colleges and places of worship were allowed to reopen in Mumbai. The city’s suburban railway network also witnessed a rise in the number of passengers.Both the zonal railways are contemplating on redemption of local train services in 100% capacity. At present, local train services are operational at 95% capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dip-in-number-of-local-train-commuters-caught-without-masks-in-october-railways-101635176047761.html
25-10-2021||Pune||PMC to survey accident-prone flyovers, bridges to take corrective action||PUNE: Following a series of accidents along the Narhe stretch of the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to conduct a survey of all accident-prone bridges and flyovers on the national highway and accordingly take corrective steps wherever possible while also submitting a report to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).However, priority will be given to the Navale bridge, civic officials said on Monday, days after four persons died in two mishaps along the 3.5 km Narhe stretch that has claimed as many as 56 lives in the past eight years. Nearly half of the 56 deaths were caused by human error where drivers did not follow traffic rules while the remaining half were caused by faulty design of the flyover, steep slope, lack of rumblers and wrongly created punctures on service roads, according to the local police.During the PMC’s general body meeting on Monday, elected members discussed the spate of accidents at Narhe. Congress appointed corporator Ajit Darekar first raised the issue in the general body meeting and said that corrective steps need to be taken. “The Navale Bridge at Narhe has become a dangerous spot and till date, nearly 56 people have died in accidents along this bridge. The civic administration should take cognisance of the accidents and take measures to curtail them,” Darekar said. Thereafter, elected members across parties joined the discussion. Many claimed that flaws in the flyover design and construction are causing accidents and that the accident-prone spots should be studied and corrective measures taken. Representatives from Warje, Bavdhan, Kondhwa, Katraj, Parvati and the peth areas, too, shared their observations about flyovers and bridges in their areas and held the traffic planning department responsible for the raft of accidents. The corporators pointed out that the commuters’ woes are also due to lack of coordination between the local authority and the state government’s public works’ department. The elected members demanded that an audit of accident-prone bridges and flyovers be carried out so as to take corrective measures to curb future accidents and save commuters’ lives. They demanded that a report on the lacunae be submitted to the union and state government for the future course of action.After the discussion, mayor Murlidhar Mohol ordered the administration to conduct a survey of bridges and flyovers. “The administration will have to undertake visits to flyovers and bridges and carry out detailed studies. A report of accident-prone spots will be tabled in a couple of days. A copy of the report will be sent to the union government as well as the state government. The blind spots and other problems will be identified and resolved as early as possible,” Mohol said. On Friday night, a tanker first rammed into an SUV car and then into a tempo and container truck at Narhe, causing a major accident in which two persons died and two others were injured. According to the Pune traffic police and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) however, a majority of these accidents are caused by human error where commuters are violating traffic rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-survey-accident-prone-flyovers-bridges-to-take-corrective-action-101635175867713.html
25-10-2021||Pune||Yerwada jail inmates’ Diwali exhibition expected to net ₹12-15 lakh; open till November 2||PUNE In its 10th year, the Yerwada Central Jail inmates’ Diwali exhibition, inaugurated on Monday, is expected to add ₹12-15 lakh to the ocean of deficit of ₹13-14 crore in the industrial output of the state prison department for the financial year of 2020-21.The exhibition was put up by the inmates with reduced funds as a result of funds being used for the Covid-19 pandemic.The past year, owing to Covid-19 restrictions and trade restrictions, the industrial output was ₹9.4 crore as against ₹24.8 crore in 2019-2020. The year before this also witnessed industrial output of ₹23.09 crore.The ADG also announced that they have an order worth ₹1 crore from a district hospital for furniture. These orders will help the industrial output from the jail and helping provide more work for inmates which will translate into daily wages for them.When asked about the effect of the lockdown and number of people working to make these products, Atulchandra Kulkarni, additional director general (ADG) of Police for Prisons in Maharashtra said, “For now we do not have many skilled workers with the emergency parole and Covid-19 situation. We first have to ask inmates for their interest and then train them. Not everything they make reaches the market so they have to be trained until their products are worth selling. That takes up a lot of time. Around 2,000 inmates must be involved in putting up the exhibition this time.”Various forms of industries are operational using inmates’ workforce in seven major jails including Yerawada, Nagpur, Amravati, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, and Thane.The shop also provides products to government organisations including hospitals, government student hostels, rescue homes, universities, products like stationary required for election procedure, stationary for the High Court, police department, and social welfare department.There are at least a dozen types of factories that are in operation - iron products, masonry, sewing, painting, paper production, shoe-making, baking, washing center, and spare parts assembly. While these are functional in most of the seven jails, there are jail-wise specialties.Ganpati idols are made in the Nashik jail, while LED lights are produced in Amravati and a foundry exists in Kolhapur, which also makes the famous boondi laddoo for the well-known Mahlakshmi temple in Kolhapur. Meanwhile, the men’s jail in Yerawada specialises in wiring for Mahindra’s Bolero SUV, and the women’s cell produces locksets for TVS vehicles.With handloom and power loom-produced clothes like bedsheets, shirts, kurtas, napkins, other products like lanterns, lamps, footwear, earrings, Paithani sarees, furniture-like sofa sets, home temples, shoestand, key-holder, watch-holder, along with cakes, and biscuits are for sale. The exhibition, which drew a notable crowd on the first day itself, will be on till November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/yerwada-jail-inmates-diwali-exhibition-expected-to-net-12-15-lakh-open-till-november-2-101635174067582.html

Fines have been levied against the offenders.The action has been taken as the bikes emerged back on the roads after Covid lockdown in Pune was eased earlier this month. Action has been taken under Section 119 and 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, pertaining to unauthorised modifications to the vehicle, often causing a nuisance to the public.DCP (Traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “We took action against 500 such bikes with modified silencers, but during the lockdown period, no action was taken.”DCP Srirame further added that according to the Motor Vehicle Act, any non-authorised modification to a two-wheeler is illegal. “We will carry out special drives against all types of two- wheelers with loud silencers and police action will be taken against the accused violating the traffic and RTO rules,” he said.The traffic branch in 2018 had conducted a special drive against modified silencers and took action against around 200 Royal Enfield motorbikes in a day. Kondhwa resident Mallesh Naidu said, “We are seeing a number of youngsters moving in groups riding motorcycles which fire a loud noise which is extremely dangerous for senior citizens and pregnant women.”Kothrud resident Harish Gosavi said, “The loud silencers are disturbing the neighbourhood and causing anxiety issues.

25-10-2021||Lucknow||Purvanchal will emergeas a medical hub: Modi||LUCKNOW Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took pot shots at the previous government in Uttar Pradesh for “ignoring basic medical needs of the people of the Purvanchal region while filling coffers of their families,” and asserted that the region, which became infamous for deaths due to encephalitis, would now emerge as a medical hub under BJP rule. Addressing a public meeting at the BSA ground in Siddharthnagar after inaugurating nine medical colleges in UP virtually from here, the prime minister said the BJP’s priority was to provide basic facilities to the poor.Built at a cost of ₹2,329 crore, the medical colleges inaugurated were located in Siddharthnagar, Etah, Hardoi, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Deoria, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Jaunpur districts. Modi attacked the previous UPA government at the centre and the Samajwadi Party government in UP, alleging that both neglected eastern UP (Purvanchal region).“Mere announcements of the establishment of dispensaries were made. For years, the building was not constructed, and if the building was constructed, the equipment was not installed. There was a crisis of doctors and paramedical staff,” he said.In an apparent attack on the SP government, which ruled the state before the BJP came to power in 2017, he said: “Their cycle of corruption ran 24 hours. There was corruption in medicine and ambulance procurement as well as in appointments. They had the priority of earning for themselves and filling the coffers of their families while for us the priority is to extend basic facilities to the poor.”“In 2014, the people gave me an opportunity to serve them. To change the prevailing scenario, my government worked day and night. Measures were taken to improve the health services of the country,” emphasised the PM.Modi said the previous government in UP did not cooperate with the central government and indulged in politics over development projects. “For the first time in UP’s history, nine medical colleges have been inaugurated in a single day. Why such events did not take place earlier. The reason is they lacked political commitment and priorities,” he added.These nine medical colleges with 2,500 beds were ready to serve the people of Purvanchal region and had also created job opportunities for more than 5,000 doctors/paramedics. They will also pave way for medical education for youths, he said.The prime minister said before Independence and also later no importance was given to basic health facilities and people from towns and villages had to rush to cities to avail medical facilities and noted that “dimagi bukhar” (Acute Encephalitis Syndrome) use to grip the region every year, but there was lack of adequate medical facilities in the area. “The double engine government has worked honestly to ensure that better health services reach the poor. We have launched the new health policy in the country to ensure that the poor get treatment and lives can be saved. Under Ayushman Bharat scheme, 90 lakh people have got free treatment in UP. The treatment of cancer, dialysis and heart disease has also become affordable,” said Modi.“The previous government constructed only six medical colleges, whereas under the Yogi Adityanath government, 16 new medical colleges have started and work is in progress on 30 medical colleges. The AIIMS at Rae Bareli and Gorakhpur are a bonus for UP,” he said. Before 2014, the number of medical seats in India was less than 90,000 but in the last seven years 7,000 new seats were added. Till 2017, UP had 1,900 seats, but under the double engine government more than 1,900 seats had been increased, he added. “This is the mantra of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, sabka prayas.’ When people are healthy and have opportunities, they will contribute to the development of the country, said the Prime Minister.With more medical colleges coming up, India will have more doctors in the next 10-12 years than it has had in the past over 70 years since Independence, said Modi while addressing the launch function of PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi.The nine new medical colleges had been named after noted personalities of the region and in some cases prominent politicians. The Siddarthnagar medical college had been named after Madhav Prasad Tripathi, a Jansangh leader, who served as the first BJP president of the state after its formation in 1980. In Deoria, the medical college was named after Maharshi Devraha Baba (a noted saint), Ghazipur medical college after Maharshi Vishwamitra, Mirzapur medical college after Maa Vindhyavasini, a manifestation of Goddess Durga, Pratapgarh medical college after Dr Sonelal Patel (founder of BJP ally Apna Dal), Etah medical college after Virangna Avanti Bai Lodhi and Fatehpur college after Jodha Singh Ataiya Thakur Dariyav Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/purvanchal-will-emergeas-a-medical-hub-modi-101635172928734.html

25-10-2021||Lucknow||Nine new medical colleges a tribute to those who died prematurely: Yogi Adityanath||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the inauguration of nine new medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a genuine tribute to all those who died prematurely because of lack of medical facilities since independence.The new facilities will check deaths by providing medical quality medical care and the new medical colleges will also inspire youngsters to become doctors and serve the society, Yogi Adityanath said.He was addressing a public meeting at BSA Ground in Siddharthnagar on the occasion of the opening of nine medical colleges simultaneously by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Uttar Pradesh government was committed to providing quality health facilities in the backward regions of the state that remained neglected post- independence, he said.The chief minister said under the leadership of PM Modi, the country has emerged as a model for other countries by developing two vaccines in a short span and vaccinating more than 100 crore people, while several developed countries are battling the Covid pandemic.The people of UP were earlier denied the basic health amenities even after seven decades of independence due to neglect by previous governments leading to the premature death of people, he said.“Today, the scenario is changing fast in the medical field with measures taken by PM. The impact of PM’s plan is visible in the state. Today, nine newly constructed medical colleges have been inaugurated by PM,” he said.Before 1947, there were only three-four medical colleges in UP despite the fact that today’s Uttarakhand was part of the state, he noted.“Between 1947 -2016, there were 12 medical colleges in the state. Now, 30 medical colleges are coming up in UP with assistance of the central government, of which seven have started in 2019, nine are opening today while the construction of 14 medical colleges is on,” he said.PM Modi has also provided employment and distributed free ration to people, apart from offering free vaccination during the Covid pandemic, the chief minister said.His vision of “One District-One Medical College” was fast becoming a reality, he added.Under PM’s guidance, unprecedented work was done to fight the pandemic and save lives and livelihood of people, he said, adding that ICUs have been opened in hospitals in every district of the state.Earlier, a large number of deaths were reported in Siddharthnagar due to encephalitis . With improved health infrastructure, cleanliness, construction of toilets, supply of pure drinking water, establishment of paediatric ICUs, as well as encephalitis treatment centre, 95% of deaths due to encephalitis have been controlled, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nine-new-medical-colleges-a-tribute-to-those-who-died-prematurely-yogi-adityanath-101635170526877.html
25-10-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai coastal road-sea link interchange in violation of clearances: Fisherfolk||The representatives of Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Vyavsay Sahakari Society (WKNVSS) on Monday wrote to the Maharashtra chief minister, environment minister and officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), alleging violations of the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance granted in 2017 to the coastal road project. The allegation has been made specifically against a proposed interchange to connect the coastal road with the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL), for which the construction is to start this month. HT had reported on October 17 that Cleveland Bunder, an artisanal fishing port in Worli Koliwada, may face permanent closure due to this interchange, as it will cut off fishing boats from accessing open seas. BMC plans to construct two connecting bridges between the south-end of BWSL and the north end of the coastal road, which the fisherfolk said will severely constrict the only navigational route available to boats as they commute to their customary fishing grounds. BMC recently began preparing to construct this segment of the controversial infra project, prompting nearly 200 boats from across the Worli fishing zone to block a temporary jetty at the coastal road construction site on October 14. In Monday’s letter, a copy of which is with HT, the fisherfolk wrote, “One of the specific conditions of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) clearance dated January 4, 2017, was as follows: ‘BMC to ensure that no fishing activity is hampered during construction and operation phase of the project’. Thereafter the final CRZ clearance dated May 11, 2017, was granted by the MoEFCC (Union environment ministry), subject to the following specific condition: ‘Bridges with navigable spans will be provided by the project proponent as committed, so that there are no obstructions to fishing boats’.” The fisherfolk pointed out that their request for a navigable span (of at least 200 metres, as opposed to the proposed distance of 60 metres) under the interchange has been raised formally on multiple occasions since 2016. The assistant commissioner of fisheries has also written to both BMC and the fisheries commissioner in April 2017 and December 2018, respectively, pointing out to the fisherfolk’s concerns over possible closure of their only navigation route out to sea. Subsequently, in January 2019, the assistant commissioner of fisheries also wrote to fisheries commissioner saying that the department’s no objection certification (NOC) for the project should be re-examined in light of this predicament. In a parallel development, the Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti (AMMKS), a state-wide fishworkers’ collective, which has pledged their support to Worli Koliwada’s fisherfolk, also took up this issue with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). The latter had in March 2017 provided a no objection certificate (NOC) for the coastal road project to BMC, which is subject to compliance with 14 statutory conditions. “In the 14th condition, MSRDC clearly wrote that if fisherfolk are obstructed from doing their business, and if fisherfolk recorded any objections, it will be considered as violating the terms of the NOC,” said Devendra Tandel, president, AMMKS. “These matters are very serious in nature and MSRDC needs to seek an explanation from BMC. It is humbly requested that your NOC for the project be immediately revoked as BMC has violated its 14th condition,” Tandel wrote in his letter, dated October 20. Both WKNVSS and AMMKS have also pointed out to authorities that the coastal road project has been subject to important design changes that were not part of its original detailed project report (DPR). For example, additional land reclamation of 21 hectares for a protective sea wall was included after finalisation of DPR and cleared by statutory bodies long after construction work began.“If these design changes were made during the execution of the project, why is it not possible to change the design of the interchange to ensure safe passage of our boats,” WKNVSS wrote in Monday’s letter. Shweta Wagh, architect and researcher, who has been closely monitoring the impact of coastal road on fishing communities, emphasised that even the design of the original design of BWSL was changed to accommodate a navigation route for fisherfolk leaving from Bathery Jetty, another fish landing centre close to Cleveland Bunder. “If it has been done in the past, there is no reason it cannot be done again,” she said.Officials in BMC’s coastal road department did not responds to requests for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-coastal-road-sea-link-interchange-in-violation-of-clearances-fisherfolk-101635169807116.html

The owner, Manish Pimple, will also fund their further education. The women had to give up their education owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the first such bunker in Palghar district where tribal women have been employed.Pimple, a resident of Maswan, has been running Priya Petrol Pump in Palghar for the past two decades. “I got to know that Dipali Tumbada, 18, and Priti Jadhav, 20, lost out on their education since March 2020 owing to the financial crisis from the Covid-19 pandemic. The parents of the women are farm labourers and make a living by working in paddy field in Maswan and the nearby areas. The women were also working in the fields after losing out on their education,” said Pimple. The petrol pump owner then approached Hindustan Petroleum Company Limited (HPCL) as he runs their franchisee. “After I shared my idea of helping the women, they told me to go ahead and hire the women,” said Pimple.The women were given a month’s training at the bunker on how to start the fuel pump, fill the correct quantity, filling air in vehicles as well as fire-fighting training to avoid mishaps. “The women were very eager to undergo the training, and after a month, they were employed at my station in September. They get a monthly stipend of ₹6,000 each and we bear the expenses of their uniforms. This is the first bunker in Palghar district where tribal women have been employed, with a hope of making a difference in the society,” said Pimple.He said the customers were surprised to see the women welcome them with a ‘Namaste’ and a smile. Pimple added Tumbada and Patil want to be enrolled for Arts degree at Yeshwantrao Open University, Nashik, from the next academic year.“I want the women want to have a secure career. I will take care of their education and help them achieve their goals. They can continue working at my bunker along with their studies. Dipali has cleared Class 12 from a Palghar college while Priti has studied till Class 10 from Maswan government school. If one day the two become a collector or Class-1 officers, I’ll consider it to be my small contribution to the society. Just because the two women had to leave their education due to the pandemic, they should not lose out on an opportunity to have a good future,” said Pimple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/palghar-petrol-pump-owner-employs-two-tribal-women-will-also-fund-their-education-101635169627417.html

We also have a majority on the basis of numbers. Other than this, no election is valid. I will complete the unfinished work of Mahant Narendra Giri,” he added.ABAP general secretary Mahant Hari Giri, said, “The new president has been elected according to the rules, laws and traditions of ABAP and those who did not come due to any reason, it is expected that they will attend the next meeting scheduled for November 25.”Mahant Resham Singh of Nirmal Akhara said, “The court has recognised me as the president of Nirmal Akhada and apart from me, those who have gone to any meeting from Nirmal Akhada do not have any validity and if necessary, legal action will be taken against such people.”Representatives of the Nirmal Akhara had supported the second faction of ABAP, which held a meeting at Haridwar early this month.Shrimant Someshvaranand of Agni Akhara said, “The election conducted in Haridwar is arbitrary and against tradition. We reject that choice. If necessary, legal action will be taken against them.”However, Mahant Rajendra Das, general secretary of ABAP’s second faction, said, “The election to the Akhada Parishad was held on October 21. The seers of all the Akhadas have got representation in the meeting and the election conducted in Shree Niranjani Akhara, Prayagraj (on Monday) is illegal and has no recognition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/new-abap-president-backs-bjp-wants-yogi-as-uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-again-101635168306838.html

On Monday, NCB officials said a three-member panel led by the agency’s chief vigilance officer and deputy director general Gyaneshwar Singh will inquire into the allegations.Prabhakar Sail, who claimed to have worked as a bodyguard of KP Gosavi who was seen with federal drugs enforcement agency officials at the October 3 raid on a cruise ship, also said in a notarised affidavit that he was forced to sign blank papers on that night.Gosavi, one of the witnesses in the case, could not be contacted for his comments. He is on the run and the Mumbai police, which have issued a lookout notice on him.Sail allegedly heard Gosavi and another person discussing an amount of ₹25 crore, out of which ₹8 crore was supposedly to be paid to a senior NCB official, he said in a notarised affidavit. Sail said he overheard Gosavi talking to someone by the name of Sam D’Souza on the phone after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office following the October 3 raid. Gosavi suggested that a demand of ₹25 crore be made which could be negotiated to ₹18 crore, as they “have to give ₹eight crore to Sameer Wankhede”, the zonal director of NCB.Wankhede has repeatedly rejected the charge since Sunday when the allegations first emerged. On Sunday, he told reporters that “we will give a befitting reply” to the allegations, and wrote to Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to request that no precipitate legal action is carried out with ulterior motives to frame him. NCB sleuths on October 2 conducted searches at the International Cruise Terminal at Green Gate in Mumbai and apprehended several individuals set to board Cordelia cruise leaving for a holiday cruise to Goa, including Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha for possession and consumption of banned drugs.

Home minister Dilip Walse Patil said the same was done as sought by the witness.Earlier in the day, the NCB and Wankhede filed two separate affidavits before the special court against the allegations. The anti-drugs agency and Wankhede had urged the court to pass an order saying no court should take cognizance of the affidavit prepared by the independent witness, Prabhakar Sail.Also read | Ananya Panday not appearing today, has sought more time, says NCBAs per the NCB and its zonal director, the allegations made by Sail were only an attempt to create hurdles and scuttle the investigation into the case. The central agency had also sought the court to pass appropriate orders to ensure there is no tampering with the evidence or investigation in the case.Special judge VV Patil, designated to hear cases related to the NDPS Act, disposed of the affidavits, saying such blanket orders cannot be passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ndps-court-disposes-of-ncb-plea-against-interference-in-aryan-khan-case-101635167202541.html

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||BJP contesting on core issue of development: HP CM Jai Ram Thakur||The stakes are high for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur as the Mandi Lok Sabha and three assembly byelections on October 30 are being seen as a test of his popularity with Himachal Pradesh heading for elections next year. Despite issues such as unemployment and inflation besides infighting in the BJP, the CM is confident of the party continuing its winning run in the byelections, too. Excerpts: What is your government’s biggest achievement in the past four years? The BJP government has worked for the all-around development of the state in accordance with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Despite two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has ensured that the pace of progress is unhindered and development projects worth ₹4,200 crore have been inaugurated. We conceptualised the global investors’ meet in 2019 to reestablish Himachal Pradesh as a favoured investment destination We targeted an investment of ₹96,456 crore but the pandemic hit our plans. The BJP says you’re a double engine government but the opposition says it has failed. The opposition has always been critical and this may be its perception but the fact is the other way round. The Centre has been considerate towards the developmental demands of Himachal Pradesh. Projects worth crores sanctioned by it for the state are testimony to this. Do you see the elections as a litmus test? Will the outcome be a test of your popularity? There is no doubt that every election is crucial. Ultimately, the thing that matters is people’s verdict. We won the 2019 byelections, municipal corporation elections, panchayat elections and now we will win these byelections, too. There was infighting in the BJP over ticket allocation. Chetan Bragta rebelled, while former legislator Govind Ram, ex-MP Kripal Parmar refused to campaign. Indiscipline in the party won’t be tolerated. The high command has taken a serious view. After the bypolls, the party will gear up for the assembly elections. The party is preparing a report and those involved in indiscipline will be taken to task. The Congress has accused the BJP of deflecting attention from the core issues of rising prices, unemployment and corruption. The Congress is a leaderless, issueless and directionless party whose base is eroding. Everyone wants to be its supreme leader. The BJP is contesting these elections on the core issue of development. Unemployment is a global issue. Inflation is not happening for the first time. Covid has impacted world economies. The central and state governments are trying to bail out people from this situation. Our government is giving relief to the common man whether it’s through the public distribution system or subsidised ration. The Union health ministry has warned eight states, including Himachal Pradesh, of a Covid-19 surge due to rallies, festivals and reopening of schools. How is the government dealing with this situation? The state government is aware of the situation and taking preventive and safety measures. People are being motivated to adhere to the safety protocol. We have been holding smaller gatherings. Besides, we have achieved 100% target of vaccinating people above 18 years with the first dose and aiming at full vaccination by November-end. I seek a feedback from the health department on the Covid situation daily. There have been talks of a change in leadership in the state. Do you see yourself as completing the five-year term? This is a hypothetical question. It is a wish of a handful of people who want me to go but that won’t happen. The BJP government will be re-elected in 2022 as well. The people have given a massive mandate to the BJP in the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda and home minister Amit Shah have reposed full faith in me.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-contesting-on-core-issue-of-development-hp-cm-jai-ram-thakur-101635166206814.html
25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Oases of wit and humour in the desert of banking||When I landed in the desert of a banking job after flying for a while on the wings of literary aspirations, I felt a bit parched and suffocated. As the official correspondence was dominated by clichéd expressions and hackneyed phrases, providing little scope for giving vent to one’s flair for writing or witty self-expression, I resigned myself to the dreary banking life and routine officialese. But during my long career, I did come across, though not very often, some pen-pushers who used their pungent wit or humorous turn of phrase wherever they could find an occasion. A few juicy instances still stand out in memory even after 12 years of retirement. Once, during my posting at the zonal office of the bank, I dealt with the sanctions for expenditures incurred by the branches. Those days, we did not usually give permission for the use of taxi for carrying cash from one branch to another and insisted that the ordinary bus be used instead. But a branch manager pleaded his case with such a witty metaphor that I could not help but allow him the use of a taxi. He had written, “The buses are so crowded that it’s difficult to keep one’s body and soul together not to speak of the gun and the cash box by the guard.” In another instance, we received a request for permission to purchase furniture and fixtures for a newly opened branch and also for its manager’s residence. It included the requisition for six ceiling fans and four pedestal fans. As happens in most zonal offices, such requests are not acceded to in the first instance. Thus, a routine query was mailed to the branch, “Please specify where these fans will be used.” We wanted to ascertain how many of these fans would be used in the branch premises and how many at the manager’s residence. But the manager wrote back, perhaps with his tongue discreetly in his cheek, “Sir, the ceiling fans will be used on ceilings and the pedestal ones on pedestals.” Simple and harmless enough but laced with caustic wit! Sometimes, senior executives are also caught off guard. They become a butt of a joke and cause an amusing repartee. Once, a note for payment of gratuity and terminal benefits of an employee of the bank was put up for sanction before the chief general manager. The case was that of a deceased employee, but the CGM, taking it for a routine retirement case, wrote a remark in red ink as to why such claims are not processed at least six months in advance. The officer down the ladder could not digest the remark and wrote back, apparently in an attempt to clear the misunderstanding, “Sir, we would have prepared the papers in advance, but the employee failed to provide us with the intimation of his premature death well in time.” I don’t know whether this reply reached the CGM’s table or not, but whoever read it on the way could not suppress a smile. My most treasured piece in this context is an unusual compliment paid to me by my boss. Noticing my aptitude for detecting grammatical or syntactical slips and correcting them, he used to send to me various drafts for approval before finalizing them. Once when I spotted yet another glaring but not so easily noticeable mistake in the draft, he wrote on the margin, “Mr Parmar, these days you are doing better than VVS Laxman!” It took me some time to realise what he actually meant. VVS Laxman had the reputation of being one of the best slip fielders in the Indian cricket team those days. parmar.ranbir@gmail.com The writer is a Shimla-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oases-of-wit-and-humour-in-the-desert-of-banking-101635165006448.html

If the government does not do it, parties decided that a session of Vidhan Sabha be called over this,” ANI quoted CM Channi as saying after the all-party meeting."As this is a matter related to Punjab and Punjabis, and because law and order is a state subject and it's like a raid on our rights in the federal structure, all political parties in Punjab will come together in the fight to make Centre withdraw the notification,” he also said.Also read | Mamata says Centre's BSF move meant to hurt federal structure, borders peacefulBriefing on his government’s plan of action against the extension of BSF’s jurisdiction, Channi said that the Punjab assembly would be convened in the next 10 or 15 days and a resolution against the notification would be passed. He also said that a resolution against the three contentious farm laws would also be passed during the session.The chief minister said that the state government would approach the Supreme Court regarding the matter. “Political parties will hold agitations against the extension of BSF jurisdiction in Punjab. We will also approach the Supreme Court seeking justice in this matter,” he added.Earlier on Monday, leaders from various political parties such as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) attended the meeting in Punjab convened by Channi.

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||2015 ‘bir’ theft case: Production warrant issued to ‘arrest’ Ram Rahim||Over a year after jailed Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was named accused in a case connected with the Bargari sacrilege, a Faridkot court on Monday issued a production warrant against him for October 29.Punjab police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases on Monday moved an application in the court of judicial magistrate Tarjani seeking a production warrant of Ram Rahim for his ‘arrest’ in a case of sacrilege wherein a ‘bir’ of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of Faridkot district on June 1, 2015.SIT-led by inspector general of police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar has said in its plea filed in the court of the judicial magistrate that the statement of a witness Pardeep Kumar and the evidence came forward in the investigation conducted by SIT is enough for the arrest of the Ram Rahim in the case of theft of a bir (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. “The production warrant of Ram Rahim, who is currently lodged in Sunaria jail at Rohtak, is required so he can be produced in the court and formally arrested in the case,” the plea reads. Judicial magistrate Tarjani directed the SIT to produce Ram Rahim in the court before or on October 29. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera followers in a case pertaining to the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of the Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala in 2015, the SIT, led by former inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra, had named Ram Rahim and the dera’s three national committee members—Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri— as accused. The ‘bir’ was stolen from the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, which had caused outrage across the state and the death of two Sikh protesters in police firing. The SIT in its chargesheet had claimed that it was Ram Rahim who had ordered the sacrilege after a Sikh preacher had insulted his followers. “Some dera followers arrested in connection with the sacrilege case revealed that Mohinderpal Singh Bittu, who was killed in a Nabha jail in 2019, told them that the sacrilege was executed at the behest of the dera chief. During a diwan (religious congregation) on March 22, 2015, Harjinder Singh Manjhi, a Sikh preacher, asked some dera followers to remove their lockets or leave. Bittu raised the issue with Bareta, Kler and Dhuri, who saw it as an act of sacrilege and decided to take revenge. The sacrilege conspiracy was hatched thereafter,” the SIT chargesheet says.  SIT probing police firing failed to quiz Ram Rahim In April 2019, the SIT probing the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases had also secured orders from a Faridkot court to question Ram Rahim. However, the Sunaria jail authorities refused to let the team meet the dera head saying that permission had not been taken from the deputy commissioner. In June 2019, the SIT finally got permission from the Haryana government for questioning the dera head in jail. However, the SIT-led by retired inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh never went to question Ram Rahim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-bir-theft-case-sit-seeks-production-warrant-to-arrest-ram-rahim-101635164526314.html
25-10-2021||Jaipur||Petrol pumps in 8 Rajasthan districts on indefinite strike to demand lower VAT||JAIPUR: Nearly 1,500 petrol pumps in eight districts of Rajasthan close to the state’s borders with Haryana and Punjab on Monday went on an indefinite strike on Monday to demand that the state government reduce the 6 percentage point increase in value-added tax (VAT) on diesel during the Covid-19 pandemic starting March 2020.The petrol pump dealers have also sought a ban on the sale of illegally sourced and smuggled diesel from neighbouring states, base oil or paraffin in form of biodiesel in the division, one-state-one-price for fuel, lower VAT rate on the lines of Punjab and Haryana, and reduction in the storage limit for farmers from 2,500 litres to 1,000 litres.Because of the levies, petrol and diesel are sold in Sri Ganganagar, the state’s northernmost district, for ₹120 per litre and diesel at ₹108 per litre, said chairman, steering committee of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealer Association, Rajendra Singh Bhati.“Our protest will continue till our demands are met,” he said. Bhati said over 1,500 petrol pumps in eight districts, Bikaner, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Churu, Pali, Barmer, Jalore and Jhunjhunu, remained closed on Monday. Besides, some pumps in two districts, Nagaur and Jaisalmer, also participated in the strike.He said these eight districts generate revenue of ₹32 crore per day for the state. Bhati said petrol pump owners lost out due to the high taxes because of smuggling from Punjab and Haryana, where state taxes are much lower. “Several pumps in these eight districts had to shut because of drop in sales,” he claimed. As a result of the levies and transportation charges, petrol and diesel in Churu on Monday were priced at ₹116.80 per litre and ₹107.88 per litre respectively, as compared to ₹108.45 per litre (petrol) and ₹98.36 per litre (diesel) in Punjab’s Bathinda, and ₹109.26 (petrol) and ₹98.05 (diesel) in Haryana’s Sirsa.Bhati said the existing limit allowing people to store up to 2,500 litres of diesel for farming was being abused, and used to smuggle the fuel from neighbouring states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/petrol-pumps-in-8-rajasthan-districts-on-indefinite-strike-to-demand-lower-vat-101635163926545.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||A need for designing better closures for eye drops bottles||Ophthalmic solutions or eye drops are probably one of the most fast moving pharmaceutical products. You buy them to treat a variety of viral and bacterial eye infections, irritations, allergies and dry eyes. They are also used for treating eye injuries, before testing your eyes and before and after eye surgery. However, consumer complaints indicate that the quality as well as the design of closures used in containers of eye drops and even ear drops leave much to be desired. In fact, flawed closures have raised issues of safety and also economy of use, thereby calling for urgent intervention by the drug control authorities.The container closure system, including the seal , the outer cap and the solution dispensing nozzle, play an extremely important role in maintaining the sterility of the solution within and preventing their contamination during use. So a good quality closure system not only has to ensure these, but also regulate the volume of the eye drops dispensed to prevent wastage and also ensure ease of use. It’s extremely important to ensure that the closures meet all these requirements.Most of these closure systems consist of a cap covering the dispenser unit, with an attached seal ring or ‘tamper-evident’ seal at the bottom. When you first unscrew the cap, you automatically break the seal, thereby separating the ring from the cap. Sometimes this ring may break and fall off on its own. But most of the time , you have to remove the cap and then the ring, put the cap back and apply adequate torque, so that the spike underneath the cap pierces the dropper tip and makes a small hole through which the liquid comes out in drops.Consumer complaints reveal that the biggest problem with this closure is the poor quality of the piercing mechanism. Sometimes either the barb is not sharp or long enough to pierce the nozzle or there is some cap tube misalignment that prevents the spike from making an aperture, thereby denying access to the medicine. What makes matters worse is the refusal of chemists to change such bottles on the ground that the consumer has broken the seal. What they fail to understand is that such bottles are defective and need to be replaced and the defect reported to the drug company and the regulator.A consumer recently told me that in desperation, he tried to pierce a hole by heating a needle and plunging it into the tip of the nozzle. However, to his horror, the plastic melted from the heat and he was not sure if that had contaminated the solution- so he had to throw away the bottle. A defect such as this is a safety hazard, if the consumer is forced to pierce a hole, thereby contaminating the solution. This problem, from all accounts, exists in bottles that have closures without seals too.Even where the spike works and makes an aperture in the nozzle, consumers say that they often have to use considerable force to twist and turn the cap and succeed only after several attempts. Considering that many senior citizens use several of these solutions following a cataract operation and may not have very strong or dexterous fingers, this is a very serious flaw and needs to be rectified. In fact the closure system needs to be simplified to ensure breaking of the ‘tamper evident’ seal and opening of the nozzle in one simple easy step.Consumers also report on the variations in the way the dispenser releases the medication. While with some bottles, the drops fall in quick succession, wasting medication, and in some others, it is so slow that by the time it drops, you would have blinked and closed your eyes. The volume is also often much more than the eye can hold. Given the steep price of these medications, the drug control authority really needs to ensure that the bottle, the nozzle design and the size of the aperture ensure proper control over the volume as well as the speed of dispensation.In fact, several studies around the world have focused on the need to reduce the drop volume of the medication, so as to bring down the cost, particularly for those on long term medication, such as glaucoma patients. A study on the topic published in the Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology and Research in 2011 ( Shiva Kumar et al) for example, concluded that “a drop size greater than 25 μL (microliter) will cause wastage of the medication and unnecessary expenses to the patient. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the maximal tear film concentration can be achieved with a drop of 20 μL. While increasing the eye drop’s size beyond this does not increase efficacy, reducing the eye drop’s size will decrease wastage.”It’s time the drug regulator looked closely at these issues and ensured better quality of closures to ensure safety, efficacy and economy of use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-need-for-designing-better-closures-for-eye-drops-bottles-101635161705678.html
25-10-2021||Kolkata||‘Prepare to reopen schools, colleges from Nov 16’: Banerjee tells officials||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday asked officials to prepare for the reopening of schools and colleges from November 16. “Let schools and colleges reopen from November 16. Make arrangements so that all institutions are sanitised before that,” Banerjee told chief secretary H K Dwivedi at a meeting in Siliguri during her five-day North Bengal tour. Banerjee said educational institutes will reopen for students from class 9 onwards. The rest will remain closed for now. Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das welcomed the decision. “I do not think virtual education can replace physical classes.”Educational institutions in Bengal have been closed for around 18 months because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Banerjee had earlier said they will reopen after the Durga Puja but did not announce a date. On Monday, she said the reopening should take place after Jagatdhatri Puja on November 13.Kunal Sarkar, a doctor, said education has suffered a lot because of the prolonged closure of schools and colleges. “This was necessary. However, people of the state, who showed little regard for health protocols during Durga Puja festivities, must act responsibly.”The final examinations of the West Bengal government’s secondary and higher secondary boards were held in June. The syllabi were reduced by over 30% and qualifying examinations for both tests were done away with.Ranjana Roychaudhury, the headteacher of Manimala High School in Asansol, said the safety of students would be ensured if classes for are held on alternate days. “Mentally we are ready to reopen the school. We have around 900 students. To avoid crowding, it would be better if the classes for various sections are held on alternate days. This is a suggestion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/prepare-to-reopen-schools-colleges-from-nov-16-banerjee-tells-officials-101635160628342.html
25-10-2021||Pune||Countdown to PMC polls: Traffic, lack of parking, poor water supply are Shivajinagar’s major woes||PUNE Around five decades ago when the city was largely limited to the peth areas, it used to boast two clean rivers passing through Shivajinagar. With rapid urbanisation and the city’s inability to prevent sewage from entering the Mutha and the Mula rivers at their confluence in Sangamwadi, the Mula-Mutha today is essentially a “nullah”.Welcome to Shivajinagar – an area that covers Ghole road, Aundh and the Kasba peth ward offices of the PMC. Deccan, Prabhat road, Erandwane, and the University road are also part of the Sivajinagar area. The commercial development of these areas has seen traffic and a lack of parking become major civic challenges.For other areas like and Aundh, where the population is largely the IT workforce, given its proximity to the Hinjewadi IT Park, frequent power cuts and water scarcity is a problem. According to Anup Shitole, a 38-year-old IT professional, the traffic at Savitraibai Phule Pune University (SPPU) chowk has been a mess even when there was no flyover, after its construction and now when it has been demolished. “After demolishing the flyover at University chowk, we believed that traffic will be smooth, but it is not happening. In fact it has only worsened,” said Shitole, a resident of the area. The main reason for a delay in the construction of the flyover is the proposed Metro work between Shivajinagar and Hinjewadi that passes through the same stretch. Multilevel flyover at SPPU chowk The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), which is executing the Metro project on this stretch, has already prepared a design for a multilevel flyover at SPPU chowk on Ganeshkhind road and submitted it to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The PMRDA has demanded that PMC should share some cost of this flyover, though it is getting built along a Metro line. The flyover was demolished last year during the national lockdown with the promise of a new one to come up immediately. The slow pace of the Metro rail project between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar may now further delay the flyover. Residents from several areas under Shivajinagar will be beneficiaries of two other Metro lines – Swargate-Nigdi and Kothrud-Ramwadi. These two lines also pass through Shivajinagar, where a multi-modal hub is coming up and work has been expedited. Maha-Metro plans to operationalise two stretches on these two lines by the end of this year. Parking has been a major issue in this area, that has seen drastic commercialisation with banks and restaurants coming up in various areas in the past decade. Bylanes provide the parking which in turns causes an inconvenience to those residing there. Sanjay Upsani, working with automobile firm and a resident of Deep Bungalow chowk said, “Traffic is the main issue here for which neither PMC nor the police have done anything. With so many youngsters flocking around on bikes and cars, the problem has intensified.” The area has some prominent educational institutions like Fergusson College, BMCC, SPPU and the Agriculture college, besides the Pune courts, MSTRC bus stop and a railway station. Due to this, the constant inflow of people coming from other parts of city is high, which often results in traffic chaos. Even as wards under Shivajinagar are the heart of the city, there is a mix of new and old areas, with water shortages also an issue. With water coming in at low pressure, many have installed pumps to draw more water from the pipelines. According to locals, areas like Model Colony, FC road, Gokhale nagar and Bopodi have been facing water problems. Even though municipal commissioner’s official residence is in Model Colony, it has also been facing a water problem. The water issueOn the political front, all 12 corporators representing various wards under Shivajinagar are from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). These corporators have accepted that water scarcity in the heart of the city is acute. However, the 24x7 water scheme is being cited as the solution. Citizens don’t agree. “I live in Model Colony and water shortage is almost a daily problem here. I am doubtful about claims being made that post implementation of 24x7 water scheme, the issue will be resolved,” said Omkar Natu, 32 year old management executive working with a bank. Besides the areas mentioned above, Bopodi, Khadki, the old Mumbai-Pune highway, Wakadewadi, Patil estate, Shivajjinagar and Deccan also fall under this constituency. Most of these areas have seen some widened footpaths and better roads. Snehal Shah, 27-year-old medical professional said, “JM and FC roads are really good for pedestrians. At the same time there is an issue of encroachments. Also the e-toilets installed by PMC are not functioning.” All the credit, all the blameCredit for all projects implemented in various parts of Shivajinagar goes to the BJP, as does the blame for failed projects. Opposition parties claim that apart from the Metro, the BJP have nothing substantial to show. NCP leader Nilesh Nikam said, “Despite having clear mandate, BJP has failed to deliver. Some of the busiest roads fall under Shivajinagar, but in the name of ‘smart’ roads, PMC has actually reduced the carriageway leading to traffic jams.” Congress leader Datta Bahirat, who a runner-up in the assembly elections, said, “Check the budget for each member and work carried out by them. We plan to publish a report card very soon.” The BJP MLA and PMC corporator from the area Siddharth Shirole hits back: “During last five years, we ensured that all the mega projects have been fast tracked. All the land required for the metro project is getting handed over. Work on Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar Metro will start on the ground by December.

This year was no exception, except there were two groups with the same cause. They gathered on different days holding placards seeking justice to the rationalist. Like every year, Dabholkar’s friends gathered here to rededicate themselves to carrying forward his work and strengthening the movement.Dabholkar, the genial doctor, social activist, rationalist, writer and editor, was the face of the anti-superstition movement in Maharashtra for more than two decades. As the Dabholkar case has now reached the stage of the trial in Pune court, his supporters and all those who believe in the cause he took up can find a partial solace. After all, the investigation into his murder has on previous occasions meandered, while moving at snail’s pace. Earlier this month, the prosecution submitted a list of 32 witnesses for examination during the trial before the special court which has posted the matter for October 29 for a much-awaited trial.The yearly scene at Ramji Shinde bridge near Balgandharva, the place where Dabholkar was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen on August 20, 2013, may not be reminiscent of protests during the criminal trial at Los Angeles County Superior Court involving OJ Simpson but the two cases have something in similar if not everything.On the evening of June 12, 1994, former National Football League player Simpson’s ex-wife Nicole Browne Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were found stabbed to death. The subsequent arrest of Simpson and the trial afterwards turned the case into black versus white, shown effectively through the crime television series – American crime story – on Netflix. Simpson’s lawyers used his arrest and hearing as “another instance of implicating”, dividing opinion among America’s black and white communities.Back home, the arrests of right-wing outfit Sanatan Sanstha members in the anti-superstition crusader’s murder hasn’t pleased many left-leaning activists as the case has completed eight years recently. They believe the real mastermind of the Dabholkar murder is still at large and the probe agency has been delaying the arrest of the kingpin. On the other hand, Hindutva organisations including Sanatan Sanstha has refuted their role in the killing saying they are being targeted by the government – the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which arrested these men comes under the Centre which is controlled by the rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Narendra Modi since 2014.So far, CBI has arrested eight people, including two alleged shooters Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar. The central probe agency, however, had to change its theory about shooters, who according to CBI’s earlier chargesheet were Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar.Most of these arrests, which came after pressure from the high court, may have helped move the case in court, but those working in the field of anti-superstition aren’t convinced about the progress. After Dabholkar, three other rationalists – Govind Pansare, MM Kalburgi, Gauri Lankesh – were similarly shot dead. Multiple agencies grappled with Dabholkar’s case: the Pune Police formed 30 teams, the crime branch first arrested two men, who were then let off, before finally, the CBI took over in May 2014.All this while, the movement against superstition has received larger attention after Dabholkar’s murder. From less than 2,000 workers, mainly from Maharashtra, a few years ago, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), the organisation Dabholkar founded in the late 1980s, now has over 6,000 registered members from across the country spreading his message of scientific temper.However, it also saw schism as cracks developed between members of the Dabholkar family and those running MANS, which he co-founded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-narendra-dabholkar-murder-case-now-at-trial-stage-justice-for-rationalist-in-sight-101635158765993.html
25-10-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls happening because Nitish govt didn't provide treatment to his MLAs: Tejashwi Yadav||Ahead of By-polls in Bihar, Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Yadav on Monday slammed Chief Minister and JD-U President Nitish Kumar over "poor health facilities" in Bihar and alleged that the need to conduct by-polls has arisen because Kumar could not provide proper medical treatment to the MLAs of his own party.Speaking to reporters here today, the RJD leader said, "In the NITI Aayog report, Bihar is the worst-performing state in Health. These by-elections are happening because CM Nitish Kumar's government didn't provide treatment even to their MLAs. So on what basis will Nitish Kumar ask for votes from the public."The RJD leader further alleged that both the MLAs died because of the bad medical facilities in the state.He said, "By-elections are being held in both the places because of bad arrangements of the government during the COVID period. Because of that, all those people were admitted to the private hospital. Mevalal Choudhary died while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Patna and Shashi Bhushan Hazari went to Delhi for treatment."The Election Commission of India, earlier on September 28, announced by-polls for three parliamentary and 30 assembly seats across 15 states and Union territories (UTs) in the country. Voting for the By-elections in Kusheshwar Asthan (SC) and Tarapur assembly constituencies in Bihar will take place on October 30, while the counting of votes and announcement of results will be on November 2.The Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats had fallen vacant following the death of sitting MLAs Mewalal Choudhary and Shashibhushan Hazari, respectively.Claiming that people have lost faith in the current Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in Bihar, Tejashwi further expressed confidence that RJD candidates will win from both seats."In the last election, the NDA government promised to give 19 lakh jobs to people. How many people got jobs? So on what basis will Nitish Kumar ask for votes from the public? We have visited each and every village and panchayat of the district and people are worried, they have lost faith in the state government. We have full faith that people are with us and RJD candidates will win from both Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur," he added.The RJD leader further alleged that Nitish Kumar is running the state for the past 15 years, yet there is no development in Bihar, adding that people in the state are complaining about the inflation and bad conditions of roads."He is running the state for the last 15 years but there is no development in the state. People showed faith in Nitish Kumar but today people are worried now. They are complaining about the inflation and bad condition of roads," said the RJD leader.He also challenged Nitish Kumar to take a road trip in all the three blocks of Kusheshwarsthan."I challenge Nitish Kumar to take road trip in all the three blocks of Kusheshwarsthan. We do not say that one should not campaign by helicopter. Due to lack of time, people campaign through helicopter, but being a chief minister he should visit villages to see the developments," he added.Voting for the by-polls will take place from 6 am to 7.30 pm on October 30.Meanwhile, the Election Commission had banned the dissemination of opinion and exit polls results before the 48-hours period till the polling ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-happening-because-nitish-govt-didn-t-provide-treatment-to-his-mlas-tejashwi-yadav-101635155120847.html

Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede retired as Senior Police Inspector of State Excise Department, Pune on 30.06.2007. My father is a Hindu and my mother Late Mrs. Zaheeda was a Muslim,” he said.Also read | Aryan Khan case: Being targeted because of my dead mother, says Sameer WankhedeThe NCB zonal director in Mumbai also listed both his marriages in the press release. “Further, I married Dr. Shabana Qureshi in 2006 in a civil marriage ceremony under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Both of as divorced mutually through Civil Court under the Special Marriage Act in the year 2016. Later in the year 2017, I married Shrimati Kranti Dinanath Redkar,” he added.“The publishing of my personal documents on Twitter is defamatory in nature and unnecessary invasion of my family privacy.

Wankhede in his affidavit refuted the allegations levelled against him and claimed he was under a "lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interests for conducting an honest and impartial investigation".Wankhede also claimed that he was being personally targeted by a well-known political figure and the only reason he can fathom is that the NCB arrested "this person's son-in-law Sameer Khan". Sameer Khan is the son-in-law of Nawab Malik.On Sunday, the NCB official also wrote to Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, seeking protection from likely legal action "being planned" against him by unknown persons to falsely frame him concerning an alleged vigilance related issue.Also read | NCB replies to 'extortion' allegation, Nawab Malik says SIT should probeWankhede, without naming anyone, claimed that the threat of jail and dismissal have been issued against him publically by highly respectable public functionaries.An NCB team led by Wankhede earlier this month allegedly seized drugs onboard a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast following which Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3.

25-10-2021||Kolkata||Containment zones back in Bengal as Covid-19 cases shoot up after Durga puja||With the daily count of Covid-19 cases shooting up in West Bengal once again after the festive season, the state administration has started re-introducing containment zones to check the spread of the virus and prevent a possible third wave. Containment zones have already come up in Howrah and North 24 Parganas, the districts with the highest number of daily cases after Kolkata. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation is likely to decide on the matter on Monday. Barely 10 days have gone since the Durga puja, the biggest festival in the state, ended in West Bengal and the daily count of Covid-19 cases is again hovering around the 1000-mark, after a gap of more than three months. “While 974 new cases were detected in the state on Saturday, on Sunday, the number shot up further to 989. Such a high number of cases was last detected in July this year when the second wave was on the decline,” said a senior health department official. The positivity rate has been steadily going up in the state as well. While the positivity rate on September 24 was 1.7% it shot up to 2.1% on October 10. On Sunday, it was 2.3%. Even though the puja started on October 11, the festivity and shopping started much before. “Under such circumstances, the state government and district administrations have decided to bring in the containment zones. The night curfew, from 11 pm to 5 am, which was lifted during the puja, has been imposed again,” said a senior government official. Already 56 containment zones have been declared in North 24 Parganas. In Howrah, 14 such zones have been introduced. On Sunday, while Kolkata reported 273 new cases, the highest number of fresh Covid-19 cases among other districts in the state, North 24 Parganas registered 146 cases. Howrah registered 83 cases. South 24 Parganas, which shares its borders with Kolkata, recorded 74 cases while Hooghly reported 89 cases. Health experts have been blaming the rise in Covid-19 cases on the huge gatherings during the Durga puja and rampant violations of safety norms. “During the puja days there were huge gatherings outside pandals and people from Kolkata and outskirts hit the streets in thousands. Covid-19 protocols were rampantly violated,” said Dr Manas Gumta, general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. Experts earlier warned that at least two weeks following the Durga puja would be crucial to check the spread of the virus and prevent a possible third wave. “Covid-19 safety protocols were rampantly flouted during the festive season. Many were not wearing masks, leaving aside social distancing and sanitizing. Two weeks following the puja would be very crucial,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee that was set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/containment-zones-back-in-west-bengal-as-covid-19-cases-shoot-up-after-durga-puja-101635136265530.html

25-10-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s death toll breaches 140k mark, amid dip in Covid fatalities||Even as Covid-19 deaths are on a steady decline, Maharashtra’s death toll breached the 140,000 mark, with its tally touching 140,016 on Sunday. Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 1,410 new Covid-19 cases and 18 deaths, official data showed.The first wave which started on March 9, 2020, and went up to February 9, saw 2,048,802 cases and 51,360 deaths. Against it, the second wave which continues has logged 88,656 deaths. Although fewer deaths and new cases have been reported in the past 24 days of October, the fatality rate has been high at 1.86%, as the number of deaths recorded during this period is 949 with 50,966 new cases. In contrast, the fatality rate in September for the first 24 days was 1.68 %, with 87,033 new cases and 1,463 deaths. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said, “A fatality rate of less than 2% indicates the virus is under control. In addition, we have been able to control the death rate as our focus is on critical cases. Even in case of new patients, we isolate and arrange instant medication.” Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said the death rate could have been much lower had the authorities been cautious after the first wave.“The authorities just dismantled the temporary infrastructure they had readied in the first wave and acted as if Covid-19 has disappeared. They should have used the period before the second wave to beef up the entire health infrastructure in anticipation of the second wave. The history of pandemics has shown there will be multiple waves, but all this was ignored,” said Shaikh. He even blamed the citizens, saying they took part in large gatherings after October last year and hardly wore a mask. Mumbai saw 400 new cases with six deaths.

Ananya was questioned by the agency on Friday for over four hours.Last Thursday, Ananya was questioned for more than two hours by the NCB in the drugs-on-cruise case after her name allegedly cropped up in WhatsApp chats during the agency's probe in the case in which Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and others have been arrested. An official speaking on condition of anonymity told Hindustan Times that Ananya maintained that she has never used any narcotics and the chats with Aryan Khan were in a light vein.On Wednesday, the NCB raided Ananya's house in Mumbai's Bandra before sending her a summon to appear before it later in the day to record her statement. The NCB officials seized her laptop and mobile phone during the raid. The actor then reached the NCB office along with her actor father Chunkey Pandey at around 4pm.Aryan Khan was arrested following a raid on a cruise ship anchored at the International Cruise Terminal in Mumbai on October 2. The cruise ship was on its way to Goa when NCB searched the guests and arrested Aryan, Arbaaz Merchant and others.Last Wednesday, a special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act denied bail to Aryan, saying there was prima facie evidence that he was indulging in “illicit drug activities” on a regular basis, and could commit a similar offence if released.Aryan is presently lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road central prison. His father Shah Rukh Khan met him at the prison last Thursday, the first time since his arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cruise-drugs-case-ananya-pandey-summoned-by-ncb-again-today-101635119530742.html
25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir, Sidhu slug it out over village land auction in Mohali||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday hit out at former health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu for “facilitating forcible takeover of prime village land in Mohali for construction of a private hospital”.Participating in a dharna in Barri village, along with senior party leader and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, Badal said shamlat lands in Punjab were under capture of the Congress government.He said it was shocking that the government was planning to lease prime land worth ₹90 crore for 33 years at ₹1 lakh per year. “I have learnt that the entire gram sabha is against the move. The sarpanch even showed me a video in which Balbir Sidhu is seen pressuring the villagers to facilitate establishment of the hospital,” he said. On the other hand, Sidhu said SAD only wanted to make headlines in newspapers ahead of the Progressive Punjab Investors’ Summit on October 26-27, and scare investors away.The former health minister said the land in Barri village was being leased for a world-class health facility. “But Akali leaders are blatantly betraying the interests of Punjab and Punjabis. Chandumajra has incited villagers against the land lease on flimsy grounds and now he had misled Badal to oppose the open bid slated on Monday, only to fulfil his narrow political interests and personal ambitions,” Sidhu said.Sidhu appealed to the chief minister, panchayat department and district officers to go ahead with the open bid scheduled on Monday, keeping in view the interests of the state and to convey the right message to investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-sidhu-slug-it-out-over-village-land-auction-in-mohali-101635111492238.html

Speaking about this, IMD Chandigarh director Manmohan Singh said, “The Western Disturbance (WD) was weak on Saturday, but strengthened between Saturday night and Sunday. It was able to receive a good amount of moisture from the Arabian Sea.”Mercury drops to all-time lowest in OctoberFollowing the rain, the maximum temperature plunged from 31.1°C on Saturday to 19.3°C on Sunday, 12 degrees below normal and the lowest ever in October, as per IMD officials.“According to IMD data in Chandigarh, the maximum temperature hasn’t gone below 20°C in the city in October, ever since measurements were recorded,” they said.With this, Chandigarh also became colder than Solan in Himachal Pradesh, where the day temperature was 20°C, and was close to the 18.8°C temperature in Dharamshala.“Due to the WD active in the region, the cloud cover blocked the sunlight. Also, there was fresh snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, which brought cold winds to the city, causing the temperature to drop,” said Singh, adding that the WD is likely to cross the city by Monday, which will bring back clear skies.With this, the maximum temperature is expected to jump by at least 6-7 degrees and rise further in the coming days.Meanwhile, the minimum temperature dropped from 19.6 °C on Saturday to 16.2°C on Sunday.

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Dakshin Marg most dangerous road in Chandigarh for third straight year||For the third year in a row, Dakshin Marg continues to be the most dangerous road in the city, according to the Road Safety in Chandigarh 2020 report released by the traffic police.As per the reports’ findings, the number of fatalities halved between 2019 and 2020, and the number of black spots also went down from 14 to four.However, all four of these spots are situated on Dakshin Marg, one after the other on National Highway-5, going from Tribune Chowk towards Zirakpur, and covering a length of around 5km.Starting from the Sectors 25/38 light point in the west, Dakshin Marg traverses the whole width of the city, before ending at the road connecting to the Zirakpur-Ambala highway.The Union ministry of road transport and highways defines black spots as a road stretch of about 500m where either five road crashes, involving fatalities and grievous injuries, or 10 fatalities took place during the last three years. Among these four black spots, Tribune Chowk was the most dangerous with seven fatal accidents.The other three – Airport light point, Poultry Farm Chowk and Hallomajra light point – saw six fatal accidents each. All these four points were also among the 14 black spots identified in Chandigarh in 2019.Punjab traffic adviser Navdeep Asija, whose team also worked on this report, said, “Data shows that the Sector 32 GMCH Chowk, on the same stretch of Dakshin Marg, has continued to remain without fatal accidents, but the four intersections after it are all black spots. This is because of the presence of speed tables on this intersection, which forces vehicles to stop. Rather than looking at flashy solutions, like the Tribune flyover, which will lead to further problems, simple traffic control mechanisms like this are needed to control traffic at Tribune Chowk.” According to a recent daily traffic flow study by the administration, as many as 1,43,170 vehicles, including 1,35,805 passenger car units, ply via Tribune Chowk over 16 hours.Six vulnerable stretches also identifiedThe traffic police also identified six vulnerable stretches in the city, which don’t meet the criteria for black spots, but still have seen numerous accidents, both fatal and non-fatal. Most of these were earlier black spots.Among these, three spots – the Sector 46/47-48/49 light point, Transport light point and Railway Station light point, had 10 crashes each, including a total of 10 fatalities.As many as nine accidents took place at the Kalagram and Sector 25/38 light point, with loss of nine lives, while six crashes were reported at the Sector 16/23 small roundabout, where four people died.Speaking about this, member of National Road Safety Council, Kamaljeet Singh Soi said, “Vulnerable spots are also important as commuters are at risk of accidents here. The authorities must conduct studies to prevent these areas from turning into black spots.”Meanwhile, the traffic police have increased deployment around black spots to manage the traffic in a better manner.Senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic) Manisha Choudhary said, “The road accident analysis cell of the Children’s Traffic Park visits every accident spot to find out why the mishaps happened and suggests corrective action. Night nakas are also set up in accident-prone areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dakshin-marg-most-dangerous-road-in-chandigarh-for-third-straight-year-101635111483473.html

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||As trains get back on track, Ludhiana sees a rise in railway deaths||With 200 of the total 228 trains starting or passing through Ludhiana railway station getting back on track amid the easing of Covid restrictions, the number of deaths on tracks, especially suicides, is also beginning to see a rise in Ludhiana. As per the data provided by railway officials, as many as 190 persons have lost their lives on railway tracks in Ludhiana till October 20 this year. Last year, when passenger trains were suspended owing to the pandemic outbreak, the figure stood at 169. According to officials most of these accidents happened with goods trains that were operational amid Covid. In 2019, the number of deaths on tracks was 348, which is more than double the figure recorded in 2020. In all three years, the maximum deaths were caused by railway accidents (see box). In 2019, the second common cause was natural deaths. In 2020 and 2021, suicides accounted for the second common reason for deaths on tracks. While in 2020, the number of railway suicides stood at 35, the mark has already been breached this year in just 10 months. In January this year, a single suicide was reported on the railway tracks in Ludhiana while in February, the figure shot up to eight and later went down to three in March. As normalcy was restored in April, the month recorded four deaths by suicide, followed by two in May, four in June, six in July, nine in August, three in September and five in the first 20 days of October. With regards to railway accidents, Ludhiana has seen a total of 124 deaths till October 20, most of it occurring when people were crossing the tracks. Inspector Jaskaran Singh, Government Railway Police, Ludhiana, said that most of the railway accident victims are migrant labourers. “These migrants work in factories near the station and sometimes relieve themselves on the tracks, which puts them at risk of being run over by a train. Other than this, people tend to cross the tracks with earphones plugged in, which also lead to accidents. Now most of the trains are electrical and don’t make noise like the diesel ones which used to ply earlier. With earphones plugged in, most are not able to hear the sound of the train and end up losing their lives while crossing the tracks,” said Jaskaran. Another senior official said that the number of suicides has also increased due to the immense mental strain brought about by the pandemic. “A lot of people are losing their jobs and facing financial difficulties. This pushes them over the edge and compels them to take the extreme step,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-trains-get-back-on-track-ludhiana-sees-a-rise-in-railway-deaths-101635108002531.html

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Heartbreak for cricket fans in Chandigarh as Pak thrash India in T20 World Cup tie||For hardcore cricket fan Prakriti Malhotra, Pakistan’s win over India in the ICC T20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday night came as a heartbreak. The thumping 10-wicket win brought the spotlight on the Pakistan team as they won a World Cup match against India for the first time ever. Before this game, India had never lost to their arch-rivals in either ODI or T20 World Cup games.The loss dampened the festivities in the tricity as cricket fans were left disappointed.“I was really excited about the India-Pakistan game and decided to watch it with my family at home. I was fasting also during India’s batting, but I was hopeful that India would post over 170 runs. Although the wicket was not easy to play, 151 runs were not enough for a determined Pakistan team. I now want India to win all other World Cup matches and reach the final. I am a bit thrilled due to Karva Chauth festivities, but India’s loss spoiled my mood,” said 27-year-old Prakriti, a Panchkula-based entrepreneur. India posted 151 runs batting first with captain Virat Kohli making the highest 57 runs. Pakistan chased the target in 17.5 overs.India’s top order was rocked by Pakistan pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, who claimed three wickets to put pressure on Indian batsmen. The lanky bowler took wickets of Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Kohli.“Pakistan came with a positive frame of mind and their bowlers bowled well. I was hoping to end my Sunday on a happy note and if India had won, it would have been an ideal start for them. All credit goes to the Pakistan team for putting up a disciplined show. This win would have lifted the spirits of cricket fans in Pakistan,” said a cricket fan, Pankaj Verma, 37. Last month, the New Zealand team called off their limited-overs tour citing security concerns while touring Pakistan. The decision had left the Pakistan cricket fraternity unimpressed.A lot of fans thronged local restaurants on Sunday evening to watch the much-anticipated match on big screens.“I made plans with my friends to watch the game on a big screen. I have come from Noida to be with my friends over Diwali. This India-Pakistan game was on my mind for a long time. I wish India had won the game and we would have gone back home smiling. As cricket fans, we are not used to seeing India lose to Pakistan in events like the World Cup. The memories of India beating Pakistan in the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa are still so fresh in my mind. This loss is going to hurt,” felt Varun Abbi, 39, who with a group of friends watched the game in a Sector 7 restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heartbreak-for-cricket-fans-in-chandigarh-as-pak-thrash-india-in-t20-world-cup-tie-101635106092224.html

From edible hand painted aces to poker chips, cracker box, customized chocolates, cake jars and other hampers, the creative lot have come up with an array of options. The market is flooded with sweets and bakery options by small as well as big commercial establishments but many are opting for the variety being offered by these young bakers. “Gifting sweets and cookies are a passé. When I get something like that,I just pass it on. So, this time, I chose to try a hamper from a young home baker. One, it was to support her passion and creativity, second the amount of hard work that she is infusing in is simply commendable. So, I got a hand-decorated customized box which consists candles, nuts, cake jar and assorted chocolates,” says Vishwas Yadav, a businessman. Monika Chandra has been a hobby baker since 2014 but it was from last year that she introduced creative gift hampers modelled on items relevant to Diwali. “At M’s Kitchen we call them ‘patakhe jo mum mein phute’. Inspired by my friend in Pune I came up with chocolate diyas, hand-painted rasmalai flavoured aces, poker chips in different chocolate flavour and a range of patakas like anar, sutli bomb, pistol, chakri, ladi bomb and rockets in different taste and they look same like original crackers,” she says. Youngster Aarushi Sehgal has prepared hampers containing flavoured nuts, tea cakes, assorted chocolates and candles. “The Cakewalk hampers can be customised as per buyer’s preference. Since these are for festival, we prepare them fresh and everything is eggless,” she adds. Home chef and baker Ehab Beg says, “During festival season our clients expect us to give them something innovative and different. So, we prepared customized hampers as per their need and since it’s for limited clients we are able to put all our heart, soul and creativity into it and give them truly aood stuff.” At Bhavya’s Amazin Glazin too gift hampers are a big draw which includes browines, cupcakes, tea cakers, chocolates, cookies, juices and cake jars. “These young bakers, some of them still a student, are doing very well for themselves. They are very creative and passionate about their hobbies which surely will become their career someday. I know many of my friends who just order from home bakers and chefs which ensure them personalised service, good quality and fulfillment,” says Anupriya Agarwal, an entrepreneur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/straight-from-the-heart-of-home-bakers-101635106022877.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: City escape in city’s heart||Consisting of sloped mounds, parts of the landscape resemble the sandy Chambal valley ravines that were infamous for sheltering dacoits. But here the crests and troughs of earth are carpeted with trimmed grass. And these are currently sheltering a handful of law-abiding citizens. A man is sitting still. Three folks are playing hide and seek, with a woman in blindfold. A couple is whispering into each other’s ears.Around them, an endless procession of speeding bikes, cars, autos and red DTC buses.Many years ago this used to be a smoggy square dreaded by commuters for its hour-long jams. Today, this is an island of utmost peace.It’s 6 pm in Rajiv Gandhi Setu. Opened in 2003, you might be knowing it more informally as the AIIMS flyover. (The place was featured four years back on this space but it has drastically evolved, for better, and necessities a re-appraisal). The two gardens tucked at the traffic circle’s heart exude a weekend getaway’s serenity. Only by lying flat on the grass will you be able to absorb the place’s transformative character. This evening, the rush hour sound has the calmness of lilting music — the shriek of an occasional car horn intrudes into the melody as politely as an orchestral cymbal. If you close your eyes, you feel you are swaying with this sound. Open them and you see the sky above.The serenity feels unusually intense because it is conjoined to the frantic life rushing about the circle. And since AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital are just beyond the gardens, the cool October air is frequently echoing with the wail of ambulance sirens, reminding every attentive ear of life’s frailty.The two gardens themselves have changed over the course of their brief lives. A decorative fountain has come up in one, which usually remains dry, and idlers sit on its waterless steps like audience in an amphitheatre. The sapling that was planted in a corner here years ago has matured into a giant leafy tree under which crowds gather on sunny afternoons. One more object of beauty is a narrow lane lined on both sides with flower-heavy frangipani trees.The other noticeable new sight is of the recently erected multistories across one end of the traffic circle. Built to house senior government officers, their twinkling balconies inadvertently advertise the great scope of sarkari privilege to us tax-paying citizens lounging in the gardens. In the twilight, as the sky darkens, the shiniest thing in the horizon becomes the signage of AIIMS, lit in the color of blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-city-escape-in-city-s-heart-101635105827017.html

Now, the upcoming complex will help improve hygiene in the region, as all the dairies will come under one roof. The village panchayat has also passed a resolution on this.Home and health minister Anil Vij, who represents the Cantonment constituency in the state assembly, said that this modern dairy complex will have a veterinary hospital for free treatment of animals, a biogas plant, fodder store and pond. “The budget has been approved and a long pending demand of the residents will be fulfilled,” the minister said.Scall-scale dairy owners in city left anxiousAs the Ambala municipal corporation ramps up the process to shift cattle from almost 250 dairies under city limits to Kanwala or Katholi dairy complexes, the owners of small-scale farms have been left anxious.Megha Ishu Goyal, councillor from ward number 9, said that such farmers have no way out as they don’t have any other employment option and cannot afford to shift. “They were not allotted plots at the complex in 2004 and MC have warned many of them for operating illegally. The civic body should look into the matter or allot plots to them in other areas,” she said.Kicking-off seizure of animals of from dairies that were not allotted any space, an MC team gave notices to four owners on Saturday with a two-day warning, Mandeep Singh, sanitary inspector (city zone), said.MC commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata said that according to a 2004 survey, the dairies were allotted land in the two complexes. “No re-survey can be done and those left can’t operate under MC limits,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-proposal-for-21-acre-dairy-complex-approved-by-haryana-government-101635105422311.html

With 97% of seats in the undergraduate nursing courses remaining vacant after the first round of counselling, the medical university decided to hold another entrance test for want of enough eligible candidates. But the attempt failed as 92% of candidates, who appeared in the second entrance test, failed to score minimum marks. The BFUHS conducted the entrance test on Sunday but only 220 of the 2,730 could score 50 or above marks required for the eligibility. A total of 3,878 candidates applied online for the test, of which 1,148 remained absent. In the first entrance test conducted in August, only 240 of the 2,596 candidates could score more than 50 marks. During the first round of the counselling, the BFUHS allotted nursing seats to 190 candidates while 4,780 seats remained vacant in government and private nursing colleges of the state. There are 4,970 BSc nursing seats in the 103 colleges of the state. During the first round of counselling, 89 nursing colleges failed to fill even a single BSc nursing seat. BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said: “We have conducted the second entrance test to give another chance to the students as a large number of seats are vacant. But unfortunately, only 220 students have managed to score the qualifying marks. This is very disappointing that students are not putting in efforts the profession needs,” he added. Officials said the BFUHS had even put an easier question paper in the second entrance test to fill the nursing seats but still only a few students qualified. In recent years, there has been a continuous decline in the number of candidates interested in pursuing nursing courses, badly affecting the private colleges offering the courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsc-nursing-seats-in-punjab-set-to-remain-vacant-only-8-qualify-2nd-entrance-test-101635104462441.html

The election to the office-bearers of PUTA will be held on October 28 and over 600 teachers of PU are eligible to cast their votes.Finding a common ground, both the groups have ensured the implementation of the seventh pay commission as well as the promotion policy of teachers of the dental institute. However, Manu Sharma’s team has also outlined the senate and governance reforms in their planned deliverables. “Over the years we have realised that there is a need for various reforms in the governing structure of the university,” said Manu Sharma. While the matter of senate polls was in the high court earlier this year, the vice-president of India, Venkaiah Naidu, who is the chancellor of PU, constituted an expert panel in February to examine the existing governing structure of the university and make recommendations.Although the panel submitted its report to the office of chancellor in July, its various recommendations were criticised by the stakeholders. Mritunjay Kumar said, “We are not against the governance reforms but those should be democratic and start from the bottom level first. We have also advocated that the number of campus teachers should be increased in the senate.”Key agendas of groupsThe key agendas of the Mritunjay-Naura group include the grant of central university status to PU and pension for all. The group has promised that they will make efforts to ensure that teachers receive all retirement benefits immediately on their retirement and the completion of the process of counting the past service of teachers. The group has also said that timely processing of CAS promotions, payment of arrears and pay fixation will be among their priorities. The team of Manu Sharma and Kashmir Singh is also vouching for the CAS promotion for teachers of dental institute and clearance of cases of counting of past service. They have also claimed to work for the flexibility in the use of ‘improvement of education funds’ and central funding for PU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-teachers-body-elections-governance-reforms-promotion-policy-for-dental-teachers-among-key-agendas-101635104402255.html

Raju has been appointed senior vice-president of the party’s transport wing. Former Akali MP Prem Singh Chandumajra was also present.

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pink bollworm infestation: Impact to be reassessed as cotton sales belie projections||The state government on Saturday ordered a re-assessment of losses to the cotton crop due to pink bollworm infestation after doubts were raised over the field inspection reports. Sources said that the trend of cotton arrival in different mandis of Punjab’s southern districts was not indicative of major crop loss at this stage. “Initial girdawari inputs submitted last week claimed that standing crop on 4-lakh acres of the 7-lakh acres area was severely hit. However, the sale of raw cotton in mandis is inconsonant with the loss projections. Government is sensitive to farmers’ concern but a reassessment of cotton crop losses was needed for objective financial support to the affected persons,” said a cabinet minister privy to the development, requesting anonymity. According to the reports of the district authorities, Bathinda and Mansa, key cotton-growing districts, suffered 76-100% loss of productivity. It was also stated that more than 80% of the total area in the two districts was under severe pest attack. Pockets of Sangrur and Muktsar had a limited impact, the reports said. However, official data does not hint at a major difference in the sale of cotton till the first three weeks of October in the corresponding period of 2020 when the bumper yield was reported. In the 2020 kharif season, about 50-lakh quintal cotton was produced and almost half of the produce was purchased by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), a central agency. Punjab Mandi Board cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said till October 21, 2020, 6.01-lakh quintal cotton arrived in mandis in seven districts. In the corresponding period this year, 5.28-lakh quintal raw cotton was purchased. This season, the rate of cotton has touched an all-time high of ₹8,380 per quintal, he said. This year 3.3-lakh hectare area was under cotton cultivation, an increase of 17% than that of the 2020-21 kharif season. Yarn sector hopes that Punjab would reach last year’s production of 50-lakh quintals. Till October 21 this year, Bathinda, stated to be the worst-hit district, has seen cotton purchase of 1.08-lakh quintals whereas in the corresponding period last season, 1.60-lakh quintals were sold by farmers in the mandis. Till Thursday, Mansa saw sales of 1.19-lakh quintals whereas the district recorded a sale of 1.46-lakh quintals. Official data says about 80,000 quintal crop was purchased at various mandis in the cotton belt spread across south Punjab till September 21. In the corresponding period last kharif season, various purchase centres had reported the arrival of only 1,637 quintals. Vice-president of Mansa arhtiya association Chanderkant Garg said the cotton rate may even touch ₹9,000 per quintal as the yarn is in great demand in the international market. “The actual impact of the pest attack may be known by November-end when cotton harvesting will be over as currently, the farmers are rushing their produce to the market,” said Garg, who also owns a cotton mill.

In a series of tweets, Sidhu, who has refrained from commenting on the issue, said the choice was between irreparable damage and the last chance for damage control. “Punjab must come back to its real issues that concern Punjabi and our future generations…How will we counter the financial emergency that stares upon us? I will stick to the real issues and not let them take a backseat (sic),” he posted on the microblogging website. A slugfest is on in the Punjab Congress after deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said a probe will be carried out to ascertain whether Aroosa Alam, a Pakistan journalist and Amarinder’s companion, has any links with that country’s spy agency ISI. Amarinder, while terming it a “baseless investigation”, accused the deputy CM of resorting to personal attacks. Sidhu’s wife Navjot Kaur and principal strategic adviser Mohammad Mustafa also jumped in to target the former chief minister. Sidhu further asked who will bring back state’s resources to its coffers, instead of them going to private pockets and who will lead the initiative for resurrection our great state to prosperity. “Let the mist clear, reality shine like the sun upon the roadmap for revival of Punjab, shunning those who protect the selfish vested interests and focus only on the path that will lead to Jittega Punjab, Jittegi Punjabiyat and Jittega Har Punjabi,” he tweeted.

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Rain, hailstorm damage paddy crop across Punjab, girdawari ordered||Paddy harvesting in parts of Malwa, Majha and Doaba regions of the state is set to get delayed as heavy rain coupled with high-velocity winds and hail flattened the crop and drenched the harvest. The untimely rain that started on Saturday evening continued intermittently till Sunday afternoon, flooding fields and grain markets.According to the government figures, nearly 70 lakh tonne paddy has reached the grain markets, which is roughly one-third of the total yield expected this season. Last year, the 210 lakh tonne of paddy was procured in the state. Paddy, including basmati varieties, is sown on nearly 31 lakh hectares of land in the state this year.Guru Har Sahai block in Ferozepur district, and parts of Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts were the worst hit. The rain also drenched tones of paddy lying in mandis across the state.The state agriculture department has already sought a report about the damage from districts. Punjab agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said teams have already been rushed to assess the damage to standing crops and the stock. “As per the reports received so far, there is serious damage to the standing crop, while harvesting in parts of Punjab is surely going to be delayed,” Sidhu said.Agriculture experts say unfavourable weather conditions will adversely affect the production in addition to making the grain vulnerable to shrivelling, blackening and discolouration. In Amritsar, the agriculture officials reported 30% loss to the standing crop. In Rupnagar, 10% of the standing crop has been flattened. Major Singh, a farmer from Ghamrouda village in Patiala district, said the farmers stare at huge financial losses. “The government should provide adequate compensation and immediate financial relief to the affected farmers,” he said. Tarn Taran district, pea and potato crops were also severely hit. Bathinda chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said the district witnessed 10.5mm rain and preliminary inputs do not hint at much loss to the crop in Bathinda and Mansa districts. “Paddy harvesting that was picking up the pace will slow down again. The harvesting may resume in most parts of the district after a week,” he said. As per the official figures, Jalandhar witnessed 32.6 mm rain, while Nakodar and Phillaur saw 18mm.State agriculture department joint director Gurvinder Singh said barring Ferozepur, the loss to crop in southern Punjab was not substantial. “However, rain at this point of time is not good for paddy and cotton,” he added.Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC)’s state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “We want ₹50-60,000 per acre compensation from the state government. We will launch widespread protests if the compensation is not announced soon.”Baldev Singh of Shahkot said his paddy crop was flattened due to rain and gusty winds. “Now it can be harvested only manually,” he said. Kulwinder Singh of Nakodar said untimely rain can add to the moisture content, besides discolouring of the grain.Jalandhar agriculture department officer Naresh Gulati said nearly 45% of the paddy is yet to be harvested in the district. “Sunny weather for the next three-four days can bring down the losses,” he said.‘Farmers will be compensated’ Punjab deputy chief minister and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa took stock of the situation in Dera Baba Nanak town of Gurdaspur district and announced a special girdawari to assess the losses across the state. “I have asked the officials to complete the girdawari in a week’s time so that the farmers can get the compensation at the earliest. I also want to appeal to the officials to be honest while assessing the damage,” he said during his visit and interaction with farmers. Deputy chief minister OP Soni, during an event at a Amritsar village, assured adequate compensation to the farmers. “The rain has damaged the paddy crop in Majha region. Fair compensation will be given after the girdawari.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-hailstorm-damage-paddy-crop-across-punjab-girdawari-ordered-101635103262353.html

25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Crop loss reported in several parts, may cause veggie prices to soar||Incessant rains coupled with strong winds caused crop loss in several parts of Ludhiana, particularly in Khanna, Samrala and Machhiwara on Sunday.Market experts said this is likely to lead to a rise in vegetable prices in the coming days.Farmers in Khanna rued that the standing crop in their fields were completely flattened by the unseasonal rain. In Samrala and Machhiwara, vegetable farmers lamented that the unexpected change in weather destroyed their potato crop.Nachattar Singh, a farmer from Lalhari Kallan, said “Rain has washed away our potato crop. Farmers who were yet to harvest their rice crop have also suffered heavy losses.” At the grain markets in Khanna and Ludhiana, farmers were seen anxiously trying to save their grains from getting drenched by trying to cover it with plastic.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader from Khanna, Rajinder Singh Benipal said farmers in Naulari, Alipur, Baupur, Bhadla Nicha, Nasrali and Rajewal have suffered massive losses. He said vegetable crops such as spinach, coriander and potato have been completely destroyed.Surjit Singh, secretary market committee, Khanna, said, “We managed to save 90% of the crop that arrived in the market. We have informed the authorities about damage.” Harminder Singh, a progressive farmer from Jagraon, said besides damaging the standing crop, the rain has also delayed the harvesting process by another week. “This will leave farmers with a limited window for stubble management and sowing of wheat crop,” said Harminder Singh.Chief agriculture officer Narinder Singh said the initial survey conducted to assess the crop loss has revealed that about two percent of crops were damaged due to rain, while majority of the matured rice crops have been dislodged due to strong wind and rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-crop-loss-reported-in-several-parts-may-cause-veggie-prices-to-soar-101635103022201.html
25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Never seen such chaos, anarchy in Punjab Cong: Tewari on infighting||Amid continued infighting, Congress MP from Anandpur Sahib Manish Tewari on Sunday slammed the “daily soap opera” in the Punjab Congress, questioning open defiance, party leaders squabbling like children and use of guttural language against each other. Referring to former Punjab affair in-charge Harish Rawat’s interview, Tewari said that in his 40 years plus in the Congress, he has never seen such chaos and anarchy. “Repeated open defiance of AICC by a PCC president, colleagues squabbling publicly with each other like children. Guttural language against each other that even fish wives would not use. For the past 5 months, it is @INCPunjab vs @INCPunjab,” he tweeted, hitting out at state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Rawat, in an interview last week, asked Tewari to understand the ground situation in the state. The Congress has been rocked by factional feud in Punjab for the past five months that saw Capt Amarinder Singh resign as the chief minister after Navjot Singh Sindhu and several ministers and MLAs rebelled against him. Charanjit Singh Channi, a minister in the Amarinder cabinet, was then appointed as the first SC chief minister of Punjab. However, the change of guard has failed to end the rift in the state unit as Channi and Sidhu have not been on the same page on senior appointments, portfolio allocation and pending promises. The Congress has also stepped its attack on Amarinder since his announcement that he would float a new party and have an understanding with the BJP for the upcoming assembly polls. In another tweet, Tewari, who had backed Capt Amarinder in his tussle with Sidhu and other detractors, said: “Do we think that people of Punjab are not disgusted by this daily soap opera? Irony is that those who complained loudest of transgressions & aberrations were unfortunately and continue to be worst offenders themselves.” The Lok Sabha MP said history would record that the appointment of the committee that ostensibly heard perceived and real grievances was a serious error of judgment. “Where is progress on the issues that agitated these MLAs and other eminences – Bargari, Drugs, Power PPAs, illegal sand mining. Has there been any movement forward,” he asked without mincing words. The three-member committee comprising Rajya Saba MP Mallikarjun Kharge, Rawat and ex-MP JP Agarwal was constituted by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to resolve the rift in the state Congress. The panel held one-to-one discussions with close to 150 party lawmakers and functionaries from the state with the then CM appearing twice before it and handed then handed an 18-point agenda for implementation before the state polls. The to-do list is also a bone of contention between Channi and Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/never-seen-such-chaos-anarchy-in-punjab-cong-tewari-on-infighting-101635102842110.html
25-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pundri MLA claims rotten foodgrains are being supplied under PDS||Nearly a month after he threatened to withdraw support from the BJP-JJP coalition government alleging that bureaucrats do not listen to elected representatives, independent MLA from Kaithal’s Pundri assembly constituency Randhir Gollen has alleged that rotten foodgrains are being supplied under the public distribution system (PDS).“Even cattle cannot eat the rotten wheat that is being supplied under the PDS to the poor. We took up the matter with the Kaithal deputy commissioner but to no avail,” alleged Gollen on the sidelines of a public rally he organised in the assembly segment on completion of two years as an MLA on Sunday.“A written complaint has already been filed with the deputy commissioner but no action was taken against the officials concerned. I will take other three MLAs of the district along to take up the issue with the higher authorities,” said Gollen adding that there are problems at the district level.On the other hand, Kaithal deputy commissioner Pradeep Dhaiya has refuted the allegations of inaction on complaint of the MLA and said action was taken immediately and directions have already been issued in this regard to the officers concerned.Reacting to the allegations, Haryana’s additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department) Anurag Rastogi said he has asked for details of the matter.On September 19, Gollen had threatened to withdraw support to the BJP-JJP government if action wasn’t taken against officials who “don’t listen to the elected representatives”.“I feel the bureaucracy is dominating everywhere (in the government); nobody is ready to listen to the elected representatives. If they (officers) don’t listen to us, how will we work for the people who have elected us?” he had said.Gollen was earlier associated with the BJP but had left the party and contested independently from Pundri as the party did not give him a ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pundri-mla-claims-rotten-foodgrains-are-being-supplied-under-pds-101635102782089.html

25-10-2021||Lucknow||Man-tiger peaceful co-existence: Pilibhit district administration coaxes farmers to switch from cane to other cash crops||Slowly, silently but surely, Pilibhit, a district in the terai region of Uttar Pradesh, appears to be finally moving towards an environment where tigers and humans can co-exist peacefully in their defined territories, after being in a bloody conflict for decades together. Courtesy the ambitious mission ‘crop diversification with a life-saving purpose’ that Pilibhit district administration launched a year ago and which still continues, farmers living in the villages around the jungle now look to enhance their income while retaining peace of mind. “Since tigers can easily hide in sugarcane fields, they provide the big cats with a semblance of their natural habitat. However, the tigers attack and kill farmers in an encounter in the fields. We launched an intensive campaign to persuade cane farmers to shift to equally remunerative alternative crops that are agro-climatically suited to the terai environment,” said Pulkit Khare, district magistrate, Pilibhit, who is leading the campaign from the front. Many farmers, according to him, told tales of spending fearful nights in their cane fields guarding their crops or moving in a group with mashaals while harvesting the crop. “After several rounds of discussions with progressive farmers and experts, crops like haldi, laahi, sarson, matar, chana, soyabean, mentha, lemon etc, were identified as equally remunerative alternatives to conventional sugar cane plantation,” he revealed. Reduced cane area And the campaign has already started yielding the desired results. “As per the annual GPS survey for 2020-21 conducted by the cane department, the cane coverage was 1,04,213 hectares. But that got reduced to 1,02,114 hectares when the same GPS survey was carried out for the year 2021-22,” Khare said. “Thus, a reduction or rather diversification of around 2,099 hectares (3.5%) of cane area took place in these villages as a result of this intensive campaign to motivate and train farmers for alternative ‘safer’ crops which would reduce man-animal conflict incidents in the times to come,” he added. Amandeep Singh, of village Purva Bhoora, is one such farmer who has started growing vegetables instead of sugarcane in the fields near the jungle. “Inspired by the district administration’s relentless campaign, I have stopped growing sugarcane in the field near the forest area from where tigers often crept into the cane field,” he said, adding, “Instead, I have started growing vegetables in two of the seven acres of the land that I possess,” he said. Like Amandeep, Gurumangat Singh Cheema of Haripur village, has also switched to an alternative to sugarcane. “After the officials’ persuasion last year, I have begun growing mentha and potato in place of cane on the four acres of land and get equally good returns without any fear of encountering tigers that would easily hide in dense cane fields,” he said. Man-tiger conflict commonplace Pilibhit, located in the terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, is home to Pilibhit Tiger Reserve which has rich flora and fauna. As part of the Upper Gangetic Plain, its characteristic sal forests, tall grasslands and swamps host species like Indian leopard, swamp deer, hispid hare, floricans and an estimated 65 Royal Bengal Tigers. Stories of man- animal conflict are commonplace in these habitations. Incidents of tigers straying into the village to either snatch away livestock or have direct confrontation with villagers had been increasing. “In the last five years, 15 humans were injured and 21 lives were lost in such conflicts. Fencing the entire perimeter of the reserve is a mammoth project which moves only a few notches each year as per the availability of budget with the department,” said Khare, a young 2010 IAS officer, whose videos of raiding government paddy procurement centres in the same district a year ago, went viral. Though several efforts by the forest department like asking villagers to resort to haanka (lighting the fire, beating drums and dhols) to scare away the animal, moving in groups to their fields for irrigation or manuring or identifying the signs of tiger’s presence nearby are carried out intensively in these villages, nothing was of much help. This forced the administration to intervene, analyse and make other efforts to reduce such occurrences considering an increasing number of man-tiger conflicts in the district. “Data analysis of the region of such occurrences showed a high percentage of such man-animal conflicts taking place in the sugarcane fields adjoining the jungle in these villages. (12 out of 21 deaths in the last 5 years were in sugarcane fields of farmers who went for irrigation or harvesting the crop,” the DM said referring to ‘The Sugarcane Tigers of Pilibhit by Sanctuary Asia’ (Vol.41 Aug 2021). ‘Sugarcane tigers’ are those that stray out of the reserve and adopt sugarcane fields as their habitat. This includes the sub-adults pushed out of the forest by dominant male tigers and tigresses and cubs who find it congenial to take refuge in cane farms when the crop is ripe. “Cane fields also provide a semblance of the forest ecosystem with long canes often providing hiding places for herbivores, which attract the tiger as prey to these fields,” he further pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mantiger-peaceful-co-existence-pilibhit-district-administration-coaxes-farmers-to-switch-from-cane-to-other-cash-crops-101635100804653.html

25-10-2021||Mumbai||Why are mental health practitioners pushing for resilience building?||This July, when a 31-year-old teacher from Kolkata lost her husband to Covid-19, it was not just grief that she had to dabble with. A few days before her husband tested positive, she had walked out on him due to incidents of physical abuse. When he landed in the isolation ward, they got talking again and he promised to be good to her and make their marriage work. But two weeks later, he succumbed to the infection, driving her into a pile of guilt. The mother of two daughters aged four and seven turned to a psychologist who let her vent, cry, and slowly bring back her self-esteem. A big part of her therapy involved building resilience. “Grief and guilt can be a devastating combination,” said Alisha Lalljee, a Bandra-based counselling psychologist who has been virtually counselling the Kolkata woman. “In her case, close relatives blamed her for not being there for her husband. She was made guilty for walking out on him. Despite being a confident woman, it was the societal pressure that kept pulling her down. Building resilience helps to cope in such circumstances,” she said. The term resilience is not new. In a recent mental health event, Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Avinash DeSousa spoke of resilience and how it plays a crucial role when it comes to dealing with mental health issues. More and more mental health practitioners have started emphasising its importance in recent years. As the world faces the worst shocks like the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that followed, its resilience that helps each individual to cope, bounce back and get back on the feet to face the next challenge. “Self-love or self-compassion is a crucial aspect to being more resilient,” said Lalljee, who included daily journaling in the Kolkata woman’s therapy along with cognitive behavioural therapy and rational emotive behavioural therapy. “Acceptance of the situation, learning to identify the rational and irrational thoughts and beliefs, believing that you have a superpower and that you have been through worse are some mechanisms that help in coping,” she said. The American Psychological Association defines resilience as “the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress—such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressers.” The association lists a variety of resilience-building strategies including prioritising relationships, taking care of own body, practising mindfulness, being proactive, looking for opportunities for self-discovery among others. “Put simply, it’s your ability to bounce back,” said DeSousa. “The good part is that resilience is something that can be taught formally to children or older adults, and it can even be tailor-made for the disaster or trauma. It’s like training them in the right or wrong ways to react for a certain shock,” he said. According to DeSousa, biological factors also play a role in one’s resilience. “How the family copes, the situations one has been brought up in all contribute to resilience building or not,” he said. Thus, when two people suffer from the same kind of trauma, one may cope better and faster than the other. A 2019 review in Lancet Psychiatry stated that at the level of a child’s community, high social support will change psychosocial and behavioural outcomes. “It is important to note that studies like this review tend to show that single resilience factors—such as paternal communication or maternal support—do not contribute to resilience on their own but are instead related to the totality of the family experience. Single factors together create an environment of social cohesion and a positive family climate, which are associated with resilience,” the review said further adding that resilience is not solely a quality within individuals; it grows from access to and use of the resources needed to support mental health and wellbeing. Dr Samir Dalwai, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician said that resilience-building exercises must be included compulsorily at the school level. “Unfortunately, our systems are such that we expect a lot from our children but offer little to build on their strengths. Resilience building involves validating the child’s feelings, motivating them, helping them build the skills that they lack and gradually helping them rise above,” he said. “When we don’t build such strengths, most land up adapting bad coping mechanisms when they face any kind of stressors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-are-mental-health-practitioners-pushing-for-resilience-building-101635100441957.html

Her brother visited her house after she did not visit their house on Saturday morning, and did not respond to phone calls.“Her brother went to check on the couple. As he peeped inside the room through the window, he spotted the man’s body, after which he alerted his family and the police,” said the officer.The woman worked as domestic help, and the man as an electrician with a private company in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-strangles-wife-in-ashok-nagar-dies-by-suicide-101635100263563.html
25-10-2021||Lucknow||Congress, others would do well to retain seats they won in 2017: Maurya||LUCKNOW: Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit out at Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi ‘Vadra’, describing her as ‘Twitter Vadra’ and claiming that despite her being active, Congress would do well to retain even the 7 seats that it won in the 2017 UP polls. “In fact, not just Congress, it would be worth observing if Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party also manage to win the seats they won last time,” Maurya said on Sunday. In the 2017 UP polls, Samajwadi Party had won 47, BSP 19 and Congress had won 7 seats. “The Congress doesn’t exist in UP politically. They have been neglected by the people. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, they won just two seats and shrunk further in 2019 LS polls to just one seat in UP. In 2017 assembly polls, they won 7 seats and holding on to that tally would be some achievement for them. SP and BSP too would do well to win as many seats as they did last time,” Maurya said. Asked why he has been referring to Priyanka as ‘Twitter Vadra’, Maurya said: “All these parties are competing among themselves. One is active on Twitter. Congress seems to be ahead at the moment in getting photos clicked but that’s about all and since they have not made space for themselves in the hearts of the people, they won’t be able to make any impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-others-would-do-well-to-retain-seats-they-won-in-2017-maurya-101635100204040.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Evening rain gives Delhi cleaner air, temperature likely to dip||Moderate to light rains were reported from across the national capital on Sunday, with parts of the city also receiving hailstorm, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, and predicted that the weather will clear up by Monday, and temperatures will start dropping in the coming days.On Sunday, Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory, which provides representative data for the entire city, 27mm rainfall was reported till 8.30pm. Palam weather station received 4.9 mm rain.IMD scientists said that while ‘trace’ showers (not enough to be recorded in the observatory) was reported in most parts of the city till Sunday afternoon, rains intensified in the evening with some areas also receiving hailstorm.“Radar images indicate that parts of northwest Delhi and Haryana received hailstorm. We can only report hailstorm for sure when it is reported over an observatory; for any other part of the city, we rely on public and media reports,” said a senior Met official.Forecasters explained that Sunday’s rain was caused by a western disturbance, which also led to intense and widespread showers and thunderstorm in parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. In Delhi, the clouds are expected to clear up by late Sunday night, they said.“Western disturbance is moving away and the weather will clear up in Delhi by Monday. Temperatures are also likely to start falling from tomorrow (Monday),” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services.The rainfall also resulted in a fall in pollution levels. Since most of Sunday’s showers were concentrated towards the evening hours, the overall air quality index, which is released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 4pm, showed only a minor drop from Saturday. On Sunday, the overall AQI was 160 in the ‘moderate’ zone.By 9pm, pollution levels fell further dropped to 158. At 10.30pm, of the 39 monitoring stations listed on the CPCB’s Sameer app, only five showed air in the poor zone. The air quality at all others were in the moderate zone.“The AQI will improve but remain in the moderate zone on Monday. After that as the winds change back to northwesterly, AQI will start rising again during the week,” another senior Met official said.Some parts of the city witnessed waterlogging, officials said. The Delhi Traffic Police posted on its official Twitter handle that the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road in south Delhi was closed due to waterlogging at Pul Prahladpur underpass and asked commuters to take alternate routes.“Due to waterlogging at Pul Prahladpur underpass, MB road is closed. Please avoid this route. Kindly take alternate route MB Road-Maa Anandmai Marg towards Badarpur,” the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.Other places from where waterlogging was reported included Kirari, Rohtak Road, and Nangloi, civic officials said.However, no major waterlogging was reported from anywhere else, they added.The city reported a maximum temperature of 31.5 degrees celsius and a minimum of 19 degrees Celsius, IMD officials said.Last week, the city recorded recorded 87.9 mm rainfall between Sunday night and Monday, the most in a day since an October 1956 day when Delhi recorded 111mm rain. Delhi has now broken a weather record for the 15th straight month, records showed.IMD data shows that despite a late onset, Delhi this year has had one of the most erratic monsoons ever. It started off with an unusually delayed arrival — instead of its normal date of June 27, monsoon this year entered the Capital only on July 13, 16 days behind schedule. This was the most-delayed arrival in 19 years.In 2002, monsoon hit Delhi on July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/evening-rain-gives-delhi-cleaner-air-temperature-likely-to-dip-101635099969115.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Gogi murder: 4 arrested for killing man who celebrated gangster’s killing||A member of slain gangster Jitender alias Gogi’s gang, who was allegedly involved in the murder of Deepak alias Radhe, a member of the rival Tillu Tajpuria gang, has been arrested along with his three associates, police said.Three pistols and 18 bullets were seized from the arrested men, who, according to the police, were planning more killings to take revenge for the murder of Gogi, who was shot dead inside a courtroom in the Rohini court complex. “The arrests of the four men have helped us avert a gang war in the city,” said deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.On September 24, Gogi was being produced before a judge in Rohini Court in a decade old attempt to murder case, when two assailants dressed as lawyers shot him dead in the courtroom number 207 . The police personnel escorting Gogi gunned down the assailants before they could flee.Police cracked the case by arresting two men, whose interrogation revealed that Gogi’s killing was planned by his archrival, Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuria, who is presently lodged in Mandoli jail. Apart from the duo, Tillu, his associate Naveen Bali and another jailed criminal have been arrested in the case, so far.On October 11, one Deepak alias Radhe, who was a member of Tillu gang, was shot dead in Rohini Sector-15 and four persons were arrested in that case. At least two more suspects, identified as Sumit alias Sethi and Bachchi, were absconding. On September 23, the Rohini district police received information that the two would be coming at Helipad Road in Sector-37 Rohini on a bike.“Accordingly, a trap was laid and Sumit was caught with a pistol and six cartridges. He is a hitman of Gogi’s gang. His interrogation led to the arrest of his associates namely Kunal, Karan Hans, and Suraj Kumar. Two more pistols and 12 bullets were seized from them,” added DCP Tayal.HT on October 17 reported that Radhe was allegedly murdered because he he had thrown a party to celebrate Gogi’s murder.Police officers privy to the investigation said that the police have formally arrested jailed gangsters -- Rohit Moi(Gogi’s second-in-command) from Tihar and another close aide, Kapil Maan from Mandoli jail in connection with Radhe’s murder.Officers said Moi planned the murder because he had learnt about Deepak throwing a party outside his house in Rohtak, Haryana, on the night of September 24 -- the day when Gogi was shot at 18 times inside the Rohini district court.A police officer said Deepak was not an active member of the Tillu gang but had thrown a party after Gogi’s death.“Gangster Rohit Moi got to know about Deepak celebrating Gogi’s murder through his friends. Moi spoke to another key gang member, Kapil Maan, at the Mandoli jail and planned the murder. They also followed Deepak for 4-5 days. Currently, Moi is running Gogi’s gang from inside jail, and another absconding member Deepak Pehal alias Boxer is running the gang from outside,” a police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gogi-murder-4-arrested-for-killing-man-who-celebrated-gangster-s-killing-101635099968013.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Deadline of BJP’s farewell from MCDs is near: Delhi minister Gopal Rai||Asserting that the deadline of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s farewell from the three municipal corporations in the city is near, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday announced that it will launch a campaign after Diwali (to be celebrated on November 4) to strengthen the party’s organisational structure ahead of the MCD polls next year. AAP’s Delhi convener Gopal Rai said the party organised 2,532 ‘mohalla meetings’ across Delhi from September 1 to October 20 under ‘Aapka MLA Aapke Dwar’ programmme. “In every mohalla sabha, people have raised the issue of dirt and litter throughout Delhi. People said the BJP and MCDs have proved completely unsuccessful in cleaning Delhi,” Rai said.“It is evident now that the deadline of BJP’s farewell from MCD will come before their deadline of clearing Delhi’s garbage mountains,” Rai, who is also Delhi’s environment minister, said in a press conference.He said the AAP is preparing its plan of action for the civic body polls based on the report of ‘mohalla sabhas’. The party is also reviewing the performance of the organisation in holding the public meetings, he said.While the AAP rules the Delhi government, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in power in the three municipal corporations. The AAP is the principal opposition in all the three MCDs. Municipal corporation elections are due in April next year. Delhi BJP dismissed the AAP’s allegations as baseless. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “People of Delhi are fed up of allegation politics of Aam Aadmi Party leaders.” “People have seen how the Kejriwal government failed them during Covid-19, while the BJP-led central government has not only provided medical aid during the Covid-19 waves but has also ensured free Covid vaccination for 2 crore people in Delhi. People of Delhi have seen how BJP-ruled MCD staff and councillors worked hard during the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure not only proper sanitation, but also distributed food and ration to the poor,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deadline-of-bjp-s-farewell-from-mcds-is-near-delhi-minister-gopal-rai-101635099543751.html

They were part of a bigger 17-member team which had gone to the Pass for trekking.On Monday, due to snowfall in the area, the 11 people went missing. Six porters managed to reach the ITBP camp in Chitkul village in Kinnaur and informed them about the incident on October 19. A massive rescue operation, comprising army, air force, ITBP and SDRF personnel, was then launched to search for them.“The two bodies were retrieved by rescue workers of ITBP 2nd battalion from Kullu, Himachal Pradesh on Saturday. But due to bad weather, they couldn’t be brought down. On Sunday, after the weather improved, they were airlifted to the ITBP base in Himachal on Sunday in an air force chopper,” said Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer (DDMO), Uttarakashi.He said the two deceased were identified as Richard Mandal, 30, a trekker from Kolkata, and Upendra Chauhan, 32, a porter from Uttarkashi.“Mandal’s body was flown to Delhi from Himachal Pradesh where it would be handed to his family members. The body of Chauhan was brought to Uttarkashi where it was handed to his family members,” said Patwal.Earlier on Friday, the Uttarakhand SDRF had brought down five bodies near Lamkhaga Pass to Uttarakashi in an air force chopper.The deceased were identified as Anita Rawat, 38, from Delhi, Tanmay Tiwari, 30, Saurav Ghosh, 34, Savian Das, 28, and Vikas Maikal, 33, all residents of Kolkata and trekkers.“The bodies of four trekkers from Kolkata were handed over to their family members in Uttarkashi while the one from Delhi was cremated in Uttarkashi by her family members,” said Patwal.The rescue workers had earlier rescued two persons among the 11 missing. They were identified as Mithun Dari, a resident of Kolkata and a trekker, and Devendra, 37, a porter from Kolkata. Among the two, Dari, who received treatment in an army hospital in Uttarkashi, was flown to Dehradun on Sunday from where his family members will take him to Kolkata.“Till Sunday, seven of the 11 are now confirmed dead while two have been rescued and as many are still missing near Lamkhaga Pass,” said Patwal.Meanwhile, a total of 72 people have died so far in various flood-related incidents in the state after it was lashed by heavy rains from October 17-19.According to data shared by the state government’s disaster management department, of the total 72 deaths, maximum 35 were reported in Nainital district followed by 11 in Champawat and 10 in Uttarkashi district. Also, 26 people were injured and four are missing.Earlier on Sunday, state director general of police Ashok Kumar visited the US Nagar and Nainital districts which were the worst affected one in the state in the tragedy.During his visit, he informed the media about the rescue operation being carried by the state police wings and other government agencies.“A total of about 65,000 people in the state were prevented from getting trapped in the floods as they were stopped by the police from going to the hill areas as a result of prior warning about the rains. Similarly, 48,000 people were evacuated in a timely manner after the warning to safe places,” Kumar said, adding 9,900 people were also rescued, including 9,500 from Kumaon region and 400 in Garhwal region.“Rescue works are still on in many areas including Uttarakashi and Bageshwar district to search eight trekkers and six locals,” Kumar said while commending the SDRF, fire department and local cops for their quick response in the disaster.The Dehradun centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), meanwhile, issued a weather forecast of very light to light rains in seven districts of the state including Dehradun, Uttarkashi and Nainital for Sunday.

All the 22 samples of his family members, relatives and friends sent to King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, have tested negative, said chief medical officer Nepal Singh.“No new case is a big relief for all of us,” he said, adding the source of his virus hasn’t been traced.Chief medical officer Nepal Singh said that the IAF (warrant) officer was suffering from fever for the past several days and was admitted to the Air Force Hospital in the district.Following mysterious symptoms in the case, his blood sample was collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology for proper examination which confirmed that the patient was Zika virus-positive, he said, adding the report was received on Saturday.The health department quickly isolated all those who came in contact with the IAF officer. Anti-larva spray was done in and around the place he lived with his family. Dr Singh said health department teams were going door to door in Lal Bangla and Jajmau areas of Kanpur to see if anyone else has similar symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iaf-personnel-tests-positive-for-zika-virus-in-kanpur-22-contacts-negative-101635099305325.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt’s ‘green fellows’ to help tackle pollution||The Delhi government has decided to hire young students and professionals to become ‘green fellows’ under their ‘Green Delhi’ mission to assist the understaffed environment and forest departments in managing issues related to air pollution, water pollution and management of the Capital’s forest lands, said senior government officials on Saturday. Senior officials said the fellowship programme by the environment department aims at engaging the city’s youth in assisting the government in their mission to tackle environmental concerns. Under this programme, the government will engage three specialists, 10 fellows and 15 associate fellows for a period of four years to assist the city’s understaffed environment and forest departments in improving their research, on-ground presence and public engagement programmes related to environment issues. “The fellows will be assigned to work under senior officers (such as principal secretary, special secretary, director etc) or any other officer designated by the environment minister and in coordination with the environment department, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the green war room as well as other departments,” a senior official from the environment department said. The official said the applications for the fellowship programmes are in; the environment department will now assess the merit of the applicants and recruit them ahead of the upcoming winter season. Government officials also said while these fellows will assist the government in the upcoming months in better assessing the pollution sources in winter, they will eventually help the department undertake the much-awaited tree census, which has never been conducted in the city. Residents from some localities in the city, such as south Delhi’s Sarvodaya Enclave, Vasant Vihar and Greater Kailash, conducted their neighbourhood tree census but this was a private exercise. While the Delhi government expressed its interest in conducting the tree census in the city in 2018 and engaged Dehradun-based Forest Research Institute for the task, the proposal never took off. In 2015 too, the government planned a tree census after the high court observed that the city is not as green as official figures make it out to be. In 2017, a few government agencies and civic bodies started a census and counted around 18 million trees. But the exercise could not be completed and was left midway as some agencies could not submit their data. While Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai refused to comment on the government’s plan to conduct a tree census, Reena Gupta, advisor to the Delhi government, told a news channel on October 20 that the ‘green fellows’ will assist in the task. “Of course, we want to do a tree census all over Delhi in all the colonies, but we do not have people in the forest department. Under this new programme..., we are hoping some of these will help us conduct the tree census,” Gupta told the news channel. Experts also said that Delhi, which is grappling with the problem of air pollution, needs a comprehensive tree census to get a clear picture of where the city stands in terms of its green cover, which will also help agencies plan plantation drives better in the future. C R Babu, professor emeritus at Delhi University’s Centre for Environmental Management and Degraded Ecosystems, said the tree census could give an idea as to how prepared the city is when it comes to fighting pollution. “The girth and the canopy details of trees will give us an idea as to how much carbon is trapped in these trees, how much dust they can trap and how much pollution they can mitigate, thereby helping the city focus its fight against pollution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-s-green-fellows-to-help-tackle-pollution-101635099301796.html
25-10-2021||Delhi||Taking stock of the market: Bull run boosts finance literacy programmes in Delhi||Kanika Bhaskar, a resident of Nirman Vihar in east Delhi, expounds stock market trading concepts such as risk management, position-sizing, and stop-loss, among others like a seasoned professional. It is quite a feat considering that until last year she was running her family’s office furniture business with her husband, and did not even know what BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) or NSE ( National Stock Exchange) are. “All I knew was that there are companies and there are stocks. But during the lockdown, our business came to a halt, and I was free. That is when a friend told me that she was earning ₹45,000 a day from the market; I was intrigued and wanted to know more about it. And so in December last year, I joined an in-class stock market course,” Bhaskar. She has since attended three courses—one in-class and two online and has read several books on stock market trading. “I did a lot of paper practice before I made my first investment in July this year. “Today, I am totally occupied with the stock market and making decent money,” she says. She is not the only one. Thousands of people from varied backgrounds are attending stock market courses—both offline and online. Finance institutes across the city, which earlier catered to students of commerce and business, now have engineers, doctors, housewives, retired people attending their stock market courses that cost anything between ₹10,000 to ₹40,000 . Stock market gurus offering private classes and workshops too are flourishing like never before. The curriculum of these courses includes how to operate a demat account, place different kinds of orders, equity market analysis, and use various technical analysis tools to make trading decisions, among others. The growing interest in the stock market is also reflected by the fact that the number of demat accounts in the country has almost doubled from 35 million in March 2020 to a record high at 62.2 million at the end of June 2021.More than 5.8 million new demat accounts were created in the September quarter this year, according to data from CDSL and NSDL. Retail investors cumulatively owned a record 7.18% of all listed companies on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the June quarter this year—an increase from their 6.96% holding in the March quarter. The new and aspiring retail investors are fuelling demand for stock market education, says the owners of these stock market institutes. “Today, 80% of our students are people who have no background in finance. These include doctors and even DTC drivers,” says Aryan Sharma, who heads the Laxmi Nagar branch of the National Institute of Financial Markets(NIFM), a private financial market institute. The institute’s walls are plastered with posters, including one featuring Microsoft founder Bill Gates with a quote: ‘If you are born poor, it is not your mistake, but if you die poor, it is your mistake.’ “This is to inspire people to believe that the stock market can help you become rich,” says Sharma. “But making money from the market is a science and art and one requires patience and perseverance to master it.” It is 10 am, the time for his first class of the day for the students pursuing a course called Certified Advanced Level Smart Investor. And today’s lesson is about analysing candlestick charts to determine the possible price movement of stocks based on past patterns. The class, which has about 25 students, includes young businessmen, an aspiring restaurateur who wants to learn an extra skill; two mechanical engineers, who have given up their career in engineering to make a living as stock traders. The compact air-conditioned classroom has an LED TV and whiteboard. Each student has a laptop and notebook and is listening intently as Sharma explains candlestick patterns – from bullish to bearish -- on the TV screen. “Essentially I teach my students how to understand the behaviour and psychology of the market. And I tell them that when others are fearful of the market you should be greedy and when others are greedy, you should be fearful,” adds Sharma, a cost accountant by profession and a stock market teacher for a decade.“Many of our students who knew nothing about the market when they joined today are confident traders.” Saurabh Tiwari, a mechanical engineer in Sharma’s class, says that he wanted to do something of his own and recently gave up his job with a multinational company to try his luck as a trader. “The pandemic made me realise that all jobs are dicey and it is better to be on your own,” says Tiwari, who has been attending the in-class trading lessons for the past two months. “I think I have made fairly good progress; my background in mechanical engineering will help me use various technical analysis tools to make trading decisions. I have no plans to return to engineering.” Praveen Baghel is another mechanical engineer in the class. He says he was inspired by his cousin brothers to try his luck in the market. “During the pandemic, stock market was open when all businesses were shut and I saw my brothers making a lot of money. I asked them to teach me the basics, but they said they did not have time and so I joined this course,” says Baghel. “In life, one should acquire as many extra skills as possible and with India’s economic growth story continuing to be exciting, stock market trading is an important skill that will hold you in good stead when nothing else is working.” Manish Taneja, the senior analyst at IFMC (Institute of Financial Market Courses) another Delhi institute in Lajpat Nagar offering in-class, live web classes and online recorded lessons in stock market trading, says a lot of his students are people from the travel and hospitality industry who lost their jobs, and also those who had huge salary cuts during the pandemic. But then these institutes also have those looking to supplement their income. Manoj Tiwari, a Delhi-based software engineer is one such person. Last year in September, inspired by a friend, he made an investment in the stock market and suffered a loss. He decided to join an in-class course in a Laxmi Nagar Institute before making another investment. “Today, I know how the market will behave. I am mostly into option selling and earn decently in addition to my salary,” says Tiwari. Each of these stock market institutes claims to teach their own unique tricks of trading. Manish Taneja, for example, teaches what he calls Uni-Directional Trade Strategy (UDTS)-- a copyrighted course on stock trading strategies for both beginners and traders. “We have developed this revolutionary tool to give traders and first-time investors freedom from cumbersome analysis and make stock trading simple,” says Taneja, who worked with a brokerage firm in Delhi before he co-founded IFMC. Not just in-person classes, workshops, both online and offline, are flourishing too. Ravi Kumar, a stock market guru, who has been busy imparting lessons on the stock market through his two-day workshops and three months’ online ‘master classes’ since 2013 , says the number of people in his workshop and classes has doubled in the past one and a half years. This month he has already organised five workshops in Delhi, Gurugram and other cities in hotels, clubs, auditoriums. About 13,000 people, he says, have attended his workshops in the past one and a half year. “Among them are 12-year-olds to 80-year olds. Parents are sending their young children as they believe stock trading is science and not gambling as it was considered earlier. Now stock trading is almost as popular with children as coding,” says Kumar, a PhD in Business Finance and Wealth Management from the University of Southern California. “I have offered private stock market lessons to CEOs of top companies. Making money in the stock market is as easy as making a cup of coffee if you learn how to read the pulse of the market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/taking-stock-of-the-market-bull-run-boosts-finance-literacy-programmes-in-delhi-101635098042226.html
