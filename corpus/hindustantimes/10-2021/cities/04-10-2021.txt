The funds were approved in December last year; however, it is unlikely that residents will feel the effect of the project this winter season as, according to officials, it is likely to be completed by the end of the current financial year or, at the earliest, the end of December this year.Every year, during the winter season, the district usually sees a spike in air pollution.Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said that the fifteenth finance commission had allotted ₹121 crore last year for air quality improvement and solid waste management, and they will devote equal amounts of ₹60.5 crore each to both.A district-level committee of officers has also approved the plan under which the Ghaziabad municipal corporation gave its nod to detailed infrastructure improvement measures.“We have completed all the tenders for air quality improvement, and several work orders have also been issued. More work orders will be awarded soon. The works are likely to be completed by the end of the current financial year, but we are expediting projects and it is likely that we may complete these by end of December this year,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.To improve air quality, the corporation plans to pave dusty road patches with greenery and stones and add more greenery to 200 existing parks.The corporation will also devote funds to develop a city forest on 32 acres of land near the New Bus Adda Metro station.Ghaziabad will also get 30 big air filters, which the corporation has decided to install in major markets and commercial areas to help reduce pollutionThe corporation also plans to procure six more anti-smog guns, each with a capacity of 6,000 litres.“We are also initiating a project in Vasundhara zone, which comprises localities such as Kaushambi and Vaishali. Under the pilot project, we plan to introduce e-vehicles for the lifting and transportation of daily solid waste. So, this will also improve conditions,” Tanwar added.However, the project has already been delayed due to the pandemic situation.According to government data, Ghaziabad is listed among 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh with high levels of air pollution.Cities are declared non-attainment if, over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM10 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide).“This year, too, we are in the process of chalking out the action plan for winter and will add more pollution hotspots to the existing list. We also plan to prosecute contractors who have not completed infrastructure works such as road repair and construction on time. Such incomplete works are aiding air pollution,” said Utsav Sharma, regional office of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board.Environmentalists said that the delays are a regular feature of plans which need immediate attention.“If the works are going to be completed by the end of the financial year or even by the end of December this year, there will be no relief from air pollution this winter either. Ghaziabad has been recording high air quality index readings in the severe category for the past several winters. External factors such as stubble burning will also aid pollution,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-initiates-works-for-air-quality-improvement-pollution-reduction-101633372149092.html

04-10-2021||Noida||Forest dept names former Ghaziabad mayor in tree-felling case||The officials of the divisional forest department said on Monday that they have registered a case against former city mayor Ashu Verma and his gardener under the provisions of the Tree Protection Act, 1976 for chopping down four full-grown Alstonia trees without permission.The trees were growing in front of a vacant house next to Verma’s in Sector 9, Raj Nagar. According to the forest department, it is an offence to fell full-grown trees without its approval.Officials of the department said that the felling took place on September 30 and came to light on October 1 after environmentalists visited the spot upon information and complained to the forest department.“We registered a case under provisions of the Tree Protection Act, and it figures the names of Ashu Verma and his gardener. The trees which were found chopped down at the site are estimated to be about 15 years old and we could find only a few feet of their main trunks at the spot. The provisions of the Act stipulate financial penalty, and its quantum will be decided later upon investigation,” said Ashok Gupta, officiating forest ranger.“For now, we have seized the logs of wood which our team found at the spot,” he added.Verma, however, denied his involvement and said that he cannot be held responsible for what happened outside his neighbour’s house.The former mayor, on October 1, had said that his neighbour’s house was empty and sealed.“I have no involvement with what happens outside my neighbour’s house. I am a political person and often have to travel outside the city for different works. In fact, I got about 200 trees planted this monsoon season and many of them were procured from the forest department,” Verma said.“I will meet the forest department officials since they have held me responsible for the incident... they must prove it with evidence,” he added.Environmentalist Akash Vashishtha, a lawyer and resident of Raj Nagar, had visited the spot on October 1 upon information and briefed the forest department.“The office of the forest department is about a kilometre away from the site and they had no information. Now, after having registered a case, the officials must investigate and act in accordance with the law. The city’s forest cover has hardly shown improvement and the city also suffers from high levels of air pollution, so it is imperative that people should save and protect trees,” Vashishtha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/forest-dept-names-former-ghaziabad-mayor-in-tree-felling-case-101633371849114.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||20-year-old beaten up by residents over suspicion of theft in outer Delhi, dies||A 20-year-old man died after he was allegedly beaten up by a group of people on the suspicion of theft in outer Delhi’s Kirari Suleman Nagar near Aman Vihar in the early hours of Monday, police said.The body of the man, identified as Vishal Singh, has been preserved at the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital’s (SGMH’s) mortuary for autopsy. The police have written to the Delhi government to constitute a panel of doctors for conducting the post-mortem examination, senior police officers said.“The exact reason behind Singh’s death will be ascertained once the autopsy is done. Further legal action in the matter will be taken accordingly,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parminder Singh.DCP Singh said around 5am Monday, the Sultanpuri police station received a call wherein the caller informed the police that a “thief” was caught from Kirari Suleman Nagar. A police team was sent there to verify the information. The team learnt from locals that the thief had entered a house in the neighbourhood.“When the occupants of the house woke up on hearing some sound, the thief allegedly jumped off the terrace of the house, in a bid to escape. He was allegedly caught and assaulted by the public. The injured man was shifted to the hospital, where he was declared brought dead. There were no visible injury marks on his body. It is being ascertained whether the man died of the alleged assault or due to the fall from the terrace,” said DCP Singh.A case of house trespass and attempt to theft was registered on the complaint of the house owner, Sumit. No case was registered in the alleged assault case, as the autopsy report is still awaited, the police said.A month ago, a 25-year-old unidentified man died after he was tied to a tree and beaten up by a group of people on the suspicion of theft in outer Delhi’s Narela Industrial Area. Two men were arrested in that case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20yearold-beaten-up-by-residents-over-suspicion-of-theft-in-outer-delhi-dies-101633371789223.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to HC: Will update portal to register Muslim, Christian marriages||The Delhi government on Monday informed the Delhi high court that it will issue administrative instructions within two months to update its web portal with the necessary options to register online both Muslim and Christian marriages.Justice Rekha Palli was informed by advocate Shadan Farasat, additional standing counsel for the Delhi government, that the online software for marriage registration currently has option to register only marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and the Special Marriage Act (SMA).Farasat said he is writing to the revenue secretary to make the changes across the board as this is a frequently encountered problem.Farasat’s submissions came while the court was hearing a plea by an NGO, challenging the practice of registering Muslim marriages under the Special Marriage Act (SMA) instead of the Compulsory Registration Marriage Order, which allows for the registration of the alliance as soon as it is solemnised.The petition, filed by the NGO Dhanak for Humanity, and individual petitioner Mohammad Adnan, has contended that despite being a religious union and not an interfaith wedding, Muslims were being subjected to a 30-day notice period -- to call for objections to the union -- under the Special Marriage Act.The plea said Adnan and his wife came from their home town to Delhi to solemnise their marriage and was subjected to the 30-day notice period under the SMA.The plea contended that this violated the fundamental rights of the parties concerned and the requirement of 30-day notice period under the SMA was very cumbersome to persons who came from another place.On the last date, the court had granted time to the Delhi government to take instructions on the matter.On Monday, the Delhi government counsel said the couple can get their marriage registered after filling a form, which he would supply within the course of the day.Farasat further assured the court that this problem will also be examined and appropriate administrative directions will be issued in this regard within two months. Taking note of the submissions, the court disposed of the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-hc-will-update-portal-to-register-muslim-christian-marriages-101633371729169.html
04-10-2021||Lucknow||Opposition leaders stopped from going to Lakhimpur Kheri on day of detentions||The battle lines between the Uttar Pradesh government and Opposition parties were drawn on Sunday night after eight people were killed in violence in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh , resulting in a situation which saw a spate of detentions on Monday.Many of the Opposition leaders from UP and other states announced that they would leave for Lakhimpur Kheri, setting the stage for high-tension drama that unfolded quite predictably.For instance, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra landed at Lucknow on late Sunday evening. Soon, she attempted to head to Lakhimpur Kheri with a team of leaders and a large contingent of party workers despite being detained at her Lucknow residence, the Kaul House.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra made an abortive attempt to leave his house for Lakhimpur Kheri around the same time. Aam Aadmi Party MP and UP in-charge Sanjay Singh too made a bid around midnight. He was detained in Sitapur and sent back.Some other leaders had announced that they would go to Lakhimpur Kheri Monday morning.They included Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Dal president Jayant Chaudhary, Chattishgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder S Randhawa. Besides, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced she would send five Trinamool Congress (TMC) MPs to Lakhimpur Kheri.Amid rain at night, Priyanka broke the police cordon around her Lucknow residence and walked out, locked horns with police on duty, boarded her car and proceeded towards Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the victims’ families. However, police stopped her at several spots, including allegedly by blocking the path with trucks, but her motorcade managed to cross the hurdles. Priyanka had a heated altercation with the police and she even warned them till she was finally stopped at Hariya in Sitapur district near Lakhimpur Kheri around 2am. There, she was detained and sent to the PAC guest house. Many of her video clips made by Congress workers went viral all through the night and the next day, showing her travel, altercations and sweeping the floor with a broom in the room where she was detained.Chandrashekhar Azad of Bhim Army, who did not have a convoy like the other leaders, managed to sneak into Lakhimpur Kheri and reached the spot by dawn.The police had a tough time on the road from Lucknow to Lakhimpur through the night and the day.Around midnight, the Lucknow police began barricading Lucknow’s Vikramaditya Marg that houses Akhilesh Yadav’s residence and the Samajwadi Party headquarters.To prevent him going, the police allegedly made some transporters block the road at both ends by parking trucks across. The trucks were allowed to leave when the anti-riot force in large numbers were deployed all around Akhilesh’s house and the SP office.Akhilesh Yadav made an attempt to drive off at around 8 am, but was stopped. Soon afterwards, some unidentified persons set a police jeep on fire. While the police held SP workers responsible, Samajwadi Party blamed the police for the fire. Around 10am, a large crowd of SP workers with party flags gathered near the cordoned off area.Akhilesh, along with SP national general secretary Ramgopal Yadav, sat on the road outside his residence and shouted anti-government statements.Within in half-an-hour, the police detained him and sent him to the Eco Gardens (built in BSP chief Mayawati’s regime) nearly 5 km away. He was released from detention around 5pm.Many SP workers clashed with police. The police resorted to a lathicharge and packed several of them into buses to Eco Gardens. While in the vehicle, Akhilesh tweeted: “All party workers and leaders should sit on dharna wherever they are.”Samajwadi Party and Congress leaders protested in almost all the districts across the state. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) protested largely in the western UP districts. Around two dozen RLD leaders, including its state president Masood Ahmad, were detained near Bakshi Ka Talab on the outskirts of Lucknow.Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia chief Shivpal Yadav managed to leave his house through the backdoor while the police were focusing on Akhilesh’s house and the SP office.His convoy sped off but the police later intercepted it and detained him at the Lucknow police lines. He was released hours later.Punjab deputy chief minsiter Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who took the road route to Lakhimpur Kheri from Punjab, was detained by UP police immediately on entering Saharanpur. Earlier in the day, he was denied permission by the UP government to reach Lucknow by air.UP cabinet minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh, in a statement, said: “We are taking the matter seriously and it is under investigation. CM has said the culprits will be punished. The Opposition is using the incident for political tourism and political competition as polls are around the corner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/opposition-leaders-stopped-from-going-to-lakhimpur-kheri-on-day-of-detentions-101633371672176.html
04-10-2021||Noida||Lakhimpur Kheri aftermath: Heightened police checking causes jam on DND Flyway||A number of people were stuck in traffic jam on the DND Flyway on Monday morning as police set up barricades to check vehicles in the wake of protests at several places in the city over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. The Noida police diverted the Delhi-bound traffic to Chilla border and the traffic movement remained slow between 8am and 11am, officials said. A police team headed by deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ganesh Prasad Saha reached the spot and tried to ease the situation. Saha said that the Delhi Police had set up barricades on their side at the DND Flyway. “The Noida police also put up barricades to check vehicles entering Noida due to security reasons. This slowed down traffic movement at the DND Flyway. We soon diverted the traffic to the Chilla border. However, due to high volume of traffic, the vehicular movement was slow at Chilla border too,” he said. Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2, Noida’s Sector 78, said that he was stuck in jam for 50 minutes while going to Delhi. “Police personnel were randomly checking vehicles. This led to a massive jam on the DND Flyway,” he said.Several commuters took to social media to enquire about the traffic situation. Ashish Jain, a commuter, tagged Noida traffic police in a tweet, seeking information about the expected time by which the jam would end. The officials also said that the Film City road (Noida-Greater Noida side) remained congested as the workers were fixing streetlights. Meanwhile, several groups of farmers and members of opposition parties protested at several places in the city over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including farmers, were killed on Sunday. Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ambawata) held a protest outside the Noida city magistrate’s office. Rajesh Upadhyaya, Gautam Budh Nagar district president of the BKU faction, said that the farmers are pained over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. “The government is behaving as if farmers are their enemy. We demand compensation to the deceased farmers’ kin and jobs to their dependents,” he said. Another group of farmers also protested at the district collectorate in Surajpur. Deepak Vig, president, Noida unit of Samajwadi Party, also led a protest outside the city magistrate’s office. “Our leader Akhilesh Yadav has been illegally detained when he was trying to reach Lakhimpur Kheri. The party workers are angry over the issue. The government is muzzling the opposition in the state,” he said. Shahabuddin, Noida president of Congress, said that his party workers protested at the city magistrate’s office. “We made a sit-in protest and demanded immediate release of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. A police team reached the spot and detained us. Nearly 17 party workers were later released from police station,” he said. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said some protesters were detained from the spot. “They were released later. No case was registered against them,” he said. Uma Shankar Singh, Noida city magistrate, said that he has received the memorandums from different groups over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. “We will forward these memorandums to the government. The protest was peaceful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/lakhimpur-kheri-aftermath-heightened-police-checking-causes-jam-on-dndflyway-101633371669021.html

04-10-2021||Mumbai||100-year-old building collapses in Kalbadevi in south Mumbai, passerby dies||A 61-year-old man was declared dead after a ground-plus-four building collapsed in Kalbadevi area of south Mumbai on Sunday. The incident was reported at 10.35pm, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) disaster management cell said.The building, which was around 100 years old, was declared dilapidated by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada). The authority, which owned the structure, had also issued a notice to the tenants to vacate the building. However, the tenants did not move out. According to Mhada officials, after the toilet on the ground floor developed cracks, the building tilted, following which around 20 tenants of the building vacated the structure on Sunday around 5.30pm.According to Mhada officials, around 10pm, the dilapidated Khanderaowadi Building Number 5 came down crashing down on a passerby who was talking on phone. The man, identified as Sundara Saw, was rushed to Sir JJ Hospital, but was declared dead on arrival.Local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Aakash Raj Purohit said a major tragedy was averted as the building was evacuated in evening. “After a part of the toilet collapsed, the fire brigade and police were called. There were around 20 people inside the building and all of them were evacuated by the fire brigade. Also, one family from a nearby building was moved as a safety measure,” Purohit said.While he claimed that Khanderao Building Number 5 was around 50 years old, Mhada has maintained that the structure is close to around 100 years old. “The entire building was occupied by commercial labourers who do gold polishing and make jewellery,” Purohit added.However, Mhada said that of the 20 tenants, only one was officially commercial, and the rest were residential tenants. Arun Dongre, chief of Mhada’s repair board, said, “The building was around 100 years old and had 20 tenants of which one was a commercial tenant. Thankfully, we had evacuated all those inside the building around four hours before the collapse, averting a major incident. Another nearby building, which is also a ground-plus-four structure, has also been vacated and residents in other neighbouring buildings will also be evacuated, if required.”Meanwhile, there are over 14,000 dilapidated buildings in the city, of which a majority are in south Mumbai. Every year, a pre-monsoon structural audit is conducted by both BMC and Mhada. Earlier, this week Mhada had said that it has issued notices to 21 ‘extremely dangerous buildings’ in south Mumbai. Around 717 tenants in these 21 buildings have been asked to vacate their buildings on an immediate basis. Those who vacate their buildings are accommodated in transit camps on a temporary basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/100yearold-building-collapses-in-kalbadevi-in-south-mumbai-passerby-dies-101633371129112.html
04-10-2021||Mumbai||Resident doctors in Maharashtra call off strike||The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) called off their state-wide strike late on Monday evening after a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The doctors were assured a special incentive for their contribution during the pandemic and better upkeep of the hostels but their other primary demands were put forward for deliberations. The state-wide strike began on Friday after a series of meetings between MARD representatives and state government officials. MARD had put forward three primary demands – waiver of academic fees during the pandemic year, non-deduction of the tax deducted at source (TDS) from the stipend and better upkeep of the hostels. A media statement issued by MARD said that fee waiver was not possible due to technical reasons. However, the state has decided to discuss this issue with experts from the field. “The TDS issue will also be discussed by appointing a chartered account,” it said. As far as the special incentive is concerned, the state has agreed to deliberate and come up with an amount, which is likely to be paid from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.“The resident doctors in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run hospitals already get Covid-19 incentive. The resident doctors in state government hospitals should also get it now,” said Dr Madhav Bhondave, a third-year resident doctor from state-run Sir JJ Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-in-maharashtra-call-off-strike-101633371071464.html
04-10-2021||Lucknow||Union petroleum minister says UP implementing projects faster||Union petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday said the UP government was implementing various development projects on a faster pace vis-à-vis the previous Samajwadi Party government in the state.“Uttar Pradesh is doing well in urban mobility sector. Out of 82 km operational metro rail in the state, 67 km has been commissioned during the tenure of Yogi government. Another 131 km is under construction. This includes 82 km Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System to be ready by June 2025,” Puri said here.Puri said the trial run of Kanpur Metro on 9.5 km route from IIT Kanpur to Motijheel section was likely to start by next month and its inauguration may take place by December. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to watch Ayodhya’s masterplan and futuristic model of the temple town and will also launch 75 urban projects in Lucknow on Tuesday. Puri, who is also Union housing and urban affairs minister, listed Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, PM Swadhini Yojana and SMART City scheme to make his point that Uttar Pradesh was among the top performing states.Asked about the PNG connections, he said 22,000-km pipeline was being laid against a target of 35,000-km pipeline. He said about 4,000-km pipeline will be laid in the current financial year. About Lucknow, he said more PNG connections would be given expeditiously in the state capital in coming months. Puri said only 72,000 piped natural gas (PNG) connections had been given in Lucknow against a target of 4.9 lakh connections by 2022. He said the target would be achieved by giving expeditious connections.Puri said the number of LPG retail outlets had gone up significantly in the state. He said there were only 6,043 retail outlets when the Yogi government was installed and that the number had gone up to 9,810 now. He said the LPG distributorship had also increased by 33 percent. Puri said the number of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations had gone up to from 115 in 2017 to 502 now. Puri will also distribute free gas connections to beneficiaries of Ujjwala scheme on Tuesday.In Lucknow, there were 12 CNG stations earlier and this number had gone up to 37 now, he said. He gave statistics about how the number of LPG connections had gone up and said in areas like Lucknow the saturation was nearly 100 percent. He said more connections were being given under unsaturated areas. Puri said three refills were given free under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana and the beneficiaries were getting their LPG cylinders refilled.He said UP was the first state to have come out with its own civil aviation policy. The minister said Airports Authority of India had spent ₹2000 crore on different projects in the state. He said UP had four airports before installation of the Yogi government and out of them only two were being regularly used. Puri said UP now had eight operational airports.

Investigators said they will now secure the custody of Chaudhary, who is presently lodged in Tihar jail, to question him in connection with the case.Among the latest arrests by the crime branch team between Saturday and Sunday includes 36-year-old habitual criminal, Rajesh alias Rawan, who was wanted by the crime branch in a case registered under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) this year. Three others were arrested by the Fatehpur Beri police on Saturday. At least two more suspects are yet to be nabbed, police said.On October 1 around 6.30pm, a group of 9-10 bike-borne men carrying iron rods, sticks, hammers and firearms arrived at the office of property dealers, Jaiveer and Mahesh, in Aya Nagar and started assaulting Jaiveer, said deputy commissioner of police (crime and legal cell) Rajesh Deo.“As Mahesh tried to rescue Jaiveer, the attackers rushed to assault him. However, Mahesh locked himself inside the office. The attackers vandalised the door and windows using the rods and hammers. While leaving the place, the assailants fired at least two shots but nobody was hurt,” said the DCP.The next day, the Fatehpur Beri police arrested Vishnu Chaudhary, Rahul Rawat and Ashu Tanwar, all residents of Aya Nagar. On the same day, DCP Deo said, the crime branch team received information that the main suspect, Rajesh aka Rawan, was trying to flee Delhi.Accordingly, a trap was laid and he was arrested on Saturday from near Kherki Daula toll plaza in Gurugram while he was driving a Swift car. His interrogation led to the arrest of Shashi Lala, Shivam and Sumit, said Deo.“Their interrogation revealed that Rohit Chaudhary had sent a message to Rajesh to meet his brother, Vishnu Chaudhary, and uncle (name not revealed) to kill the property dealers who were in possession of the disputed plot in their village. Rajesh arranged his associates and directed them to execute the plan,” added DCP Deo.In March this year, Chaudhary, who figured in Delhi Police’s list of top 10 most wanted criminals and carried a reward of ₹4 lakh on his arrest, was arrested along with his associate following a gunfight with a crime branch team near Bhairon Marg in central Delhi. Chaudhary, who was shot in his leg, was wanted in many cases including that of MCOCA, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-probe-role-of-jailed-gangster-in-firing-at-delhi-realtors-office-101633370588997.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Lakhimpur violence: 95 detained for protesting outside UP Bhawan||Ninety-five people, including 25 women, belonging to various political parties and student organisations were detained on Monday for allegedly holding a protest outside the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Bhawan in Delhi to express their anger over Sunday’s violent clashes in Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people, including four farmers, were killed. The detained protesters were taken to the Mandir Marg police station, from where they were released in the evening.A case was registered for violating Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which prohibits public gathering of four or more people in a specified area, and for defying the Covid-19 guidelines of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) that has banned all types of protests, political and religious gatherings in Delhi, said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav. He said no permission was sought for holding the protest outside UP Bhawan.Police said between noon and 2pm on Monday, nearly 300 members and activists of political and students organisations such as Indian Youth Congress, Samajwadi Party, Students’ Federation of India (SFI), and the All India Students Association (AISA), among others, gathered outside UP Bhawan on Sardar Patel Marg in Chanakyapuri and raised slogans.“Even after repeated warnings regarding the imposition of Section 144 in the area and the DDMA guidelines, the protesters did not leave. A total of 70 men and 25 women were detained and taken to the Mandir Marg police station. They were later released,” said DCP Yadav.Delhi Congress leaders said two demonstrations were held on Monday against the murder of farmers in Lakhimpur and the arrest of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, who was on her way to visit the families of the slain farmers. According to the party, over 200 members and supporters participated in the two protests. “Farmers have been protesting for the past 10 months, demanding the repeal of the three anti-farmer laws passed by the BJP government, but due to the arrogance of PM Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, high-handed attacks were mounted on the food providers of this country, the humble farmer, to show their political might,” said Anil Choudhary, Delhi Congress chief.He further said, “Under the Modi and Yogi governments, democracy has been murdered and citizens have lost their right to raise their voices against injustice, and despite the Supreme Court taking cognizance of the farmer agitation, and directing the central government to find a solution to the crippling of the borders, the Modi government has not yet acted.”Congress leaders also stressed that the party will continue to support the demands of the farmers and will also continue their protests against the BJP government for their apathy to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lakhimpur-violence-95-detained-for-protesting-outside-up-bhawan-101633370289339.html

According to the police, the case has been registered under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal conspiracy, forgery and cheating against the teachers who got appointed in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) area of the state. As per a press release, the accused generated forged teacher eligibility test (TET) certificates and submitted them to the director of education in Kokrajhar and got appointments in schools of BTR. Based on an initial inquiry, which revealed the allegations of wrongdoing by the teachers to be genuine, the police acted on the directions of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and registered the case. Raids were carried out at various places on Sunday to trace the accused, the release said. “Several accused have been brought to the CID headquarters in Guwahati from various districts of Assam for interrogation and verification of documents,” the release said. The investigation conducted so far revealed that forged TET certificates were submitted by the accused to portray as if they had qualified even though the accused failed the test. In some cases, fake roll numbers have been used and in some cases roll numbers of successful candidates were misused by unsuccessful candidates for generating forged certificates. “The candidates have dishonestly and fraudulently obtained appointment letters thereby causing long term impact on the state’s education system which will adversely impact the careers of several innocent students,” the release said. The TET qualification is the minimum criteria required in India for a person to be eligible for an appointment as a teacher for Classes 1 to 8. It is mandatory for teaching in government schools. The TET examinations are conducted by both the Centre and states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/36-teachers-booked-in-assam-for-getting-appointed-in-govt-schools-using-fake-certificates-101633370113400.html

Rana was the most prominent Hindu face of the National Conference in the Jammu region. He is the younger brother of Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh. Despite the massive Modi wave in 2014, Rana had won the Nagrota assembly seat on an NC ticket. “I am still the provincial president of the National Conference. What will I do and what not, will be shared with the media but I want to say again that there shall be no compromise on the aspirations of Jammu region and its people,” he said. Amid speculations, Choudhary Lal Singh, founder of Dogra Swabhiman Sangthan and former PDP legislator Surinder Choudhary met Rana at his residence on Monday. “For the cause of Jammu, we will talk to everyone… friends and guests come to meet you and to host them is my duty. So far, as the cause of Jammu is concerned, nine months ago I begged before BJP, Congress, PDP, National Conference and Panthers Party,” he said. “I talked to everyone and I am ready to talk to everyone so that welfare of Jammu is ensured and it is possible only when we keep aside our political interests and come together to contribute our bit for Jammu…for Duggar Pradesh,” said Rana. Rana was once a close confidante of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah. He said, “After all, we are from Jammu whether it is BJP, PDP, DSS, Panthers Party, Apni Party or even intellectuals, people from trade and commerce, civil society. We should put our interests behind and think about Jammu”. Rana further said, “We should strive for a narrative of Jammu, which should be by Jammu, from Jammu and for an inclusive Jammu and Kashmir”. On October 2, Rana said the people of the region were determined to end the era of despondency, deprivation and neglect by fighting for their just and legitimate rights. Party president and Lok Sabha member Dr Farooq Abdullah refused to speak on the issue saying, “I can’t say anything”. However, it has been learnt that the Abdullahs were acerbic over the ‘unpleasant’ developments in Jammu. “Rana was considered Omar’s backbone in Jammu. At the same time, the exit of an individual is not going to impact the party,” said a senior NC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/speculations-rife-over-ncp-s-devender-singh-rana-quitting-national-conference-101633369390299.html

The couple moved the high court against this order of the district judge. “The order of injunction dated (December 7, 2019) passed by the trial court is restored with the condition that the petitioners shall pay the monthly charges for their occupation inclusive of the charges for the meals and electricity at a tentative rate of ₹12,000 per month for both the petitioners at the end of every month,” said the court. “In light of the discussions hereinabove, the impugned order dated October 20, 2020 passed in miscellaneous civil appeal is set aside. The order of the trial court subject to above conditions shall stand restored,” said the court. The high court also ordered the trial court to complete the trial within one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hc-restrains-old-age-home-in-lucknow-from-evicting-old-couple-101633369328788.html

He also announced that an HR (human resource) policy would be brought for MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) workers like one in Uttar Pradesh State Rural Livelihood Mission within a month.“Under the defined HR policy, MNREGA workers will be entitled to 24 days’ casual leave and 12 days’ medical leave,” he said.Yogi Adityanath also announced adding many other works of the rural development department in the job chart of MNREGA workers. After this, the consent of the deputy commissioner MNREGA would be necessary before termination of the services of gram rozgar sevaks so that no one can remove them forcibly.He said that if the gram rozgar sevaks happened to be the close relatives or family members of the newly elected gram pradhan, they would be posted in the nearest vacant gram panchayat and their services would not be terminated. “Similarly, after the marriage of the gram sevika, she will be posted in the new district.

Our team is already tracking down people whose second doses are due, and we have also increased the number of vaccination sites for the same.”According to the health department records, over 83,900 doses administered over the past five days were second doses, compared to over 22,000 first doses. In September, the district task force decided to undertake vaccinations at places of worship, vegetable markets, post offices and banks, to extend the reach of the drive. The health department will also be coordinating with 1,221 residents’ welfare associations in this regard. On Monday, a total of 16,003 people were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district, with 4,619 people being given the first dose and 11,384 people being given the second dose of the vaccines. So far, over 3.1 million doses of vaccines have been administered in the district. On Tuesday, the first and second doses of Covishield will be administered at 78 centres and the second dose of Covaxin will be administered at five centres. Sputnik V vaccines will be administered at the Sector 31 polyclinic. Meanwhile, six new Covid-19 cases and 10 recoveries were reported on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccinations-drive-extended-to-15-temples-madarasa-101633367712061.html
04-10-2021||Gurugram||Atul Kataria Chowk: Flyover, underpass to open in December||Work on a flyover and an underpass at Atul Kataria Chowk is 80% complete and they are likely to open to the public by December, officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said on Monday.“The construction of the flyover is almost 80% ready and it would be opened to public by December this year. This flyover and underpass will help ease traffic congestion at this junction, which sees traffic from internal sectors, Huda City Centre and Dwarka Expressway,” Suresh Kumar Chahal, the joint chief executive officer of the GMDA, said. The project, which was approved by the state government in 2018, was initially expected to be completed in November 2019, but hit roadblocks and the deadline was moved to May 2021. However, the revised deadline could not be met as the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns hindered the completion of the project, officials said. Officials of the Public Works Department also cited a design conflict, due to the presence of a GMDA drainage box underground, which further delayed the project as the alignment had to be rejigged.A 715-metre-long flyover will be constructed from the Gurgaon Bus Stand to Kapashera, along the Old Delhi Road, and a 620-metre-long underpass will be constructed from the Sheetla Mata Temple to Maharana Pratap Chowk. Service roads and drains are also being constructed alongside. Traffic movement is normal at Atul Kataria Chowk with no routes diverted as work for the underpass is going on internally, with no disruptions on the surface. A sloping section of the Lt Atul Kataria Marg, where the underpass is being constructed, was shut for over a month from the last week of January for excavation work.The Atul Kataria Chowk is a key junction, where traffic from the border areas and older parts of the city converge. The two infrastructure projects are expected to benefit residents travelling towards the Dwarka Expressway, Gurgaon Railway Station, Gurgaon Bus Stand, Kapashera border, Sheetla Mata Temple, Signature Towers and Huda City Centre.Officials said the flyover and underpass would decongest sectors 12, 14, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 17, Maruti industrial area and Udyog Vihar. Puneet Kumar, executive engineer, construction division, PWD, said, “The work would have been completed earlier but during construction of the underpass, we realised that it was hitting an underground box drain of the GMDA. We had to rework the project and ensure that the underpass did not obstruct the drain. Around 70% of the work of the underpass has been done, with the walls of the underpass being ready; we just have to put the raft for carriageway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/atul-kataria-chowk-flyover-underpass-to-open-in-december-101633367711044.html

However, officials said that the drive went off smoothly, without any untoward incident. The illegal shops and shanties were located adjacent to the Moulsari Avenue Rapid Metro station in DLF Phase-3, behind the offices and commercial buildings in Cyber City.“All the eight shops razed were owned by a single person. Subsequently, the team also took action to remove the slums settled on around one acre of government land. MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja has given clear instructions to the joint commissioners and in-charges of enforcement teams of the four zones to check unauthorised constructions, illegal encroachments, and encroachment in their respective areas, and such drives will continue in the future,” SS Rohilla, the public relation officer for MCG, said.The MCG has stepped up its anti-encroachment drives over the past three weeks.On September 22, the MCG demolished eight under-construction structures in Satguru Enclave and Noble Enclave, areas that fall under the 900-metre radius of the Indian Air Force (IAF) ammunition depot in Sector 14.On September 22, MCG officials also demolished at least 50 illegal structures, including eateries, tin sheds, workshops, vends, and courtyards, at Bandhwari village on the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road.On September 20, the MCG reclaimed 70 square yards of civic land by demolishing illegal temporary structures, shanties, junk, and building material shops in Nathupur village, after complaints were filed with the CM Window.In a related development, the enforcement team of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran on Monday carried out a demolition drive in Sector 9 and reclaimed two acres. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that the land was notified for construction of a school but it had been encroached upon. A service centre, permanent rooms and other illegal structures were constructed. “A team of enforcement, with support of city police, carried out demolitions and cleared the land,” Lot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-conducts-anti-encroachment-drive-in-nathupur-village-101633367709945.html

The decision was taken last week in a meeting chaired by the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, wherein the issues of arbitrary installation of gates and hindrances to public movement were discussed.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said, “The internal roads in a colony can have boom barriers that must be manned permanently by security personnel so that movement of people is not curbed. This will ensure safety and security of residents is not affected.”DTCP officials said that a meeting was held last Friday, under the chairmanship of the deputy commissioner, to decide on applications submitted by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) for installation of additional gates. During the meeting, it was also decided that permission would be given to the Sun City colony for the erection of a wall after demarcation of land by DTCP and forest departments, officials said.“The decision to allow construction of wall in Sun City colony will definitely help the residents. The permission for additional gates should have been given but boom barriers with manned security will also serve the purpose,” VMK Singh, a member of Sun City RWA, said. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that permission was sought by several RWAs in plotted colonies to set up additional gates but they have been told to erect boom barriers instead and man them permanently. “They were told that gates on main roads and revenue roads will not be allowed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-disallows-gates-on-public-roads-through-licensed-colonies-101633367708703.html
04-10-2021||Gurugram||MCG initiates probe into double payment for contracted works in Palam Vihar||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has initiated a probe into a double payment made to a contractor for drainage and road works in Palam Vihar. The MCG’s vigilance wing issued a show-cause notice to at least 16 MCG officials and the contractor concerned, seeking an explanation on the matter, officials said on Monday.Senior MCG officials said that although the contractor has returned the additional payment, the matter continues to be under probe.The issue of double payment was initially raised by senior deputy mayor Pramila Kablana, who is the councillor of Ward 9, where the work was undertaken. The contractor was selected in November 2018 for laying a new drainage line, setting up manholes, and building roads in Palam Vihar.After the project was completed, Kablana issued a work-satisfactory certificate to the contractor, based on which payment of ₹47 lakh was done by the MCG, officials said.“Just two months after the payment was made, the same contractor was paid ₹44 lakh by the MCG upon presenting the November 2018 work order. I was alerted about the issue and accordingly, informed senior MCG officials about the same, based on which a probe has been initiated. The MCG needs to ensure the additional payment is recovered and action is taken against the violators,” Kablana said.As per the MCG rules, payment to contractors for localised projects can be sanctioned only after the area councillor issues a work-satisfactory certificate, which essentially indicates that the work has been completed and that required standards have been met.A senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “Such a situation (of double payment) has never occurred in MCG’s history. There is a strong possibility that the MCG officials may have simply been negligent and sanctioned the project cost for a second time inadvertently. However, we are not ruling out the possibility of the contractor and few MCG officials being mixed up, and hence, have asked all the officials concerned for an explanation.”The official said that almost all the 16 MCG officials issued show-cause notices are from the engineering wing.MCG’s chief engineer, TL Sharma, could not be reached for comment.“If the replies of the contractor and MCG officials are deemed to be unsatisfactory, then the MCG will immediately blacklist the contractor while a copy of the matter would be sent to the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB) for suspending, terminating, or transferring the officials concerned,” a second MCG official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-initiates-probe-into-double-payment-for-contracted-works-in-palam-vihar-101633367648989.html

A Punjab government spokesperson said UP home secretary had informed the Punjab civil aviation director that landing and taking off of the CM’s helicopter at Lakhimpur Kheri was not feasible in view of the law and order situation there, and also that fact that provisions of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) had been imposed. DEPUTY CM RANDHAWA, MLAs DETAINED IN SAHARANPUR After UP’s denial of permission, deputy CM Randhawa, along with some state MLAs, decided to go to Lakhmipur Kheri by road on Monday. However, the UP Police detained them in Saharanpur and took them to the Shahjhapur police post. Randhawa was accompanied by Congress state unit working president and MLA Kuljit Nagra. Other MLAs in the delegation are Parminder Singh Pinky; Barinder Singh Pahra; Kuldeep Vaid; Kulbir Singh Zira and Angad Saini. Randhawa has demanded that the perpetrators behind the Lakhimpur Kheri violence must be arrested, and has even drawn parallels of the incident with the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy for which the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government would never be forgiven. “The Punjab government would raise its voice at every forum about the incident and ensure justice for the victims’ families,” said Randhawa, also issuing an appeal to farmers to maintain peace.

He alleged that the PM’s ego had led to the killing of farmers at many protest sites. “The PM should act as the head of the family and respect the sentiments of farmers who have rejected the three agriculture laws. Not doing so will lead to further unrest in the country. The BJP government should understand farmers’ sentiments and resolve the matter at the earliest before any more lives are lost,” Sukhbir, in town to attend a road show in Ludhiana constituency said. Addressing the media at the Ram Darbar Mandir located in Sector 39 here, Sukhbir added, “A case under Section 302 (murder) should be registered with immediate effect against the culprit, Union minister of state for home Ajay Misra’s son Ashish Misra. A high-level probe must be conducted. The UP government should not protect the guilty.”There was high drama at the Jalandhar bypass during Sukhbir’s visit, when some youngsters owing allegiance to the ruling Congress surrounded vehicles in Sukhbir’s convoy and showed black flags, raising slogans against the Bada family.

04-10-2021||Mumbai||Fisherfolk write to Uddhav Thackeray, voice objections to coastal zone management plan||Members of the Mumbai’s fishing community who are objecting to the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Mumbai — which was recently approved by the union ministry for environment and climate change — wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, voicing specific concerns and demands in the matter. While the approved CZMP has been welcomed by builders as it will open up large tracts of coastal land for real estate projects, fisherfolk fear that the plan will facilitate land grabs in and around koliwadas, and degrading fishing commons by putting them in close proximity to development activities.“We wish to bring to your notice that the MoEFCC, Govt of India, has recently approved the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) prepared by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for Mumbai City and Suburbs. This is a serious attack on our rights under the CRZ regime and will have far reaching negative impacts on fishing, fishing communities and the coastal environment of Mumbai,” stated Monday’s letter, authored by Devendra Tandel, chairman of the Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti.Speaking to Hindustan Times on Monday, Tandel alleged the recently sanctioned CZMP to be in violation of not only the overarching Coastal Regulatory Zone (2019) framework, but also the municipal corporation’s own Development Control and Promotion Regulations 2034 — or development plan 2034 — which is awaiting final notification.“All the koliwadas in Mumbai are supposed to be mapped and demarcated in the coastal zone management plan. This was a provision of the CRZ 2011, and remains in its updated 2019 version. In Mumbai, the koliwads have been mapped, but they have not been released for public scrutiny, revised and accordingly incorporated in the CZMP. That’s an outright violation,” Tandel explained.Community members also explained that the finalised CZMP, which will allow construction activities to take place at a distance of 50m from the high-tide line (as opposed to 500m as per the CRZ 2011 rules) will particularly endanger those parts of fishing villages which do not fall under the land revenue category of ‘gaothan’. “There are some restrictions on redevelopment in the gaothan, while parts of the koliwada falling outside the gaothan area were protected by the CRZ 2011 rules. It’s these parts, which tend to consist of koliwada ‘extensions’, which will become susceptible to redevelopment and land grabs,” said Tandel.Other fishing community leaders whom HT spoke with alleged that public consultations with Kolis and other fisherfolk were not adequately organised and publicised, as pre-legislative policy dictates. “What’s more alarming is that the revised Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) maps, which the state level coastal zone management authority approved in March this year, are not even public. We have no idea where the high-tide line has been drawn. This is a major lapse in governance which affects fisherfolk directly, whereas if you look at the parent law of the CRZ, it mandates that affected communities be taken into confidence,” said Rajesh Mangela, spokesperson of the National Fish Workers Forum and community leader from Moragaon village in Juhu. Mangela and others have also, in their letter to the chief minister, sought to keep in abeyance “all applications for CRZ clearances based on the recently approved CZMPs for Mumbai City and Suburbs” until fisherfolk’s demands are resolved.An official with the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority, seeking anonymity, responded to these allegations saying, “Both the state and the national coastal zone management authority have followed all due process and taken public feedback into account while drafting and approving the CZMPs for Mumbai city and suburbs. Aggrieved parties can approach the environment department, or any other mode of redressal they choose. Since they have addressed the chief minister I am sure their concerns will be addressed where required.”State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, in January, had written to former Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar seeking inclusion of Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMP) under the Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) Notification, 2019 for the districts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg.The draft CZMP maps were prepared by the NCSCM under the Union environment ministry in 2019 for all coastal districts in Maharashtra based on the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. They were published on January 22, 2020. These maps use distinct colour codes to demarcate CRZ areas (I to IV), high tide and hazard line, fishing zones, intertidal areas, mangrove forests and buffer areas, turtle nesting sites, cyclone shelters, koliwadas and gaothans. These maps also identify coastal areas that can be opened up for infrastructural development.“Public hearings were then held in February to receive objections and suggestions on the previous iteration of the CZMP, which was published in January 2020. It was learnt that the main objection is with regards to the coastal mapping in which regulatory zones have been delineated. The maps were revised keeping in mind public feedback. The MCZMA gave a go ahead on these changes, and the revised plans have now received the MoEFCC’s nod,” said an official privy to the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fisherfolk-write-to-uddhav-thackeray-voice-objections-to-coastal-zone-management-plan-101633362496548.html

Upset by RJD’s unilateral decision to name the candidates for both the seats, Congress, which had unsuccessfully contested from Kusheshwarsthan in 2020 polls, has also begun searching for a suitable candidate for Tarapur constituency in Munger district after a formal go-ahead by All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, on Monday. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, citing his conversation with Das, said the party’s nominees for both the seats would be announced on Tuesday after final clearance from the AICC chief Sonia Gandhi. “The party may reconsider its decision to contest both the seats only if RJD bows out of Kusheshwarsthan and support the Congress candidate there,” said Jha. “Former Congress legislature party leader Ashok Kumar, who is also working president of BPCC, is set to file his papers for Kusheshwarsthan seat in Darbhanga. He lost the seat to JD(U)’s Shashi Bhushan Hazari in 2020 assembly polls by a small margin,” said the Congress leader, adding that party’s deliberations were on to name a strong leader from Tarapur, where the party had fought last in 2010. In the ruling camp, the Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is firmly supporting JDU’s nominees, Rajiv K Singh and Aman Bhushan Hazari, in the fray for Tarapur and Kusheshwarsthan (reserved for the scheduled caste) seats. The names of candidates were announced by state BJP chief Sanjay Jaisawal two days ago. Senior Congress leader Kishore Kumar Jha said RJD always took his party for a ride and parted ways when it found a better opportunity. “Ideology is secondary thing for RJD, which ditched the Congress in 2000, 2009 and in 2010. Still, Congress relied heavily on RJD and remained eager to sacrifice the cadres’ aspirations in the name of the united opposition,” said Jha. Kadwa MLA and AICC secretary Shakeel Ahmad Khan said RJD indulged in opportunistic politics.The relationship between the two allies worsened recently after former JNU students’ union leader Kanhaiya Kumar left CPI and joined Congress. Though RJD leaders dismissed Kanhaiya’s joining as inconsequential in the state politics, senior party leader Shivanand Tiwari took a swipe at Congress, saying it should make the former JNUSU leader as its national chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bypolls-cong-rjd-set-to-part-ways-101633362069375.html

After his arrest in May this year, Yadav was lodged at Birpur jail in Supaul district, where he launched a hunger strike alleging that jail authorities had tortured him. On June 1 this year, Madhepura district and sessions court denied bail to Yadav. Later, the former MP was shifted to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for treatment.Earlier, the Patna high court had directed the Madhepura court to decide the case within six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pappu-yadav-acquitted-in-32-year-old-kidnapping-case-101633362009744.html

Thackeray was speaking at the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signing ceremony relating to Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP). The current fleet size of BEST is over 3,000, of which 386 are EV buses.The BMC on Monday signed MOU, including the Women for Climate, Cities for Forests Campaign and the e-Bus Mission. The MOUs were signed in the presence of state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and civic officials.Speaking at the event, Thackeray said, “We are one of the few cities to move towards climate friendly initiatives. This includes having women when it comes to finding solutions for climate changes, considering they are impacted in every such scenario. Following this, we are also focusing on increasing the trees in the city. It is not just about increasing tree cover in forest areas, but also in the city area. We must ensure that we involve our citizens in planting trees native to Mumbai and cool the neighbourhoods.”Thackeray further added, “The BEST currently has 386 EV buses and we are looking at 1,900 EV buses and 200 double-decker buses, converting 50% fleet to electric by 2023 & 100% by 2028. WRI India and GiZ will optimise a smooth transition for the consumer and last-mile connectivity for BEST.” The BEST also aims to set up 55 EV charging points in the city in the next three to four months followed by a mobile application for real-time updates on BEST buses by the end of December.Further, Thackeray also spoke about climate change in the form of changing rain patterns and the need for rainwater harvesting. He said, “We have seen many red alerts in the past few years, which have also included rain of around 250mm. If this is the type of rainfall, be it any city in the world, there will be waterlogging. There is nothing to lie here about it. Also, further with the adequate rainfall, we also need to focus on rainwater harvesting, considering a city like Mumbai has a lot of scope for it.”Meanwhile, at the event on Monday, the BMC also launched a logo having QR code that will be pasted outside housing societies where citizens are fully vaccinated. The logo of the same was unveiled at the hands of Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/best-fleet-to-be-100-electric-vehicles-aaditya-thackeray-101633362008589.html
04-10-2021||Patna||Nitish dismisses Niti Aayog’s damning report on Bihar’s health sector||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday dismissed the Niti Aayog’s report on the state’s health sector as “inappropriate” and said a formal and comprehensive reply to it would be sent to the commission. Talking to the media after his customary Janata Darbar, where people meet the CM with their grievances, Kumar questioned the modalities for the sectoral assessment of different states and alleged that the fundamentals and remarkable changes in the sectors were completely ignored in the Niti Aayog’s study of Bihar. Kumar was replying to a query on the Aayog’s recent report in which it had rated Bihar at the bottom of all the state in terms of availability of beds in district hospitals per lakh population. The report stated that Bihar has only six beds per lakh population as compared to 222 in Puducherry, 59 in Delhi and the national average of 24. “I don’t understand who and how the study is carried out? Is there any logic of comparing a poor state like Bihar with the prosperous Maharashtra? I will tell everything if I was given a chance to attend the Niti Aayog’s meeting,” said Kumar, adding there was tremendous advancement in the health sector ever since he took over as the CM. He said that nearly 10,000 people were being treated at a block-level hospital per month as against 39 in 2006. “We have launched free distribution of medicines in government hospitals, which was later followed by other states. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) is being developed as the country’s biggest hospital in terms of bed-capacity and infrastructure. The number of medical colleges and hospitals has also increased considerably. But these things were not considered by Niti Aayog,” the CM said,adding that people of Bihar no longer needed go out for treatment now. Kumar said Niti Aayog might have come in the existence much later, but it should not ignore the progresses in all sectors, including economic conditions, made by Bihar in the past. On the issue of caste-based enumeration of the population, Kumar said that he would convene an all-party meeting after the by-elections for Kusheshwarsthan and Tarapur assembly seats and discuss the way to do that in the wake of the Centre’s no to the proposal. “I still hope a consensus would be reached before deciding the fresh course of action on caste census,” Kumar said, apparently ignoring the change of stance of BJP leaders on the issue post the Central government’s reluctance to go for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-dismisses-niti-aayog-s-damning-report-on-bihar-s-health-sector-101633361948311.html

The police have recovered 88 grams of jewellery worth ₹2.68 lakh from him.According to the police, the accused, Kiran Saha, used to get his prospective victims involved in conversations on various pretexts on roads and then run away snatching their chains and mangalsutras.Bipin Kumar Singh, police commissioner of Navi Mumbai, said, “The accused used to accost people on roads and randomly told them things such as ‘you just touched a woman inappropriately,’ and ‘you hit a pregnant woman by speeding your motorbike’. Upon hearing that, the prospective victims would get distracted and then the accused snatched their chains. Using this modus operandi, he committed more than 125 crimes in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai.“In Navi Mumbai, the accused has cases registered against him in Rabale, Turbhe, Koparkhairane, and Vashi police stations. In Mumbai, he has cases against him in Vakola, Mahim, Bhandup, NM Joshi Marg, Pant Nagar and Andheri police stations. Earlier, he used to stay in a slum in Ghatkopar.

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Art transcends borders and artists belong to the world||A visit to the Lahore Museum was on the itinerary of our delegation. I was looking forward to seeing it because I had been hearing about it since childhood from my father and uncles, who migrated to India after Partition. The museum is housed in an imposing building in front of Anarkali Bazaar. The imposing structure is extraordinarily tall and has departments concerning different periods of history of Punjab beginning from the ancient times. There are paintings and books related to the Mahabharata and Ramayana besides the Buddhist era, the period of Hindu rulers and the Mughal period. I was expecting that the section depicting Sikh history would be comparatively smaller as Maharaja Ranjit Singh had ruled only for 40 years, but contrary to my expectations, the department of Sikh history was among the largest. Apart from Maharaja Ranjit Singh, there was a lot of material related to the rule of Maharaja Kharak Singh, Maharani Chand Kaur, Maharaja Sher Singh and Maharaja Dalip Singh. The British era and Pakistan post-1947 were also depicted through pictures, paintings and other documents. The common factor in all the historical material was the reality of life that the rule is short-lived, and life is perishable. It goes on changing, one after the other. As we came out of the museum after spending more than two hours, we saw a number of shops selling memorabilia, but I was more attracted to a book shop. I noticed some of the books were written by famous authors, such as Shakespeare and Charles Dickens, besides Pakistani writers, including Tehmina Durani, who advocates women’s and child rights. While browsing through different titles, I enquired from the young salesman if any books by any Indian author were bestsellers in Pakistan. He gave two names: Khushwant Singh and Rajinder Singh Bedi. But as I looked around, I found that there were a large number of books on artist Amrita Sher-Gil and the museum also displayed her paintings. I noticed that some of the books on her had been published by European publishers. The books had been prominently displayed so I could not restrain my enquiry and reminded the bookseller that he had mentioned only two names of bestselling authors of India when books on the artist were in demand. He replied that Amrita Sher-Gil was not an Indian and insisted that she was a Pakistani because she lived and died in Lahore. How could she be called an Indian? I tried to correct him that she was the daughter of Sardar Umrao Singh, a Jat Sikh of Amritsar, who married a Hungarian woman. Another person listening to our conversation interrupted and added that Sher-Gil was a Hungarian as well. It’s then that an elderly gentleman, the father of the bookseller, intervened and wisely said that Amrita Sher-Gil was a citizen of the world. Art and literature transcend borders, so artists and authors cannot be confined to boundaries. He concluded that Sher-Gil belonged to every nation. Why Sher-Gil alone, artists like her belong to all nations and are citizens of the world. sarbjitchhina@yahoo.co.in The writer is senior fellow, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/art-transcends-borders-and-artists-belong-to-the-world-101633355833730.html

Besides, the court also took into consideration the NCB contention that the investigation was at a preliminary and crucial stage.ALSO WATCH | Salman Khan visits Shah Rukh Khan amid son Aryan's drugs case   NCB on Saturday night raided a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and busted a party where drugs were allegedly being used. The agency on Sunday afternoon arrested Aryan, the eldest son of Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan, for alleged possession and consumption of illegal drugs.The two others also arrested by NCB were Arbaaz Merchant, a resident of Bandra and a friend of Aryan, and Munmun Dhamecha, a fashion designer from Madhya Pradesh.“Khan and others were on the cruise ship where the agency busted a rave party,” NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede had said.The three, Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, were taken to JJ Hospital for a medical check-up at about 1.30pm. Doctors also took their swabs for RT-PCR Covid test. They were later taken to the NCB office and were produced before the Esplanade Court at about 3.15 pm.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Advait Sethna, who appeared for NCB, submitted that the agency has seized Aryan Khan’s mobile phone and found several chats which allegedly show his connection with drug dealers. “It is necessary to confront all accused in the custodial remand,” Singh asserted.He said the WhatsApp chat clearly shows the nexus, contain the discussions of cash transactions of Aryan Khan. There are international transactions and further probe underway, Singh submitted.The senior law officer showed some chats to the court to allege that Aryan Khan was in touch with some unknown persons about buying charas (hashish), monetary aspects, and NCB needs to find out who those unknown persons.The investigation is at a preliminary stage and the agency needs to unravel code words used by the accused to communicate with peddlers, Singh said adding that there are several cash transactions between the accused for which they need to be confronted with each other.Advocate Satish Maneshinde, appearing for Aryan Khan, opposed the prayer for extension of custody, insisting that Aryan Khan was not involved in any sale, purchase or consumption of drugs. Nothing incriminating was recovered from the 23-year-old or anybody related to him from amongst the people on the ship, he said.He submitted that Aryan only knew Merchant, from whom 6 grams of charas was allegedly seized. Maneshinde claimed that Aryan did not know the other accused.“The agency can’t simply rely on WhatsApp chats to seek more custody, as there was no other material on record found from me or people related to me,” said Maneshinde, speaking on behalf of the actor’s son.He pointed out that Aryan was invited as a guest and therefore he did not have a boarding card, ticket and best suite on the ship was allotted to him because he was invited as a special guest.He added Aryan didn’t have any contact with organisers, dealers or any other people on the cruise. “Nothing has been found in my bag during the search,” said Maneshinde.“The NCB officers came, nabbed me and brought me to NCB office, apparently because his friend Arbaaz Merchant was allegedly found with 6 gm charas, a small quantity of the contraband material.“Nothing is seized from me (Aryan) or my friends,” Maneshinde submitted. “The contraband is seized from others who are not my friends and have no connection with me,” he added.The lawyer further pointed out that NCB officers have already downloaded Aryan’s WhatsApp chats while on the ship and claimed that I was involved in international drug trafficking. “I am not involved in any drug supply, consumption during my foreign trips,” the lawyer said.The lawyer also underlined that NCB officers had already interrogated the 23-year-old for the last 48 hours and found nothing. “I am a twenty-three-year-old with no criminal antecedents.”NCB registered a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, after officers seized 13 gms of cocaine, 21 gm of hashish, 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy), 5gm mephedrone, and cash worth ₹1.33 lakh at International Cruise Terminal, Green Gate Mumbai.The drug enforcement agency also arrested five others from the cruise, identified by NCB as Vikrant Chhokar, 32, Mohak Jaiswal, 28, Ishmeet Singh Chacha, 33, Gomit Chopra, 28, and Nupur Satija, 29, all residents of Gurgaon, Greater Noida and Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-shows-shahrukh-khan-s-son-aryan-s-chats-to-judge-gets-custody-till-oct-7-101633354807634.html

The answer sheets cannot be there at the exam centres and it can be leaked only with the involvement of a secrecy wing official,” Meena told reporters on Sunday and demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the matter.आप भीड़ इकट्ठी कर लो, भड़काने का काम करो, ये अच्छी परंपरा नहीं है, ये अगर परंपरा रही तो आगे भर्तियां कैसे होंगी?तो ये विपक्ष को समझना चाहिए कि ऐसी गलती न करें क्योंकि जब BJP का शासन था तब भी पेपर आउट कई बार हुए हैं, हमने तो रीट के पूरे प्रोसेस को बड़े अच्छे ढंग से मैनेज किया है। pic.twitter.com/VYer7VnqXBState party president Satish Poonia said that not a single exam in Rajasthan was conducted transparently in the past two and a half years. On the other hand, BJP Yuva Morcha demanded the resignation of Rajasthan’s education minister Govind Singh.Ashok Gehlot also alleged on Monday that those candidates who knew that they wouldn't pass the examination were involved in provoking people. “This is not right that such people try to gather a crowd, provoke others. If this goes on, then how will recruitment take place,” Gehlot further told ANI.Previously, education minister Govind Singh Dotasra on Saturday accused the BJP of misguiding Rajasthan’s youth over the REET and said that if any irregularities were found, the guilty would not be spared. Dostara said that during BJP’s rule in Rajasthan, cheating in exams was rampant and gangs involved in it flourished. “You also had the resources, you had the government, but you kept on sleeping peacefully. The gangs involved in cheating continued to flourish,” the education minister said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/papers-were-leaked-during-bjp-rule-too-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-on-reet-scandal-101633353592995.html
04-10-2021||Dehradun||‘Misbehaviour with Char Dham pilgrims won’t be tolerated at all’: CM to officials||Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Monday issued directions to district magistrates and police chiefs of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi where four Char Dham shrines are located, to ensure pilgrims face no inconvenience or difficulties during the pilgrimage. He said misbehaviour with pilgrims won’t be tolerated at all. Dhami issued these directions while reviewing Char Dham yatra with senior officers in which he also interacted with the DMs and police chiefs of the three districts through video conferencing. “Pilgrims should not face any inconvenience. All possible efforts will be made to provide better facilities to the pilgrims. The pilgrims should return with a good message from the state. This is the responsibility of all of us. I will be distressed if even one pilgrim faces any problem here during the pilgrimage”, he said. Dhami also appealed to the pilgrims intending to come for Char Dham yatra to register themselves on the Char Dham Board portal. The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board has so far issued over 69,000 e-passes to the devotees of other states as per the SOP. According to the Board officials, till Sunday, over 36,000 people visited Char Dham shrines. On September 17, the Uttarakhand government released a standard operating procedure (SOP) for Char Dham yatra. The main conditions for the yatra are negative RTPCR/TrueNat/CBNAAT/RAT COVID report (72 hours before) or certificate for both the Covid-19 doses (15 days should have passed after both doses) and seeking e-pass for Char Dham yatra from the website of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. Pilgrims from Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, even if they have received both doses, are required to carry negative RTPCR/TrueNat/CBNAAT/RAT Covid-19 report (72 hours before) with them for seeking e-pass for the pilgrimage to the four revered shrines. The daily limit of pilgrims will be 1,000 for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri shrines. Kedarnath, along with Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, are collectively called Char Dham and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Traditionally, Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west of Yamunotri, proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east. Last year in June, the state government restricted the number of local pilgrims for the Char Dham pilgrimage. The authorities had capped the daily influx of local pilgrims, allowing only 1200 per day for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for the Yamunotri shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/misbehaviour-with-char-dham-pilgrims-won-t-be-tolerated-at-all-cm-to-officials-101633351088467.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Upward rounding off of retail bills: Overcharging or a matter of convenience?||The concept of rounding off 50 paise and above to the next higher rupee, put in practice by retail businesses, has not found favour with consumers. So for several years now, consumers have been questioning this practice and many consumers have sought justice before the consumer courts, accusing businesses of overcharging.What’s now added to the indignation of consumers is an order of the apex consumer court, holding that such method of doing away with fractions neither constitutes an unfair trade practice nor is it a deficient service. Of course, this is not the final word on the issue because the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in this case did not examine the practice per se, but confined itself to the question of quantum of compensation awarded by the lower consumer courts on such a complaint.Why should there be so much fuss over adding 50 paise to a bill , one may well ask. Well, individually, it does seem like a small amount, but to a business, it adds up to a huge profit and to consumers as a class, the loss is substantial. Businesses point out that they do round off fractions below 50 paise downwards to the nearest rupee and only fractions of 50 paise and above, upwards. So consumers do not pay if the bill has a fraction of less than 50 paise and pay a rupee only if it is 50 paise or more. But consumers are not convinced. Besides, there is no data to show that the gain to consumers from such downward rounding off is equal to the loss from upward rounding off. Also, going by consumer complaints, some businesses have tweaked their billing software to round off all fractions, whatever the amount, upwards to the nearest rupee.The concept of rounding off fractions of a rupee was first introduced by the Reserve Bank in 1991 for banking transactions. Subsequently, as 50 paise coins more or less disappeared (it is still legal tender), retail businesses also adopted it in their billing . However, this has annoyed consumers.Perhaps one of the first complaints on this issue that went up to the level of the apex consumer court was filed in 2012 by consumer Shyam Joshi, questioning McDonald Family Restaurant charging ₹53, instead of ₹52.50. The lower consumer courts awarded ₹4,500 and paise 50 to the consumer and the apex consumer court refused to entertain the revision petition of the restaurant on the ground that the amount involved was too paltry.The Delhi high court, before which the restaurant challenged this, also disposed it off with a similar comment. However, the court said none of the orders of the consumer courts in this case shall form a precedence. (WP 4713 of 2015, order dated Feb 8, 2016).This issue came up again before the National Commission in 2016 in the form of a revision petition filed by the same restaurant, challenging the orders of the lower consumer courts in Rajasthan. The commission disposed them all through a common order of July 26, 2021, the lead case being M/s Mcdonald Family Restaurant vs Nisha Goyal (RP No 1246 of 2016) and held that the restaurant need not pay any compensation as there was no unfair trade practice or deficiency in service on its part in rounding off a bill of ₹85.50 to ₹86.Admittedly, fractions are inconvenient, more so in the absence of 50 paise coins. But are consumers bearing the brunt of RBI’s decision not to mint 50 paise coins? The commission needs to examine this. Also in its order of July 26, the commission basically looked at the notifications issued by the RBI on the issue, but these were meant for banks and non-banking financial companies. In fact, whether it is the circulars issued by RBI or SEBI, or laws passed under Central Goods and Services Act ( Section 170) or Income Tax Act (Section 288 B), they are all meant specifically for those sectors and not for retail business.On the other hand, the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, that regulate retail sale of packed goods in the country, says that packages must mention maximum retail price inclusive of all taxes “after taking into account the fraction of less than 50 paise to be rounded off to the preceding rupee and fraction of above 50 paise and up to 95 paise to be rounded off to 50 paise”. So this is very different from what the RBI says to banks.It is also important to note that with the digital push given by the government, we have moved considerably away from cash payments. Much more than credit and debit cards, today mobile wallets have gained extreme popularity and are accepted by even roadside vendors. So the excuse of the disappearing 50 paise does not hold good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/upward-rounding-off-of-retail-bills-overcharging-or-a-matter-of-convenience-101633350907684.html

The hunter is trying to track the leopard in Bajeti, Papdev, Paun areas of the district. The leopard was declared maneater on September 25, after it killed an eight-year-old girl in Bajeti area, officials said. Vinay Bhargav, divisional forest officer Pithoragarh, said the hunter has been called to eliminate the problematic leopard which has created terror in the area. Bhargav said after the leopard killed an eight-year-old girl in Bajeti ward of the town, the forest department had installed a cage near the place. “A leopard was trapped there but after taking samples of its stool and urine we found it was not a maneater as there was no trace in the samples of it having consumed human flesh. Then we freed it in Ramnagar forests last week,” he said.He said there are two or more leopards that have been spotted in the area since the incident occurred. “I will try my best to eliminate the leopard which is attacking people here. I am already trying to track it in the affected areas”, said hunter Harish Dhami who has eliminated many leopards in the last 10 years. On September 30, the Pithoragarh administration had extended the night curfew by a week in the leopard-haunted areas of the district till October 6 after the leopard movement was again reported near residential areas. On September 23, in a bid to avoid man-animal conflict, night curfew was clamped in half a dozen villages in Pithoragarh district after an eight-year-old girl was dragged and killed by a leopard in Bajeti village adjoining the district headquarters. After this incident, a cage was installed in the village and a leopard was caught. Man-leopard conflict is a major problem in the state. Since the formation of the state, over 800 people have been killed in the man-wildlife conflict. Deaths due to leopard attacks account for nearly half of the total deaths, as per the data of the state forest department. As per the records of the state forest department, the last state-wide leopard estimation exercise was conducted in 2008, when the state reported 2335 leopards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-forest-dept-ropes-in-hunter-to-kill-maneater-leopard-in-pithoragarh-101633346468395.html

04-10-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Can drug busts prevent growing substance abuse?||It was the early morning of March in 2007. The kuccha road led nowhere, yet some 300 youths had found their way to a small farmhouse called “Janjeera” on the foothills of the Sinhagad fort. The promise was salvation through the mantra of “trance”. It had a great and desired effect. IT professionals, air hostesses and students from prestigious colleges had come to the rave party organised by local drug pedlars in association with international counterparts, based in Ireland. The SP (superintendent of police) level officer – who later went on to become a high-profile officer in the state police force - had allowed some journalists to accompany the police squad that busted what then was termed as a “rave” party. It had the desired effect for police as the next day’s newspapers were flooded with stories of drug haul. The latest incident involving the son of a Bollywood star in the cruise rave party that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) raided on Saturday night only underlines high-profile drug busts often make for great headlines. However, they may not fix the global problem of addiction. For example in Pune, from 2007, when the first big rave party was busted to 2021, not much has changed as cases of drug haul have increased as the demand for consumption. The trend in the last few years in the city is well in consonance with what is happening nationally. In 2019, Pune police had registered 119 cases, arrested 157 accused, and seized nearly three crores of narcotics substances which highest in the last 10 years, as reported by Hindustan Times in its December 25, 2020 edition. In 2020 the figure went down, but that was mainly due to national lockdown. During the year, police registered 41 cases of Narcotic Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) in which 59 accused (2 Nigerians) were arrested including seizure of 150kg ganja, 69gms MD, 112gms charas, 368gms cocaine, totalling worth ₹40 lakh. What made the headlines during most of 2020 was the busting of a racket by neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad police. The seizure of 20kg mephedrone (MD) in Chakan by Pimpri-Chinchwad police in October led to the exposure of a nexus of producers, distributors and transporters who were involved in the production and sale of MD weighing at least 150kg.If the police actions have increased, so is the increased substance abuse. Nationally, some 59,806 cases were registered in 2020 under the NDPS Act, according to National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), which was enacted in 1985 when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister. Of them, 10,852 cases came from UP alone while 3,246 in overall cases were for possession of quantities lower than the threshold considered to be for personal use. If we look at the conviction rate, as many as 81% of the 14,340 NDPS cases in which trials were completed saw convictions. This is much higher than other serious crimes. The problem, many experts have noted previously, is that law enforcement agencies have focused more on catching those involved in the supply side. While only a few get caught, those involved know what does work – and how. This often leads to flourishing the trade as demand grows amid societal moral qualms. According to the Institute of Behaviour and Health in the USA, “Supply reduction is an effective tool for demand reduction because when drugs cost more and are more difficult to obtain there are fewer drug users and less demand for illegal drugs. Demand reduction is also an effective tool in supply reduction because when the number of drug users falls, drug supply falls correspondingly as the market for illegal drugs shrinks. Linking these complementary approaches maximises the impact of the national strategy on illegal drug use by attacking the drug economy from both sides.” So if law enforcers in India want to control drug misuse, they need to adopt a dual strategy of checking both, supply and demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-can-drug-busts-prevent-growing-substance-abuse-101633344246916.html
04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Lakhimpur Kheri violence sparks off farmer protests in Punjab||The violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri that killed eight people, including four farmers, on Sunday sparked off protests in Punjab on Monday morning with protesters gathering at district headquarters in Amritsar, Patiala, Ludhiana, Barnala, Bathinda, Sangrur and Malerkotla on the call of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 32 farmer unions that is spearheading the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws since last year. Also read: ₹45L and job for victim’s kin, judicial probe: Lakhimpur Kheri stalemate ends The SKM on Monday wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind, demanding the dismissal of minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni from the Union council of ministers and the setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) under the supervision of the Supreme Court into the killing of the four farmers. Farmers owing allegiance to the SKM protested outside the deputy commissioner’s office in Amritsar from 10am to 1.30pm, while police kept a tight vigil. In Sangrur, members of farmer unions, students and Congress workers held separate protests to oppose Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Sangrur, Barnala and Malerkotla districts on Monday. Over hundreds of farmers held demonstrations opposite the district administration complexes in these districts. Besides, the Congressmen burnt effigies of BJP minister Ajay Mishra in Sangrur and Malerkotla. Also, students associated with Punjab Student Union (Lalkaar), PSU (Shaheed Randhawa) and Punjab Radical Students Union opposed the incident at Government Ranbir College, Sangrur.Farmers supporting the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) tried to gherao the house of BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh near Hathi Gate in Amritsar, but police foiled the bid and put up barricades where they raised slogans against the Centre and burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “We will intensify our agitation against the Centre,” said KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher, who was leading the protesters. The farmers also protested at the Bhandari Bridge, which connects both parts of the holy city. “The barbaric killing of the farmers was pre-planned to crush their resistance against the authoritarian Yogi-Modi regime in UP and India,” said Rattan Singh Randhawa, a leader of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha.The protesters compared the killing with that of Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, seeking stringent action against the guilty. Students of Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) also staged a big demonstration in the main campus. Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Pathankot also saw protests in major towns. Manjit Singh of BKU (Ugrahan) criticized the Yogi government from preventing farmers and political leaders from visiting the site of the violence.In Doaba too, farmers submitted a memorandum to the DCs, also demanding that Union minister of state Ajay Mishra should be removed immediately. They also sought action against the Haryana chief minister, Manohar Lal Khattar for his provocative remarks. Doaba Kisan Union and Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) leaders said people must rally against the BJP to maintain communal harmony. In Bhogpur, farmers burnt effigy of the central government. In Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, farm leaders said the sacrifice of farmers will not go in vain. PROTESTS PASS OFF PEACEFULLY IN MAJHAActivists of farmer unions gathered in large numbers outside the district administrative complexes (DACs) in southern Punjab for three hours to protest against the UP violence. A large number of farmers of the BS Rajewal faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union gathered outside the house of Abohar BJP MLA Arun Narang and burnt effigies of BJP leaders. Security was tightened in Barnala, Bathinda, Mansa and Ferozepur and the protests passed off peacefully. In a statement, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said the governments at the Centre and UP had adopted an indifferent stance against their demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-sparks-off-farmer-protests-in-punjab-101633343406991.html

The civic body based its prediction on a "smooth" vaccination drive, in which over 42 lakh people have been fully vaccinated and more than 82 lakh have received the first dose.“The work is on. It is going on smoothly. Now, there is no shortage of vaccines too. Mumbai is safe. We do not see a third wave (of the Covid-19) coming,” BMC counsel Anil Sakhare told the high court, according to news agency PTI.He also said that 2,586 bed-ridden people have so far been administered both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine while 3,942 such people have got the first jab.The arguments were made during the hearing of a petition seeking a direction to both the Union and Maharashtra governments to start door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens aged 75 and above, specially-abled people and those who are bed-ridden.The petition was filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari earlier this year.The Maharashtra government had said in August that it will initiate the drive and had started door-to-door vaccination of bed-ridden people as a pilot project.Maharashtra recorded 2,692 fresh Covid-19 infections on Sunday, which pushed the state's overall count to 6,559,349. The tally of active cases further reduced to 35,888 as 2,716 recoveries were reported in the 24-hour span.The Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra is under control as the average daily cases are on a decline for the past few months. In September, the daily average of new infections came down to 3,368 cases against 4,944 in August, 7,737 in July and 10,542 in June.

04-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Arvind Kejriwal releases 10-point winter action plan to fight pollution||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday released a 10-point winter action plan for the national capital. He said that the plan will help combat air pollution in Delhi, which deteriorates during the winter season due to a number of factors, including stubble burning by the farmers in nearby states."I have been posting Delhi's air quality recordings since September 15, and we have seen that Delhi's pollution levels are in control. But since the central and neighbouring state governments have not done much to help farmers, Delhi's air quality will start deteriorating in a few days because of stubble burning," Kejriwal said while addressing a press conference.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief added that he has been requesting the central government and neighbouring states but no step has been taken to stop stubble burning and other things which have adverse impact on the national capital's air quality."Instead of playing the blame-counter blame game, we have found a solution to stubble burning. We have requested the central government to take into consideration our request and hope this alternate plan will be implemented," said Kejriwal.Here are the 10 steps listed by Kejriwal to check the pollution level in Delhi during winters:1. Stubble burning: We have prepared a decomposer (a solution) with the help of Pusa Institute. This solution, once sprayed on the crop residue will eliminate the need to burn it. Delhi government has been spraying it for free, Punjab and other states too can do the same.2. Anti-dust campaign to be strengthened: We have formed 75 teams which will survey the entire national capital and impose heavy penalty on those who are found violating the government's dust pollution norms.3. Stopping the burning of garbage: 250 teams have been formed for this.4. Ban on firecrackers5. Installation of smog towers: These towers have shown good so far and they will continue to analyse results before taking a call to install more such structures.6. Monitoring of pollution hotspots using app7. Green War Rooms are being strengthened. Kejriwal said that the Delhi government has hired 50 environment engineers.8. The Green Delhi app is being constantly monitored. Public is also encouraged to use it and lodge complaints of any violation, said Kejriwal.9. Eco waste park: This is the first such park being constructed in the country, said Kejriwal. Twenty acres of land has been allotted for the project.10. Vehicular pollution: The AAP chief said that steps are being taken to minimise traffic jams to reduce the emissions caused by cars and other vehicles. The chief minister said that 64 congestion points have been identified across Delhi and steps will be taken to control traffic and resultant pollution here. “We have also intensified checking for Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates and are cracking down on diesel vehicles older than 10 years,” Kejriwal added.Before listing the 10-point approach, Kejriwal also talked about the work done by his government to bring the pollution level down in Delhi:1. Delhi has provided 24x7 electricity. This has controlled the use of thousands of diesel generator sets that used to run in the city.2. We are focussing on bringing down the level of dust pollution, said Kejriwal, adding that Construction sites are being monitored regularly.3. Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways have helped control the number of trucks coming into Delhi.4. Two coal fired thermal power plants have been shut down5. 100% conversion of industries to PNG6. Tree transplantation policy was brought in by the Delhi government to reduce the number of trees being cut for construction projects7. Green Delhi app is operational where people can lodge their complaints8. Green war room has been made, where the pollution levels in Delhi is being constantly monitored.9. Graded Response Action plan was implemented in Delhi on the directions of the supreme court10. Electric vehicle policy was implemented in the cityPollution in DelhiDelhi was the most polluted capital city in the world in 2020 for the third consecutive year, according to a report by a Swiss group that ranked cities based on their air quality measured in terms of the levels of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5) that can enter the organs and cause lasting damage.The World Air Quality Report, 2020 by IQAir that was released globally in March this year showed that Delhi recorded an annual average PM 2.5 concentration of 84.1ug/m3.Delhi was also ranked the 10th most polluted of the 50 cities from where data was analysed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-arvind-kejriwal-releases-10-point-winter-action-plan-to-fight-pollution-101633331436099.html

04-10-2021||Delhi||#WorldHabitatDay: Climate action can’t wait, say NCR’s young eco-activists||New Delhi Growing up in Delhi-NCR made teen changemaker Aditya Mukarji see “climate change at its worst”, and gave sustainable fashion entrepreneur Kriti Tula a “reality check about the fast changes in climate conditions” as she, like others, struggled to see blue skies over the Capital. They are two of the 17 young climate leaders chosen for the UN in India’s new climate campaign ‘We The Change’ to showcase innovative solutions in the run-up to 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November. On World Habitat Day, today, the two eco-activists talk about doing their bit for the planet.At 17 years of age, Mukarji has campaigned against single-use plastics, such as straws and cutlery, in the hospitality space, including Khan Market restaurants. His crusade began with a video of vets pulling a plastic straw out of a turtle’s nose. Being a Gurugrammer also shaped his activism. He explains, “Air pollution is now a constant problem. We started living with masks way before the pandemic started. We have waste management issues as well as people don’t practise proper waste segregation.” Meanwhile, Tula’s efforts are focused on recycling resources. The 33-year-old, who makes products from garment manufacturing waste, says, “It may seem small or tedious, but given the huge environmental costs of [mainly fast] fashion — from water guzzling cotton crops to unsustainable levels of cloth production — it can make a great difference.” Both youth activists feel the need for greater participation to make real progress against climate change. While Tula feels it is hard to see “any real change if people with capital don’t commit to build better businesses”, Mukarji believes if “two or more generations work together, there’s nothing we can’t achieve”.Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/worldhabitatdayclimate-action-can-t-wait-say-ncr-s-young-ecoactivists-101633326845622.html

04-10-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata Police to start inspection of pandals||Less than a week before the Durga Puja begins, the Kolkata Police will start inspecting the Puja pandals from Monday to check whether the curbs imposed by the Calcutta high court were being followed.On Friday, the court banned the entry of visitors into the pandals to check the spread of Covid-19. The puja committees need to put up barricades - 10 metres from the outer end of the big and five metres from the smaller pujas – to make the pandals a no-entry zone for visitors.A team led by a joint police commissioner will visit around 18 of the biggest puja pandals on Monday. Many of these pujas are patronised by ruling Trinamool Congress leaders and ministers.“It would be a joint inspection by the police and other agencies such as the fire brigade and power supply corporation. On the first day, the team would visit around 18 puja pandals,” said a police officer.While at least 36,000 community pujas are held across the state, in Kolkata alone, 2,500 are held by various clubs. These are just the clubs that are registered with the state government. This apart, there are pujas held in housing societies and residences. Around 1500 pujas are organised by women.Durga Puja is the biggest festival in West Bengal. Even though the five-day Puja starts this year from October 11, the festivity starts much before, and it extends for more than a week every year. Mahalaya this year would be held on October 6 and the immersion process would continue till 17.Also Read: Mamata Banerjee logs record win in Bhawanipore bypoll; BJP loses on 2 more seatsThe high court, while hearing a plea seeking curbs during the festive season to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases, said that all the restrictions that were imposed by the court in 2020 will remain this year.“The puja committees have been asked to make their pandals as open and possible so that pandal hoppers may have a glance of the Goddess and the decorations from outside without crowding. The committees have also been asked to share their plans for crowd management during the peak hours,” said a second police officer.Thousands of people from adjoining districts come to Kolkata during the puja days for pandal hopping.In October 2020, just 72 hours before the Durga Puja started, the high court banned the entry of visitors inside pandals. The court also put a cap on the number of puja committee members who could enter the pandal – 45 for big pujas and 15 for smaller ones. Anjali, the offering of flowers to the Gods and Goddess and Sindur Khela, a ritual in which married women smear each other’s face with vermillion before immersion, was also banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-police-to-start-inspection-of-pandals-101633324565599.html

Hours after the RJD listed its candidates for bypolls to both Kusheshwarsthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies, the Congress said it was also contemplating fielding its nominees for both seats for the elections.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha told HT: “The announcement came as a shock to the (Congress) party as we were following the coalition dharma and was preparing for Kusheshwarsthan seat, which was allocated to the Congress under the seat adjustment among the opposition alliance during the 2020 assembly elections,” Jha said.The BPCC chief said the party has almost finalised its nominees for Kusheshwarsthan assembly seat in Darbhanga, which is reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates, and that consultations are underway to finalise the nominees for Tarapur constituency in Munger district. “However, the final decision on naming the candidates would be taken by the party high command who has been apprised about the developments, post the RJD’s decision to field its nominee on both the seats,” he said.State RJD chief Jagadanand Singh announced that Bhagalpur-based party leader Arun Kumar Sah and Ganesh Bharti Sada would contest the by-elections from Tarapur and Kusheshwarsthan seats, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjds-decision-to-field-candidate-in-bypoll-latest-flashpoint-in-ties-with-congress-101633301175066.html

Hooda said it is clear that the government doesn’t want to procure farmers’ produce on MSP, which is why they are imposing several conditions and repeatedly changing the procurement schedule. Hooda visited several grain markets in Karnal, Kurukshetra and Panipat districts and interacted with the farmers, arhtiyas and labourers. He said the mandis are flooded with paddy and there was no space in most of the grain markets due to delayed procurement. “Farmers are forced to sell their produce to private agencies below MSP due to lack of government buyers,” he added. “Farmers are being harassed on the pretext of e-portal registration and high moisture content,” said Hooda. Interacting with reporters after visiting the Jind grain market, Surjewala said paddy is lying in the open as government has failed to initiate the procurement process. “The government has not been procuring paddy in the name of high moisture content. If it rains, who will be responsible for the grains getting soaked? The government has decided to reduce bajra procurement by 80%, besides reducing the rates of labour per bag from ₹12.76 to ₹8.56,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hooda-surjewala-visit-grain-markets-slam-govt-for-delay-in-paddy-procurement-101633301103395.html

Sahota, a 1988-batch Indian Police Service officer, was given the additional charge of Punjab director general of police on September 25.The viral pictures of the meeting, however, triggered sharp reactions from the BJP.“The Chief Minister is well aware of ‘governance rules’ as he is a former minister and a three-time MLA. The credibility, dignity while respecting the rules of the constitution should always be maintained,” said state BJP president Ashwani Sharma.He also attacked senior bureaucrats for allowing the CM’s son to remain seated in the official meeting. “It is unfortunate that senior bureaucrats, well aware of rules and norms, allowed this error to happen.”Cabinet minister Pargat Singh, who holds the sports portfolio, was also among the attendees.According to experts, the presence of a family member of the chief minister or that of any minister is in violation of the Rules of Business of the state government. Such a scenario, they said, violates the Official Secrets Act, as sensitive matters, which the CM and ministers take oath to keep confidential, are taken up in official interactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fresh-row-over-presence-of-punjab-cm-channi-s-son-at-official-security-meet-101633300704388.html

He later won the same seat in 2014 and 2019 assembly polls.INLD supremo and former Haryana chief minister OP Chautala said farmers and other sections of the society are trying to get rid of the BJP-JJP dispensation and INLD will ensure that the security deposit of all candidates fighting against their nominee is forfeited. “INLD’s win will underline the simmering anger against the three farm laws among the farming community,” said the INLD supremo.After attending the mahapanchayat, Abhay said people of his constituency have invited him and asked him to contest the bypoll. “Hundreds of people gathered here to repose faith in me. We will win this seat with a thumping majority. I have an emotional connect with the people of my constituency.

Randhawa, who visited his constituency of Dera Baba Nanak for the first time after becoming the deputy CM, said, “The Congress has had many big leaders like Partap Singh Kairon and Darbara Singh who devoted their entire life to the party and the country. The party gave Captain Amarinder everything in little over 20 years after he rejoined it. He should not degrade himself by making such statements.” The minister, who took out a roadshow, said, “Amarinder rejoined the Congress in 1997 when my father was the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president. Next year, he took reins of the party’s state unit and has held key posts since.”The government, he added, was working to resolve the issues of the Bargari sacrilege, police firing, drugs and electricity on priority. “We will come up with results soon. And there will be no discrimination with anyone,” he claimed. Randhawa said some leaders were questioning the appointments of certain officers but the government will ensure that they perform their duty with integrity. “We will not tolerate any negligence.

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Khattar asks party workers to wield sticks, kicks up row||Stirring a controversy in the backdrop of ongoing farmers’ agitation, Haryana chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party’s kisan morcha workers to raise groups of kisan volunteers in northern and north-western districts who can “pick up sticks”. The controversial remarks seen in a video, which went viral on social media platforms, are likely to create a storm. The reference was evidently aimed at the protesting farmers who have been chasing the ruling BJP-JJP leaders and disrupting their visits and events. “We will have to encourage upcoming farmer groups... In every district, particularly the northern and north western districts, we will have to raise groups of 500-700 kisan volunteers... And then Sathe Shathyam Samacharet (tit-for-tat). Pick up sticks,” Khattar was purportedly seen telling the workers in the video who were heard laughing at his comments. Responding to a remark by a person in the gathering (which was not audible), Khattar further told the gathering not to worry about jamanat (bail) after picking up the sticks. “If you spend a couple of months.... you will become a leader. You will learn much more than these meetings and become a tall leader. Your name will get etched in history,” he said in a reference to doing time in jail. A government official said that the chief minister’s remarks were shown selectively in the viral video. “The video lacked perspective and is misleading. It was an internal meeting of the party workers. The CM told them to oppose wrong actions but by maintaining discipline. In fact, the CM told the party workers to maintain discipline and not to take law in their hands,” said an official. Former BJP MLA Sukhwinder Sheoran, who was present at the BJP kisan morcha meeting at Khattar’s residence on Sunday, said that remarks regarding raising kisan volunteers were only aimed at countering the propaganda about the three central farm laws. The remarks drew criticism from the opposition parties. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, in a tweet, said that rule of law cannot be maintained in the state if the CM himself speaks about inciting violence and breaking law and order. “The anti-farmer face of the BJP stands exposed. It’s time to get rid of this government,” Surjewala tweeted. Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Kumari Selja said, “The remarks of the Haryana CM are shameful, highly improper and condemnable. Instead of helping farmers, the CM is making highly provocative statements. What will be the fate of the state when the CM will make such instigating remarks and advise people to pick up sticks… Will our people and farmers tolerate this?”Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar also tweeted: “In his ‘call to arms’ Sh @mlkhattar has not only bared the fangs but also the ‘true colours of BJP’. Hope Supreme Court is taking note.”The fresh controversy with the “sticks” remark has come after an IAS officer posted as Karnal SDM was, in August, seen telling cops to hit the farmers on the head if they try to disrupt a BJP event. The remark and a police lathicharge at a toll plaza in Karnal fueled protests by farmers unions. The farmers relented after the government set up a commission of inquiry to probe the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-asks-party-workers-to-wield-sticks-kicks-up-row-101633296722074.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Preventive health checks mandated for Delhi cops||Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has issued a standard operating procedure (SOP), making the annual preventive health check-up of all police personnel above the age of 40 and upto the ranks of DANIPS (Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu Police Service) officers and multi-tasking staff (MTS) mandatory and part of their annual performance assessment report.The annual confidential report (ACR) as well as the annual performance assessment report (APAR) of the police staff above the age of 40 will be considered incomplete if “annual health report is not attached with it while submitting them before the competent authority.”The police chief has also announced that like all the ‘Class-A’ officers, the other personnel will also be able to get their “comprehensive investigations and diagnostic tests” done at any Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) empanelled hospitals at ₹2,000 for male and ₹2,200 for female staff or the rates revised from time to time by the central government.Senior police officers said the decision was taken keeping in mind the welfare of the police staff and the long duty hours that they have to put in because of which they suffer from various occupational health issues and lifestyle related diseases.They said suboptimal health status has an adverse effect on the efficiency of the police personnel, apart from an adverse impact on policing. To maintain requisite fitness and alertness among the police personnel, it was important to implement an annual health check-up scheme for Delhi Police staff above the age of 40.“While IPS officers were already availing this facility, now multi-tasking staff and police staff up to the ranks of DANIPS officers will also be covered under the same scheme. It would help in early detection of any health-related ailments for timely curative measures. The step would also help monitor the health status of personnel. It is a big welfare measure that will surely boost the morale of the police force,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.In the standard operating procedure released on September 1, Asthana has mentioned that smooth implementation of the scheme and identifying and shortlisting the CGHS empanelled hospitals will be the responsibility of head of offices (HOOs) of each district and unit.As the nodal officer, one assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in each unit has been tasked to prepare a list of personnel above the age of 40, who would be sent for medical examination on prescribed dates to the identified hospitals. The ACP will also have to keep an updated record of the scheme in a register for the perusal of senior officers.“The HOOs may permit the officials to go for conducting their preventive health check-up on specified days and no leave (CL or EL) shall be deducted for their absence from office...In case one is not in a condition to get his or her preventive health check-up conducted on any day during the monthly slot allotted to him or her due to leave, illness or any emergent reason, the HOOs may consider postponing the date in the same or next month on a case-to-case basis after verifying the genuineness of the case,” said the SOP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/preventive-health-checks-mandated-for-delhi-cops-101633296322661.html
04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers to protest outside DM offices across country today against Lakhimpur incident: SKM||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has called for a protest outside the offices of district magistrates and divisional commissioners across the country on Monday over two SUVs allegedly running over protesters in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri, farmer leaders Yogendra Yadav and Darshan Pal Singh said on Sunday. They also demanded a probe into the incident by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court and not by the Uttar Pradesh administration. “To express our agitation against Sunday’s incident, the SKM calls for a protest outside the offices of district magistrates and divisional commissioners across the country between 10am and 1pm,” Singh said. The farmer leaders alleged that Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son was in one of the SUVs. “We demand that Union minister of state for home and Khiri MP Ajay Kumar Mishra be immediately dismissed from his post. A case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC should be registered against the minister’s son and other goons,” Singh and Yadav said at a virtual press conference. They claimed that at least four farmers were killed in the incident and appealed to the protesters to maintain calm. The SKM, an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions, is spearheading a protest at Delhi’s borders against three agriculture laws of the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-to-protest-outside-dm-offices-across-country-today-against-lakhimpur-incident-skm-101633296542095.html

The protesters said they had filed a complaint against the actors around 15 days ago, following which an enquiry was marked to the additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti. However, even after two weeks the police did not initiate an investigation.Shri Hindu Takht state president Varun Mehta said, “Rohit Bhutto district president of the organisation had staged fast unto death against police action and if action was not taken, they will intensify the protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hindu-outfit-demands-arrest-of-actors-jassie-gill-surbhi-jyoti-for-hurting-religious-sentiments-101633296482166.html
04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Procurement begins, but no end to worries of farmers in Haryana||Though the Haryana government claimed to have started paddy procurement on Sunday, there was no end to farmers’ worries as large quantities of the grain awaited procurement despite arriving in the mandis.As per reports, procurement agency officials visited different mandis across the state but did not procure the paddy, barring from a few farmers, due to high moisture content.A commission agent from Kurukshetra’s Ladwa grain market said, “We have around 800 quintals of paddy lying in our shop but not even a single grain was procured on Sunday.”Chaos outside mandis as farmers turn up without registrationLong queues of tractor-trailers were seen at the entrance of the mandis since morning as farmers turned up without prior registration on the e-kharid portals. Due to this, they had to wait for several hours to get temporary gate passes. As per the laid down procedure, SMSes were sent to registered farmers, inviting them to the mandis on a pre-scheduled date and time for procurement, but many turned up without registration as started pressuring the administration officials to let them in.Jashmer Singh, a farmer from Ladwa, said, “I had brought my produce on September 19 as the government had earlier announced to start procurement from September 25 but later postponed it. Now, they should procure our produce on priority as we have been waiting here for more than a week.” Scheduled procurement is a pre-condition for direct payment of the minimum support price (MSP). Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board chief administrator Vinay Yadav said fresh directions have been issued that farmers who have brought their produce to mandis without registration will have to obtain an invite or schedule on the e-kharid portal. “Meanwhile, to avoid long queues outside mandis, temporary gate passes have been issued to farmers but procurement will take place only as per schedule,” he added. Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board’s zonal administrator Gagandeep Singh said, “Procurement has started in all grain markets of Karnal as per schedule. If a farmer has missed their scheduled procurement slot, then alternative arrangements will be made as per the government’s directions.” Meanwhile, light rain in different parts of Ambala caused some worry though farmers said they were able to sell their produce in a hassle-free manner. Ambala deputy commissioner Vikram appealed to farmers to bring their crops as per schedule to avoid any problems. The state government has set a target of procuring around 60 lakh MT of paddy from around 200 purchase centres this year. But officials associated with the agencies say that procurement may exceed the target due to an increase in the area under cultivation of parmal varieties. As per official data, over 40% of area under paddy cultivation, that is 5,84,000 hectares, is growing the parmal varieties.According to commission agents, the delay in procurement and lifting may create a glut in mandis. Haryana BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni has demanded that the order for scheduled procurement in all mandis is withdrawn. He also said that the government should increase the per acre limit from 25 quintals. In a videos message, Charuni also asked farmers to break the gates of the mandis if the officials do not allow them to enter the grain markets in the name of schedule or gate passes.

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Channi says rulebook will decide new police chief after Sidhu rakes up issue again||Chandigarh/Morinda Hours after Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu again demanded removal of director general of police (DGP) IPS Sahota and advocate general APS Deol from his own party’s government, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday said the new police chief would be appointed as per the laid-down procedure. Channi said his government had already forwarded the names of IPS officers with 30 years of experience to the central government and was waiting for the panel of three names from them. “Thereafter, the name of the new DGP will be finalised in consultation with the PPCC chief (Sidhu), all ministers and MLAs. I have told Sidhu Saab and he already knows the names of the police officers,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a government function in Morinda. The state government has sent the names of 10 IPS officers to the Centre. The chief minister’s statement was in response to a query on Sidhu’s repeated demands, which he reiterated on Sunday, for removal of AG and DGP appointed by the new administration. Sidhu, in a tweet, said the AG and DGP must be replaced otherwise they (ruling Congress) would have no face. “Demand for Justice in Sacrilege cases and for arrest of main culprits behind the drug trade brought our Govt in 2017 & Due to his failure, People removed the last CM. Now, AG/DG appointments rub salt on wounds of victims, they must be replaced or we will have No face!! (sic),” he posted on the microblogging site. Sidhu had sent his resignation from the state chief’s post to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who did not accept it, a few days ago, raising questions over the two senior appointments and “tainted leaders”. The appointments of Sahota and Deol were said to be the last straw leading to his resignation as his choices for both these posts were ignored. Sidhu has minced no words in his opposition to Sahota which stems from the fact that the IPS officer had led the first SIT constituted by the then Akali government to probe the 2015 sacrilege and police firing cases. Sahota had claimed to have cracked the case and even addressed a press conference, stating that the Bargari sacrilege incident was “a handiwork of some foreign handlers”. However, his claims of purported “foreign handlers” later fell flat. The Punjab Congress chief, in a video last Wednesday, claimed that “those who tortured kids to give clean chits to the Badals were now being given plum posts”. Though Sidhu and Channi then had a meeting on Thursday to discuss their differences and agreed to set up a coordination committee under a central leader for prior consultation on all major government decisions and appointments, their two-hour-long discussion does not seem to have had the intended effect as the state party chief continues to be in a sulk. The delay in setting up the coordination panel has also not helped. On the issue of retiring government employees above 58 years, Channi said any employee who has attained the age of 58 would not be allowed to serve anymore so that the youth could be given a chance for government jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-says-rulebook-will-decide-new-police-chief-after-sidhu-rakes-up-issue-again-101633296183589.html
04-10-2021||Chandigarh||People of Punjab won’t forgive Amarinder if he quits Congress: Minister Raja Warring||Newly inducted Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Sunday said that former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should not leave the Congress as the people of the state had showed faith in him in the 2017 assembly elections being a part of the party. Warring, who was in Ludhiana to initiate a cleanliness drive at the local bus stand, said, “People of Punjab won’t forgive him if he leaves the Congress. He should not let them down. He is our senior leader and we all have a lot of respect for him. Also, the party has lots of expectations from him. He should resolve the internal issues or rather ignore them and think in the interest of the party.” Joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or floating his own party won’t be a good option for Captain, the minister claimed. Warring, who is considered close to Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, dodged a question whether the latter has landed the party in trouble. Sidhu recently tendered his resignation as the state party chief. “He (Sidhu) is a loyal soldier of the Congress and will continue to work for the betterment of the party,” the minister said. On chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Warring said, “He is doing a great job and will sail the party to victory in the upcoming elections by working in the interest of the people of Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/people-of-punjab-won-t-forgive-amarinder-if-he-quits-congress-minister-raja-warring-101633296181067.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Portal to lost aesthetics||Eighteen little squares are sculpted into each of the door’s two kiwaars, the shutters. A metallic chain is attached at the top. The side jambs—the chaukhat—are carved with intricate patterns. A taak—an arched niche, rarely seen in contemporary architecture—is scooped above the door, and two others are on the sides.This old-fashioned work of art must be located somewhere in an Old Delhi gali?No.This is Gurugram, the Millennium City of cloud-kissing high-rises, of malls, multiplexes, beer pubs, penthouses and multinational headquarters. But of course, the door is slightly removed from this promised land. The place is tucked away in the older part of Gurugram, in Sadar Bazar where there are no towers.This afternoon, hawkers and bazar shoppers are going past the doorway without throwing even a cursory look, as if it were just another boring piece of architecture. To add to the indifference, bikes are parked in front of the door. A tailor working nearby explains that the building is a private property, though it stays locked most of the time, with nobody inside. One anyway doesn’t need to bother about the antecedents of the building, which isn’t half as impressive as the door. It’s the wooden portal that stands out like a museum exhibit, looking completely out of place from the rest of the environs.The door is painted white. The wooden strips on either sides are carved with three separate designs, running from top to bottom. One of them consists of a decoration of flowers. The strap at the top is also patterned with flowers. The petals are indicated by a few dashes drawn inside each of these tiny oval figures, representing an individual bloom. These dashes make every flower resemble a human face—a dash at the bottom is like a smiley in one case, a sad emoji in another.A curly-edged arch possessively runs above the doorway, as if to shield it from rain and sunshine. The three taaks should have claimed attention for their exquisite wavy-shaped outlines, but the extravagant door makes them look like plainly-dressed cousins from the village.If you gaze upon the door from across the road, the panoramic perspective gives it a comical touch. The adjacent walls are in shabby yellow, making the white door look like frosting on a cake.And now another biker parks his bike in front of the doorway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-portal-to-lost-aesthetics-101633295998421.html

Assistant sub-inspector Om Prakash said CCTVs were installed at the house. However, the accused took the DVR with them.A case was registered under Sections 457 (house trespassing) and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sadar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-seeing-off-son-at-delhi-int-l-airport-ludhiana-family-returns-to-find-house-burgled-101633296001743.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Swachh rankings to take Delhi civic bodies’ Covid response into account||Future Swachh Bharat rankings will assess the municipal bodies of Delhi on their response to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly the vaccination of sanitation workers and insurance cover and protective gear provided to them, senior civic officials said.But that’s not all: the overall assessment will also factor in the training provided to workers in dealing with epidemic-related emergencies and providing fair compensation to the dependents of municipal workers who have lost their lives in the line of duty.Sanitation workers were the worst-hit by the pandemic among the municipal staff. Of the 94 officially reported deaths among civic staff due to Covid, 49 were of safai karamcharis.The Swachh Survekshan is an annual national survey to assess cleanliness and sanitation in cities and towns across India. It was launched in 2016 as a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission. Barring 2018, when the south corporation fared relatively well, Delhi’s three municipal corporations have consistently performed poorly in these rankings. In the Swachh Survekshan 2020, the East Delhi civic body was ranked 46th among 47 local bodies in its category, as the South body ranked 31 and the North DMC was at 43rd .A South civic body official from the sanitation department said that the first preparatory meeting for the 2022 Swachh Survekshan happened on September 30 where the new parameters were discussed. “Of the total 2,250 points, 200 will be awarded in epidemic response preparedness; 50 points will be awarded if more than 95% of the frontline workers have been fully vaccinated, while 30 marks will be awarded if between 65 and 80% of the staff have received both doses of the vaccine,” the official said, on condition of anonymity.The municipal corporations have also been asked to provide monthly training to the frontline workers for dealing with epidemic-related emergencies. Another 30 points have been kept for adequate compensation, making it binding on corporations to offer compensation in all cases under the national insurance scheme, official added.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation lost 21 frontline workers to Covid-19. It reported having paid ₹10 lakh as compensation to 20 of them and approving payment in the pending case. Dependents of 11 of the deceased have also been provided jobsThe five local bodies of the city, including the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Cantonment Board, will also be assessed on gear provided to sanitary workers such as personal protective equipment, fluorescent jackets, gloves and boots.In the past year, several sanitation unions have flagged the issue of lack of protective equipment during the pandemic. Deepak Pihal who heads Nigam Karamchari Ekta Manch, a union of sanitation workers, said that while most of the workers have been vaccinated, no significant progress has been made in terms of providing protective equipment or training. “Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been demanding that protective equipment be provided to us. But only tall claims have been made,” Pihal said.The new survey methodology also states that all sanitary workers will have to be trained in segregating waste, collecting waste from quarantined homes, and handling Covid waste. Sanitation workers’ unions say structural changes need to be incorporated to improve working conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/swachh-rankings-to-take-delhi-civic-bodies-covid-response-into-account-101633295687804.html

Following the nod for the names from RJD chief Lalu Prasad, party’s state unit chief Jagtanand Singh announced the names of Arun Shah and Ganesh Bharati from Tarapur and Kusehswarsthan respectively.The JD-U has already announced candidates for both the seats and may be part of a direct contest with the RJD. Ganesh Bharati, who was earlier in the JD-U and also served as a member of the Bihar Legislative Council, switched over to the RJD last year ahead of the Bihar assembly polls. Bharti is from the extremely backward class (Nonia community).However, fielding Bharti from Kusehswarsthan could be difficult for the Congress to digest, as former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Kumar, who lost narrowly last time to JD-U candidate late Shashibhushan Hazari, is eyeing the seat. This time, the late leader’s son Aman Bhushan is contesting.In Tarapur also, RJD has denied a ticket to former Union minister Jai Prakash Yadav’s daughter Divya Prakash, who was runners up to late ML Choudhary in 2020 and gone in for Arun Shah, who is from the Vaishya community. He will be pitted against JD-U’s Kushwaha candidate Rajiv Kumar Singh. JD-U reportedly wanted to give a ticket to late ML Choudhary’s son, but he refused to contest.“The names have been finalised after detailed consultations with winnability as the only factor. The party has gone for winnability. It is a fight to form the government in Bihar, as the mandate was for the RJD-led alliance and all the constituents of the alliance know its importance,” said a senior RJD leader.Congress leader Ashok Kumar, who was a strong claimant for the Kusehswarsthan seat that he also represented in the past, said the party was watching the developments and if required would contest both the seats going to bypolls. “I have been the claimant, as I have nurtured the seat. This is like humiliating the Congress. Our party Vice President Rahul Gandhi’s decision will be final in this regard and we are preparing for both seats,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjd-to-contest-both-seats-in-bihar-bypolls-unhappy-congress-says-move-humiliating-101633295521815.html

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Dengue soars in Mohali, 80% of this year’s cases in September alone||Even as September saw the Covid-19 cases waning in the tricity, dengue cases spiked to the highest since the beginning of the year.Mohali district has been hit the hardest, with 344, or 80%, of the 432 dengue cases all year surfacing in September alone. In contrast, 471 dengue cases were reported last year. The district also lost two residents to the viral infection in the first three days of October – a nine-year-old boy from Adarsh Colony in Balongi and a 20-year-old man from Zirakpur.Last month, too, a 35-year-old policeman from in Dera Bassi had succumbed due to the disease, taking the district’s toll to three this year.While Chandigarh and Panchkula aren’t as affected and have reported no fatality due to dengue, both also saw the cases rise rapidly in September. The month accounts for 59 (75%) of the 78 cases in the UT this year, and 65 (93%) of the 70 cases in Panchkula.Stating that the health department had increased surveillance and testing, Mohali’s district epidemiologist Dr Vikrant Nagra said, “The maximum cases are surfacing in Phase 7, Balongi and Saidpur village in Dera Bassi. Residents are urged to take precautions as the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which causes dengue, breeds till the end of November.” Private hospitals to report all suspected casesCivil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur has asked private hospitals to gear up and cooperate with the health department to fight dengue and other vector-borne diseases in the district.According to health officials, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test facility was a must to detect dengue cases as simple card-based testing may lead to false results.Therefore, all private hospitals and labs need to report any suspected or confirmed dengue cases to the health department for immediate remedial measures. “There are three labs for confirmation of dengue fever at government hospitals in Mohali, Kharar and Dera Bassi,” Dr Kaur said. She also warned private hospitals and laboratories against overcharging dengue patients for tests and treatment, and said patients can contact the helpline 104 for complaints and queries.Early detection crucialHealth experts fear that the combination of dengue and Covid-19 can intensify the severity of both infections, as there is no specific drug for both, and the treatment mostly depends on clinical conditions and symptoms.“Since Covid and dengue have common symptoms, people must get tested for both the diseases as early detection can help them recover better. Covid is also not over yet and people must adhere to safety protocols,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health services, Chandigarh, adding that no case of co-infection had so far been seen in the UT.Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Mukta Kumar urged residents to ensure vector-control measures at their houses and locality. She said the district education officer had also been told to sensitise schoolchildren regarding preventive measures in the school assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-soars-in-mohali-80-of-this-year-s-cases-in-september-alone-101633295105777.html

He added: “If this government were to keep Sajjan on, it would send a strong message that they don’t care about women in the military.”National Post columnist Sabrina Maddeaux voiced the same view, as she wrote: “If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is at all serious about changing the military’s toxic culture, when he names his new cabinet in October, there must be a new defence minister.”She added that Sajjan had “lost all credibility when it comes to the institution’s sexual misconduct crisis.”Former New Democratic Party leader Tom Mulcair echoed that sentiment in the outlet CTV: “Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has been an abject failure in dealing with the issue of sexual misconduct in the military. Women who have courageously come forward have felt betrayed.”The Canadian Press reported recently that the calls for his ouster from the ministry will be very difficult for Trudeau to ignore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/armed-forces-crisis-calls-grow-to-remove-sajjan-as-canadian-defence-minister-101633295103270.html

In a meeting held in July this year, GMADA has already been requested to hand over the control of building regulations of the areas/sectors falling within MC limits at the earliest.”The letter said in 2013, the Punjab department of housing and urban development had issued a notification, wherein the commissioner of municipal corporations, under Section 2 of the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Act, was appointed as the competent authority to exercise and perform powers granted under Section 81 of Chapter 11 of the aforesaid Act.But the department, in a notification issued in August this year, appointed the commissioners of all municipal corporations as competent authority under the Act, while excluding only Mohali, the mayor wrote.Speaking to HT, he said the minister had been requested to make amendments in the August notification to include the Mohali MC commissioner under the ambit of the Act as well to allow MC more control of building regulations, such as approval of building plans, collection of non-construction fees and change of land use (CLU) permissions, in areas falling under its limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mayor-writes-to-punjab-local-bodies-minister-demanding-more-powers-for-mc-101633295101552.html
04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab transport minister gets 50 private buses impounded in Ludhiana||Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring had 50 private buses, which were parked on government land, challaned and impounded, on Sunday while he was inspecting the Ludhiana bus stand. The minister, who arrived at the bus stand at around 8.15am, initiated a cleanliness drive and checked the operations. Taking cognisance of the complaints filed by the roadways and PRTC bus operators during his five-hour visit, the minister observed that private buses illegally stabled outside the Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Stand on government land were a menace and directed the local Regional Transport Authorities (RTA) to immediately impound the vehicles.Following the minister’s directions, Ludhiana Improvement Trust chairperson Raman Balasubramaniam wrote to the RTA on the spot, requesting that action be taken against encroachment of government land by private buses and observed that the LIT had spent crores on beautifying the spot where the bus stood and had also installed pavement tiles. Authorities also got the taxi stand cleared from the area.The RTA said, “Private buses are not supposed to be parked at the spot. Moreover, these buses do not pay any fee to the transport authorities. These buses ply illegally and gather passengers from outside the bus stand, which causes losses to the government.” Drivers say they pay ₹500 to park Warring also ordered the LIT chairman to float tenders for making a parking lot so that government land was not encroached. The driver of an impounded bus said, “We pay ₹500 to park the bus outside the bus stand. However, now officers are challaning us. This is an election stunt.”The minister also pulled up officials for neglecting cleanliness at the bus stand. He also asked authorities to take measures to check water accumulation at the bus stand and demanded that the contractor hired for the maintenance of the bus stand be suspended, which led to a spat between the contractor and the officials. Finally, the contractor agreed to increase the number of garbage carts and dustbins at the bus stand. During his inspection, Warring was seen picking up garbage. He warned officials that he would be carrying out surprise visits. Inquiry transport mafia Warring also called Ludhiana commissioner of police GPS Bhullar to seek action against the alleged bus mafia.A senior transport official, on condition of anonymity, said, “The government remained silent on the issue, despite numerous complaints from the local administration. It is only now when the elections are near that the government showing such sincerity”, said an official.On why nothing had been done to bring down the mafia so far, the minister said an inquiry will be launched into the matter. Warring said, “I am sure that officials were aware of it, but they did nothing. It is also possible that a minister may be hands in glove with the mafia. This is the first time I have heard of such a mafia. I will surely take action against the mafia.” “On Monday, we will issue a Whatsapp complaint number, on which people will be able to lodge their complaints regarding transport and may share the videos of any wrongdoing on the part of the officials,” said Warring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-transport-minister-gets-50-private-buses-impounded-in-ludhiana-101633294862994.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Vendors’ count by municipal bodies not realistic: NASVI||The National Street Vendors Association of India (NASVI) has alleged several shortcomings in the recently concluded surveys of street vendors by the town vending committees. They said the committees have identified only 71,347 street vendors during the survey between January 1 and September 30, 2021, adding that according to their assessment there were at least 200,000 street vendors in the capital.According to the data provided by the three municipal corporations, the North Delhi civic body has surveyed the maximum, 27,819, vendors in its six administrative zones, the south corporation counted 23,951 vendors and 19,577 street vendors were counted by the east civic body. Maximum vendors have been found in the central, south and City-Sadar Paharganj zones.Arvind Singh, national coordinator of NASVI, said not even 50% of street vendors have been covered in this survey. “The real number of street vendors in the city is at least 200,000. This is despite around 20% of street vendors leaving the city for their villages and hometowns during the pandemic lockdowns,” Singh said.He added that the surveying agencies have failed to consider street vendors in low-income areas and non-market areas. In some cases, they failed to recognize that some street vending activities occur at specific times in some areas. “If the survey teams do not visit the commercial areas at different times, they will fail to capture the real situation on ground,” he added.NASVI said that even the street vending Act recognizes that 5% of population could be engaged in street vending activities. According to the North MCD report, the civic body teams have surveyed 5,912 people in City Sadar Paharganj zone, 4,018 in Karol Bagh, 2,861 in Civil Lines zone, 5,334 in Keshav Puram zone, 5,080 in Rohini and 4,614 in Narela zone. Similarly, the south corporation has identified 8,140 street vendors in Central zone, 7,789 in South zone, 4,350 in West zone and 3,672 in Najafgarh.A senior municipal corporation official said the exercise is being undertaken through empanelled agencies in all municipal wards. “The survey report will be used for providing certificates to the street vendors so that they are regularised, and do not face eviction,” the official explained.“The survey reports will be put in the public domain and feedback will be sought,” the official said.NASVI has also written to Chief Justice of India alleging that street vendors have been excluded in places like Nehru place, Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar. In some cases such as Chandni Chowk, the traders have also resisted the surveys citing that the areas are already declared as no-hawking zones.“Some areas were declared to be no-squatting zones by the courts in 2000 while the street vendors act came in 2014. Vendors who came after 2000 should not be permitted,” said Sanjay Bhargava from Chandni Chowk traders’ body.Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman of the North Delhi civic body said that he was not aware of survey findings, and that he will look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vendors-count-by-municipal-bodies-not-realistic-nasvi-101633294616225.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Electricity bill subsidy a distant dream for tenants caught in power play with owners||This summer has been harsh for 40-year-old Amarjeet Chauhan, a footwear vendor who sells his merchandise on a pavement in northeast Delhi’s Sonia Vihar, and his family of six. Chauhan had to pay monthly power bills ranging from ₹400 to ₹1,200 between April and August for his two-room rented accommodation, which has two ceiling fans, two bulbs, a tube light, an old television set, and a small refrigerator.They cannot avail of government waivers such as not having to pay anything for up to 200 units a month, because they do not have a separate power connection, but a sub-meter instead.The entire building, which has five more families renting homes, has one power connection, with each household equipped with a sub-meter. While the owner of the house pays the power bill at the government subsidised tariff, he assesses the consumption of each tenant household and charges ₹9 per unit from each of them-- more than double the rate which discoms charge.“With incomes going down because of the pandemic, it was difficult to pay electricity bills. It would have been a big relief if we could have availed of the government subsidies and waivers,” said Chauhan’s wife Renuka, who works as a domestic help.A government scheme launched in September 22, 2019 allowed families, such as Chauhans — living as tenants with no separate power connection — to install proper electricity meters and avail of subsidies.Delhi has at least 4.9 million domestic power consumers.To install separate electric meters, the homeowners and tenants have to be in agreement. Many landlords often do not agree for a range of reasons beyond just additional income.“We live in an unauthorised colony. Ownership documents of properties here are not registered, legally. Having more than one power connection for one house can lead to legal complications in future,” said Balram Tyagi, a property dealer based in north Delhi’s Burari, who has five tenants in his own building.As the population in Delhi increased, hundreds of unplanned and illegal colonies mushroomed across the city. Despite some of them being regularised, Delhi still has around 1,900 such colonies on paper and at least five million people — roughly 25% of the city’s population – stay in these colonies.Akhil Monga, a landlord based in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, said, “When the tenants agree to pay rent, they also give their consent to pay power charges mentioned in the rent agreement. That way, it is legitimate income for the owner.”In two years of the government launching the scheme of separate electricity meters for tenants, only 1,019 tenants have installed meters, show government records. However, according to the government’s socio-economic survey released in 2020, Delhi has around 3.6 million households, roughly one-third of which occupy rented accommodations.“There is not much we can do if the owner of the house disagrees,” said Manik Kumar, a sanitation worker who lives with his family in south-east Delhi’s Tigri neighbourhood. “In our case, we tried convincing the owner of the house twice. He did not agree and told us that we could look for another house if we had a problem,” said KumarSeveral tenants said that even though their landlords agreed, they found the one-time payment of ₹6,000 too high in the light of adverse economic impact of the pandemic. Out of ₹6,000, half the amount is security deposit, which is refundable, and the other half is a non-refundable installation charge.Tenants who can avail of the government’s subsidised power rates said it is a big relief, especially amid a pandemic. “None of us had work for several months last year. Thankfully, we did not have to pay any power bills... In most months, we manage to keep the total monthly consumption below 200 units and avail of the 100% subsidy because we have a separate meter,” said Rakesh Singh, who lives with his wife and 10-year-old son in a rented accommodation at a slum in Deoli.A senior government official said: “The government has reduced paperwork and compliances to a minimum. A meter can be installed within 24 hours. But the government or discoms cannot get into disputes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/electricity-bill-subsidy-a-distant-dream-for-tenants-caught-in-power-play-with-owners-101633294290920.html
04-10-2021||Bangalore||NCB nabs gang delivering drugs disguised as Swiggy delivery agents||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has busted a drug trafficking gang, members of which were posing as food delivery agents for supplying drugs in Bengaluru and Shivamogga. This gang of seven people used the recent lockdown to deliver drugs across the two cities, according to a statement from NCB. According to Amit Gawate, zonal director of NCB’s Bengaluru unit, based on specific information on Thursday, they caught two residents of Bengaluru while they were in the process of taking delivery of eight boxes of the contraband from a courier vehicle and loading the same into a car. “A thorough examination revealed 137 kg of high-grade marijuana packed in paper packets wrapped with adhesive tapes, which was seized. Searches at the residence of one of the accused led to the recovery of ₹4.81 lakh cash. Packing materials used for retail packing of the contraband was also found,” read a statement from NCB. The NCB said that a Swiggy delivery executive who was about to deliver a parcel was also apprehended. NCB also claimed that during the lockdown, peddlers pretending to be agents of Swiggy delivered drugs in Bengaluru. “The traffickers, instead of going and buying the drugs, booked the drugs consignments through couriers, by giving addresses of non-functional shops or other business establishments,” the NCB said in a statement. “The kingpin, along with associates, was operating the drug trafficking on a large scale in Bengaluru City and its outskirts and were delivering the drugs to their consumers under the disguise of Swiggy delivery boys since lockdown guidelines under Covid-19 restrictions allowed such deliveries under service of essential commodities,” the NCB added. “This drug cartel has many Swiggy delivery boys in their drug syndicate who have mastered the drug delivery mechanism in Bangalore. The syndicate thrived especially during the lockdown and used to assure customers of doorstep delivery,” the NCB said in the statement. The NCB said it carried out searches at residential premises of another accused, and that it has recovered about three kilograms of ganja, packed in small packets with specific markings on it, and cash of ₹39,000. Follow-up action led to the arrest of four people in Shivamogga on Friday, October 1, including the man who has been handling the finances of the network, the agency claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ncb-nabs-gang-delivering-drugs-disguised-as-swiggy-delivery-agents-101633294382905.html

It has economic viability as well. The NTPC and other thermal power plants are purchasing the crop residue. The government has given around ₹700 crore to these states for the higher use of crop residue removal machines.”After harvesting paddy, the main kharif crop, in October, farmers set their fields on fire to clear the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. Yadav said that some experiments have been conducted on the use of biological decomposition technology. “We have held meetings with states and control rooms have also been set up,” he said.The Union minister also mentioned about creating straw-based animal feed for the Kutch region in Gujarat.During the event he also flagged off the field work of the Area Frame Establishment Survey (AFES). “The ministry of labour and employment has entrusted the Labour Bureau with three major all-India surveys on migrant workers, quarterly establishment-based employment survey (AQEES) and domestic workers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-taking-steps-to-check-stubble-burning-says-union-minister-101633294381479.html

Pargat, who is MLA from Jalandhar cantonment, made this statement a day after he accused Amarinder of being responsible for a conspiracy to delay paddy procurement in the state.Interacting with the media at the grain market near HMV College in Jalandhar while starting the paddy procurement process on Sunday, Pargat said he was I was already saying that Amarinder was more inclined towards the BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal. “Capt’s party will ultimately be supported by the BJP as he has already met Amit Shah.

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Pick up sticks against opponents: Haryana CM Khattar||Stirring a controversy in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers’ agitation, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday asked Bharatiya Janata Party’s kisan morcha workers to raise groups of volunteers in northern and north-western districts who can “pick up sticks” to take on opponents.The reference was evidently aimed at the farmers who have been protesting the ruling BJP-Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leaders in the state and disrupting their visits and events.“We will have to encourage upcoming farmer groups... In every district, particularly the northern and north western districts, we will have to raise groups of 500-700 kisan volunteers... And then Sathe Shathyam Samacharet (tit for tat). Pick up sticks,” Khattar was seen telling the workers, who were heard laughing at his comments in a video shared widely on social media.Responding to a remark by a person in the gathering (which was not audible), Khattar further told the gathering not to worry about jamanat (bail) after picking up sticks. “If you spend a couple of months.... you will become a leader. You will learn much more than these meetings and become a tall leader. Your name will get etched in history,’’ he said in a reference to doing time in jail.A government official said the chief minister’s remarks were shown selectively in the viral video. “The video lacked perspective and is misleading. It was an internal meeting of party workers. The chief minister told them to oppose wrong actions but by maintaining discipline. In fact, the chief minister told the party workers to maintain discipline and not to take the law in their hands,’’ the official said, requesting anonymity.Former BJP MLA, Sukhwinder Sheoran, who was present at the BJP kisan morcha meeting at Khattar’s residence on Sunday, said the remarks regarding raising volunteers were only aimed at countering the propaganda about the three central farm laws.The remarks drew criticism from opposition parties. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet that rule of law cannot be maintained in the state if the chief minister himself speaks about inciting violence and breaking law and order. “The anti-farmer face of the BJP stands exposed. It’s time to get rid of this government,” Surjewala tweeted.The fresh controversy over the “sticks” remark has come after an IAS officer posted as the Karnal SDM was in August seen telling cops to hit farmers in the head if they try to disrupt a BJP event. The remark and a police lathi charge at a toll plaza in Karnal fuelled protests by farmers unions. The farmers relented after the government set up a commission of inquiry to probe the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pick-up-sticks-against-opponents-haryana-cm-khattar-101633293175606.html

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-Punjab CM Badal hits campaign trail, says farmers wrongly demonising Akali Dal||Five-time Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Sunday said that the protesting farmer unions were wrongly demonising the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and appealed to them to acknowledge what he termed as the party’s “contribution to the welfare of the peasantry”.At a political event in Bathinda to demand compensation for cotton growers for the loss caused due to the pink bollworm attack, the nonagenarian Akali patriarch termed Lok Sabha MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Union cabinet as their party’s commitment to fight for the cause of farmers. The 93-year-old leader made his first public appearance in Punjab in the last over two years. “When new agriculture laws were being framed, Harsimrat advised the Centre to consult the farmers before finalising them. When the Union government did not pay heed to our appeals, ours was the only party that cast a vote against the Bills on the floor of the House. She quit the ministerial position in protest. Can there be a bigger contribution n than this?” he asked the farmer associations which have been opposing the SAD events.The rally was held a month after SAD-BSP alliance was forced to shelve election campaign ‘Gall Punjab Di’ after farmer union activists created a ruckus at party president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s event in Moga on September 3.Addressing the gathering, Sukhbir said the party would gherao the residence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi if the affected cotton farmers are not paid a compensation of ₹50,000 per acre within a week.Touching on the panthic agenda, the Badal senior said the SAD was the real custodian of khalsa (Sikhism) and Punjab heritage that understands the aspirations of Punjabis. But he was quick to vouch for the “secular credentials” of the party, saying it had always given political representation to leaders from all faiths and castes.Taking potshots at the Congress, he said, “It is a baseless allegation that then SAD government mishandled the incidents of sacrilege. The Congress should answer who was behind the attack on the Harmandir Sahib and anti-Sikh riots of 1984,” he said.The 93-year-old spoke non-stop at the rally for 35-minutes. He, however, fumbled while greeting leaders from the dais as “friends from the BJP”, the Akali Dal’s former ally for 25 years.The protest rally was well-attended but the party activists were unresponsive, a fact that was pointed out by Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/expunjab-cm-badal-hits-campaign-trail-says-farmers-wrongly-demonising-akalidal-101633292462425.html

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||BJP deliberates on candidates for Himachal bypolls||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) election committee met at Dharamshala on Sunday to deliberate on the probable candidates for the bypolls slated at the end of this month for Mandi parliamentary constituency and three assembly segments of Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai. The poll panel includes Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, Union sports minister Anurag Thakur, state party chief Suresh Kashyap, BJP national vice-president Saudan Singh, state party incharge Avinash Rai Khanna and co-incharge Sanjay Tandon, BJP organisational secretary Pawan Rana, former state party chief Satpal Singh Satti, former Speaker Rajiv Bindal and party general secretaries Trilok Jamwal, Trilok Kapoor and Rakesh Jamwal. Sources said that the election committee meeting, which was underway till the filing of this report, would pick two names from each constituency, which will be sent to the party’s parliamentary board for the final approval. Earlier, while speaking to the media, state party chief Kashyap had expressed confidence that the BJP will win all four bypolls. He said the development will be the main poll plank of the party. “Jai Ram Thakur-led government has done unprecedented development in the state,” he added. He said the Congress lacks leadership and commitment. Mandi Lok Sabha seat has been vacant since the death of Ramswaroop Sharma in March this year. The Arki seat fell vacant after six-time CM Virbhadra Singh died on July 8, while the Jubbal-Kotkhai incumbent MLA Narendra Bragta passed away in June. Former transport minister Sujan Singh Pathania, who represented Fatehpur, had died in February. The election committee also held a meeting with incharges appointed for the byelections, including state industries minister Vikram Singh Thakur, power minister Sukhram Chaudhary, forest minister Rakesh Pathania, health minister Rajiv Sehjal, education minister Govind Thakur, Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur and former state president Rajeev Bindal. The incharges have suggested forming a panel to hold talks with disgruntled leaders. The BJP fears rebellion by former MP Maheshwar Singh in Mandi. He is a former three-term MP from Mandi parliamentary seat. He holds sway in some pockets. It is worth mentioning that the party has been considering the names of state Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh and education minister Govind Thakur for the Mandi Lok Sabha ticket. Besides them, Pankaj Jamwal, the BJP leader from Jogindernagar and the younger brother of BJP organisational secretary for the seven northeast states Ajay Jamwal, is also vying for the ticket. Others are CM’s close aide Nihal Chand, who was the Milkfed chairperson, and Kargil hero Brigadier Kushal Thakur. Ajay Rana, the BJP spokesperson, is also vying for ticket, besides state media coordinator Praveen Sharma. The Mandi seat is also a litmus test for Jai Ram Thakur for being his home turf. In Jubbal-Kotkhai, Narendra Bragta’s son Chetan is the front-runner among the probables. However, former zila parishad member Neelam Seraik, who also has a strong vote base, is also vying for the ticket. It would be a challenge for the BJP to prevent any rebellion as it may harm the party’s prospects in the elections. On the Arki seat, the BJP is already facing revolt by former MLA Govind Ram Sharma. The BJP is said to be unanimous on the name of Rattan Pal Singh. However, Sharma has announced to contest as an Independent, posing a challenge to the saffron party. In Fatehpur, former MP Kripal Parmar and local leader Baldev Thakur are the main contenders. If Baldev is denied the ticket, he may revolt as he has done in the past. In 2017, Baldev had secured more than 13,000 votes when he contested as an Independent and was the reason behind BJP candidate Parmar’s defeat. Another BJP rebel, former MP Rajan Sushant, is also considering to contest from Fatehpur and would only dent the BJP’s prospects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-deliberates-on-candidates-for-himachal-bypolls-101633291861382.html

Addressing a press conference, Mankotia, who had been lying low for quite long, said since Himachal was set for a bypoll, whatever has happened in Punjab, would impact the election outcome here. “Captain Amarinder Singh was one of the tallest leaders in Punjab. He is and will remain so. If one thinks that his resignation would not affect Himachal, he is mistaken. This episode would affect the entire north India,” said Mankotia. He said that Captain has hinted at floating a new party along with other disgruntled leaders. “In such a situation, it seems that at present the Congress is completely on its downfall,” Mankotia said, adding that Amarinder had already said that former PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu was a traitor. “Due to him, not only Punjab but Himachal as well as entire country faces a security threat. Pakistan and China want to destabilise India though Sidhu. This problem should be solved at the national level,” he said.“It (Congress) is a sinking ship. Many leaders have left and others are leaving. Just about four days ago, a former Congress CM of Goa joined the TMC,” he said.“Gradually, we are heading for a showdown within the Congress. I fear there would be a vertical split in the party,” said Mankotia.He said the G-23 leaders who had sought a change in the party leadership would also take some decision sooner or later.The protest outside former Union minister Kapil Sibbal’s house was an indicator what is going to happen, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-a-sinking-ship-former-minister-vijai-mankotia-101633290542346.html

While it has been carefully conserved till date, digitalisation will help researchers and historians take this wealth of knowledge into the future.Senior historian and secretary of Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pandurang Balkawade, said, “We have decided to digitalise all our rare documents and letters available at the library. It is a five-year project as the number of documents is huge with around 2.5 lakh rare historic papers and letters. The formal tender of this work is going to be finalised within one month and then the actual work will start. It will certainly help to take these historic documents forward to preserve them in digital format for researchers ahead and to find new things about our history.”Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal was founded by historians V K Rajwade and Khanderao Mehendale on July 7, 1910. Its main building is located at Sadashiv peth next to Bharat Natya Mandir auditorium. Meanwhile, the renovation work of this over 100 years’ old building is also being planned by the management.“The building has become old and needs to be renovated so we have decided to renovate it without hampering its historic value. Nothing new will be built, only the damaged parts and some minor changes and repair works will be undertaken. The budget for this renovation will be around ₹1 crore and we are working on finalising its tender,” said Balkawade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bharat-itihas-sanshodhak-mandal-in-pune-to-digitise-250k-rare-documents-101633289461722.html

As per information released by the Pune RTO, in 2018, 685 licences were suspended, while that figure in 2019 was 505. In 2020 it was 257, and currently, in 2021, 50 driving licences have been suspended as of September 30. So a total of 1,497 driving licences have been suspended by the Pune RTO for violation of traffic rules under relevant sections of the Motor Vehicle Act. The licence suspensions are for those who are repeat offenders and offences include driving under the influence of alcohol, speaking on a mobile phone while riding a bike or driving a car, and breaking the red light at a signal, among others.The RTO’s special ‘Vayuveg Pathak’ squads have used data shared by the Pune traffic police to track the repeat offenders.“When we receive cases from the Pune traffic police department, our squads take action. If a person is found repeatedly breaking a traffic law, then the licence is suspended,” said deputy regional transport officer (RTO), Sanjeev Bhor. “Now we have got interceptor vehicles, with which it will be easy and accurate to observe and take action against traffic violators. These modern, fully equipped interceptor vehicles will be beneficial for our flying squads patrolling the highways.

04-10-2021||Pune||Countdown to Pune polls: Civic issues plague Khadakwasla||The lungs of Pune city. That is the fast-catching on descriptor for all the hills that surround the city’s urban landscape, and as that population grows, the hills that are increasingly part of the city.The assembly seat of Khadakwasla may well be the epicentre of that ecological pattern for Pune - it has plenty of hills.One main point of discussion when it comes to Khadakwasla though, with the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) elections on the horizon, centres around the word “construction”.That is the tightrope any, and all, candidates contesting the civic elections from this seat must contend with. Sustainable development of this mega-urban settlement of Pune is at stake.A major problem in PMC wards here is the regularising of small constructions, qualified as they are, as “illegal.” Even as the state government gave permission to regularise homes built under the gunthewari scheme, PMC has not started the procedure yet. The apathy of PMC and district administration has led to illegal structures flourishing on various hills in Katraj-Sinhgad stretch, which are otherwise is ecologically rich. The lungs of the city getting clogged. The wards under the Khadakwasla assembly constituency - Warje, Karvenagar, Dhankawadi - have a mixed population - urban and rural. The area covers Dandekar bridge to Singhgad fort, Warje, Bavdhan and then it is connected to Ambegaon, Katraj road and Dhankawadi, towards Satara road. Last week, Nitin Gadkari, Union minister for highways, was in Pune to lay the foundation stone for the proposed flyover on Sinhgad road. Gadkari asked the PMC to rethink its existing design and instead a multi-level structure, which can facilitate road traffic, as well as a Metro line. Gadkari’s suggestion was apt. However, it should have come years ago and the civic body might have acted on it bringing relief to the daily traffic jams that plague the area. Known to be Pune’s entry-exit points on the south, the Katraj to Sinhgad road stretch has witnessed a massive growth in population. After its merger with PMC in 2018, when the state government included 23 villages in the municipal limits, the areas along the Katraj-Sinhgad road have seen major real estate development. For Amol Tonpe, a call centre employee, negotiating Navale bridge daily is a nightmare due to increased traffic. “I am staying at Ambegaon behind the Shiv Shrusti. There is a need for another underpass at the Katraj-Navale bridge stretch, as the existing underpass is not enough. While the service road construction is underway, it is tough to ride a bike due to the work going on,” said Tonpe (34), a resident of Sai siddhi society Its’ been two years, and the road widening work undertaken by the Central Public Works Department between Navale bridge-Katraj is on. There is no sign it will be over soon. Citizens feel service roads, currently being developed till Navale bridge, should be extended up to Warje due to heavy traffic. “I need to travel everyday towards Hinjewadi. Many IT employees like me travel on the highway, which sees movement of heavy traffic. If there are service roads, we can avoid speeding trucks,” said Chetan Desle, an IT professional, who resides in a bungalow in the area.With the Katraj-Navale bridge stretch announced as part of the national Highway, Nitin Gadkari has shown an interest to allocate funds for various projects here which include another proposed flyover at Katraj square. For years, citizens living in areas under Dhankawadi, Sinhgad road and Warje ward offices of PMC have been deprived of basic amenities like roads and planned development. Five years ago, when local residents chose BJP and NCP (Supriya Sule is the MP of this area) in these areas, many thought they will see development. However, what they have got in return is everyday traffic on streets, more illegal constructions and water cuts, despite the fact that Khadakwasla dam is located here. “We have been facing a water problem in Shivane along Sinhgad road for years. Despite assurances from PMC, there has been no improvement and we continue to face a water scarcity,” said Desle. For residents of Sinhgad road, it’s an irony that there is a water shortage despite the fact that city gets water from Khadakwasla, which is located on same stretch. Power playEarlier, this area was mainly dominated by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) although the last few elections, as the urban population increased, BJP could wrest the control in some parts. If Sinhgad road and Bavdhan are dominated by the BJP, Warje and Dhankawadi are still a stronghold of the NCP. For citizens, their problems should be tackled by leaders without looking for mileage. The residents of Satara road, up to Katraj, which is one of the most crowded entry and exit points for the city, are awaiting a proposed Metro line that recently received the PMC nod. The idea that merged with the PMC will end all civic issues, has only remained a dream, as poor road infrastructure, unauthorised hawkers and illegal constructions have not diminished. Sachin Joshi, a teacher running private coaching classes in the area said, “I live on Sinhgad road where traffic problems during peak hours happen daily. Most often, hawkers have encroached on the road which causes more trouble. The PMC needs to take action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/countdown-to-pune-polls-civic-issues-plague-khadakwasla-101633288925546.html
04-10-2021||Mumbai||BMC R-North ward launches daily Covid session online with 100 societies in Dahisar||Data from the first and second waves of Covid-19 have revealed that nearly 90% of the infected cases were recorded from high-rise buildings as compared to slums. Keeping this in mind and anticipating a third wave, the R-North ward that covers Dahisar on Sunday launched an online educational session, in which representatives of 100 societies will be sensitised about Covid-appropriate behaviours on a daily basis. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the idea behind the session is to create awareness about monsoon-related ailments which have symptoms similar to novel coronavirus.While Mumbai has not witnessed a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases over the past one month, the speculation of a third wave is not over yet. Taking advantage of this period, BMC wants to focus on raising awareness in the non-slum areas.“As the chance of a third wave still looms, we have decided to increase awareness among people and motivate residents to follow Covid-19 precautionary measures through online sessions. We have invited the representatives of the societies who will be sensitised about the ‘dos and don’ts’. Later, during the monthly review meetings of these societies, they can disperse the information to their residents,” said Dr Avinash Waydande, medical officer of health, R-North ward.With the help of the ward’s councillors, the civic health department will hold the online meeting with 100 societies on a daily basis for the next two weeks. At the end of the meetings, the representatives will be provided with PPT on all the required information. “The chairman or secretaries of the societies can use the ready-made PPT in their monthly reviews to sensitise the residents,” he added.Along with this, the ward health department will also disperse information about monsoon-related diseases in the online sessions. “Like every year, this year also, Mumbai is recording monsoon-related diseases such as dengue, malaria and leptospirosis, among others. Many of these diseases have symptoms similar to Covid-19. Thus, we want to raise awareness among people so that they don’t ignore timely diagnosis, which can delay their treatment of a possible Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal officer of the ward.On Sunday, the ward started the programme in two batches, wherein the first 100 societies participated from Dahisar (East). “Despite being a weekend, the ward held the meeting with us for our convenience. It cleared many doubts and queries which helped provide us a better picture about Covid-appropriate behaviour. We will soon hold meetings with the residents and put up the guidelines in our society,” said Omkar Dubey from Vishnu Park Society in Rawalpada, Dahisar East where 500 residents live. “We have already ensured that all the residents above 18 years get fully vaccinated in our society,” he said.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the ward has recorded 22,955 Covid-19 cases.As on October 2, R-North ward did not have any sealed buildings but had 51 sealed floors. BMC’s dashboard shows that the average seven-day growth rate of the ward stands at 0.04%— the lowest in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-r-north-ward-launches-daily-covid-session-online-with-100-societies-in-dahisar-101633288747805.html

04-10-2021||Chandigarh||High permit costs: Traders keep Manimajra Sunday car bazaar closed||After appealing to the municipal corporation (MC) authorities to charge only half of the permit cost citing lack of business in the last three months, all traders of the second-hand car market refused to open shop on Sunday and are threatening to continue the same from next week onwards if their demands aren’t met.Speaking about this, president of the Car Bazaar Dealer Association, Gulshan Kumar, said, “Our business has thinned out due to Covid and due to bad weather. The MC is asking us for ₹8,260 per ten cars as fees for setting up shop here every Sunday. We are asking that they take only half this fee owing to the hardships that the traders are facing, but they are being apathetic.”Kumar added that he will discuss this issue with the MC authorities in the coming days. “A large chunk of our customers included people who would come from adjoining states. This travel has stopped now owing to the pandemic and we have not sold any cars. It will not be financially viable for us to stay open from next week onwards if our demands aren’t met,” he said.Speaking about this, Chandigarh mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “Earlier in the MC house meeting, we had given a three-month waiver to the traders that they would have to pay 50% of their fees. From October, they were to pay the original amount. We have heard their issues and this will be a part of the agenda of the next House meeting.”Sharma added that they will introduce the matter asking for a similar waiver till December. However, it now depends on the House whether it will be approved or not.Before the pandemic, the Sunday second hand car bazaar had been at loggerheads with the authorities over where they could set up shop. For many years they had been working out of Sector 7, however, they were allocated space in Hallomajra village and after repeated complaints, they were able to open shop at Manimajra.“We don’t have any cover when it rains and the administration hasn’t given us any facilities here. However, we are thankful that we were shifted here from Hallomajra as it was bad for business,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-permit-costs-traders-keep-manimajra-sunday-car-bazaar-closed-101633288624068.html
04-10-2021||Noida||Noida’s Emerald Court case: SIT submits report, names 26 officials||The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted to investigate irregularities in the approval of building and map plans for the Supertech group’s twin tower project, in violation of building regulations, has named at least 26 former and current officials of the Noida authority in its report that was submitted to the Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday. The SIT has recommended action against all 26 officials, as well as four Supertech directors and private architects. Of the 26 officials identified by the investigating team, two are already dead, 20 have retired, three are still serving with the authority, and one officer has already been suspended. Chairman of the Noida authority Sanjiv Mittal, who is heading the SIT, said, “Action should be taken against 20 retired officials as per the law and the three officials, who are in service, should be suspended. One official, Mukesh Goyal, who was a manager in the planning department, has already been suspended.” The SIT has also recommended filing an FIR against four directors of Supertech Limited, two private architects and the 24 Noida officials. The team has also directed the Noida authority to free 7,000 square metres of green area in Supertech’s Emerald housing project, which was encroached upon and merged into the housing project illegally. “We have also directed the Noida authority to act against officials, who were hand in glove with the Supertech group,” said Mittal.On August 31, a Supreme Court bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud directed the demolition of the twin towers part of Supertech’s Emerald Court project, over grave violations of building norms, which, the court said, was a result of “nefarious complicity” between Noida Authority and the real estate developer. Further, the bench asked Supertech to refund money to all the existing home-buyers in Emerald Court’s Apex and Ceyane towers within two months, along with an interest of 12% per annum from the date of their deposits. Supertech has approached the Supreme Court to stop the court-ordered demolition of the two 40-storey towers, saying that it has an alternative plan that could save several crores of rupees from going waste and also prove to be “beneficial for the environment”.The UP government had constituted an SIT on September 2, two days after the Supreme Court gave the demolition order. “The action has been recommended according to the provisions of the UP Apartment Act, 2010, and other rules. Now, appropriate action will be initiated according to the Supreme Court order,” said Mittal. Officials from the Supertech group refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noidas-emerald-court-case-sit-submits-report-names-26-officials-101633288504917.html

There are five underground stations. Of these five metro stations, Maha-Metro is erecting multi-modal hubs at three stations. The underground station at Mandai is behind schedule as land was handed over to Maha-Metro in July by the Pune municipal corporation (PMC).Atul Gadgil, director of Maha-Metro said, “After crossing the Mutha river, we speeded up tunneling. At present, we have completed around 75 per cent of the work. One TBM (tunnel boring machine) has crossed Mandai and is moving towards Budhwar peth. A second TBM has started work from Swargate towards Mandai.”He added, “Stations take more time and work is going smoothly and at full speed.”The ongoing Pune metro rail had already constructed an underground tunnel of 1.6 km stretch from Agriculture College to Civil Court in Shivajinagar.Maha-Metro is carrying out the Pune Metro Rail Project, which has two corridors — one from Vanaz to Ramwadi which is an elevated line; and the other from PCMC to Swargate, which is elevated from PCMC to Agriculture college, and thereafter underground up to Swargate. The underground section is six-km long with stations proposed at Shivajinagar bus stand, Civil Court, Phadke houd, Mandai and Swargate.The total metro rail route under construction is 31km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/metro-tunnel-on-shivajinagar-to-swargate-stretch-75-complete-101633288501810.html

The move is aimed at tackling the increasing cybercrime incidents in the city, they added.For now, most of the cybercrimes are handled by a specialised cyber cell, and victims who approach the local police station are often sent there.According to a senior official, several cybercrime cases are reported in the city on a daily basis, of which a majority is related to online fraud. Officials said this on the side-lines of a workshop organised to train the police officials on handling complaints related to cybercrimes.The police commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar, Alok Singh, said that they are working on a strategy, under which the incidents of cybercrimes could be reported at the police station level soon, and the incidents may be moved to the next level as per the severity.“To handle the incidents, we are working on a strategy under which all three zones of the city will have cyber help desks in the first stage, and every police station will have a cybercrime help desk in the future, which will take cognisance of relevant incidents. The routine or general cyber incidents shall be resolved at the police station level, while those with relatively higher severity shall be escalated further,” Singh said.On Sunday, the Gautam Budh Nagar police held a workshop for all the DCPs and other police officers in Noida, to train and brief them on how to handle complaints related to cybercrimes. The training session, chaired by Singh, and held by a private consultant, specifically for the investigators at the police station level, focused on what should be the first response if someone reports a cybercrime-related incident.“Cybercrime incidents are on the rise, and maximum cases are related to online cheating and fraud which constitute about 60% of the total incidents. Today, we held a training session for our SHOs, investigators, etc., on the same. The session focused on several things, including how to handle the routine cybercrime incidents, basic tools on how to reach the cyber criminals, and providing relief to the victims,” Singh said.According to the officials, Noida sees several hundred cybercrime incidents in a month. “About 60% of the reported cases are routine or related to online fraud, fake IDs, and smaller transactions, while the remaining 40% are critical incidents,” said a police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-stations-to-soon-get-cybercrime-help-desks-101633288145606.html

September saw the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases of viral, mosquito-borne infections (dengue and chikungunya) which are now emerging as the new health challenge for the administration.As per PMC health department data, the city recorded 122 confirmed cases of dengue and 69 confirmed cases of chikungunya in the week between September 29 and October 2. Both diseases are spread by the Aedes Aegypti breed of mosquito. As of now, there are 395 and 2,073 confirmed and suspected cases of dengue, respectively; and 180 confirmed cases of chikungunya in the city. Out of the 395 confirmed cases of dengue, 192 were reported in September alone. Similarly, out of the 180 confirmed cases of chikungunya, 80 were reported in September alone. So much so that the civic body issued a total 2,084 notices and collected a total ₹1.52 lakh in fines for having conditions favourable for mosquito breeding.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC health department, said, “The PMC has conducted a city-wide survey regarding how to prevent the spread of mosquitoes. Notwithstanding, over 90% of the times, mosquito breeding spots are found inside homes namely, plates under pots, abandoned tyres and open tanks. As the monsoon progresses, climatic conditions favour the breeding of mosquitoes and so, the number of mosquito-borne infections rises in September.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-records-80-chikungunya-192-dengue-cases-in-september-101633287906718.html

The housing units in the project were supposed to be delivered in December 2018.Panchsheel Hynish is the second project in Greater Noida that has got the funding under the central scheme. In November 2020, Capital Athena -- another project in Greater Noida West -- had got ₹165 crore under the scheme to deliver 900 units by 2022.“We are trying that eligible developers get the last mile funding so that they can deliver the housing units at the earliest. Around 2,200 homebuyers will benefit from the scheme,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.Out of ₹249 crore, the authority will get ₹37 crore against the group housing land that was allotted to the Hynish project and the remaining fund will be spent on construction and delivery of the projects, the officials said.“Three new housing projects will soon get the last mile funding under this scheme. We will try for other projects too,” said Bhooshan.Officials of Panchsheel Group said that they will be able to deliver the 1,300 units by the end of next year.“We have got the fund and already started the work at the ground so that we can deliver the project by 2022-end,” said an official of Panchsheel Group, seeking anonymity.In December 2019, several developers from Greater Noida had applied for last mile funding under the central scheme announced by the ministry of finance in that year.According to the ministry of finance, the stress fund is to be given to stuck housing projects, which fulfil certain conditions such as a project should be registered with RERA, affordable or middle income category project, project has to be financially viable, project in final phase of completion, housing unit’s carpet area should not be more than 200 square metres, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/housing-project-in-greater-noida-west-gets-249-crore-fund-under-central-scheme-101633287905281.html

Police said they have registered an FIR against two employees of the company under Section 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code. Officials of the company said that the issue came to the fore after an audit was conducted from September 6 to 12. “The audit report was received on September 28. We are also conducting an internal inquiry into the incident. It seems to be an internal issue and not the case that some outside persons gave way to a theft incident. We questioned two of our employees, but they could not provide us with satisfactory answer,” said Ashok Verma, company’s senior manager who is complainant in the case. “Of the 14,000 number plates, about 9,500 are the front plates of two wheelers and they have not gone missing in a pair. So, there are very less chances if these plates can be misused,” Verma said. The FIR was registered at Madhuban Bapudham police station on Saturday evening. “We have started investigation in the case, and it will be taken on priority considering that the issue is related to HSRPs. We will also communicate the issue to the other agencies so that any chances of getting these plates misused are minimised,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1). The HSRPs are tamper proof as compared to the conventional number plates. In Uttar Pradesh, the transport department had set the September 30 deadline for installation of HSRPs on vehicles. However, about 600,000 vehicles in the Ghaziabad transport region are yet to install HSRPs, according to official estimates. The Ghaziabad transport region consists of four districts of Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Hapur and Bulandshahr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/14000-high-security-number-plates-missing-from-ghaziabad-warehouse-101633287548088.html

According to the district health office, Pune saw its largest vaccination drive in September, fuelled by the steady supply of vaccine and support from public companies in the district.Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer, Ayush Prasad, said that the massive supply of vaccines from private companies has resulted in a shortage of syringes as most of these companies are only giving vaccines and not syringes. “However, this is a temporary shortage and the state government has permitted the purchase of syringes by the local administration to continue the drive.”Of the total 10.53 million vaccines administered in Pune district since the beginning of January this year, 4.55 million vaccines were administered by PMC; 1.96 million by PCMC; and 4.02 million by Pune rural. While Pune district has seen a massive vaccination drive which is likely to grow further in October, as of now, 85% have received the first dose while 47% have been fully vaccinated.

04-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi to get ₹18 crore as funds under central clean air strategy||New Delhi: The national capital will get over ₹18 crore from the Centre under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) this year to cater to critical gaps in air pollution management, officials aware of the development said.This is the first time Delhi that will get funds under NCAP, a national strategy for a 20% to 30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024, with 2017 as the base year for comparison.“Delhi will get ₹18.74 crore under NCAP. This is the first time it will be receiving funds under the programme since it started in 2019,” news agency PTI quoted an official as saying. NCAP covers 132 non-attainment cities, which do not meet the prescribed national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). These cities have been identified based on the ambient air quality data obtained during the 2011-2015 period under the National Air Monitoring Programme.According to the national ambient air quality standards, the acceptable annual standard for PM10 and PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre and 40 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. In 2017, Delhi’s annual PM10 average stood at 240 micrograms per cubic metre. The targeted PM10 concentration by 2024 is 168 micrograms per cubic metre.“The national capital did not get any funds under NCAP for two years because it had other resources available -- a green cess levied on diesel vehicles above 2,000 cc -- which is deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and a pollution tax on commercial vehicles entering Delhi,” an official in the Union environment ministry said.This time, fund availability under NCAP has improved. “Fifty cities are already getting a good amount ( ₹4,400 crore aggregate in 2020-21 and ₹2,217 crore in 2021-22) for pollution management from the Finance Commission. Therefore, the availability of funds for the remaining 82 cities under NCAP has improved. So, we decided to give some funds to Delhi, too,” the official said.A total of ₹290 crore is available for these 82 cities this year.The NCAP fund will be utilised to cater to critical gaps -- wherever there is any inadequacy of funds available from other resources. The rest of the funding is to be mobilised through convergence of schemes, the official explained.Funds for bigger projects such as management of construction and demolition waste are allocated under the Swachh Bharat Urban programme and other schemes of the central government.The Delhi government has prepared a “Winter Action Plan” to tackle air pollution in the capital. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Saturday and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to announce the plan on Monday.The plan focuses on 10 key issues, including stubble burning, pollution hotspots, working of smog tower and vehicular and dust pollution.The city government has already imposed a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers till January 1, 2022, and has issued detailed guidelines to control dust pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-18-crore-as-funds-under-central-clean-air-strategy-101633287300662.html

04-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Security scaled up at UP Gate site after violence breaks out in Lakhimpur Kheri||Senior police and administrative officials rushed to the farmers’ protest site at UP Gate on Sunday evening after at least eight people, including four farmers, died in violence that broke out in Lakhimpur Kheri--over 400km from UP Gate -- following an agitation that was launched to block Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit to Banbirpur village, said a senior police officer from the police headquarters in Lucknow. The UP Gate protest site is crucial for farmers protesting against the three farm laws. Many of the farmers protesting here are from Kheri and adjoining districts in UP and Uttarakhand. Hundreds of farmers from UP and Uttarakhand have stayed in camps at the UP Gate protest site since November last year to press their demand for a new law on the minimum support price and a rollback of the three new farm laws. According to farmers protesting at the UP Gate, many farmers were standing with black flags in Lakhimpur Kheri when Maurya came to visit Banbirpur village. Soon, violence broke out with protestors at the UP Gate alleging that the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri were attacked when they were returning home after protesting against the deputy CM. Following the incident, several farmers’ leaders, including national spokesperson for Bharatiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait, rushed to Kheri as the Ghaziabad police deployed more police personnel at UP Gate to ensure the situation is under control here. “People were attacked using vehicles, and firing was also done... As per the latest reports that we have, several people have died in the incident,” said Tikait in a video recorded message. Many other leaders also condemned the incident and rushed to Kheri to throw weight behind the farmers. “Such incidents cannot be tolerated and the future course of action will be decided by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, likely on Monday. We are rushing to Kheri to stand with people who have suffered during the incident. We will urge them to observe utmost restraint and carry on their fight in accordance with the law.

Schools reopen for Class 8 to Class 12 from Monday.Speaking about various challenges school bus owners face, Kiran Desai, secretary of Pune bus owners’ association, said, “Many students from Class 8 to Class 12 commute on their own, via cycles and private vehicles instead of buses. Students who need school buses are those from Class 1 to Class 7. Moreover, it is financially not viable for bus owners to start buses for a few students,” said Desai.He added that with higher diesel prices, school-bus fees will also increase.“Since the state government announced that schools will reopen from October 4, no parent or school has approached us to start the bus service. ThepPast 18 months have been very challenging for us as there has been no income for many drivers,” said Desai.Sachin Panchmukh, vice-president of the School Bus Association, said that there is no respite for drivers, caretakers and owners of school buses.“The government has constantly neglected us. All businesses are functional, as hotels, vacation spots are open. Only schools were shut. And we are suffering the most because of the pandemic. Our buses have not been running for more than 18 months now. Each bus alone needs maintenance, insurance and other important repairs and owners don’t have the money for that. In such a scenario, how can we start bus service for students?” said Panchmukh.95 per cent of schools ready to reopenSpeaking about the reopening of schools from October 4, Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association said that around 95 per cent of schools are expected to start from Monday.“Schools are all geared up with sanitisation and are following Covid protocols to ensure safety of the students. We are hoping to see a good turn out on Monday. School buses are also instructed to be sanitised twice a day, with only one child occupying one seat. Schools will have to keep a check on sanitisation of buses and relevant instructions will be passed by them to the drivers and caretakers,” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/class-8-to-class-12-reopens-but-school-buses-absent-in-pune-101633287180632.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Just 1.2kg wheat in SDMC dry ration kit for civic body schools||Several councillors of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) have flagged drawbacks in the distribution of dry ration kits in lieu of cooked mid-day meals in schools, pointing out that the 1.2kg of unprocessed wheat provided as part of the monthly kit is too little for families to take to the flour mill.The chairman of the standing committee confirmed the problem and said they will “find a practical solution” soon.As the municipal primary schools are still closed for physical operations due to the ongoing Covid pandemic, the students are provided ‘dry ration kits’ --consisting 1.13 kg rice, 1.2 kg pulses and 1.2 kg wheat each month in place of the mid-day meals. South corporation runs 521 municipal primary schools where around 2.5 lakh kids are currently enrolled.“The meagre quantity of wheat being provided in these kits has made it laughable... We understand rice and pulses can be used directly for cooking but what will parents do with 1.2kg of wheat? Should they take it to flour mill? Isn’t it a cruel joke?” said Suresh Kumar, the representative from Khanpur ward and a member of standing committee.Kumar, a councillor from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said he flagged the issue during one of the standing committee meeting deliberations of the municipal corporation.“They can’t use this wheat; a four mill operator will not even take it. We should provide at least five kilos of wheat flour,” said Kumar.Representatives from teachers’ association said that the problem did not arise earlier as ration was delayed for months and it was distributed in bulk after 5-6 months.Vibha Singh, the vice president of Nagar Nigam Shikshak Sangh, a municipal teachers association, admitted that 1.2 kg of wheat is impractical. “The cost of grinding a kilo of wheat is at least ₹10. We should try to provide ration for several months in one instalment,” she opined.Kuldeep Khatri, who heads the Nagar Nigam Shikshak Nyay Manch, another teachers’ body, said that instead of providing such small amounts of rations, the administration should think about implementing direct cash subsidy transfer.A senior official from the SDMC education department said that ration is being distributed as per the guidelines and that a solution will be worked out before the next committee meeting.Col (retd) BK Oberoi, the standing committee chairman of the south corporation, said that this is a genuine problem “We will take up the matter with the education department to find a solution. We agree that flour should be provided and if it is necessary, we will get the wheat processed on our end. We are trying to find a practical solution to this problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/just-1-2kg-wheat-in-sdmc-dry-ration-kit-for-civic-body-schools-101633287003084.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest four who wanted to kill gangster Tillu||Delhi Police’s special cell has arrested four members of three separate gangs who, the police claimed, were planning to kill gangster Tillu Tajpuriya, officials aware of the matter said on Sunday. The arrests came a week after gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi was killed in a shootout inside a courtroom at Rohini courts complex on September 24. Police suspect Tajpuriya to be the main conspirator in the case. Officials said the arrested persons are members of Gogi, Lawerence Bishnoi and Ashok Pradhan gangs, and carried an aggregate reward of ₹4 lakh on their arrest. Police said they were involved in almost 15 cases of murder and over 30 cases of attempt to murder, robbery, carjacking, extortion, etc. in Delhi/NCR, Haryana, Punjab and UP.Special cell officers said after Gogi’s death, gangs active in Delhi-NCR are forming alliances around Gogi and Tajpuriya’s gangs. While Gogi’s gang has formed an alliance with Kala Jathedi, Lawrence Bishnoi, Sampat Nehra, Ashok Pradhan, Hashim Baba gangs, Tajpuriya’s gang is being supported by groups of Neeraj Bawana, Sunil Rathee, Naveen Bali and Nasir.Police identified the four arrested suspects as Anuj, Harsh, Sagar Rana and Sumit. They said they had come to Delhi to kill Tajpuriya to seek revenge for Gogi’s murder. “They were also told to target members of Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali gang,” deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said.DCP Yadav said with the recent turn of events, a dedicated team of special cell was looking at movement gangsters. Based on surveillance of some gangsters, the police got to know that members of Gogi, Bishnoi and Pradhan gangs will come to Prahladpur or Khera village on Friday. “The police team intercepted a car carrying the four gangsters, when it was going from Prahladpur to Khera village. The criminals opened fire at the police team,but were later caught,” said DCP Yadav.A case under section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 307 (punishment for attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and sections of the Arms Act was registered by the Special Cell.DCP Yadav said that the accused people are being interrogated for their involvements in other cases and efforts are being made to arrest their associates. “The accused persons were produced before the concerned court and have been remanded to ten days police custody. Concerned police stations have been informed regarding their arrests and further investigation is in progress,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/week-after-gogi-shooting-delhi-police-arrest-four-who-wanted-to-kill-gangster-tillu-101633286880581.html
04-10-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Residents protest dumping of solid waste at Galand||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) is facing opposition from residents of Hapur’s Galand and nearby areas against dumping of solid waste at a site in the village. The villagers said that they will not allow solid waste dumping at the site proposed for construction of waste-to-energy plant for safe and scientific disposal of solid waste in Ghaziabad.The villagers on Saturday stopped GMC vehicles which arrived with truckloads of solid waste, and drove those away. According to GMC officials, the 45-acre site comes under the jurisdiction of the corporation, but “physical possession” of the site is still with the farmers.In 2019, the Uttar Pradesh government had given the project of developing a waste-to-energy plant at Galand to a Netherlands company, but the project is yet to take off.“People from Galand and nearby villages of Masuri, Nahal, Piplehda, and Dabarsi will continue the protest, if the solid waste is dumped at the site. If the corporation wishes to develop anything else, we will not protest. The site is close to our Abadi land and also nearby schools,” said Sanjay Khori, village head, Galand.“We want a peaceful solution to this problem, and we will not hesitate to take legal recourse if our voices are not heard,” Khori added.The GMC moved to the site at Galand after it faced opposition to dumping activities at a site in Raj Nagar Extension (RNE), where the residents have been protesting the move for almost two years.“Solid waste is being dumped at several places in Raj Nagar Extension. The activities have led to unhygienic conditions in the area, and the RNE residents will continue to oppose this... We have also moved a petition with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last week, and it got registered. After it is admitted, we will continue our legal battle against the activities of the corporation,” said Vikrant Sharma, a lawyer and resident of RNE.In September this year, the GMC decided to move the dumping of solid waste from RNE to Galand. The officials said that the daily solid waste -- about 200 metric tonnes -- from Kavi Nagar and Vijay Nagar zones was taken to RNE, but the residents objected to the activity.“Now, the Galand residents are also opposing this activity. The 45-acre land belongs to the corporation, but at present the site has no boundary wall. The farmers, who have not given physical possession of the land yet, still use it for agricultural purposes... One of our garbage processing factories at Ret Mandi in Nandgram will be operational in October this year. Arrangements will be made to take solid waste to the site for processing... We will seek help from the administration in getting the issue resolved at the earliest,” said Mithilesh Kumar, city health officer of GMC.GMC commissioner MS Tanwar could not be reached for comments on Sunday.The city generates nearly 1,200 metric tonnes of solid waste daily.In January 2019, the NGT-appointed UP solid waste monitoring committee had banned dumping of solid waste at the city’s only major landfill site at Pratap VIhar. According to the officials, the Pratap Vihar landfill site consists of nearly 4.5 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste, and further dumping is banned. They estimated that the ongoing bio-remediation activity at the Pratap Vihar site is likely to be completed by March 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-residents-protest-dumping-of-solid-waste-at-galand-101633286763054.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC to consider Covid as grounds to refund community hall fees||Many people, who pre-booked community halls run by the municipal corporations for dates that coincided with the lockdown that lasted from April to June this year for different purposes, have been facing problems in getting the refund of their booking amount. According to the existing policy, the booking amount can only be refunded in case of a death or due to announcement of elections. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to amend the refund policy and will now consider pandemic as a factor for returning the booking amount. The municipal commissioner will be authorized to take such decisions in future so that the same bureaucratic hurdles, in terms of amendment of entire policy, are not required. The standing committee of the SDMC has also decided to refund the current outstanding amount of ₹11.95 lakh taken for the 71 bookings that were made between May 9 and June 26 this year. Chairman of the standing committee Col (retd) BK Yadav said a proposal recommending 100% refund was cleared by the committee as the Delhi Disaster Management Authority imposed a lockdown and banned all types of gathering. “We have also amended the refund policy. The municipal commissioner will be able to refund the booking amount in future, if any such conditions arise due to the ongoing pandemic,” said Yadav. The SDMC operates 94 community halls spread over four administrative zones.A senior municipal official explained that according to the existing policy of the corporation, 100% refund of booking charges can be made only when there is a death in the family which has made the booking or when the bookings are cancelled due to elections. “The law department was consulted on the issue as the parties which made the bookings are asking for a refund as they did not use the community halls on account of the lockdown. The law department stated that a fresh policy was required to be filed by the corporation,” said the official requesting anonymity. According to the data furnished by the civic body’s community services department, 29 bookings of community halls were made in the central zone during the lockdown, 12 in the south zone, 16 in the Najafgarh zone and 14 bookings were made in the west zone. The DDMA put restrictions on gatherings via on order dated May 9 which said, “There will be complete prohibition on organizing any marriage ceremony at public places, marriage halls, banquet halls and similar places. The event may be organized in court or at home where not more than 20 people will be allowed to participate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sdmc-to-consider-covid-as-grounds-to-refund-community-hall-fees-101633286700649.html
04-10-2021||Pune||Battle for Taljai hill: Do not hold development to ransom when “destroying” an ecological sanctum||Hills in and around Pune are a matter of pride and love for Punekars. These hills, covered with greenery and rich biodiversity, and work as lungs for the city. They absorb pollution and help make the city a pleasant place to live in. Over the years, we have seen frequently that the hills are being targeted under the schemes of “development”. Taljai hill is no exception. The recent proposal of “development” of over a hundred acres of Taljai hill has met with fierce opposition from local citizens of the Sahakarnagar-Taljai area and the environmentally-conscious citizens across the city. Tight from the onset I would like to emphasise that we are NOT against development. But, we do question the intentions of the government and the policymakers. I grew up in Sahakarnagar, and over the years I have seen the degradation of the Taljai hill. Wide concrete roads were built, food stalls were installed, buildings were constructed. Unfortunately, despite the opposition by the locals and the concerns raised by the environmentalists back then, these projects were pushed through by the decision-makers, without wider public consultations and participation. The recent proposal is outrageous for many reasons. The first and foremost concern is that the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of this proposal has NOT been made public yet. The proposal is already on the Standing Committee’s agenda, and still, the public at large is kept in the dark about the plan. This looks extremely suspicious. Hence, the issue is not only about the environment, but also about the governance, lack of transparency, and lack of public participation. Now let’s see what exactly is proposed in this new plan for Taljai. Construction of a food plaza, parking areas, a sports complex, another sports complex for women, schools, and an adventure park are the projects which will directly result in the concretisation of a large area. Different kinds of gardens are also a part of this proposal. The whole project will first destroy the existing natural ecology and biodiversity on the hillslopes and then the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will spend a lot of money on tree plantations, landscaping and maintaining the gardens. This is exactly like cutting down trees and then installing wooden artificial nests for birds! Now let’s address the question of “development”. Here, I would like to reiterate that the citizens are NOT opposing sports complexes and schools, but they are opposing these projects on Taljai hill. The location is the problem, not the proposed infrastructure. For public utilities like schools, gardens and grounds, the city Development Plan has reserved land called amenity spaces. There are about 270 spaces in the city which are still unused. The total area of these unused spaces is around 123 acres. Imagine converting even 2/3rd of this area into urban forests and gardens. The city will have an additional green area without touching the already existing ecology and biodiversity. Instead of spending Rs120 crore on the proposed Taljai project, the PMC needs to focus on using that money to develop those amenity spaces for schools, gardens, playgrounds, urban forests. Most of the amenity spaces do not have a rich biodiversity like the one on Taljai. So converting those into urban forests is a far better idea than destroying an already existing ecology. To summarise, we demand transparency in the processes of such projects, wider public consultations and participation, deeper analysis of the environmental impact and alternatives, and making these findings public. The real battle is not between the environment and development; but it is between transparent, inclusive governance and sustainable development on one side, and arbitrary ideas of governance on the other. We must save Pune’s hills to save Pune. This is a long and complex battle and I’m sure that the citizens shall endure it. The writer is a resident of Sahakarnagar.- As told to Prachi Bari||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/battle-for-taljai-hill-do-not-hold-development-to-ransom-when-destroying-an-ecological-sanctum-101633286649502.html
04-10-2021||Chandigarh||Public Action Committee demands scrapping of proposed industrial park in Mattewara forest||Members of the Public Action Committee (PAC) for Sutlej and Mattewara forest organised a discussion on Sunday on the development model for Punjab in the context of the modern industrial Park proposed by the previous Amarinder Singh government on the flood plains of Sutlej river near Mattewara forest. Colonel CM Lakhanpal of Sangharsh Committee, said, “Developing factories that destroy natural resources and poison rivers in Punjab are seriously impacting the health of people and calling it development is grossly misleading. Environmental destruction has been packaged and sold as development in a clever manner to fool people, so that even those drinking polluted water from Sutlej, which is already toxic due to Buddha Nullah, do not oppose the industrial park.”Gangvir Rathaur of Aalmi Punjabi Sangat said, “The Bhakra dam is almost 70 years old and will soon need to be repaired to ensure safety. Keeping floodplains free from encroachments and construction will be even more important then, as the dam will not be able to regulate water flow completely during the maintenance period.”Kashmir Singh, a resident of Sekhowal village, is along with other villagers not only protesting against the industrial park and state government for taking away their land, but also fighting a legal battle in court. He said, “In the name of development, an attempt has been made to grab 416 acres of arable land of Sekhowal village during the tenure of Amarinder Singh government, which if successful will force the farmers of the village to become daily wagers.”Barjinder Singh of Naroa Punjab said, “Water resources of Punjab are being polluted and destroyed and to stop this mindless destruction, people of Punjab have to stand up against such misuse of state power by powerful but corrupt and selfish politicians and bureaucrats.”Dr Amandeep Bains of RBS Roots, said, “The key players in this industrial park scheme drawn up by the Amarinder government have been ousted from power. The Channi government should immediately reject this anti-people and anti-environmental plan. Political parties should give prominent place to environmental issues in their manifestos and help shift Punjab towards sustainable and pollution free development. “Kapil Arora, an environmental law expert and president of the Council of Engineers, appealed to all MLAs and MPs from Punjab to raise their voice for the scrapping of this scheme, which is detrimental to the environment of Punjab, Mattewara forest, Sutlej and the health of Punjabis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/public-action-committee-demands-scrapping-of-proposed-industrial-park-in-mattewara-forest-101633286524452.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Metro, traffic to run on same flyover on Pink Line link||A three-lane flyover and Metro viaduct will run parallel on a common structure that is being constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) along with Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) at Soorghat in north Delhi.The integrated elevated structure will be constructed parallel to an existing single-lane flyover on the Outer Ring Road. An underpass will be constructed under the integrated structure for vehicular traffic going towards Signature Bridge, said DMRC officials.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “In this first-of-its-kind engineering marvel, integrated portals (structure) will be erected on which a flyover as well as a Metro viaduct will be placed. On these portals, the road flyover and the Metro viaduct will rest and run parallel to each other for a length of (approx.) 450 metres.”The integrated structure is part of DMRC’s 12km-long under-construction Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor, which is being constructed under Phase-4 expansion plan. The corridor is part of the Pink line (Majlis park-Shiv Vihar corridor).According to the plan, a total of 21 portals (each portal will have two piers) with average width of 26m and a height of 10 metres will be constructed. The Metro viaduct and three-lane flyover will be 10.5m and 10m wide respectively. The flyover will run adjacent to the existing single flyover between Wazirabad to ISBT Kashmere Gate near Soorghat.“Delhi Metro will construct the portals and the Metro viaduct over it and PWD will erect the superstructure for flyover on the already constructed portals in future,” said Dayal.A senior PWD official said, “We have tied-up with DMRC for the project. We have sent the project proposal for financial approval.”In a bid to provide smooth passage to vehicular traffic coming from north Delhi towards Signature bridge, DMRC has decided to construct an underpass. The underpass will merge with the road on the other side of Najafgarh drain on the Outer Ring Road.The Delhi PWD has been planning to construct another single-lane flyover near the existing one to ease congestion on Outer Ring Road. The DMRC and Delhi PWD decided to integrate the project to expedite the construction work and also address construction related issues, said a DMRC official.This is not the first time that PWD and DMRC have collaborated on engineering projects. As part of Phase-4, DMRC is already constructing two integrated double decker flyover-cum-Metro viaduct projects. In these two projects, the Metro viaduct and flyover will be constructed on single piers at two different levels. A 2.4km long flyover-cum-viaduct will be constructed on Mehrauli Badarpur road as part of the Aerocity -Tughlaqabad corridor.But at Soorghat, the two modes of transport will run parallel to each other. DMRC officials said that they plan to complete the project by December 2023.Once the 12km-long Majlis Park – Maujpur corridor is completed, the Pink Line will be the first ever ‘ring corridor’ in India with a length of about 70km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metro-traffic-to-run-on-same-flyover-on-pink-line-link-101633286521935.html
04-10-2021||Pune||Battle for Taljai: One hill, two separate areas – do not confuse Taljai project with Pachgaon Parvati||It is unfortunate that opposition to the proposed Taljai development project by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not been completely informed, and I, as the project architect of this planned project, am saddened. Environmentalists should get proper information about this project, after which their doubts will be resolved. This is because the objections raised by environmentalists in the Sahakarnagar area are not applicable to the Taljai development project, but to the adjoining Pachgaon mountainous area.Pachgaon Parvati is a separate part, with a forest area of about ,600 acres, with 107 acres coming under the jurisdiction of the PMC, where the PMC is proposing to set up the Taljai development project. The Sadu Shinde Cricket Stadium has already been set up on five acres owned by the PMC, where completely natural soil has been used.The proposed 107-acre project currently has nominal large trees, which will also be maintained in the planned project. Apart from this, cement concrete will not be used and only soil will be used to preserve the nature. Also, the proposed 107-acre project will plant more than 10,000 native trees, so it is certain that a large number of birds, butterflies, will find their home here.Opponents of the Taljai development project should note that JCBs are working in the area and many of the trees that are being cut down do not fall under the Taljai development project. Environmentalists must consider that the 107-acre development project on the Taljai hill of the PMC has not yet been approved by the Standing Committee and the General Body.The Pachgaon hill area of the state government is nearby, where deforestation has nothing to do with the Taljai development project and the PMC has nothing to do with it. Some environmentalists have warned that the use of JCBs and deforestation will destroy the habitat of peacocks. If peacocks are disappearing, it is definitely a matter of concern. However, peacocks are in the 600 acres under the forest department of the state government, and not in the Taljai development project area.Some vested interests are claiming that the Taljai Development Project and the PMC’s 107 acres, and the state government’s Pachgaon Parvati, about 600 acres of forest land, are one and the same. The proposed Taljai development project will be fully committed to nature and will be in line with the socio-environmental role of citizens.I would like to clarify here that those who oppose the proposed Taljai development project should study the Micro Development Plan (DPR) submitted by the PMC to the Standing Committee. They will notice the difference between the two areas. In this regard, the opinion of other experts should be known and they are aware that the Taljai development project and the Pachgaon hill area are different.Everyone is expected to support this eco-friendly project to enhance the natural beauty of the area. In this context, Taljai development project should be understood and its area should be understood. As the project architect, I will take the initiative and request the corporation administration to hold a meeting with the administration of the PMC. I am appealing to those who are currently opposing the project to also participate in this meeting. I am also confident that the constructive suggestions of citizens regarding this proposed project will be welcomed.The project, which is a landmark in the area, is being discredited for no reason, and I fear that the vested interests of a handful of stakeholders will be served. The proposal currently before the Standing Committee will come up for discussion after a period of scrutiny. Even then, these environmentalists should participate in it.I request the citizens not to link the Taljai development project with the forest lands of the state government and the ongoing activities there. This project will be the pride of Pune and it will be 100 per cent environmentally friendly. There is no concrete construction or use of cement concrete.- Uplekar is project architect, Taljai development project - As told to Prachi Bari||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/battle-for-taljai-one-hill-two-separate-areas-do-not-confuse-taljai-project-with-pachgaon-parvati-101633286340682.html

But the issue of who will prepare the layouts has been hanging in the balance for over a decade.The decision to extend the deadline was taken in a meeting chaired by state industries minister Satyender Jain, where representatives of the 24 industrial clusters and officials of the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) were also in attendance. “After hearing the grievances of members of associations and details submitted by secretary (industries), the minister (Jain) has directed to extend the time limit up to 30.06.2022 since major changes are being done on the issues discussed in the meeting of the proposed MPD-2041,” said a government official.A senior DSIIDC official said, “The associations of industrial clusters are supposed to prepare the layouts. Due to the pandemic last year, the deadline was extended till December 2021. But as the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is going to notify the new master plan of Delhi (MPD-2041) and also because of the pandemic, it was decided to extend the deadline by another six months.”The 24 industrial clusters, which have been notified in batches since 2005, operate in areas that are part of rural villages (non-conforming areas) such as Khayala, Peeragarhi, Mundka, Hastsal, Anand Parbat etc. These clusters have been notified for redevelopment by the Delhi government as there was 70% or more industries operating in these areas.While the industrial area associations have welcomed the decision to extend the deadline, they want the government to fix responsibility for preparing the redevelopment plan of their clusters. “After hearing the grievances of members of associations and details submitted by Secretary(Industries), the minister (Jain) has directed to extend the time limit up to June 30 , 2022, since major changes are being done on the issues discussed in the meeting on the proposed MPD-2041,” said a government official.According to norms for redevelopment of clusters of industrial concentration in non-conforming areas notified in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 in 2012, “The redevelopment scheme will have to be prepared by the concerned local body/land owning agency in consultation with the Society (to be formed by the land owners).” Vijay Virmani, president of the Delhi Manufactures’ Federation (an association of non-conforming industrial clusters), said, “The rules clearly say that it has to be done by the local bodies. We have been trying to convince the government to ask civic agencies to prepare the layout. But no decision has been taken so far.”As per the MPD-2021 provisions, clusters should have a direct approach road of at least 18m right of way; 10% area is to be reserved for surface parking, loading and unloading; 10% area reserved for infrastructure requirements such as police post, fire station, pump house etc; 8% areas reserved for parks among other facilities. Federation members said that it is not possible to convince people to give up their land for redevelopment according to the clauses mentioned in MPD 2021. Joginder Talwar, general secretary of Delhi Manufactures’ Federation, said, “The onus to prepare the layouts for redevelopment has been put on us. But the fact is that we don’t have the power to do so. We can’t force any industry owner to give up his/her land for civic infrastructure such as road widening, fire station, etc.”When contacted, a senior DSIIDC official aware of the development said, “We just want that these industrial clusters to redevelop and have essential facilities. The associations can get the layout plan prepared by civic agencies if they want. As they are the land owners, they will have to get the plan prepared.”With no firm decision on the matter yet, industry owners said they are unable to freely carry out their work as their work is dependent on extension of the deadline. Ashwani Sehgal, general secretary of Peeragarhi industrial area, said, “Our licences for factory and other permission will be renewed if the deadline for submission of layouts is extended. We want a permanent solution to the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-extends-deadline-for-fixing-plans-for-24-industrial-clusters-101633285500596.html

The information was stated in a release issued by BJP’s central office on Sunday. Sabne will officially join the party on Monday.The Election Commission of India (ECI) has declared the bypoll on the seat on October 30 as it got vacant following sitting Congress legislator Raosaheb Antapurkar’s death in April. He was undergoing treatment for post Covid complications in a city hospital.“I am joining BJP tomorrow in a public event. I am not annoyed with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray but am against the monopoly of PWD (public works department) minister Ashok Chavan in Nanded district. Chavan is trying to eliminate the Sena in Nanded,” Sabne told reporters on Sunday.He, however, admitted that his demand for party’s candidature from Deglur Assembly seat was not accepted by the Sena leadership. “I requested the party leadership to give [me] the candidature for the bypoll but he [Thackeray] wants to run the state. It is the party’s decision whether to give the candidature or not,” he said in response to a question.Sabne had lost the 2019 Deglur Assembly polls to Antapurkar by a margin of 22,433 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-declares-former-shiv-sena-mla-as-its-candidate-for-assembly-bypoll-in-nanded-district-101633285143021.html
04-10-2021||Delhi||Mohammadpur village in Delhi debates its name and past||These days the chaupal in south Delhi’s Mohammadpur village is a place of heated discussion about the origin of the village -- and how it got its name. The debate was triggered after Bhagat Singh Tokas , the local councillor, submitted in July a proposal to rename the urban village in a zonal committee meeting of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). “During the Mughal era, names of all villages were forcibly changed. The villagers’ demand to change the name of Mohammadpur has been pending for a long time. In view of people’s demand and sentiments, I propose to change the name of the village from Mohammadpur to Madhavpuram,” the proposal by Tokas said. The proposal, which came months before the civic body polls, where BJP faces a 15-year anti-incumbency, has since got anticipatory approval from SDMC Mayor Mukesh Suryan. “This a valid demand. The proposal has been passed by the corporation’s naming committee and will soon go to the house. By the end of this month, we will send it to the state government for necessary changes in the revenue records,” said Suryan. For the uninitiated, Mohammadpur is a Jat-dominated village near Bhikaji Cama Place, home to about 7,000 people. The village boasts a Teen Burj ,a domed Lodhi era- monument, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). In the 1960s and 70s, the land of the village was acquired to develop RK Puram, Sarojini Nagar and parts of Safdarjung Enclave. Today, a rental economy flourishes in the village, which is a maze of narrow lanes with multi-storey buildings housing tenants—many of them government servants, including CRPF, ITBP and CRPF personnel. The village is also home to many people working in AIIMS, Bhikaji Cama Place and hotels such as Hyatt. The village also has several leather shops. “Our elders believe that the name of the village was changed during the Mughal period, and the current name only symbolises our subjugation by foreign invaders,” says Bhagat Singh Tokas, the local councillor, who lives in the village. According to Census 2011, of the 600,000 cities, towns, and villages in the country, 704 carry the name of the first six Mughal emperors, viz., Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shahjahan and Aurangzeb, but there is no historical evidence that the name of Mohammadpur was changed during the Mughal period. “This is historically a Jat village and no Muslim has ever owned land in our village. So, we assume that either the Mughals rulers gave us this name or changed the original name” says Rajesh Tomar , a villager who works as a swimming coach. In fact, unlike many Delhi villages where wrestling, kabaddi and Kho-Kho are popular, Mohammadpur and nearby Munirka is home to many swimming champions who played at national level, including Arjuna Award winner Khajan Singh Tokas. Talking about the origin of their village, some old-timers say that Jat farmers in the nearby Munirka village came to live near their farmland around the Teen Burji monument around 250 years back. “That is how this village came into being. But these Jat farmers who settled here centuries back had no reason to name it Mohammadpur,” says Kulvir Singh , a village resident, sitting at the chapual, which is the hub of community activities. Some villagers claim that the demand for the name change was first raised in the 1960s when they had approached then Chief Commissioner, Bhagwan Sahay. Till 1966, Delhi was governed by a chief commissioner. In 1966, a Metropolitan Council was set up with the lieutenant governor as its head. “We proposed to him that our village can be named after him as Bhagwan Nagar, but the demand was not accepted,” says Sukhbir Singh a villager. “The problem is whenever we go outside Delhi and tell people that we are from Mohammadpur, they ask us if that is the Muslim-majority village . We have nothing against any religion or community, it is just that the current name of the village goes against our identity and history,” adds Singh. But there are those who are opposed to the idea of the name change. Jasbir Singh, 71, calls it a futile attempt to reject history. “ What are we going to get out of this name change. This is nothing but politics,” he says. Interestingly, elaborating on the history of the village, he says that Tula Ram was the first farmer to come from the nearby Munirka village and settled in Mohammadpur in 1765. “I am his descendant. But the village is named after Mohammad Khan, a local landlord during the Lodi period. The Mughals have nothing to do with its name,” he says. Singh’s account was supported by Rana Safvi, city chronicler and the author of The Forgotten Cities of Delhi, who mentions Teen Burji and Mohhamadpur in her book. “ The Mughals did not change names of cities, towns or villages. They built new cities and gave them new names,” says Safvi. “In the past, most villages were named after local landlords or nobles. Mohammad Khan, I believe was a noble during the Lodi period,” says Safvi, citing the examples of Munirka, and Wazirpur that were named after Lodi-era nobles Munir Khan and Wazir Khan, respectively. Curiously, while councillor Tokas and Mayor Suryan will have one believe that the name of the village was Madhavpuram before it was changed by the Mughals to Mohammadpur, Brahm Prakash, president of the local residents welfare association, has a different take. “I think Mohammdpur was a name given to us by the Muslim rulers. Locals here came up with an alternative name, Madhavpuram after much discussion. Madhav is the name of Lord Krishna. I hope we get the new name soon”. Mohammadpur may or may not become Madhavpuram, but BJP councillor from Safdarjung Enclave Radhika Abrol has moved a proposal to rename Humayunpur village to Hanumanpur. “We are also receiving similar a proposal from a few other villages including Saidulajab. We are favourably inclined to all these demands and proposals,” said Suryan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mohammadpur-village-in-delhi-debates-its-name-and-past-101633281239438.html
