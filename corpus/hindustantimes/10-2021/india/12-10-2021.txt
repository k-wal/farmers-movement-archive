12-10-2021||India||Affiliation of 100 schools with Sainik School Society approved||The Union Cabinet on Tuesday cleared the proposal of affiliation of 100 schools, including both private and public, with the Sainik School Society, an autonomous organisation under the ministry of defence. The decision was taken during the Union cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday. “In a paradigm shift to the existing pattern of Sainik Schools, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its meeting held today has approved the proposal for the launching of affiliated Sainik Schools under Sainik Schools Society, Ministry of Defence (MoD). These Schools function as an exclusive vertical which will be distinct and different from existing Sainik Schools of MoD. In the first phase, 100 affiliate partners are proposed to be drawn from States/NGOs/Private partners,” the government said in a statement. According to the government, the decision has been taken in line with the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 that advocates “value-based education, enabling children to develop pride in the rich culture and heritage of this nation, effective leadership with character, discipline, sense of national duty and patriotism.” Currently, there are 33 Sainik Schools in the country that account for a large number of candidates who join the armed forces. Until now, Sainik Schools were set up after receiving requests from state governments/union territories who have to provide infrastructures such as land and educational/ residential buildings. In March this year, the government informed the Parliament that it was working on a new scheme to set up more Sainik Schools in the country in partnership with non-governmental organisations, private schools and state governments. Before that, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in this year’s budget speech announced that India will set up 100 new Sainik schools in partnership with NGOs, private schools, and states. In its statement on Tuesday, the government said that around 5000 students will be enrolled in class 6th in these 100 schools from the next academic session i.e 2022-23.The government has invited proposals from government or private schools or NGOs to apply for affiliation. “The scheme will leverage Public/private partnership in the education sector, help tap into existing infrastructure available with reputed private and government Schools and open up new capacities to meet the growing aspirations of children desirous of receiving education in a Sainik School environment,” the statement added.Figures testify the role of Sainik Schools as feeder institutions for the armed forces. In 2018, the National Defence Academy, known as the cradle of military leadership inducted a total of 662 cadets of whom 147 (22.2%) were from Sainik Schools. The preceding year the number was even higher. In 2017, of the 644 cadets who joined NDA, 179 (27.8%) were from Sainik Schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/affiliation-of-100-schools-with-sainik-school-society-approved-101634063179799.html

It will be allowed to lapse because the government felt it needed a wider consultation which we will do in the next assembly session of the new assembly. We will have a new bill if required,” Goa’s legislative affairs minister Mauvin Godinho said on Tuesday.The Bhumiputra Bill proposed to consider anyone who has lived in Goa for at least 30 years as a bhumiputra (son of the soil) and allowed them to seek ownership rights to the small housing units in which they live. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who fiercely defended the legislation on and off social media, had insisted that the legislation was aimed at helping people who live in houses smaller than 250sq metres built on government or community land.The legislation exposed Sawant to sharp criticism that accused the government of encouraging people who encroached public and community land.The legislation was sharply criticised by the opposition and activists, prompting the Pramod Sawant government to put it on hold and not send it to the governor for Raj Bhavan’s assent. Sawant announced in early August that the government will bring an amended version of the controversial law that will incorporate suggestions received from the public.The Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, was tabled and hurriedly passed barely hours after it was introduced in the state assembly on Friday (July 29). According to the proposed law, any person who is a resident of Goa for more than 30 years qualifies as a ‘bhumiputra’ (son of the soil) and can apply for ownership of the house (up to a plinth area of 250 square metres) they have been living in even if the land on which it stands is owned by the government, a private person or commonly owned. Any structure built before April 1, 2019 qualified for ownership under this law. Sawant said applicants would have to produce water and electricity bills in their name as proof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-to-let-controversial-bhumiputra-bill-to-lapse-says-minister-101634061919094.html

Your untiring efforts have ushered in a new era of peace, and law and order in Jammu and Kashmir, and the northeast," justice (retd) Mishra said.Also read | At NHRC event, PM Modi warns against ‘selective interpretation’ of human rightsOn August 5, 2019, Shah had declared in Parliament the abrogation of articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution that gave Jammu & Kashmir a special status, and divided the state into two UTs -- J&K and Ladakh.When the Rajya Sabha had approved a resolution on abrogating Article 370 amid loud protests from some of the Opposition parties, Shah had said, "Article 370 is the biggest hurdle to normalcy in the state".Allaying the Opposition’s fears of a deteriorating law and order over the move, Shah had then said, “nothing will happen” and the region would not be allowed to turn into another battle-torn Kosovo.Also read | Terrorists gun down three civilians in separate attacks in SrinagarFollowing his announcement, curfew was imposed and internet services remained suspended for a long time, amid protests from several quarters, with a few human rights groups expressing apprehensions over the issue. A large number of mainstream politicians, including former chief minister Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, were detained and kept under hose arrest for months.The former apex court judge, who had taken charge as the new chairperson of the NHRC on June 2 this year, had earlier raised a controversy while praising the PM during his tenure as a judge of the Supreme Court. Speaking at the International Judicial Conference 2020, he had termed Modi as an "internationally acclaimed visionary" and a "versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally".Meanwhile, Shah, in his address, said the central government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had been relentlessly working for the welfare of poor, backwards and deprived sections of society, thus protecting their human rights.Modi, who was the chief guest on the occasion, warned against engaging in "selective interpretation" of human rights with an eye on political gains and loss, saying such conduct harms human rights as well as democracy.During the address, the NHRC chief also said India had emerged as a powerful entity on a global level, and it had earned recognition as a new power, and the credit went to "people of India, the country's constitutional system and the leadership".Later, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh alleged that the democratic space in India continued to "shrink"."The PM & HM have made a mockery of human rights since their Gujarat days. Now they are joined in the jugalbandi by Chairman of NHRC no less, a judge who sat in judgment on his own earlier order and claimed no conflict of interest. The democratic space in India continues to shrink," he wrote in a tweet.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-chief-says-new-era-of-peace-ushered-in-j-k-ne-thanks-to-amit-shah-101634059568289.html
12-10-2021||India||HT This Day: October 13, 1999 — Sharif overthrown in military coup||Islamabad/Washington- Pakistan, A country that has been ruled by unelected governments for 25 of its 52-year history, today opened another chapter of military rule. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was dismissed this evening by the man he had sacked earlier in the day: Army chief General Pervaiz Musharraf.Shortly after Gen Musharraf’s dismissal was announced by the government this morning, troops took positions around Mr Sharif’s residence, the state-run Pakistan TV building, the main airports and all major government buildings.PTV recommenced its telecasts later in the evening to announce that the Pakistan Muslim League Government of Mr Sharif had been dismissed and Gen Musharraf would be addressing the nation “shortly”.The PTV announcement about the dismissal of the Sharif Government did not specify who had ordered his dismissal.Mr. Sharif and the man he chose to replace Gen Musharraf, Gen Ziauddin was house. Policemen guarding his official residence were disarmed and the PM was asked not to leave the building.In Washington, US government spokesman James Rubin said the Clinton Administration “naturally hoped” that the Constitution of Pakistan would be adhered to “in letter and spirit”.CNN’s Islamabad correspondent Imtiaz Gul reported that there were “spontaneous” show of public support shortly after it was clear that a coup had been staged and the democratically elected government had been unseated.Gen Musharraf, who returned from Colombo this afternoon, was reportedly given a ceremonial welcome by the Army at Karachi airport.An AP report said he was met at the airport by a large contingent of soldiers. He was seen leaving the airport accompanied by several jeeps filled with soldiers. He did not talk to reporters.Soldiers also have taken over the homes of several Sharif ministers, including information minister Mushaid Hussain, foreign minister Sartaj Aziz and accountability chief Saif-ur Rehman. In New Delhi, officials said troop along the border with Pakistan were on “full alert”. In Washington, senior Clinton Administration officials said messages had been sent to the Pakistan Army through diplomatic channels that the US does not support any military takeover anywhere, that the Constitution has to be respected and it would be not right to presume it would be business as usual after a democratically elected government is overthrown. Earlier in the day, the official APP news agency said Mr Sharif had “retired” Gen Musharraf “with immediate effect” and that Lt Gen Ziauddin, chief of the Inter Services Intelligence, had been promoted to full General and made the new Chief of the Army Staff. The sacking of the Army chief comes barely a fortnight after Mr Sharif publicly gave him a vote of confidence. The announcement on state television gave no reason for Gen Musharraf being “relieved” of his job, but the General has been at the centre of a political storm since late May when tension with India over Kashmir flared up. When asked what was going on at the PTV headquarters in downtown Islamabad, one of the Army officers surrounding the building told Reuters: “You will find out in a short while.” In 1998, Gen Musharraf’s predecessor Gen Jehangir Karamat was forced to resign after suggesting setting up of a national security council that would give the Army greater say in the running of the administration. Gen Musharraf’s removal by the PML government earlier in the day came in the wake of reports of growing differences between him and Mr Sharif and fears of another Army coup in Pakistan. This had even prompted the United States to issue a statement late last month that it would strongly oppose any extra-constitutional change in Islamabad. In an apparent conciliatory move towards the powerful Army, Mr Sharif, on September 29 had extended by one-and-a-half years till October 6 next year the additional charge of Gen Musharraf as JCSC. He was appointed as Army chief for three years last October after his predecessor, Gen Karamat resigned following differences with Mr Sharif. Pakistan’s Naval chief, Admiral Fasih Bukhari resigned on October 2, apparently for not being considered for the crucial JCSC’s post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-october-13-1999-sharif-overthrown-in-military-coup-101634058019008.html
12-10-2021||India||India cites rising terrorism in Africa, Afghan regime at UN debate on peacebuilding||India on Tuesday raised its concerns over the rising threat of terrorism in Africa, while also noting that nations that witnessing conflicts or emerging from them were facing multiple challenges in their path towards sustaining peace.Addressing the UN Security Council High Level Open Debate on ‘Peacebuilding and sustaining peace: Diversity, state building and the search for peace’, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan also spoke about the change in leadership in Afghanistan that he said happened neither through negotiations nor was it inclusive, while calling for a broad-based and inclusive process that involved representation of all sections of its citizens.Muraleedharan said the expectations of the international community on the war-ravaged nation, including on combating terrorism, were set out clearly in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593, that was adopted under India’s Presidency of the 15-nation Council in August."It is important that commitments made in this regard are respected and adhered to,” he said.Also read | At G20 meet, PM Modi calls for unified response to deal with Afghanistan crisisThe UN Security Council resolution 2593 on Afghanistan mandated that Afghan territory be not used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist acts, and reiterated the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and noted the Taliban’s relevant commitments.Speaking about terrorism in Africa, the minister said extremist forces and groups were receiving encouragement from member-states which seek to divide communities by legitimising terrorist activities.“Terrorism is a clear manifestation of how forces inimical to unity and diversity can seek to destroy the social cohesion and democratic fabric of countries by, inter alia, fomenting disaffection, hatred and violence,” he said, adding that it the spread of terrorism in Africa was matter of serious concern.He said the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) had clearly reinforced yet again that terrorism cannot be justified under any ground and that no country should provide an excuse for such activities. “It is equally important that UN organisations take GCTS as a template and not give any encouragement or excuse, even indirectly, to efforts of member states to justify terrorism in any way.”Muraleedharan told the open debate that “when we deal with countries coming out of conflict and going into peace building, putting in place strong legal framework as well as building credible institutions based on solid principles is critical.“This will also ensure that diversity is protected, and inclusivity is fostered. We need to encourage donor countries which are contributing generously to peace building in Africa and other regions to ensure that those countries coming out of conflict are able to put in place an enduring framework that withstands the test of time,” he said.Noting that the challenge will always be to make tradeoffs between the immediate and long-term, Muraleedharan said that “we believe the UN system as a whole should work closely with member states and regional organisations in line with their national requirement and needs and not advocate imposition of ideas of solutions from outside.”He emphasised that it is now the time to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains we made over the years.He told the debate that India had always played a constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership with developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia and it continued to assist nations bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans.Muraleedharan further said there were several successful examples where countries had managed to overcome post-conflict challenges, including South Africa, the transition from apartheid to free and open society; Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and Burundi, each of which were examples of successful transition of post-conflict state building and South Sudan, where “we are witnessing the transition”."These societies are diverse and have managed to sustain peace through an inclusive approach, by setting examples for similar states to emulate. We also have several other examples, including in South Asia, where diversity has always been the hallmark of societies. The political leadership of respective countries respecting universal values of peace, truth and compassion have contributed immensely to state building," he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-cites-rising-terrorism-in-africa-afghan-regime-at-un-peacebuilding-debate-101634056724197.html

The decision comes amid the Covid-19 pandemic that brought the research work of PhD students to a standstill in the last one and a half years.“The UGC, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, has decided to extend the date of applicability of PhD as a mandatory qualification for direct recruitment of assistant professors in departments of universities from 01.07.2021 to 01.07.2023,” the commission said in a statement.In 2018, the UGC set the criteria for recruitments for entry-level posts at universities and colleges. It gave a three-year window to candidates to complete their PhDs and asked all universities and colleges to start applying the criteria for recruitment from the 2021-22 academic session.“The Commission made an amendment in the UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education), Regulation, 2018 regarding clause 3.10 that stipulates that the PhD degree shall be a mandatory qualification for direct recruitment to the post of assistant professor in department of the universities w.e.f. 01.07.2023,” the statement added.Due to the pandemic, many candidates could not complete their PhDs and were appealing to the government to relax the eligibility this year since universities have been shut and research activities suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phd-will-be-mandatory-for-assistant-professor-jobs-from-2023ugc-101634056641556.html
12-10-2021||India||Navratri fast: Fasting like a boss and losing weight too||Navratri is here, it’s the season of festivity, cheer and joy. The nine-day-long festival that accompanies a period of fasting incites happiness and rejoicing among everyone. This period of abstinence is aimed at renewing our spiritual energy. For many, Navratri fasting is the ideal way to detox. Observing a fast not onlyenhances the digestive capacity of one’s body but also ensures that the harmfultoxins are flushed. Although fasting can be a great way to shape up your body and lose some weight, if not properly executed, the gains made during such fasts can be lost within a very short period of time, much to our chagrin. “Instead of going into a calorie deficit for weight loss, some people increasetheir meal frequency in the name of fasting and they, in turn, increase theircalorie consumption,” says Dietitian Rajat Jain, Weight Loss Expert & Founder of Health Wealth Clinics Jaipur. Kuttu ki puri, singhade ka halwa, Sabudana Vada, sabudana khichdi are some of the favourite dishes loved in Navratri. And these fasting dishes are much more palatable and tempting and you might end up eating much more in your fasting days than you normally do.“The secret of losing weight is not changing the quantity but the quality of your intake. During Navratras when we aspire to come closer to the divine, the process becomes even simpler as we naturally are inclined to consume ‘Satvik’ food during these pious days. Sattvic diet has high fibre, low fat with a higher satiety factor,” says Aman Jaiswal, Chef Patron , La Marinate.Fresh fruits, fresh fruit juices, sprouts, nuts, taken during fasts provide high nutrition and also help to detoxify the system.“Stick with roti/ cheela made with flours that are ok to have during fasts like kuttu/ rajgira /singhara instead of deep fried dishes made from the same. Add roasted peanuts, curd and paneer to amp up your protein intake. Dry fruits are great way to spike up your energy levels with quick snacking. Makhanas, almonds, walnuts, raisins and pistachios should be your go to snack,” says Diksha Chhabra, Certified nutritionist and a fitness trainer.Nutritionist Harshita Dilawri, Know Your Nutrients suggests healthy recipes like potato with mint chutney, pumpkin halwa, potato lauki muthias (dumplings), carrot kheer, pineapple apple carrot smoothie, rajgira paneer paratha, green peas sundal (stir fried). “You can make your own healthy combos with the right combinations. Start your day with a cup of green tea and two dates. Opt for sabudana khichdi/ rajgira roti with lauki/ arbi sabzi and a glass of chach with rock salt. Another combination which works well is starting with vegetable soup, a bowl of salad with kuttu ka atta/rajgira roti and sabzi followed by low-fat lauki halwa or carrot halwa,” says Dilawri.For those fitness enthusiasts who have been relentlessly hitting the gym and feel the fast will be a spoiler for their customary fitness visits, Vikas Chawla, founder and director, Vedas Cure has a tip, “The pro tip is to stick on to the home-cooked meals and avoid packaged foods like salted chips, and keep the body moving as much as possible. Physical exercise and walking are not only energy boosters but help in burning the calories at a faster rate,” he says.Yash Vardhan Swami, health coach and fitness educator cautions all those fasting peeps, “Losing weight during Navratri fasting is actually possible. But remember, it’s just 9 days, so do not expect to lose a lot of kgs. All we need to do is to ensure that the Navratra food is not fried, we are moving enough and are having enough protein.”Happy Navratri, happy fasting!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navratri-fast-fasting-like-a-boss-and-losing-weight-too-101634055330841.html

He also called for an inclusive administration in Kabul to preserve the socio-economic gains of the past two decades.Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi hosted the special summit of the group of 20 major economies amid growing concerns about the excesses of the Taliban set up in Kabul and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, including shortages of food, medicines and other essential goods.Since the Taliban took over after the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, Afghanistan’s economy has virtually collapsed. A team led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been holding talks with US officials and European Union (EU) envoys in Qatar as part of the Taliban’s stepped up efforts to gain international recognition.Modi called on the international community to “forge a unified international response without which it would be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan’s situation”, the external affairs ministry said.He “underlined the need to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally”, and called on the world community to enhance the “joint fight against the nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and arms in the region”.Modi also called for an “inclusive administration in Afghanistan, which includes women and minorities”, to preserve the socio-economic gains of the past 20 years and to restrict the spread of radical ideology.The prime minister backed the UN’s important role in Afghanistan and sought renewed support from the G20 for UN Security Council resolution 2593.Resolution 2593, adopted when India held the rotating presidency of the Security Council in August, demands that Afghan soil should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists. It also calls for combating terror in Afghanistan, including UN-designated individuals and entities – a key demand of the Indian side, which has strong concerns about the presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) fighters on Afghan territory.The resolution also calls on all parties in Afghanistan to seek an inclusive and negotiated political settlement, with the full participation of women.The international community, Modi said, should ensure that Afghanistan has immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. Noting that the Afghan people have a “great feeling of friendship” for India, he said that “every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition”.Modi also referred to the centuries-old people-to-people ties between India and Afghanistan and said that over the past two decades, India has promoted socio-economic development and capacity-building for Afghan youth and women. He recalled that India had implemented more than 500 development projects in Afghanistan.The summit was convened by Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20. The meeting discussed a response to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan, security and the fight against terrorism, and mobility and human rights.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented an Afghan support package worth one billion euros during the summit to prevent what she described as “humanitarian and socio-economic collapse”. She said while the EU has been clear about the conditions for any engagement with the setup in Kabul, the Afghan people “should not pay the price of the Taliban’s actions”.Chinese President Xi Jinping did not join the G20 summit and it wasn’t clear if Russian President Vladimir Putin would participate, reflecting the differing approaches to the situation in Afghanistan. While Western countries want to demand accountability from the Taliban, China and Russia have adopted a position of non-interference. In recent weeks, India has cautioned the world community not to rush into recognising the Taliban setup, pointing out that the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-g20-special-summit-on-afghanistan-pm-modi-calls-for-inclusive-administration-in-kabul-101634054539898.html

12-10-2021||India||Modi to launch Gati Shakti master plan tomorrow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi on Wednesday.Infrastructure creation in India had suffered for decades from multiple issues. There was lack of coordination between different departments, for example, once a road was constructed, other agencies dug up the constructed road again for activities like laying of underground cables, gas pipelines etc. “This not only caused great inconvenience but was also a wasteful expenditure. To address this, efforts were put in place to increase coordination so that all cables, pipelines etc. could be laid simultaneously. Steps have also been taken to address other issues like time-taking approval process, multiplicity of regulatory clearances etc. In the last seven years, the government has ensured unprecedented focus on infrastructure through a holistic outlook,” the Press Information Bureau said in a statement on Tuesday.PM GatiShakti will address the past issues through institutionalising holistic planning for stakeholders for major infrastructure projects. Instead of planning and designing separately in silos, the projects will be designed and executed with a common vision. It will incorporate the infrastructure schemes of various ministries and the state governments like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, UDAN etc. Economic zones like textile clusters, pharmaceutical clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters, agri zones will be covered to improve connectivity and make Indian businesses more competitive. The Centre said it will also leverage technology extensively including spatial planning tools with ISRO imagery developed by BiSAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics).PM GatiShakti is based on six pillars:1. Comprehensiveness: It will include all the existing and planned initiatives of various ministries and departments with one centralised portal. Each and every department will now have visibility of each other’s activities providing critical data while planning and execution of projects in a comprehensive manner.2. Prioritisation: Through this, different Departments will be able to prioritize their projects through cross–sectoral interactions.3. Optimisation: The National Master Plan will assist different ministries in planning for projects after identification of critical gaps. For the transportation of the goods from one place to another, the plan will help in selecting the most optimum route in terms of time and cost.4. Synchronisation: Individual ministries and departments often work in silos. There is lack of coordination in planning and implementation of the project resulting in delays. PM GatiShakti will help in synchronising the activities of each department, as well as of different layers of governance, in a holistic manner by ensuring coordination of work between them.5. Analytical: The plan will provide the entire data at one place with GIS based spatial planning and analytical tools having 200+ layers, enabling better visibility to the executing agency.6. Dynamic: All ministries and departments will now be able to visualize, review and monitor the progress of cross-sectoral projects, through the GIS platform, as the satellite imagery will give on-ground progress periodically and progress of the projects will be updated on a regular basis on the portal. It will help in identifying the vital interventions for enhancing and updating the master plan.PM GatiShakti is the result of Prime Minister’s constant endeavour to build Next Generation Infrastructure which improves ‘Ease of Living’ as well as Ease of Doing Business. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for movement of people, goods and services from one mode of transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce travel time for people.PM GatiShakti will provide the public and business community information regarding the upcoming connectivity projects, other business hubs, industrial areas and surrounding environment. This will enable the investors to plan their businesses at suitable locations leading to enhanced synergies. It will create multiple employment opportunities and give a boost to the economy. It will improve the global competitiveness of local products by cutting down the logistics costs and improving the supply chains, and also ensure proper linkages for local industry and consumers.Prime Minister will also inaugurate the New Exhibition Complex (Exhibition Halls 2 to 5) at Pragati Maidan during the event. India Trade Promotion Organisation’s flagship event, India International Trade Fair (IITF) 2021 will also be held between November 14 and November 27, 2021, in these new exhibition halls.Union ministers for commerce, road transport and highways, railways, civil aviation, shipping, power, petroleum and natural gas will also be present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-launch-gati-shakti-master-plan-tomorrow-101634047819206.html

Yadav used the opportunity to attack the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, saying it has "crushed farmers", in an apparent reference to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were mowed down allegedly by Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra.The SP chief further remarked that if the BJP were to come back to power in Uttar Pradesh, it would "crush the Constitution" as well, reported news agency PTI. "Therefore, the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will go to people and throw the BJP out of power," the former CM said. "This rath will go on continuously for restoring the rights and honour of farmers," he added.Akhilesh launched the yatra after seeking the blessings of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday. He aims to cover all the 403 assembly segments in Uttar Pradesh for the state polls slated for 2022 in a Mercedes bus which has been transformed into the "rath”. The rath displays the photographs of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, Acharya Narendra Dev, Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan, former president APJ Abdul Kalam, party veteran Janeshwar Mishra and jailed MP Mohammad Azam Khan.In the first phase, the yatra will pass through Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat, Hamirpur and Jalaun. The purpose of the yatra is to make people aware of the "corrupt, autocratic and suppressive" policies of the BJP government and establish "real democracy", reported PTI.On the importance of Kanpur, Akhilesh said his party worked for its development. "It is a big and industrial city. Today, business establishments here have closed down. This city can not only give employment to the youth but can also improve the economy of the country and our party will work for it," he said.Akhilesh Yadav exuded confidence that the people of Uttar Pradesh will support the SP and the party will be able to form a government with a majority. "I am confident that people will give their support and the SP government will be formed with a majority," he said.In 1988, a rath yatra was taken out from Kanpur by SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav. In 2001 and 2011, it was undertaken by Akhilesh Yadav from Lucknow and now it was started from Kanpur ahead of the assembly polls scheduled to be held early next year. In the 2017 assembly polls, the BJP came back to power by winning 309 of the 403 seats. The Samajwadi Party could bag 49 seats while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-crushed-farmers-will-crush-constitution-too-akhilesh-yadav-101634039393851.html

Sarma first announced his plan to join the puja celebrations in the Bengali-dominated region of Assam in September, underlining that the trip was designed “to strengthen the togetherness between the two valleys of Assam”.The Barak Valley in south Assam, which comprises three districts, Hailakandi, Karimganj and Cachar, is predominantly home to Bengali-speaking people in contrast to Assam’s Brahmaputra valley, mostly inhabited by Assamese speaking people.Himanta Biswa Sarma started his visit by offering puja in the century-old Shaktipeeth Kachakanti Temple at Udharbond constituency in Cachar district in the morning. Accompanied by forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya and Silchar Lok Sabha member Rajdeep Roy, the chief minister later visited several temples and later, pandals. He also took part in an event organised in memory of a student of National Institute of Technology, Silchar campus who died recently.Sharma appealed to people to adhere to Covid-19 protocols and take adequate safety measures while celebrating.“After a hard fought battle with Covid-19 virus, we have finally come to a situation where puja can be celebrated. But the virus has not completely gone yet, we have to be careful and conscious, so that we do not lose control again. I appeal to all to maintain the covid protocol while celebrating the festival.”Himanta Biswa Sarma had last travelled to Barak valley for Durga Puja in 2019 when he was a minister in the Sarbananda Sonowal’s cabinet.Lawmaker Rajdeep Roy said Sarma’s visit was a “strong message”.“In 75 years of independence, no chief minister of Assam has ever spent Durga Puja in Barak Valley… People here are happy and they are very much excited the chief minister of state is celebrating Durga Puja with them,” he said, inviting the chief minister to visit the region for the puja with his family next time.Sarma’s focus on the Barak Valley is cited as a sharp contrast to the approach of the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government. In his 15 years as chief minister, BJP leaders said Gogoi’s visits to Barak Valley were far and few between.But when the BJP came in power in 2016, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal started talking about uniting the two valleys. His slogan “Barak-Bramhaputra Pahar-Bhoyam” (Barak Valley-Brahmaputra valley, Hills and Plains) remained part of almost every speech. Sarma steered clear of the slogan used by his predecessor but he has already made three visits to the Barak Valley.Himanta meets hundreds of people during his visit and analyses the issues where government intervention is required. There has always been allegations that Assam Government deprives Barak Valley when it comes to equal distribution, be it infrastructure development or providing government job. Himanta Biswa Sharma’s visit during Durga Puja will address many sections in Barak Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-reaches-out-to-barak-valley-visits-region-for-durga-puja-101634049918193.html

Speaking at the Group of 20 (G20) Extraordinary Summit on Afghanistan earlier in the day, he also called for urgent and unhindered humanitarian assistance to citizens of the war-ravaged nation and an inclusive administration that would include women and minority communities.In a press release, the government said Modi, who virtually participated in the meeting at the invitation of Italy, which currently holds the G20 presidency, called on the international community to forge a unified response on Afghanistan and a joint fight against the nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and drugs smuggling.The meeting on Tuesday was chaired by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to discuss issues related to the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in Afghanistan following its takeover by the Islamic militants in August this year as the West-backed government led by Ashraf Ghani collapsed.In his remarks, Modi welcomed the initiative of Italy in convening the meeting and spoke about the centuries-old people-to-people ties between India and Afghanistan. He said that over the last two decades, India had contributed immensely towards promotion of socio-economic development and capacity building of youth and women in Afghanistan, adding that over 500 development projects had been implemented by India in the neighbouring country.“The Prime Minister noted that the Afghan people have a great feeling of friendship for India. He conveyed that every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition. He emphasised the need for the international community to ensure that Afghanistan has immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance,” the press release read.He also underlined the need to ensure that Afghan territory did not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, either regionally or globally and that there was a need to enhance the joint fight against the nexus of these menace, including smuggling of drugs and arms in the region.“He conveyed support for the important role of the United Nations in Afghanistan and called for renewed support of the G20 for the message contained in UN Security Council Resolution 2593 on Afghanistan. The Prime Minister called on the international community to forge a unified international response without which it would be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan’s situation,” the release added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-g20-meet-pm-modi-calls-for-unified-response-to-deal-with-afghanistan-crisis-101634048719203.html

Hence, it wants to evaluate the safety of the single-dose vaccine, Corbevax, in vaccinated people.At present, the indigenously developed Corbevax, an RBD protein sub-unit vaccine, is undergoing its second and third-phase trials for being administered to adults between 18 and 80 years and the results are expected to be declared in a few days.Also read | Biological E’s Corbevax may be launched in October: Niti Aayog’s VK PaulIn September, the DCGI had also granted permission to Biological E to conduct phase 2/3 clinical trials of the vaccine in children aged between 5 and 18 years with certain conditions.A PTI report said the Hyderabad-based firm has, meanwhile, put in an application seeking the approval of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct the phase-three clinical study of Corbevax as a single booster dose in those fully inoculated with either Covishield or Covaxin."Currently there are several literatures indicating the decline in antibodies in the vaccinated individuals, and that several countries have begun or are in the process of administering booster dose to the people who have completed the primary vaccination," it said."In view of this, we are herewith submitting the application for grant of NOC to conduct a phase-3 clinical study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Corbevax when administered to COVID-19-negative adult volunteers primed with either Covishield or Covaxin," stated the application submitted to DGCI last week.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is likely to take up the matter in its next meeting.The government last week said the science relating to the use of booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines is still evolving and the developments are being closely watched.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul had said there are several studies that are looking into the subject of booster doses. "This is an evolving science and a paradigm of information...that data is still emerging. We are watching this science very very carefully through our NTAGI system."We know that Covaxin has done a study on booster doses and those results can be available anytime...We also know that WHO has not given a clear-cut recommendation on the matter...we are watching science as it emanates and in India also, there are studies which are looking at this aspect," he had said.Biological E will supply 30 crore doses of Corbevax to the central government by December, as announced by the Union Health Ministry in June. The Union Health Ministry finalised arrangements with Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer to reserve 30 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses, an official statement had said.The Biological-E's Covid-19 vaccine candidate has been developed with support from the Department of Biotechnology and its PSU Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) from the preclinical stage to phase-3 studies.The Department of Biotechnology has provided financial assistance to Biological-E in terms of grant-in-aid of over ₹100 crore and also partnered with it to conduct all animal challenge and assay studies through its Research Institute Translational Health Science Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, a health ministry statement earlier had stated.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biological-e-seeks-dgci-nod-for-phase-3-trial-of-corbevax-as-booster-dose-101634047292607.html

Raut asserted that despite a shortage of coal in the state, the Maharashtra government has made sure that the supply of electricity is not disrupted.“Despite the coal crisis, we have tried to supply electricity to our citizens. Even after the deficiency of coal in the state, only four out of 27 power generation units are currently shut,” news agency ANI quoted Nitin Raut as saying. “As a minister, I can guarantee that there will be no load shedding due to the coal crisis,” he added.Also read: As concerns rise over coal shortage, Centre reassures with ‘fact-check’The minister's assurance came even as power cut warnings poured in from other states across the country. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the power situation is "very critical" in the entire country. Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain alleged that the Centre has asked NTPC plants to run at 50-55 per cent capacity as their coal stocks were reduced to meet one-two days' need.Kerala electricity minister K Krishnankutty on Monday said the state government will announce a decision on imposing power cuts after October 19, adding that the state was facing a shortage of 100 MW of electricity. In neighbouring Karnataka, power cuts have already been announced in Bengaluru till October 14.Meanwhile, Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) government's coalition partner Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Tuesday alleged that the Modi government was responsible for the current shortage of coal in the country, PTI reported.During the tenure of the erstwhile UPA government, the then prime minister Manmohan Singh came up with a coal policy keeping in mind the electricity requirements of the country in the future, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said.But the BJP, then in the opposition, alleged a coal scam and the policy had to be rolled back, said Malik. Eventually, coal mines were given to some entities, but mining has not yet started there, he said, adding that despite the availability of coal, it is not being mined, the NCP leader said. "The Modi government is responsible for the shortage of coal," he further said.On Sunday, amid reports of coal shortage, the coal ministry assured that sufficient dry fuel is available in the country to meet the demand of electricity generating plants. The ministry also downplayed fear of disruption in the power supply, calling it “entirely misplaced”. On Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah convened a meeting with power minister RK Singh and coal minister Pralhad Joshi amid coal shortages in power plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-coal-crisis-maharashtra-minister-says-there-will-no-load-shedding-in-state-101634042172855.html

The court reserved its order for Monday and said it will announce the quantum of punishment that day.Ram Rahim appeared for the sentencing virtually from Sunaria jail in Rohtak where he is serving a 20-year prison term after being convicted in August 2017 of raping two women disciples of his sect. He has also been sentenced to life for the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati in 2002.Ranjit Singh, who was also a disciple, was murdered because Ram Rahim suspected him of leaking an anonymous letter detailing the sexual exploitation of women disciples in the dera. A month before he was shot dead in Khanpur Kolian village, Singh was summoned to the dera and threatened with lethal consequences but he did not budge and refused to seek a pardon.Also Read: Convicted of murder, dera chief’s sentencing deferred till October 18The letter, which was purportedly written by a sadhvi, alleged sexual exploitation of women followers in the dera. The matter was probed by the CBI. The investigative agency was also probing the murder of Singh and Chhatrapati whose vernacular production ‘Poora Sach’ was highly critical of the exploits of the dera.The special CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg also convicted Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh, Avtar Singh and Sabdil for the murder of Singh, who was shot dead by assailants at his native village in Kurukshetra district on July 10, 2002. One more accused in the murder case died in 2012.Ranjit Singh’s son Jagseer Singh asked for the case to be transferred to another court in neighbouring states after levelling allegations against a CBI lawyer, but the Punjab and Haryana high court dismissed his plea, stating that his allegations were based on surmises and conjectures.The self-styled-godman was born in a Jat Sikh family of Gurusar Modiya village in Sriganganagar district of Rajasthan in August 1967 and succeeded his predecessor Shah Satnam Singh Maharaj as the dera chief at the age of 23. He enjoyed bipartisan patronage from politicians who were known to seek his ‘blessings’ and was also provided with a Z+ security cover by the erstwhile Congress government.

Domestic airlines have been operating at 85% capacity since September 18 owing to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) measures.The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic had prompted the aviation ministry to limit the domestic flights to operate at 50% of their capacity between June 1 and July 5, which was relaxed to 65% up to August 12. The ministry further eased the limit to 72.5% between August 12 and September 18.In the latest order, the ministry stated that "it has been decided to restore the scheduled domestic air operation with effect from October 18, 2021, without any capacity restriction". The decision was taken after a “review of the current status of scheduled domestic operations viz-a-viz passenger demand for air travel", according to the order.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently highlighted in a report that India’s domestic traffic reversed the trend, “as demand fell 44.8% in August, improved from a 58.9% decline in July versus July 2019, owing to positive trends in new cases and vaccination.”A relatively lower number of daily new infections per capita has prompted the Central and state governments to ease restrictions in a bid to revive the economy. The massive nationwide vaccination drive has also helped to keep the fresh Covid-19 cases in check and let businesses reopen by following the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-allows-domestic-flights-to-operate-at-full-capacity-amid-demand-surge-101634038727674.html

In addition to this, the stock available with Coal India Limited (CIL) stands at more than 400 lakh tonnes. It is the CIL stock which is being supplied to power plants.Also Read | These states may soon face a 'blackout' as coal demands surge(2.) “Coal supply is irregular”: The stock available at power plants is boosted by supplies from coal companies on a daily basis. (3.) “No supply of coal by CIL to power sector”: In what is the highest-ever “H-1” supply from CIL to the power sector, more than 225 metric tonnes (MT) of coal were provided to the power sector this year.

This is a historical fact. Despite knowing that China has intruded in our territory, the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) gave them a clean chit globally. Obviously, their confidence will increase. They will think that they can get away with intruding... This is the reason why China feels emboldened today,” said Congress spokesman Pawan Khera.

"No political leader will be allowed to share the stage where only Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders will be present,” BKU-Tikait district vice-president Balkar Singh was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

12-10-2021||India||‘It returns to haunt’: Jaishankar’s veiled message to Pakistan||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday launched a thinly veiled attack on Pakistan’s support for cross-border terrorism, saying forces such as extremism, radicalisation, and violence “come back to haunt those who nurture them”.Jaishankar used his speech at the meeting of foreign ministers of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Kazakhstan to target China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and said respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations must be at the heart of all connectivity projects.The remarks came against the backdrop of mounting concerns in New Delhi over Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15. India has also opposed initiatives under BRI such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) because a key stretch passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Jaishankar described terrorism as the “biggest enemy” of the common goal of peace and development for members of CICA, a multinational forum for cooperation to promote security and stability in Asia that was established under Kazakhstan’s leadership in 1999.“In this day and age, we cannot countenance its [terrorism’s] use by one state against another. Cross-border terrorism is not statecraft; it is simply another form of terrorism,” Jaishankar said in an apparent reference to Pakistan.“The international community must unite against this menace, as seriously as it does on issues like climate change and pandemics. Any calculation that extremism, radicalisation, violence, and bigotry can be used to advance interests is a very short-sighted one. Such forces will come back to haunt those who nurture them,” he said.Any lack of stability in the region will undermine collective efforts to bring Covid-19 under control, and the “situation in Afghanistan is, therefore, of grave concern”, he added.Also Watch: Jaishankar tears into Pak for cross-border terror at CICA meet; takes a dig at China's BRI betJaishankar also raised the situation in Afghanistan when the foreign ministers of CICA states collectively called on Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He said on Twitter that he had underlined CICA’s relevance in addressing challenges such as terrorism, pandemics and protection of global commons, and highlighted that “Afghanistan developments have generated understandable concern”. CICA can be a positive factor in shaping a global response, he added.During his speech at the CICA foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar also said Asia suffers from a “deficit of connectivity”, which is needed to promote economic and social activity.“As we build these modern arteries of commerce, it is absolutely essential that the most basic principles of international relations are observed. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations rank foremost among them,” he said.“It is also important that connectivity building is a participative and consensual exercise, based on financial viability and local ownership. They must not serve other agendas,” he said, without naming China.India is among the countries that didn’t sign on for BRI, with Indian leaders saying the Chinese initiative doesn’t provide a level playing field and often leads to a “debt trap” for developing countries.Also Read: Suspected terrorist held in Delhi, AK-47 rifle seizedJaishankar said CICA could make a notable contribution to developing resilient and reliable supply chains and additional engines of economic growth in a post-pandemic world. Such efforts put a “premium on greater trust and transparency” in order to boost security and sustainable development in Asia, he said.India will continue to work with other countries to meet challenges and find solutions, as reflected by its decision to provide vaccines, medicines and medical supplies to more than 150 nations during the pandemic, he said. He highlighted the limitations of the multilateral response to Covid-19, saying the need for reformed multilateralism was becoming more urgent.Jaishankar also met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the margins of the CICA meeting in Nur-Sultan and reviewed progress in bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-returns-to-haunt-jaishankar-s-veiled-message-to-pakistan-101634031314586.html
12-10-2021||India||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin gets emergency approval for kids aged 2-18 years||The national drugs regulator’s subject expert committee approved the use of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin’s in children between 2 and 18 years of age as a layer of protection against coronavirus or Covid-19 disease, people familiar with the matter said. An official claimed that Covaxin’s efficacy among children was found to be similar to that in adults but a decision on its inclusion in the national vaccination programme was yet to be taken. Covaxin is the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for emergency use among children in India after Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D, meant for children above 12 years of age.“As per the data that the company submitted, the vaccine has been found to be safe and efficacious in children. The experts were of the opinion that it should be allowed for use in children,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.In May this year, drugs controller general of India Dr VG Somani permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct phase 3 clinical trials of its Covid vaccine on 525 child volunteers. After it ended in September, the trial data was submitted to the drugs regulator in the first week of October.“However, whether it will be introduced in the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, and if yes, then how soon, will be for the expert panel on immunisation to decide,” added the official.If introduced, the vaccination is likely to happen through pre-filled syringes for better dose accuracy, he added.According to the experts involved in the clinical trials, the safety and efficacy of Covaxin in the paediatric age group has been found to be almost similar to that in adults, which was 77.8%, as per the phase 3 clinical trials data on adults. “COVAXIN Clinical trials data of 2-18 years age group has been submitted to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). COVAXIN is the first Covid-19 vaccine to be tested in the 2-6 years age group. This was feasible due to the safety of the manufacturing platform and empirical evidence from phase I, II, III clinical trials in adults,” said India’s vaccine major in a statement.Also Read: Will the festive season trigger the third wave?Meanwhile, WHO (World Health Organisation) experts will meet this week to take the final decision on whether to grant emergency use listing to Covaxin-- an inactivated whole virion vaccine. The approval could greatly influence how other countries treat people vaccinated with Covaxin. Experts from WHO, and a group of independent experts, are going through the data, and are expected to carry out the risk-benefit assessment before arriving at a conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-approved-for-emergency-use-in-children-101634029754231.html

The Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) will give the final approval for the use of Covaxin on children and when that comes through it will become the second vaccine, after Zydus Cadila's DNA-based vaccine ZyCoV-D, to be approved for inoculating kids in the country.Bharat Biotech, the Hyderabad based biotechnology company, submitted data from its Covid-19 vaccine trial in children aged 2 to 18 years to the DCGI on October 6, after being granted approval for conducting trials in children back in May.Sanjay K Rai, a professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and the principal investigator of Covaxin’s trial on children told news agency ANI that the trial was carried out in three age groups. "Covaxin's trial was done on three age groups. The first group examined was between 12 -18 years, the second group was between 6- 12 years and the third age group was between 2-6 years," he said, claiming that the trial found safety and immunogenicity levels were the same in children as it was in adults.Besides Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D, Serum Institute of India (SII) has also been given permission to conduct phase II and III clinical trials of Novavax in children between 7 and 11 years of age.India is gearing up to vaccinate children as schools and educational institutions start reopening up across the country and experts continue to caution against a potential third wave being deadly for children. Many states have also ramped up paediatric facilities to help combat any rise in Covid-19 infection in children. The Union government has, however, repeatedly insisted that there is no need to panic about successive waves infecting children.m||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-gets-sec-emergency-use-nod-for-children-between-2-18-years-of-age-101634027070575.html

One of the main reasons is that stubble burning has started in neighbouring states where governments have failed in helping farmers in this regard. We can get a clear picture of that through NASA images… Last week, we presented a 10-point action plan. Today, I seek your help in reducing air pollution in personal capacity,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing on Tuesday.He further said that switching off vehicle engines while waiting at traffic signals should become a habit. “Even though we will launch a formal campaign this year again from October 18, I request you to start it in personal capacity from today. Studies have shown that by doing this we can collectively save around ₹250 crore a year and reduce pollution by up to 15%.”“Secondly, I request you to use public transport or carpool at least once a week, instead of using a personal vehicle. Doing it more than once a week would be even better. Third, I request you to download the Green Delhi app... for actively registering complaints regarding air pollution.... We have resolved more than 23,000 complaints received through the app so far,” said Kejriwal.Also Read: Impact of stubble fires in Delhi’s air to stay negligible this weekOn October 4, Kejriwal released a 10-point winter action plan for the national capital to combat air pollution during the winter season, which is caused by a number of factors, including stubble burning by farmers in nearby states. The action plan includes free distribution of a bio-decomposer to stop stubble burning in Delhi, anti-dust campaign, no burning of garbage, installation of smog towers, ban on firecrackers, round-the-clock monitoring of pollution hotspots, setting up green war rooms, creating an eco-waste park, launching the Green Delhi app and investing on efforts to reduce vehicular pollution in the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwals-3-point-formula-for-residents-to-help-curb-delhi-pollution-101634023753345.html

Also roughly 12% students including 12% boys and 13% girls use smokeless tobacco,” the GYTS-4 report said. The report also said that within the smokers’ group, home was the most preferred place to smoke for 37.4% students, followed by a friend’s house for 19.8% respondents who accepted they smoked. “13.5% of the respondents said they smoke at school, 10.8% at public places and 8.9% at social events while 9.7% students smoke at other random places,” said the factsheet from the report. GYTS-4 was conducted in 2019 and 3,501 students from 37 different schools, including 12 public and 25 private, participated in the survey. GYTS is a cross-sectional nationally representative, school-based survey of students in grades associated with ages 13 to 15 years, said Satish Tripathi of the State Tobacco Control Cell. It uses global standardised methodology with a probability proportional to enrolment size. The classes within the selected school are selected randomly. The survey questionnaire includes tobacco use, cessation, second-hand smoke and other aspects of tobacco usage.

In later stages of life, these students become bold enough to smoke in front of others, hence, this habit has to be curbed even before the start,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general, Association of International Doctors. GYTS assists countries in fulfilling their obligations under the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to generate comparable data within and across countries. GYTS-4 was conducted in 2019 as part of the national survey by the International Institute for Population Sciences, said Tripathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-youth-tobacco-survey-4-finds-home-perfect-hideout-for-up-students-to-smoke-101634021353017.html

Addressing the ceremony virtually, he said that though “some people” see human rights violation in a particular incident, they ignore violation of such rights in other, similar cases.Also Read | PM Modi to address 28th NHRC foundation day programme today“There is an aspect of human rights that I want to discuss today. These days, we see that people have started interpreting human rights in a way that benefits them. However, these rights are grossly violated when these are looked at from a political lens. This selective behaviour is harmful for our democracy,” PM Modi warned.Such a mentality harms the very concept of human rights as well, he further said.Prime Minister Modi also drew an analogy between human rights and India's independence movement, saying that the respect for human rights in the country is largely due to the long freedom struggle that the nation went through. “We fought for our rights across centuries and, as a country and society, always protested against injustice and tyranny,” PM Modi remarked.India, he said, has always been “committed and sensitive” towards issues concerning human rights. About NHRCThe National Human Rights Commission was established on October 12, 1993, for the promotion and protection of human rights. The body, which is currently headed by retired judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Arun Mishra, takes cognisnance of any form of human rights violation, conducts enquiries and, if the violation is established, recommends various remedial and legal measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-nhrc-foundation-day-event-pm-modi-slams-selective-interpretation-of-human-rights-101634014143750.html

The drug haul, worth ₹21,000 crore as estimated by agencies, was the largest ever seizure by Indian agencies. A narco-terror link is being probed in the delivery as it was sent to India from Kandahar after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan.The consignment was intercepted by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) on September 14 and 15 on the basis of specific intelligence that high-quality heroin was being smuggled in two containers from Afghanistan to Gujarat’s Mundra port via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port. The two containers had 1,999.58 kg and 988.64 kg heroin packed, layered between the talc to avoid detection by security and customs officials. HT exclusively reported the seizure on September 20.At least eight people, including Chennai couple Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and Machavaram Sudhakar, who allegedly imported the heroin concealed in the semi-processed talc stones through their Vijaywada registered firm (Aashi Trading Company) from a Kandahar based company, four Afghan nationals, an Uzbek woman have been arrested by the DRI so far.The ministry of home affairs transferred the case to NIA last week to probe the Taliban-Pakistan angle.Officials cited above said among those being raided on Tuesday are some individuals having Afghan links.Vaishali and Sudhakar are said to be small players as they got only ₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh commission for allegedly allowing to use their talc stones containers for smuggling heroin. A larger network of Afghan nationals is suspected to be behind the consignment, said an officer.Investigators have so far found that Vaishali and Sudhakar were taking instructions from some persons based in Afghanistan and Iran. “Their role in smuggling drugs previously in the garb of imports is being investigated,” said a second officer.Also Read: NIA raids on TRF in Jammu and Kashmir amid spate of civilian killingsAccording to a UN estimate, there are 800 to 900 mid and high-level drugs traffickers/syndicates in Afghanistan.

12-10-2021||India||Will Quad stand-up to dragon breathing fire from Indo-Pacific to Ladakh?||The condescending statement issued by PLA's Western Theatre Command spokesperson after the unproductive 13th round of senior military commanders meeting on Sunday to de-escalate situation in East Ladakh is reflective of the overall Chinese belligerence towards its perceived adversaries with dragon breathing fire from Indo-Pacific to Ladakh.The PLA statement called Indian proposals for de-escalation as “unreasonable and unrealistic” and preached to Indian Army that they should be satisfied with what has been achieved till now without getting more militarily ambitious. Essentially, it means that the PLA is in no mood to normalise the situation along the 1597-km Ladakh LAC as it asks the Indian Army to honour the same bilateral border agreements that the Chinese army itself forgot by unilaterally executing the May 2020 transgressions in Galwan, Pangong Tso, Gogra and Hot Springs.The PLA statement is in line with its Central Military Commission Chairman Xi Jinping’s aggressive statements to take over democratic Taiwan in the name of reunification. From Chinese national day on October 1 to Taiwan national day on October 10, the PLA air force tested Taipei’s beleaguered defence by flying more than 56 fighters and nuclear capable bombers on a single day to brow-beat the democratic tiny Island nation.Although Chinese belligerence is often a combined function of its domestic and international situation, the unusual aggression from Beijing comes after AUKUS pact on September 15 which allows Australia to get nuclear submarines from US and UK, the Quad summit on September 24 and the high intensity naval exercises between Quad partners and between US-UK navies in the Indo-Pacific. Add to this the failing Chinese real estate giant and energy crisis, we get a very potent mixture. The PLA aggression on Ladakh in May 2020 also came after Beijing was hit globally for keeping the deadly coronavirus, which has origins in Wuhan, under wraps in cahoots with the WHO leadership. Two years after the pandemic broke in Wuhan, nearly five million have died and the world has lost trillions of dollars in economic disruption. This is without even counting the societal impact and mental trauma the world had to go through and is still going through without any accountability from China. Any country who so much as raises the accountability issue faces retaliation from Beijing.With US military power coming under question after Pakistani ISI backed Sunni terrorist force, the Taliban, militarily seized Kabul on August 15, the Chinese aggression now matches of an unbridled superpower who is not willing to yield an inch that it perceives its own. Beijing’s information warfare also matches its self-declared superpower status with political fires being lit in backyard of democracies opposing Chinese Communist Party’s belligerence through media and news aggregators. Combine this with the military psy-ops belted out routinely by Chinese propaganda media, the global perception of Beijing is several notches above than its actual capabilities.Given that the Chinese cyber and automatic intelligence capabilities, even by recent admission of ex-Pentagon’s software specialist, exceed the US abilities, India must be prepared for more belligerence from Beijing as the latter will not let up in pressure. It is time that the Indian armed forces understood that the future wars will be won in cyberspace accompanied with stand-off weapons rather than intricate land maneuvers by tanks or infantry. The air wars will be fought with swam drones and armed unmanned platforms, which the PLA has in large numbers, rather than manned fighters which will be chased by Chinese acquired S-400 fired surface to air missiles. The sea will be ruled by nuclear submarines and unmanned sea drones mapping the oceans rather than goliath aircraft carriers which can be targeted by Chinese ballistic ship killer missiles. With US leading the way, India needs to garner its massive software talent to build up offensive and defensive cyber defence capabilities or the battle will be over even before it starts.In fact, the Indian geographical situation is such that no country can avoid its relevance and salience when it comes to China or to Af-Pak terrorism. While it has deep strategic ties with US, India also has a very close relationship with Russia and France. It is a voice of credibility in Saudi Arabia and UAE, two of its closest allies in Middle East. It is India that can bridge the current gap between France and US over Australia preferring American nuclear submarines by cancelling the order of French built diesel attack platforms and cement over the division within democracies.While Beijing prescribes an independent foreign policy (read anti-US) for India, it is the PLA which is pushing India towards a corner by its aggression and military infrastructure development along the 3488 km LAC. Even the so-called strategists talk about India staying away from US as the right path to pacify China.

The booking started from Monday, reported Dinamalar and other local publications.The pilgrimage season of Mandala-Makaravilakku begins from November 16 and only 25,000 devotees will be permitted entry daily during the initial days.The booking can be made on Sabarimala's official website by uploading relevant details and photographs of the devotees, local media reported.The decision about entry of devotees during the pilgrimage season was taken by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after a meeting held earlier this month to review the Covid-19 situation in the state. It was attended by the state ministers of Devasom, transport, forest, health and water resources as well as the state police chief.The other guidelines for regulating the rush of pilgrims at Sabarimala, which were formulated in the meeting were that the virtual queue system would continue and only those who have taken two vaccine doses or have a negative RT-PCR report would be permitted to enter the shrine.In the meeting, it was also decided that the Devaswom Board should make arrangements to give 'Neyyabhishekam' (the anointed ghee) to all and devotees would not be allowed to stay at the Sannidhanam after the darshan.Besides these restrictions, vehicles would only be allowed upto Nilackal and from there KSRTC buses should be used to reach Pampa river where permission for bathing has been granted, the release said.The chief minister also suggested that devotees who are not Covid-19 positive, but suffer from comorbidities should come for the pilgrimage only after a health check-up.Kerala recorded 6,996 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, according to state governemnt's health bulletin on Monday.The state also recorded 84 Covid-related deaths and 16,576 people recovered from the infection in the last 24 hours.

12-10-2021||India||HC nixes Goa’s bid to introduce reservations in PG medical courses||The Bombay high court at Goa has struck down a notification issued by the Goa government which mandated a cumulative 41% reservations for the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Castes (OBC) in the state quota of post graduate seats in the Goa Medical and Goa Dental Colleges from the academic year 2021-2022 onwards. The government’s decision, the high court said, was contrary to principles laid down by previous Supreme Court judgements, taken in haste without application of mind and violative of the government’s own rules for admission to post graduate courses which specifically mention that admission to post graduate courses was to be strictly on merit except for a relaxation in marks afforded to those belonging to disadvantaged backgrounds. Disposing a petition filed by a group of more than 100 doctors and medical students, the high court ruled that a failure “to take into account vital and relevant considerations which the decision-maker was bound to” rendered the decision to impose the reservations from this year onwards “unreasonable and arbitrary.”“Such a serious decision to reserve 41% of the State quota seats to PG courses at GMC ought to have been preceded by application of mind to a host of relevant considerations referred to in a plethora of decisions of the Supreme Court on the subject as well as the considerations flagged by the dean of GMC. For all these reasons as well, the impugned decision is vitiated and liable to be struck down,” the high court bench of Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar ruled. In a notification issued in May last year, the Goa government sought to implement reservations to the postgraduate courses at the Goa Medical College (GMC) to the extent of 41% in favour of STs (12%); SCs (2%) and OBCs (27%) from 2021-2022 academic year.The government argued that it was in tune with its orders of 2007, when it introduced a 12% reservation for STs in all government-run and aided educational institutions and a similar sounding notification in the year 2014, when it enhanced an already existing reservation for the OBCs from 19.5% to 27%. The government claimed in the court that there had been a “failure/lapse” by not applying reservations for the post graduate medical courses when the quota provisions had been notified back in 2007. The court was, however, unwilling to buy the argument. “The attempt, it appears, is to downplay this long period of over 14 years and to suggest that there was no conscious decision against the implementation or application of reservation policy to PG courses at GMC and GDC. Having regard to this length of time, a cogent explanation was due, but the same is not forthcoming either from the notings in the file or the affidavit of the State government,” the court observed. Also Read | Aryan Khan bail plea: Special NDPS court to hear matter on October 13The court also ruled that in case of a conflict between two sets of executive instructions -- the government’s general administrative instructions that reservations will apply to all educational institutions, and the rules that specifically deal with admissions to postgraduate courses in the Goa Medical and Dental Colleges -- it was the latter that would have precedence. The high court also struck down two recommendations made by the Goa Commission for SC/ST and the Goa State Commission for OBC for implementing reservations noting that they were made without the government specifying how the notification could impact them, without hearing the State government or more particularly, the deans of GMC and GDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-nixes-goa-s-bid-to-introduce-reservations-in-pg-medical-courses-101634005691242.html

12-10-2021||India||Mumbai police summons former cop Param Bir Singh for questioning in extortion case||Former police commissioner Param Bir Singh is summoned by the Mumbai police to appear before the cops on Tuesday, for questioning in connection with an extortion case. The notice was sent on October 9 amid reports claiming that Singh has left the country.The former cop is facing at least five criminal cases in Maharashtra.The crime branch of Mumbai Police is probing an extortion case registered against Singh on the basis of a complaint by a city hotelier and civic contractor. Besides Singh, dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, Sumit Singh alias Chintu, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh alias Babloo and Riyaz Bhati are named as accused in the FIR.On October 9, a police team went to Singh's flat in the Nilima building in the Malabar Hill area and pasted a notice outside, asking him to appear before police for questioning. The notice was pasted outside the house as he was not present at the residence.On October 5, news agency ANI had reported that Singh may have left the country before the Lookout Circular (LOC) was issued against him. It is also possible that he fled India with a forged passport, it reported quoting officials of investigating agencies.A person is not allowed to cross immigration at any airport if they have a lookout notice against them. The LoC was issued against Singh in July.Recently, Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil said that the investigative agencies are unaware of Singh's whereabouts. "I've heard something like that but as a government officer, he can't go abroad without government clearance,” Patil said on speculation that Singh might have escaped the country.Param Bir Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police chief and transferred to the Home Guard after Waze's arrest in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's south Mumbai residence.In the later course of the investigation, Singh also accused then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking Waze to collect ₹100 crore from hotels and bars in Mumbai every month, a charge which Deshmukh denies.Subsequently, while Deshmukh resigned, police registered four cases of alleged extortion against Singh in Mumbai and Thane. A case under the SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is also pending against Singh.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-summons-former-cop-param-bir-singh-for-questioning-in-extortion-case-101633999927523.html

"The 'Samajwadi Vijay Yatra' aims to make people aware about the corrupt, autocratic and suppressive policies of the BJP government and to establish real democracy," the party said in a statement ahead of the yatra. The programme is an effort by the SP to galvanise support ahead of state polls.Yadav will travel in a Mercedes bus, which has been turned into a 'rath' having his posters displayed on one side and that of party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on the other. The bus will also carry a picture of party leader Mohammad Azam Khan, according to SP.A day before the yatra, the party released a 17-second video in which Akhilesh Yadav is seen talking to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and touching his feet to get blessings.The Samajwadi Party said that the yatra will start from Kanpur and in the first two days - on October 12 and 13 - it will cover Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun and Hamirpur.

Tomorrow, the 'antim ardaas' of the martyrs of Lakhimpur Kheri massacre will take place in Tikunia at Sahebjada Inter College. Preparations are being made for the same and tens of thousands of farmers are expected to join this prayer meeting,” said SKM, an umbrella body of about 40 farmer organisations.It has appealed to farmer organisations and progressive groups across the nation to mark the occasion by organising prayer and homage meetings all over the country, followed by candle light vigils in the evening. It has urged people to light five candles outside their houses at 8pm on Tuesday.The farmers' body expressed its dismay at no action being taken against Union minister and BJP MP Ajay Mishra, whose vehicle allegedly ran over the farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri. “It is shameful on the part of the Modi government that Ajay Mishra Teni has not been sacked yet. It was his vehicles that were in the convoy that killed innocent people,” the SKM said.Thousands of farmers from across the nation have been camping at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding repeal of the three farm laws that they claim would do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Multiple rounds of talks with the government have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-farmers-to-observe-shaheed-kisan-diwas-today-101633996713597.html

12-10-2021||India||Arvind Kejriwal to begin his two-day Punjab visit today||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal will visit Punjab on Tuesday. The two-day visit comes months ahead of assembly elections in the state, where AAP is showcasing its 'Delhi model' to emerge on top.Party leader Raghav Chadha said that Kejriwal will land at Amritsar airport at about 3pm and visit Jalandhar's famous Devi Talab temple to offer prayers at 6pm."During the Navratras, Arvind Kejriwal will pray for peace, love, mutual brotherhood and a prosperous Punjab," Chadha said on Monday.No other programme has been officially announced by the party.AAP, which is already the main opposition party in Punjab after winning 20 seats in 2017 is trying to take advantage of the flux in state's ruling party, the Congress. It is also highlighting the issues in the Akalis' 10-year-long rule to emerge on top in assembly elections this time.And AAP has the power crisis issue too at hand, for which it is blaming the Centre and the state government."It is the responsibility of the Union government to supply coal to the public and private thermal plants in Punjab, but the Modi government has been reluctant to supply coal under a conspiracy. Coal is not being supplied to thermal plants in states, including Punjab and Delhi, which has led to the threat of thermal plant shutdowns and power outages," said AAP MLA Aman Arora.During his previous visits, Kerjiwal already made a populist pitch by "guaranteeing" 300 units of free power for residential consumers, waiver of pending bills and round-the-clock supply if his party comes to power in the state.In September, when Kejriwal visited Ludiana, he offered six promises in Punjab - AAP's "health guarantee" - if the party comes to power in the state. Among his offers were free health benefits at public hospitals across the state, treatment at which he promised would be on par with private healthcare. He also said that similar to Delhi, all medicines, tests, treatments, and operations would be free of cost if his party came to power in the state.For now, the biggest question in front of the AAP convenor is to name a chief ministerial candidate for Punjab, which he has promised will be named in due time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-begin-his-two-day-punjab-visit-today-101633997081073.html

The government issued an order last month, dissolving OFB with effect from October 1.The OFB, which earlier controlled 41 ordnance factories, has been split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products.These new companies have been named Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, Troop Comforts Limited, India Optel Limited, Munitions India Limited, Avani Armoured Vehicles, Gliders India Limited and Yantra India Limited.“All the indents previously placed on the OFBs by various services, CAPFs and state police have been converted into deemed contracts. These deemed contracts numbering 66 have a cumulative value of more than ₹65,000 crore,” said one of the officials cited above.“This process has been smoothly concluded following months of extensive consultations with all the stakeholders prior to the unveiling of the new defence companies,” he added.A total of 60% of the annual price of the indents will be paid by the services to the new defence public sector undertakings as mobilisation advance, said another official. “Mobilisation advance worth over ₹7,100 crore for the financial year 2021-22 has been paid to the DPSUs by the respective indentors,” he added.Ordnance factories were engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.The government expects the seven new professionally managed entities to increase their share in the domestic market through better capacity utilisation and also tap new export opportunities.During the last two decades, various high-level committees underlined the need to improve the functioning of OFB and making its factories vehicles of self-reliance for the country’s defence preparedness.The Comptroller and Auditor General also raised questions about the quality of products supplied by OFB and its overall performance in several past reports.The factories controlled by the board employed at least 70,000 people who have been against the move to corporatise it.The All-India Defence Employees Federation is among the four workers’ associations that have decided to boycott the official inauguration of the new companies on October 15, even though the government said there would be no change in the service conditions of the OFB employees and it was committed to safeguarding their interests.All OFB employees (Group A, B and C) from different production units have been transferred to the corporate entities on deemed deputation for an initial period of two years without changing their service conditions as government employees.In 2017, the government took action against 13 senior defence ministry bureaucrats from the Indian Ordnance Factories Service for the repeated failures of the ordnance factories to meet the shortfall in ammunition and poor quality of products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-inaugurate-7-defence-firms-carved-out-of-ofb-on-october-15-101633979653710.html
12-10-2021||India||Final call on Mishra’s dismissal after evidence against son: BJP||Amid growing clamour from opposition parties seeking the dismissal of union minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Mishra, Bharatiya Janata Party leaders on Monday said a final call on the issue will be taken by the Prime Minister’s Office based on evidence provided by the law enforcement agencies.The minister’s son, Ashish Mishra was arrested on Saturday in connection with the violence that erupted In Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, in which eight people including four farmers, were killed.Three senior BJP leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said the police has to provide evidence of Mishra’s son being involved in the incident. “There have been videos of the alleged incident (posted) on social media, but he (Ashish) cannot be seen in any of those. Let the police show evidence of his involvement, and the PM’s office will then take a call on the issue,” said a senior party functionary.The opposition has been demanding that the union government to remove Mishra. Congress leaders led by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sat on a silent protest demanding the dismissal of the minister. The CPI-M has also demanded the minister’s removal. The CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury said justice will not be served with Mishra’s continuation as minister.In response to a question on whether the issue will affect the BJP’s performance in the upcoming state assembly elections, a second leader said, “So far there is no indication to suggest that it will affect the party’s performance. But how the issue is handled by the government can have an impact.”The BJP’s core group on Uttar Pradesh met in the Capital on Monday to discuss election related issues. The meeting was attended by party president JP Nadda, union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is the election in-charge of the state, former union minister and state in-charge Radhamohan Singh, BJP state president Swatantrata Dev Singh, general secretary Organization BL Santhosh and state general secretary Sunil Bansal.According to a third leader, the party will draw up a plan to focus on 100 critical constituencies of the total 403 where it will need to redouble it’s efforts. These are constituencies where the party has either not won in the previous election and where it has not been able to consolidate its position. In 2017, the BJP swept to power, winning 324 of the 403.The party has also planned 100 public events spread over 100 days. The party will reach out to the beneficiaries of the central and state sponsored schemes and hold interaction with various social groups said the third leader. The BJP’s successful return to power in the 2019 national elections was built around a similar strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/final-call-on-mishra-s-dismissal-after-evidence-against-son-in-lakhimpur-violencebjp-101633979167088.html

12-10-2021||India||Kumaraswamy slams Karnataka govt for ‘sidelining’ Kannada for Hindi||Former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Monday lashed out at the Basavaraj Bommai-led government for sidelining Kannada in favour of Hindi.In a six-part post on Twitter, the Janata Dal (Secular) leader accused the state government of neglecting Kannada as a standard practice and continued to impress the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government that has been charged with imposing Hindi on non-Hindi speaking states.Referring to the stage set up at the 25th convocation of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (NIMHANS) held on Sunday, Kumaraswamy said, “Hindi gets the first place in the 25th Convocation of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (NIMHANS). English gets the second place and Kannada gets the third place. There is no better instance of showing that Kannada is caught in the hands of butchers.” The statements come at a time when Bommai has been accused of sidelining Kannada at major events in the state, especially in the presence of national leaders and ministers.“The high-handedness of national parties is increasing day-by-day. The attack on our land and language is worse than those by foreign invaders. What has happened to the tongues of people who don’t say Kannada first and instead say country first,” Kumaraswamy said in another post.In August this year, pro-Kannada organisations and the political opposition tore into Bommai for putting up boards in Hindi and English only at the flagging-off of the Metro rail services between Nayandahalli and Kengeri.The Kannada and Culture department had also issued a notice to Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) over allegations that the latter sidelined the regional language during the inauguration of the new stretch of the Metro.“Day before yesterday, the government took notice of sidelining Kananda during the event to inaugurate the Metro rail towards Kengeri. Despite Kannada being declared as the official language, some officials have been derelict and this will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” Kumaraswamy said on September 1.Dinesh Gundu Rao, the former state Congress president and AICC incharge of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa was the first to raise the issue in which he accused the state BJP of neglecting Kannada “to please the centre”.“It is a shame for Karnataka to ignore Kannada in our Metro inauguration programme on the Kengeri Purple route. It is impossible to tolerate the sidelining of Kannada in a government programme. Our Metro project is a central and state partnership project. So why should Kannada not be a priority?” Rao had said in a post on Twitter.The issue of language strikes an emotional chord in Karnataka and other non-Hindi speaking states which nurse a feeling of neglect of their native tongue under the Modi government. There have been long struggles in places like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra among several other states across the country that have fought over language rights, which even though has limited political capital, has rich dividends in mobilising support.The Metro had become the platform of choice for pro-Kannada politics to play out during the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government between 2013-2018 which had supported the cause as a tool to further criticise the union government for imposition of Hindi.The Congress and several other regional outfits have accused the union government of pursuing ‘one-nation, one-language’ policy as a way to make Hindi a common tongue as part of its larger Hindutva agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumaraswamy-slams-karnataka-govt-for-sidelining-kannada-for-hindi-101633979051331.html
12-10-2021||India||Siddaramaiah urges Rahul Gandhi to take over as Cong chief||Adding to the growing calls seeking Rahul Gandhi’s return as Congress president ahead of crucial elections in several states, senior Congress party leader Siddaramaiah on Monday echoed similar views saying that the Gandhi scion should lead the party.“I have been saying from (a) long time that Rahul Gandhi should lead (the) Congress party. I urge him to take charge at the earliest,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition and former chief minister said in Bengaluru on Monday.“It is not that Sonia ji is incapable of discharging her duties of the president. Sonia ji is not keeping good health. That is why I suggested Rahul ji to take over as early as possible,” he added.The statements come at a time when several Congress leaders have asked that Rahul Gandhi take charge of the party. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting is scheduled to be held on October 16 to deliberate on multiple issues that the party has to do as well as discussing strategies to face the upcoming elections, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi resigned in 2019 after he took responsibility for the routing of the Congress at the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Sonia Gandhi was made the interim president of the party that has continued to rely on the “Gandhi’s” for leadership and keep the party from breaking up into factions.The Congress is trying to mobilise support against the BJP over issues like price rise of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and other essential commodities as a result, the contentious farm laws and muzzling of free speech among several other issues to gain back some lost ground across the country.After the crisis in Rajasthan and then Punjab, the Congress is now trying to douse the fire in Karnataka by trying to lure Siddaramaiah to head to Delhi and be part of national politics.Siddaramaiah has refused to leave Karnataka and has aired his disapproval of any suggestions to move to Delhi.The Congress is also fighting the October 30 bypolls on the platform of price rise. “Prices of petrol, diesel and LPG are constantly increasing. Additional ₹3,000 crore is collected as tax between April and September compared to last year. (MK) Stalin’s government has reduced the tax by ₹3. Our state govt should reduce by at least ₹10 – only then prices of essential commodities can be controlled. Central govt should reduce excise duty and about ₹23 lakh cr is collected as excise duty in last 7 years. ₹1.2 lakh Cr is collected from Karnataka alone. Let BJP reduce the tax and provide relief to poor people,” Siddaramaiah said.He added that the Modi government has increased the excise duty of diesel from ₹3.45 to ₹31.84 and excise duty of petrol from ₹9.21 to ₹32.98. “Let him reduce excise duty by 50%. This is what I call criminal loot,” Siddaramaiah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-urges-rahul-gandhi-to-take-over-as-cong-chief-101633979050165.html
12-10-2021||India||Remarks taken out of context: K’taka minister||Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Monday clarified his statement on modern women opting to be single and surrogacy, which came under sharp criticism from various quarters for being sexist and bracketing women as just objects to reproduce.Sudhakar said that he was trying to make a point on the support.“It is unfortunate that a small part of my address out of the nineteen and a half minutes long speech during the World Mental Health Day programme at NIMHANS on Sunday is taken out of context and thereby losing out on the larger point I was trying to make at the prestigious National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences,” he said.The minister said that it was widely established through studies and research that families are a source of valuable mental support that is helpful in managing stressful situations. He said that the traditional Indian joint family has always been a good source of mental support.“Unlike western society that puts the focus on individualism, Indian society is collective in that it promotes interdependence and cooperation with the family being the focal point of the societal structure,” he said in his clarification on Monday. Similarly, CT Ravi, the national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and legislator from Karnataka, on Monday said that western influence and micro families are changing the mindset of women and it is an issue that needs some serious thought.“All women are not like this. Some are well-read, doing jobs in IT/BT and their mindset has changed. All women are not like this. This is something to think about and we have to do it. This is happening because of more western influence and micro families,” Ravi said on Monday.The minister’s comment on Sunday had attracted sharp criticism. The state Congress president, DK Shivakumar said that the comments reflected a regressive mindset.“They make big promises about women empowerment, while this is what the actual mindset is. Regressive, bashing women for their choices. All masks eventually come off,” Shivakumar said in a post on Twitter.Speaking at the World Mental Health Day at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru on Sunday, Sudhakar had said, “Today I am sorry to say this. A lot of modern women in India want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don’t want to give birth they want surrogacy. So, there is a paradigm shift in our thinking which is not good,” the minister said at an event for mental health in Bengaluru on Sunday.“Unfortunately, we are going in a western way. We don’t want our parents to live with us. forget about grandparents being with us and today,” Sudhakar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remarks-taken-out-of-context-k-taka-minister-101633979049054.html
12-10-2021||India||75 years of independence: Congress events to focus on farmers, Dalits||Congress has drawn up an elaborate, yearlong plan to celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence. The party will have its own celebrations, parallel to the Union government’s Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav programmes, but even in that, it will focus on farmers and Dalits.The celebrations that have begun on August 15 and will last until August 15 next year will highlight the Congress’ history and its contribution to the Freedom Struggle in an attempt to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party’s narrative on nationalism. The party will pick historic dates, including the birth and death anniversaries of icons such as Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel as well as defining events of the All India Congress Committee plenary sessions that are related to Freedom Struggle, said BK Hariprasad, co-convener of a special committee set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to celebrate the historic milestone. This panel is being helmed by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and has 11 members.“We are selecting the dates and places of important events such as Champaran (satyagraha) or Belgaum (the only Congress session with Gandhi as president) during our Freedom Struggle. The state units of the Congress have been asked to organise programmes at those places to commemorate the events,” Hariprasad told HT.In the list is a programme to commemorate the Patharughat Uprising of farmers in Assam on January 28 in 1894, a quarter-century before the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. “Similarly, the 1924 AICC session in Belgaum, where Mahatma Gandhi presided over the plenary session and said non-violent non-cooperation will be a means to attain political freedom, will also be celebrated,” Hariprasad said.The focus on farmers coincides with the ongoing farmer protests in the country and the party’s outreach, especially in Lakhimpur Kheri, where a car mowed down protesting farmers. “We also have to remember that when Gandhi ji started the Satyagraha agitation, he had realised that participation of the elites won’t be helpful unless the farmers and the Dalits also join the movement,” said Hariprasad.The Congress also plans to highlight its foundation day (December 28, 1885) this year as part of its 75-year celebrations.The Union government’s official celebrations, however, will be more expansive, covering a larger sphere of the society. All government programmes, various ongoing and future projects and major constructions such as the redevelopment of the Central Vista and the new Parliament building are all linked to the official celebrations..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-years-of-independence-congress-events-to-focus-on-farmers-dalits-101633978991975.html

These are Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra And Nagar Haveli, Goa, Telangana, Puducherry and Haryana. Haryana is the latest state to achieve the target ahead of schedule.Although the mission’s deadline is over two years away, some large states have been able to cover less than a quarter of total rural households, the data show.Among them is Uttar Pradesh, which has covered only 12.74% of its 26.4 million rural households so far.The state has drawn up a largescale engineering project to extend tap water connections in Bundelkhand, one of the driest parts of the country.In terms of overall households covered, Uttar Pradesh has been the slowest in implementing the programme.The state is key to improving India’s overall health parameters, especially among children, because it is the country’s most populous state.The Bundelkhand leg of the Jal Jeevan Mission comprises 467 piped drinking water schemes under 32 projects. Of these, 43 are surface water-based schemes and 424 are ground water-based.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/83-million-rural-houses-getting-piped-water-under-centre-scheme-data-101633978434255.html
12-10-2021||India||Veteran actor Nedumudi Venu dies at 73||Noted Malayalam actor Nedumudi Venu, who acted in more than 500 south Indian films and won three national awards, died in a private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday. Suffering from multiple ailments, Venu’s condition deteriorated due to post-Covid complications. He was 73 and survived by his wife TR Susheela, and two sons. Known for his versatile roles, the thespian started his acting career in drama and later switched to the cinema, becoming a colossus in the Malayalam tinsel world for more than five decades. An actor for all seasons, Venu’s instant wit and depth in folk songs and musical instruments were well known. A close disciple of late theatre personality Kavalam Naryana Panicker, he acted in many classical dance dramas. Personalities from the Malayalam film industry, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan were among the first to pay rich tributes to Venu. “He is one of the finest actors in Malayalam/Indian cinema. His profound knowledge of traditional art forms and Indian style of acting reflected in his unique performances,” the governor said in his condolence message.“We have lost a versatile personality, and it is a big loss to the cinema world in particular,” Vijayan said. “Farewell Venu uncle! Your body of work and your expertise over the craft will forever be research material for generations to come! Rest in peace legend! #NedumudiVenu,” actor Prithviraj Sukumaran wrote on Twitter.“He was first to break the handsome and tall hero concept in Malayalam movie. He floored reigning heroes with his acting prowess,” said director and lyricist Sreekumaran Thampi. “Not just an actor, he is a complete artist,” said Kamal Hassan, adding that he lost a good friend. Actors Mamooty, Mohanlal, Jayaram, Dulquar Salman, Tovino Thomas and Manju Warrier also poured in their condolences to the family of the veteran actor. Hailing from Nedumudi, a small village in Kuttanad (central Kerala), Venu’s chance encounter with famous director Bharathan to interview for a local film magazine in the late 70s opened doors for his film entry. The director was moved by his peculiar mannerism and instant wit and promised him a role in his next film. However, his debut happened in 1978 when he featured in national-award-winning director G Aravindan’s film Thampu. Bharathan’s Aaravam (1979) cemented his place in Mollywood. Besides Malayalam, Venu also acted in Tamil movies. His role in the 2005 movie ‘Anniyan’ and 2019 movie ‘Sarvam Thaala Mayam’ were critically acclaimed. In 2007, he also acted in an English movie Chaurahen. The release of his last film Marakkar, directed by Priyadarshan, was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 1990, Venu got the national award for supporting actor for his role in the Malayalam movie High Highness Abdullah, special jury award for Margam in 2003 and best feature film narration award in Minukku in 2006. He got the Kerala State Film Award six times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/veteran-south-indian-actor-nedumudi-venu-dies-at-73-101633978688354.html

12-10-2021||India||HC rejects plea on Kerala students’ admissions in DU||The Delhi high court Monday dismissed a petition which alleged a “disproportionate” number of admissions of students from Kerala state board in Delhi University, saying fixing of cut-offs was a matter of the university’s admission policy.Justice Prateek Jalan said that matters of academic policy were best left to the university and the court would be slow in interfering with the same. The court was hearing a petition by a DU-aspirant seeking a “scaling mechanism” for marks scored by students from different boards in order to provide a level playing field.“To me, it is entirely a matter of policy. How do we say what should be fixed as a cut-off? How do we say so-and-so board marks have been higher and so-and-so have been lower?... I don’t think a court can get into this based on this kind is reverse engineering,” the judge said. “We are of the view that the grievance of the petitioner is incapable of adjudication and is best left to the policy decision of the university,” the court said.The petitioner argued that in spite of securing over 98 per cent in Class 12, she was unable to score admission in her preferred course and college. “Take the cookie as it crumbles. We have to accept that. There is no reason to feel disheartened... You will get admission. There are great colleges and universities all over India,” the judge told the petitioner Gunisha Aggarwal who was present during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.Lawyers Vipul Ganda and Annirudh Sharma, representing the petitioner, claimed that 49 per cent of students who got admission in the first cut-off list belonged to the Kerala state board as opposed to 13.6 per cent and 14.80 per cent from CBSE and ISC, respectively. The counsel added that 27 per cent of successful candidates in the first cut-off were from the Rajasthan state board. For the Kerala board, both class 11 and class 12 marks are being considered which is leading to a disproportionate number of admissions from there, counsel for the petitioner stated.”It has come to the knowledge of the petitioner that the maximum number of 100 per cent marks have been awarded by the Kerala State Examination Board and a total of 6000 students from the Kerala State Board have scored 100 per cent marks. Similarly, other state Boards have adopted their own mechanism to award marks to students,” the petition said. “I am at the disadvantage as I am from CBSE... Suddenly this year the students of other boards have become brighter,” the counsel submitted.The court noted that not only was the scheme of marking for CBSE approved by the Supreme Court earlier this year on account of the pandemic, the petitioner filed the petition after participating in the admission process. “The fact that certain state boards may have evolved a different manner of assessment leading to some variation in the average marks does not (make the admission process) manifestly arbitrary so as to require interference,” the court said. “The judgements of the Supreme Court make it clear that in matters of academic policy, a writ court is slow to interfere,” it clarified.Delhi university counsel M Rupal stated that that the university cannot assess “which board has been liberal” as part of its admission process. “If more students (of a certain board) score more marks, being a central university, we can’t deprive them,” he added. In her petition, the petitioner prayed for a direction to quash DU’s policy of treating marks awarded by all different boards at par, saying that the present regime does not provide a “level playing field”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-plea-on-kerala-students-admissions-in-du-101633978570306.html
12-10-2021||India||Naidu on a mission to revive TDP’s fortunes||After the Telugu Desam Party’s poor show in the recent local body elections, party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will go on a three-day tour to his assembly constituency Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district from Tuesday to restore what analysts say the sagging morale of the party cadre and revive his own image.According to P Manohar, personal assistant of Naidu and in-charge of the constituency, the former CM would reach Kuppam at 1.30 pm on Tuesday and address a public meeting besides holding a meeting with party leaders in the evening.On Wednesday, the TDP chief would visit Santhipuram and Ramakuppam mandals and participate in roadshows besides meeting party leaders. On October 14, Naidu would visit Gudupalli mandal and participate in a roadshow before leaving for Hyderabad via Bengaluru, Manohar said.The former chief minister’s visit to Kuppam assumes significance in the wake of the recent debacle in all the local body elections in the constituency held recently. The TDP could win only three out of 65 mandal parishad (block parishad) territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and lost all the four zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) to ruling YSR Congress party in the elections held in April, results of which were declared on September 19.In the gram panchayat elections held in February this year, too, YSRC had won 75 out of 89 gram panchayats and the TDP had to remain content with just 14 gram panchayats.Though the YSRC won nearly 90 per cent of the local bodies in the state, the poor show by the TDP in Kuppam in particular was a sort of personal humiliation to Naidu as the constituency is considered to be his bastion.Naidu had earlier represented Chandragiri assembly constituency when he was in the Congress, but after he defected to the TDP established by his father-in-law and matinee idol N T Rama Rao in 1982, he moved to Kuppam in 1989 assembly elections. Since then, he has been representing Kuppam and never faced a defeat.But after the establishment of YSRCP by his arch rival Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in 2011, Naidu has been gradually losing ground in Kuppam. Earlier, his victory margin had always been around 42-45 per cent in all the previous elections, but in 2014, his victory margin fell sharply to 28.81 per cent, though he became the chief minister of AP. In 2019, it declined further to 16.93 per cent.Ever since he came to power in May 2019, Jagan has been laying special focus on Kuppam with a perspective plan to defeat Naidu in the 2024 assembly elections at any cost. In the last elections, Jagan successfully ensured the defeat of Naidu’s son Nara Lokesh from Mangalagiri constituency.If Jagan can defeat Naidu in Kuppam in the next elections, it would be the end of the road for the TDP. “That is precisely why Jagan laid special focus on the local body elections in Kuppam and ensured that the YSRC dismantled Naidu’s citadel to a large extent,” political analyst Suresh Dharur said.Naidu’s visit to Kuppam from Tuesday is being viewed against this backdrop. “He has realised that Kuppam is no more his stronghold and he cannot take the people of his constituency granted. If he cannot concentrate on his own seat, he may have to face the defeat in the next assembly elections,” Dharur said.In fact, the mood of the people in Kuppam was evident during the gram panchayat elections held in February. Though these elections were held on non-party basis, the party affiliation of the local candidates was glaringly evident.But Naidu did not take these elections seriously, thinking that the local factors might have played a role in the gram panchayats and moreover, the ruling party would always have an advantage. However, the recent mandal parishad and zilla parishad elections were an eye-opener for him, analysts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-on-a-mission-to-revive-tdp-s-fortunes-101633978569219.html
12-10-2021||India||Minister’s son sent to 3-day police custody over UP clash||A local court on Monday sent Ashish Mishra, son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, to police custody for three days in connection with the violence in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district last week.Eight people were killed in the incident on October 3, which included four farmers, two workers of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a driver and a local journalist.Police wanted Ashish Mishra’s custody for 14 days, but chief judicial magistrate Chinta Ram allowed only three, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said.“As per the Supreme Court guidelines, the court instructed not to adopt any coercion or torture of the accused. Also, a lawyer of Mishra’s choice may remain present during his interrogation at a distance without causing any interference,” Yadav said.The hearing on the remand application began around 2pm. Mishra was produced remotely via video-conferencing, as he is lodged in Lakhimpur Kheri district jail.Defence counsels Awdhesh Dubey, Awdhesh Singh, Shailendra Gaur and others opposed the application for custody. They argued police had already questioned Ashish Mishra for 12 hours, and no further questioning was required.Ashish Mishra was arrested on October 9, five days after he was booked in a murder case lodged in Tikunia police station following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that ran over four farmers when they were returning from a demonstration on October 3. A local court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days.Minister Mishra and his son have denied the allegation. They say that local protesters pelted the vehicles with stones, causing the driver to lose control. They also allege that farmers killed two BJP workers and the driver.The Supreme Court had taken cognisance of the incident and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take action against “whoever is involved.” The court was exceptionally harsh while commenting on the police’s lenient handling of Ashish Mishra, although it didn’t name him.Farm groups say a Mahindra Thar owned by Ajay Mishra mowed down protesters from behind while they were returning from a demonstration in Tikunia village. A video clip that is yet to be authenticated forensically shows the same.Police issued the first notice to Ashish Mishra on October 7, asking him to appear before them on October 8. He didn’t show up. After a second notice, he came in for questioning on October 9. Police said that he could not explain several points about his whereabouts during the incident and was arrested.Police had applied for custody immediately after his arrest, but the magistrate had postponed the hearing till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-son-sent-to-3-day-police-custody-over-up-clash-101633978270945.html
12-10-2021||India||Sweet display: Kerala artist makes 24-foot long Theyyam mascot with biscuits||The practice of making favourite artefacts is usually the norm across the country during the festive season but this one in Kerala is set apart from the rest. An artist in north Kerala’s Kannur built a 24-foot-long mascot of Theyyam, a ritual dance form of Malabar, on Saturday using biscuits, sweets and other bakery products, officials said.Artist Suresh PK, better known as Davinci Suresh, toiled away tirelessly for sixteen long hours to create the 24-foot long art piece. The mascot is built of 25,000 biscuits, sweets, bread, buns, dry fruits and other bakery products. “We heard Suresh is planning 100 different mediums to install different artefacts. So, we invited him and provided all arrangements,” said the main organiser of the event Rasheed Mohammad, a chef consultant and social worker. He said Theyyam was selected because it is the mascot of north Kerala and ritual dance season is fast approaching. He said the art was arranged at the Bharat auditorium in Kannur after laying enough cloth-wrapped tables. It attracted hordes of visitors.“Initially I thought of using different biscuits only. Later, we had to use other products for more visual appeal. Bakery items are my 79th medium. Later, we donated all products used in the art to a veterinary farm,” the artist said in his Facebook post.Earlier, he attempted a portrait of former President late APJ Abdul Kalam in gold, social reformer Sree Narayana Guru’s portrait in flowers and Bollywood megastar Amitab Bachchan’s in cloth masks. The Thrissur-based artist said it took about 16 hours to complete the work. North Malabar has a glorious tradition in baking and cake-making. It is often said that in 1883, the first cake was baked in south India by one Mambally Bapu in Thalassery. Mambally Bakery, situated in the town, is still continuing the tradition. The town is famous for its three Cs - cricket, circus and cake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sweet-display-kerala-artist-makes-24-foot-long-theyyam-mascot-with-biscuits-101633977727661.html
12-10-2021||India||‘It’s crucial we use COP 26 to move forward’: Danish PM Mette Frederiksen||Denmark is among the few countries with a climate law, which has set a target of cutting Denmark’s greenhouse gas emissions by 70% compared to 1990 levels by 2030. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sees the climate crisis as the top agenda for her government, and believes that economic growth and climate change mitigation can happen together. Ahead of Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26), she is on a three-day visit to India from October 9 to 11 to review the Green Strategic Partnership with India and discuss climate change mitigation. Frederiksen told to HT in an interview that Denmark hopes to set a good example by delivering more than its share of climate finance to support developing economies in mitigating the climate crisis. Edited excerpts:What are your expectations from COP 26?I think it is crucial that we use COP 26 to move forward and to show that we are willing to deliver on the Paris Agreement. Therefore, the G20 meeting just before the leaders’ meeting in Glasgow is very important because we need some of the big countries with the highest numbers of emissions to deliver more. And when you look at the IPCC report, it stands very clear that we all have to do more than we are already doing. So, no matter how high ambitions we have, we need to do more because the consequences of climate change are worse than we thought.Also Read| Danish PM visits Taj Mahal, calls it beautifulDo you think it is possible to achieve net zero emissions and what is the way forward to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century?Let me put it this way, net zero has to be possible. Renewables are an important part of this. If you have green electricity, then you can use all the electricity that you want to. I really think it’s good that your Prime Minister has set some ambitious goals when it comes to renewables. Yes, I think it is possible, and has to be possible. Renewables are a big part. Carbon capture is the next part and ensuring we are able to use green electricity in areas where we are not able to use it today. Because in flying from Denmark to India, we would still like to do that but one day hopefully we would like to travel green.Do you think it’s fair to ask developing countries to commit to similar emissions targets as developed nations? Now there is pressure on developing countries to commit to a net zero target.Yes and no. I feel a bit embarrassed by talking about climate changes and the Paris Agreement while coming from a country which had such a good starting point compared to many other countries and India. We need to be aware of the different starting points, and at the same time, ensuring together that economic growth and green decision is combined because I would never dare to ask India to withdraw from your wanting of economic growth. It’s totally necessary to make sure that living standards are lifted globally especially for the most vulnerable people. It would never be a way of asking you to slow down your development. Never ever. I am a social democrat; I believe in development, and I know India is still facing many problems in other areas. I think what is necessary is that you are not making the same mistakes we did, and I think it is possible to jump over some of those mistakes if we do it strategically. For example, when it comes to renewables.You have spoken several times about how climate finance needs to be delivered—the USD 100 billion commitment from developed countries. How will you ensure that other developed countries deliver on climate finance? Of course, Denmark has committed that they will deliver their share.Hopefully by showing a good example. Now we have said that we will take more than our share. We do it because we believe in it, and because we are totally aware that this is not possible if we are not securing some investments especially from Europe but also other partners. If Denmark is able to do more than what we are supposed to do, then you know I can push our neighbouring countries to do the same. It will be good with some competition in this area you know.Also Read| PM Modi meets Danish counterpart, sign MoUs to boost ‘green strategic partnership’You have said once that you want to be the PM for children and that the climate crisis is a children’s issue. How would you take it to the level of advocacy for children? And for women?I think there are different things I would like to say to this question. First of all, if we are not able to deliver on the demands of children and young people worldwide because we have to be honest that it is the next generation that have pushed my generation, and also the older generation, to move forward on fighting climate change. They were on the streets everywhere globally, pushing this agenda. If we want them to trust us and believe in democracy; we have to show them that we are as aware of this challenge as they are and we are able to give the answers. So, for me, this is also a democratic question in securing that the next generation believes in democracy. Secondly, I only have 40 years left but the small ones have 80 or 90 years in front of them. This is the strange part of pollution and climate change that we know that we are giving a life for our own children and grandchildren that will become not better than what we received from our parents. That’s wrong. Every generation should have the idea of giving not only a country but a world to our children with clean air and clean drinking water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-crucial-we-use-cop-26-to-show-we-are-willing-to-deliver-on-paris-agreement-danish-pm-mette-frederiksen-101633977308911.html
12-10-2021||India||India not among 11 countries allowed quarantine-free travel to Singapore||Singapore will be reopening its border to vaccinated visitors from 11 countries from October 19, however, India has not been included in the list of countries allowed quarantine-free entry under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) for now, the country said. Travellers have to be vaccinated with a World Health Organization (WHO) approved jab, its guidelines said.The Singapore government’s VTL scheme covers seven European countries - Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Germany - along with United States and Canada. The only Asian country in the list is Brunei. China, India, and Indonesia have not been included so far. In addition to this, vaccinated travellers from South Korea will also be allowed to enter the country from November 15, reported news agency ANI.To avail the VTL scheme travellers have to fly to Singapore in a VTL-designated flight flown by Singapore Airlines or Lufthansa. The government will be adding other carriers to the list over time. Singapore Airlines is expanding VTL flight services to 14 cities, with more points on special designated services to be announced in coming weeks, the carrier said in a statement.Meanwhile, a senior Indian government official said, “The appropriate ministries will work on resolving whatever the concerns are but there is nothing to be said formally at the moment on the matter.”Travellers will also need to carry proof of their vaccination and undergo RT-PCR test not more than 48 hours before their departure and also on their arrival at Singapore’s Changi airport. Previously, travellers had to take four such tests to gain entry.This announcement comes days after Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s push to live with Covid-19 without being paralysed by fear. During a televised address on Saturday, Loong said that the delta variant has shown that Covid-19 is not going away anywhere. However, with vaccinations, social distancing measures and careful monitoring, it will be possible to live with the “new normal”. “It will take us at least three months, and perhaps as long as six months, to get there,” he cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-among-11-countries-allowed-quarantine-free-travel-to-singapore-101633976829338.html
12-10-2021||India||India set to ink key trade deals by next year||India is set to conclude three major trade agreements with the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Australia by 2022, and is close to signing early harvesttrade deals separately with the three nations, three people aware of the development said. The government has set aggressive timelines for the agreements as part of its ambitious target of $500 billion exports by the financial year to March 2023 – formalisation of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the UAE by early 2022, a free trade agreement (FTA) with the UK by next year, and an interim trade deal with Australia by December. These will be followed a year later by a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), the people said, requesting anonymity. The negotiations with the UAE are on a fast track. The first round of talks was held on September 23-24 in New Delhi during the visit of UAE minister of state for trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi. “The aim is to sign a formal CEPA in March 2022,” one person said. “Both sides are serious about negotiating and concluding CEPA in line with the determination of the leadership of both countries,” a second person added. “Both sides are closely connected and working to achieve this agreement, which will complement the India-UAE strategic partnership.” The agreement is expected to raise bilateral trade in goods to $100 billion and in services to $15 billion in five years. The UAE was India’s third largest trading partner with about $59.1 billion of bilateral trade in 2019-20, a largely non-Covid period. India’s major exports to the UAE include refined petroleum products, minerals, cereals, sugar, fruits, vegetables, tea, meat, seafood, textiles, engineering, machinery products, and chemicals. It imports petroleum and petroleum products, precious metals, stones, jewellery, minerals, chemicals and wood products. “India and the UK plan to launch negotiations on an FTA from next month in two stages – low-hanging fruits (early trade deal) by March 2022 on priority, followed by a comprehensive agreement,” a third person said. The tentative timeline for the FTA and other trade matters was chalked out during discussions between commerce minister Piyush Goyal and UK trade secretary Liz Truss last month. The two countries also agreed to quickly finalise terms of reference so that negotiations can be launched in November, he said, adding rapid progress has been seen after an “Enhanced Trade Partnership” was announced by the prime ministers of both nations in May. India has also revived CECA negotiations with Australia, which has tremendous potential, said the first person cited earlier. “It is expected that the long-pending FTA negotiations with Australia may conclude by 2022 and an agreement could be signed thereafter,” he said. Australia and India launched negotiations for a CECA in May 2011, but talks were suspended in September 2015 after nine rounds because of differences on some multilateral issues. Negotiations by the two countries were “relaunched in June last year and an aggressive timeline” was agreed at the India-Australia joint ministerial commission meeting between Goyal and his Australian counterpart Dan Tehan on September 30, he said. Tehan said the aim is to have an interim agreement covering goods, services, investments, rules of origin, phyto-sanitary measures for fruits and vegetables, and mutual recognition of qualifications in place by December this year, to be followed by a final agreement in December 2022. He said the two sides are expected to make market access offers by the end of October. “It’s going to be a challenge. These things are not easy,” Tehan said, acknowledging Indian concerns in areas such as dairy and agriculture. The market access offers will be a “difficult” aspect requiring hard work by both sides, he said. Though both sides will have to make compromises, Australia can offer investments and technology to boost food and agricultural processing in India, Tehan said. Australia is also open to equitably handling the issue of domestic subsidies in agriculture, he added. India has set an ambitious of exports target of $450-$500 billion by the next financial year and early harvest deals, along with full FTAs, will play a major role in realising this goal, the first person said. Besides the three most prospective FTAs, New Delhi is negotiating trade deals with other countries and blocs. They include Oman, Canada, the European Union, Russia, and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), which comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. Speaking at a midterm review meeting of export promotion councils (EPCs) on Saturday, Goyal asked the bodies to raise trade-related concerns faced in these countries so that the government can address them while negotiating individual FTAs. He said such issues were mostly related to market access rather than tariffs. Goyal said India is on the right track as its exports touched $197 billion in the first half of the current financial year. “Our exporters have made all of us Indians proud today,” he said in a statement, adding “if we can aim to scale $450-$500 billion exports next year”.Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consultancy firm Primus Partners, said: “UAE, UK, and Australia are three key economies, and India’s old allies. Trade negotiations with them in both goods and services have progressed very well and signs of early harvest deals are visible, which will finally culminate into comprehensive FTAs. It’s a win-win for both India and its partners.”Meanwhile, commerce minister Goyal met ministers of at least 15 countries on Monday on the sidelines of the G20 Trade Ministers Meeting in Sorrento, Italy, a government spokesperson said. He clarified India’s trade position and engaged in bilateral and multilateral negotiations with the ministers of the US, the UK, the EU, Brazil, China, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada, South Korea and Mexico, among others, the official said.At the meetings, Goyal also asserted India’s position for the forthcoming Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) of World Trade Organization (WTO) to be held in November at Geneva in Switzerland. Goyal said the multilateral trade deal must be “just and equitable” and “historical wrongs against developing countries must be corrected” rather than being carried over, the official cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-ink-key-trade-deals-by-next-year-101633976408612.html
12-10-2021||India||71 loans given in Rana Kapoor’s tenure turned bad: ED||At least 71 loans worth over ₹31,855 crore approved by Yes Bank during the tenure of former chief executive and managing director Rana Kapoor have turned bad, according to a recent charge sheet by the Enforcement Directorate.The charge sheet by the central agency that investigates financial crimes was filed on October 1 in a Delhi court in connection with irregularities in a loan worth ₹514.27 crore granted to the Avantha Group by Yes Bank in 2018. HT has reviewed a copy.The directorate has accused Kapoor and Gautam Thapar, promoter of the Avantha Group, of colluding to fraudulently obtain a credit facility by creating sham agreements, causing a loss of public money worth ₹466.51 crore. Out of ₹514.27 crore, ₹14.11 crore was in processing fees, which was paid by Oyster Buildwell Pvt. Ltd, an Avantha Group company. And of the total, only ₹47.75 crore was recovered by the bank.Several officers of Yes Bank were paid huge salaries, much higher than market rates, and were given perks, promotions and prestigious titles by Kapoor to deter them from raising red flags in the dubious decisions, the charge sheet said.When these officers were interrogated, they held Kapoor responsible, but the agency alleged that they were hand-in-glove with him in taking these decisions.The new management of Yes Bank found Ashish Agarwal, senior group president and chief risk officer, accountable for 71 bad loans worth ₹31,855 crore, and imposed a penalty of ₹50 lakh on him for dereliction of duty, ED said in the charge sheet.“It is important to mention here that all these (71) loans had been sanctioned under the chairmanship of Rana Kapoor, including the one given to Avantha Group,” according to the charge sheet.In most of these 71 loans, investigations are either ongoing or the loans have been declared as fraud.Agarwal was paid a salary of ₹5 crore every year during Kapoor’s tenure. The new management has reduced it to ₹2 crore.Other Yes Bank executives, including Amit Kumar (president), Harsh Gupta (former president), Vinod Bahety (group president), Amit Mamtani (president), Pawan Kumar Aggarwal (senior president) and others, who were paid high salaries by Kapoor-led management, have faced financial penalties or salary reduction after the irregularities were revealed.ED has named them as accused in the charge sheet.Avantha Group’s Thapar and Kapoor are also being investigated in other cases, including a probe pertaining to sale of a 1.2-acre bungalow at 40, Amrita Sher-Gil Marg in New Delhi, allegedly at half its market price, in lieu of a loan worth around ₹1,900 crore granted by Yes Bank to Thapar’s group company. It is alleged that a bribe of ₹307 crore changed hands during the sale of the bungalow.Kapoor is lodged in a Mumbai jail. Gautam Thapar was arrested in August this year and is lodged in a jail in Delhi.Yes Bank did not respond to detailed queries. Kapoor’s team was not available for comment while Thapar’s legal team didn’t respond to HT’s calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/71-loans-given-in-kapoor-s-tenure-turned-bad-ed-101633976406867.html
12-10-2021||India||CBI raids at premises of former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh||The Central Bureau of India (CBI) on Monday conducted searches at the premises of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh at multiple locations in connection with the leak of confidential documents related to the preliminary enquiry against him on allegations of corruption, officials said Monday.A team of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials reached the residence of Deshmukh in Nagpur and Mumbai this morning with necessary warrants, they said.The investigating agency on September 2 arrested Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga and its own sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari for allegedly leaking confidential documents related to the preliminary enquiry against Deshmukh, they said.The agency had started a PE on the orders of the Bombay High Court which had issued the directions while hearing a public interest litigation on allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.The PE findings showed the Deputy SP probing the matter had purportedly opined that no cognisable offence was made out against Deshmukh but it was later converted into an FIR based on a contrasting opinion of the Deputy SP.The opinion mentioned in the FIR said that cognisable offence is made out against Deshmukh.The findings giving clean chit to Deshmukh got leaked to the media causing an embarrassment to the CBI after opposition parties accused the agency of conducting a motivated probe against the then minister.Soon after the leak, the CBI booked Tiwari and Daga on the allegations of leaking documents.It has been reliably learnt that Sub-Inspector Tiwari came in contact with Nagpur-based advocate Daga during the course of the inquiry, the FIR alleged.It said that Tiwari had been in regular contact with him, it alleged.The FIR alleged that Daga handed an IPhone 12 pro as illegal gratification to Tiwari for passing details of the enquiry and investigation pertaining to corruption allegations against Deshmukh.The agency also alleged that Tiwari had been receiving illegal gratification from Daga at regular intervals.

12-10-2021||India||Air quality slips to ‘poor’ zone at some stations in the Capital||Air quality in Delhi has started deteriorating, as seven localities out of 36in the national capital fell to the ‘poor’ category, Central Pollution Control Board data show. Although air pollution is likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ category because of reasonably strong winds, a rise in is expected in the coming weeks, a scientist at the India Meteorological Department said. The air quality index (AQI) for the city as a whole was 166 on Monday, but it was worse in Shadipur (211), Lodhi Road (231), Jahangirpuri (218), Wazirpur (223), Mundka (256), Anand Vihar (281) and Chandni Chowk (236). A value between 201 and 300 is considered poor, affecting the elderly, children and people with heart and lung problems. A value between 101 and 200 is termed moderate. The last time the city’s AQI rose above 200 was on July 2.The impact of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana is still negligible because the winds changed from easterly to northeasterly from October 6, when the southwest monsoon withdrew from the region, explained the Met scientist. “This is likely to remain the case through this week, and because of this the AQI is also expected to remain in the moderate zone,” the weather scientist said, requesting anonymity. The burning of farm residue, which sends up clouds of smoke into the atmosphere that then descends over the capital, is one of the reasons for the annual bad air crisis that marks autumn in Delhi. The transition to winter also weakens winds, which means local pollutants are not blown away as they usually do during other times of the year.The predominant pollutant in Delhi’s air on Monday was PM 10, which is particulate matter less than 10 micrometres thick, or dust, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality monitoring system run by the Union ministry of earth science. “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as the main pollutant.

It seems she is desperate to please her friends in the BJP,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.Citing the examples of Rhea Chakraborty being “hounded” in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, the Congress leader further claimed that the arrest of Aryan was a conspiracy hatched to “defame” Shah Rukh and his family as the actor didn’t bow before the BJP.Besides Chowdhury, several politicians have spoken about Aryan Khan’s matter. The spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Nawab Malik has recently said that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) initially detained as many as 11 people in the case, but let go of three people, including the brother-in-law of a BJP leader.Meanwhile, Union minister Narayan Rane’s son and BJP leader Nitesh Rane hit out at Malik, saying if the latter is sympathising with Aryan “because it’s a Khan.”Aryan, who was arrested on October 3, is currently in judicial custody and lodged at Mumbai’s Arthur Road prison. His bail plea will next be heard on Wednesday by a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congs-adhir-chowdhury-says-mamata-silent-on-aryan-khan-s-case-to-please-bjp-101633975392575.html
12-10-2021||India||ED quizzes Rajasthan CM Gehlot’s brother in fertiliser export case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday once again questioned Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s elder brother Agrasain Gehlot in connection with a money-laundering probe in the illegal export of a fertiliser meant for Indian farmers, people familiar with the development said.Gehlot was earlier questioned on September 27 after the Rajasthan high court asked him to cooperate with the probe while asking the central anti-money laundering agency not to take any coercive action against him.He appeared at the agency’s headquarters in Delhi along with his lawyer around noon on Monday, following which his statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The agency had raided his office premises in July last year around the time a political slugfest was going on in the state between his chief minister brother and then deputy CM Sachin Pilot.After the questioning on Monday, he told news agency ANI: “I gave my best answers in reply to their (agency) questions. Those levelling allegations against me of ₹120 crore or ₹130 crore should know where the material quantity will be kept. Those who have done the scam should be probed.”ED’s money laundering probe is based on an investigation carried out by the customs department and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in 2009 in the export of muriate of potash or MOP worth ₹57 lakh in 12 consignments the same year. MOP is a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy.The customs department’s investigation report, reviewed by HT, states that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi – allegedly played a key role in the irregularities. It is suspected that the MOP was exported to companies in Malaysia and Singapore.The customs probe report states that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become part of the syndicate in the entire chain of conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained certain amount as his commission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-quizzes-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-s-brother-in-fertiliser-export-case-101633975867471.html
12-10-2021||India||Four arrested over ‘forced conversions’ in Karnataka||Four people have been arrested in Karnataka’s Udupi district after a complaint was registered against them for allegedly converting people into Christianity, police said on Monday. “There was a complaint that four people were converting people from lower castes into Christianity,” a police officer of Kota precinct in Kundapura taluk of Udupi district. “We went there, and based on our preliminary investigation, an FIR (first information report) has been filed.” The incident reportedly took place on Sunday night. The four accused — Prakash, Jyothi, Ravichandra and Manohar — have been named in the FIR, the officer said, declining to be named. A court on Monday sent them to judicial custody for 15 days. The southern state has been seeing a surge in allegations of forced religious conversions, moral policing and hate crimes in recent times. On Sunday night, members of a right-wing Hindu organisation barged into the home of the accused who are all said to be part of the same household and confronted them in front of police personnel, people aware of the Kundapura incident said on condition of anonymity. A purported video of the incident was widely circulated on social media, in which one of the accused in the case, Jyothi, is seen arguing with the group that entered their home forcibly. HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.Last month, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said his government was considering a law to ban forced religious conversions. “Such things (conversions) are happening here and there. A couple of days ago, I gave appropriate directions to district administrations not to allow any religious conversion through inducement or by force, as it is illegal,” Bommai said on September 28. Bommai’s statement came days after the issue was raised by Goolihatti D Shekar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Hosadurga, in the monsoon session of the state assembly in September. Shekar said there has been heightened activity around conversions and his own mother has been converted after she was “brainwashed”. On Sunday evening, at least four families from a community classified as an extremely backward caste, who had converted to Christianity, embraced Hinduism at Hosadurga taluka in Chitradurga district. “Four families came to a temple and said they will continue in our religion, follow our culture and traditions,” Shekar said on Sunday. “They are from Maruthi Nagar and from Sudugadu Sidda community.” Several BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have enacted laws to prevent forcible religious conversions. In recent times, several right-wing Hindu outfits have accused Christian missionaries of luring people from backward classes to convert into Christianity, a claim denied by churches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-arrested-over-forced-conversions-in-karnataka-101633975687364.html
12-10-2021||India||PM Modi launches India’s first private space association||New Delhi: India will soon have policies on space communication and remote sensing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday while launching the Indian Space Association, a group formed to promote space technology. The draft policies, which are being finalised, are expected to enable commercialisation of space technology and facilitate private investments in India’s space sector. “The government’s approach to space reforms is based on four pillars,” the Prime Minister said. “First, the freedom of innovation in the private sector. Second, the role of the government as an enabler. Third, preparing the youth for the future. And fourth, to see the space sector as a resource for the progress of the common man.”The new association counts private companies such as Bharti Airtel, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Group’s Nelco, OneWeb, MapmyIndia, Walchandnagar Industries and Alpha Design Technologies as members, besides the state-owned Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). “The space sector is a major medium for the progress of 130 crore countrymen. For India, the space sector means better mapping, imaging and connectivity facilities for the common people,” Modi said. “Also, the space sector means better speed from shipment to delivery for entrepreneurs. It also means better security and income for fishermen and better forecasts of natural calamities.”The opening up of the space sector is in sync with the government’s overall reforms policy, Modi said. “While opening a host of sectors, the government has built a regulatory environment in which priority has been given to national interest as well as the interests of different stakeholders. Space sector was once synonymous with the government sector, but the government has worked to change this mindset,” he said. “Now is not a time for linear innovations for the country, but for exponential innovation, and this will be made possible when the government plays the role of an enabler and not handler. That is why it has been sharing expertise in sectors ranging from defence to space.” Modi said his vision of a self-reliant India is a strategy to make the country a global manufacturing and innovations powerhouse by enhancing the capabilities of local entrepreneurs and youth. It will play a big role in global development, enhancing the prestige of India’s human resources talent, the Prime Minister said.In the past seven years, space technology has been converted into a tool of last-mile delivery and leakage-free, transparent governance, Modi said, providing examples of the use of geo-tagging in houses for the poor, roads and infrastructure projects.“Development projects are being monitored by satellite imaging. Space technology is being used in settlement of Fasal Bima Yojna (crop insurance scheme) claims, NavIC system is helping fishermen, disaster management planning is also being carried out through this technology,” Modi said. NavIC is an independent regional navigation satellite system developed by Isro. Several countries are turning their attention to space technologies, especially since 2020 when SpaceX became the first private agency to fly humans into space. The company also has the Starlink project -- a constellation of satellites meant to deliver internet connectivity, as does its upstart rival, Blue Origin and its project Kuiper. Earlier this month, SpaceX announced it intends to offer Starlink broadband services in India starting December 2022.According to estimates of the space industry, 95% of the $366 billion earned in the sector was from what is called the space-for-earth economy. This include goods or services produced in space for use on earth, such as telecommunications and internet infrastructure, earth observation capabilities, and national security satellites. The announcement by Modi on Monday about the policies in work could serve as a crucial signal for potential investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-india-s-first-private-space-association-101633975628122.html
12-10-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi to virtually join G20 summit on Afghanistan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually join the G20 extraordinary leaders’ summit on Afghanistan on October 12 that will discuss a response to the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country and the fight against terrorism. The summit has been convened by Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the grouping of 20 of the world’s major economies. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has discussed Afghanistan with world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of efforts to organise the special meeting to forge strategies to confront the crisis. The agenda of the meeting will include a discussion on the response to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan and access to basic services and livelihood, security and the fight against terrorism, and also mobility, migration and human rights, the external affairs ministry said. Earlier, Modi participated in a virtual format in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)- Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) outreach summit on Afghanistan on September 17, when he cautioned the international community against rushing to recognise the Taliban setup in Kabul as the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations. External affairs minister S Jaishankar participated in a meeting of G20 foreign ministers on Afghanistan on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York last month. Also Read | ‘Leave immediately’: US, UK warn citizens of threat to Kabul hotelsG20 is an important platform to build international consensus and facilitate a coordinated approach between multilateral organisations, including the UN and its agencies, and global and regional actors to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, the external affairs ministry said.“We have to see whether there are shared objectives among the G20 nations...we have reached a point where we only need to worry about saving lives,” Draghi told a news conference last month. The G20 meeting on Afghanistan will be held a few weeks before the grouping’s summit in Rome during October 30-31. Draghi said Qatar, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and UN will participate in the upcoming meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-virtually-join-g20-summit-on-afghanistan-101633947365487.html
12-10-2021||India||India, UK back global approach to engaging Taliban||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson on Monday agreed on the need for a coordinated global approach to engagement with the Taliban against the backdrop of the group stepping up its efforts to gain recognition.The situation in Afghanistan figured in a phone call between Johnson and Modi, who also reviewed progress in implementing Roadmap 2030 for India-UK relations adopted in May.“The leaders also talked about the current situation in Afghanistan. They agreed on the need for a coordinated international approach to engagement with the Taliban, emphasising the importance of upholding human rights in the country,” a 10 Downing Street spokesperson said.The external affairs ministry said the leaders “agreed on the need to develop a common international perspective on issues regarding extremism and terrorism, as well as human rights and rights of women and minorities”. Modi also tweeted about the meeting. “Was a pleasure to speak to Prime Minister @BorisJohnson. We reviewed progress on the India-UK Agenda 2030, exchanged views on climate action in the context of the forthcoming COP-26 in Glasgow, and shared our assessments on regional issues including Afghanistan,” he said.Johnson and Modi further discussed the shared fight against coronavirus disease and the importance of cautiously opening up international travel. “They agreed the UK’s recognition of Indian vaccine certification is a welcome development to that end,” the readout said.A Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is currently in Qatar for talks with several countries, including the US, aimed at getting international recognition for the setup in Kabul and to seek the lifting of a freeze on assets worth around $10 billion.The US state department said an interagency delegation that held talks with the Taliban representatives in Doha during October 9-10 “focused on security and terrorism concerns”, safe passage for US citizens, foreign nationals and Afghan partners and human rights. The US said it would continue to provide humanitarian aid directly to the Afghan people, and the American delegation reiterated that the Taliban “will be judged on its actions, not only its words”.India has asked the world community not to be in a rush to recognise the Taliban setup as it is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations.During their phone conversation, Modi and Johnson discussed the overall India-UK relationship and “welcomed the progress made on the 2030 Roadmap since it was agreed...in May”, according to the readout from Downing Street. This included progress in areas such as trade and defence.They also reviewed progress in the “enhanced trade partnership”, which is aimed at concluding a free trade agreement by next year. The leaders also looked forward to the upcoming visit of the UK carrier strike group led by the HMS Queen Elizabeth to India and the deepening of the bilateral strategic partnership.They had an extensive discussion on issues related to climate change in the context of the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November. Modi conveyed India’s commitment to climate action, as reflected in New Delhi’s ambitious target for expanding renewable energy and the new National Hydrogen Mission. Johnson “underlined the importance of making concrete progress on climate change ahead of and at the upcoming COP26 Summit”, and noted that India already leads the world in renewable technology. Johnson also expressed his hope that India “will commit to a more ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution and to achieving Net Zero emissions”, the readout said.The UK announced last week that it will begin accepting India’s vaccine certificates from October 11, ending a travel row that resulted in British nationals facing a 10-day mandatory quarantine on arrival even if they are fully vaccinated.British high commissioner Alex Ellis has said there will be “no quarantine” for Indian travellers who were fully vaccinated with Covishield or any other UK-approved vaccine||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-modi-johnson-phone-call-india-uk-back-global-approach-to-engaging-taliban-101633946105450.html
12-10-2021||India||Five soldiers killed in J&K encounter with terrorists||Five soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), were killed in an exchange of fire with heavily armed terrorists in a forested area at Surankote in Jammu and Kashmir’s (J&K) Poonch district on Monday amid a spike in violence in the region.Three other gunfights were reported on Monday in Kashmir — while two terrorists were killed and a policeman was injured in encounters in Anantnag and Bandipora, a gun battle was on till late on Monday in Shopian. The latest casualties are the worst security forces have suffered in anti-insurgency operations in J&K this year.The exchange of fire in Poonch was triggered during a cordon and search operation that was launched early on Monday morning following intelligence inputs about the presence of around four to five terrorists in the forested area near the Line of Control (LoC), or the de facto border between India and Pakistan, in J&K.“In ensuing firefight during the ongoing encounter with terrorists, a JCO and four soldiers of Indian Army suffered critical injuries. The critically injured were evacuated to the nearest medical facility but they succumbed to their injuries,” said army spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand. He added that additional reinforcements have been rushed to the area.October, just before the onset of winter, usually sees an increase in infiltration attempts with handlers of the terrorists in Pakistan trying to get more of them into India before traversing the already inhospitable terrain becomes almost impossible.Those killed in the incident were identified as Jaswinder Singh, Mandeep Singh, Gajjan Singh, Saraj Singh and Vaisakh H, the army said.The last time security forces suffered significant casualties was in May 2020 when five of their personnel, including a Colonel and a Major, were killed in an 18-hour anti-insurgency operation in the Handwara area of Kashmir valley.Earlier in the day, security forces launched a cordon and search operation at Khagund in Anantnag district’s Verinag area following intelligence inputs, an official said. The search operation turned into an encounter after the terrorists opened fire on the security forces, who retaliated, he said. One terrorist was killed in the gunfight and a policeman was injured.In another gun battle, which broke out at Gundjahangir in Bandipora district’s Hajin area, a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist was killed. “Killed terrorist has been identified as Imtiyaz Ahmad Dar affiliated with proscribed terror outfit LeT (TRF). He was involved in recent civilian killing at Shahgund Bandipora,” inspector general of police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar tweeted.TRF, or The Resistance Front, is an offshoot of LeT that has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on civilians and minorities in the state in recent days.Late on Monday, an encounter broke out in the Tulran area of Shopian district of Jammu and Kashmir between terrorists and security forces. The gunfight was on till late on Monday and a video clip showed army jawans asking the terrorists to surrender through an announcement system.The fresh casualties come after a series of targeted attacks left seven civilians dead in the Valley this month.Four terrorists associated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested for the killing of Mohammad Shafi Lone in Kashmir’s Bandipora district, officials said Sunday. At least 500 people have been detained in connection with the string of civilian killings in the Valley, the officials said.Kashmir has been restive after the murders of seven people, in separate incidents, since October 3. Lone, the president of a taxi drivers’ union in Bandipora, was shot dead on October 5. The Centre has sent Intelligence Bureau’s counter-terror chief Tapan Deka to the Valley to oversee the operations.Security forces have had exchanges of fire with terrorists in adjoining Rajouri district’s Daddal, Pangai, and Karyote this year after a brief lull in violence amid a decline in infiltration from across the LoC.J&K Police chief Dilbag Singh said in August that infiltration resumed after a brief lull following a renewed truce deal between the India and Pakistani directors general of military operations (DGMOs) in February. He added that terror camps across the border remained intact.The DGMOs on February 25 announced the two countries agreed to strictly observe the ceasefire along the LoC.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-s-jco-4-soldiers-killed-in-encounter-with-terrorists-in-jammu-101633940473121.html
12-10-2021||India||Next phase of Quad’s naval drills to kick off in Bay of Bengal today||India, the United States, Japan and Australia will kick off the second phase of this year’s Malabar naval drills in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, with the exercise seeking to build on the synergy, coordination and interoperability developed during the first phase held in August, the Indian Navy said in a statement. The second phase, to be held from October 12-15, will focus on advanced surface and anti-submarine warfare exercises, seamanship evolution and weapon firings, it said. The navies of the Quad nations conducted the first phase of the drills near the Pacific Ocean island of Guam from August 26 to 29. It involved destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters, long-range maritime patrol aircraft and elite special forces elements, including US Navy SEALs and Indian Navy’s marine commandos, also know as MARCOS. The Indian Navy will participate in the second phase with INS Ranvijay, INS Satpura, P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft and a submarine, the statement said. The US Navy will be represented by aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, and two destroyers, USS Lake Champlain and USS Stockdale. Japan will be represented by JS Kaga and JS Murasame, while the Royal Australian Navy will be represented by HMAS Ballarat and HMAS Sirius. India is also preparing to conduct its first tri-service exercise with the United Kingdom in the Arabian Sea in October, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Royal Navy will send a carrier strike group, led by HMS Queen Elizabeth, for the drills that will be conducted from October 21 to 27. So far, India has conducted tri-service drills with two other countries – the US and Russia. Earlier, the Quad navies carried out drills in November 2020 in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. China has been monitoring the activities of the Quad countries. Beijing has been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan. These suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean region, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in the South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. Last November, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said a “great power competition” was playing out in the Indian Ocean region, where the Indian Navy has stepped up surveillance to check China’s ambitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-navies-set-to-kick-off-2nd-phase-of-malabar-drills-101633935786044.html
12-10-2021||India||Breakdown in talks as China refuses to budge||The 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in eastern Ladakh reached an impasse on Sunday, with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.“During the meeting, the Indian side made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas, but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals. The meeting thus did not result in resolution of the remaining areas (friction points),” the Indian Army said in a statement on Monday.China, meanwhile, accused India of “unreasonable and unrealistic demands” in an unusually aggressive statement.Also Read| On LAC, China’s intent is clearThe Chinese statement issued on Monday quoted Western Theatre Command spokesperson Colonel Long Shaohua as saying that China made “…great efforts to promote the easing and cooling of the border situation and fully demonstrated its sincerity in order to maintain the overall situation of the relations between the two militaries”, but “India still insisted on the unreasonable and unrealistic demands, which made the negotiations more difficult”.The statements of the two armies are among the strongest since talks began, and may well indicate that there is a stalemate.The focus of the ongoing talks is to cool tensions at Hot Springs and Depsang, as reported by Hindustan Times. Disengagement of soldiers deployed at Hot Springs was on the agenda for the 13th round of talks.The outcome of the latest round of talks is disappointing as PP-15 (Hot Springs) appeared relatively easier to resolve and would have shown some move forward to break the deadlock, former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said.“Unfortunately, the tenor of statements, particularly from the Chinese side, indicates that there is a hardening of position. Perhaps with the infrastructure developments and capability build-up on their side, PLA feels it can hold on to its current positions and has, therefore, adopted a stronger negotiating stance,” Hooda said. “This will obviously lead to an extended period of tension along the LAC (Line of Actual Control).”The two sides, however, agreed to maintain communications and ensure stability on the ground. “It is our expectation that the Chinese side will take into account the overall perspective of bilateral relations and will work towards early resolution of the remaining issues while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols,” the Indian statement said.The two armies on Sunday held talks to resolve problems at frictions points on the contested LAC in eastern Ladakh where India and China have been locked in a border standoff for over 17 months.The meeting between India’s Ladakh Corps Commander and Chinese South Xinjiang military district commander took place on Sunday on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border.The talks came against the backdrop of massive military buildup and infrastructure development by PLA across LAC, where the Indian Army has matched the Chinese moves.At the 13th round of talks between corps commanders, the Indian side told PLA that the situation along the LAC was caused by the latter’s unilateral attempts to alter the status quo in violation of bilateral agreements. The Chinese were also told to take appropriate steps at the remaining friction points to restore peace and tranquillity along LAC in the western sector.“This would also be in accord with the guidance provided by the two foreign ministers in their recent meeting in Dushanbe, where they had agreed that the two sides should resolve the remaining issues at the earliest. The Indian side emphasised such resolution of the remaining areas would facilitate progress in the bilateral relations,” said the statement by the Indian Army. Its reference was to the September 16meeting between Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.The military dialogue took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, one of the flashpoints on the LAC, in early August.Also Read| LAC and the India-China stalemateIn February, the two armies pulled back troops and weaponry from Pangong Tso. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, they still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry in eastern Ladakh.If the Chinese army is to stay in Ladakh, so is the Indian Army, army chief General Naravane said on Saturday, flagging India’s concern about the continuing Chinese buildup in the theatre.The 13th round of talks followed a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the border in north-east India’s Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang around a fortnight ago, and another incursion by the Chinese in Uttarakhand in northern India on August 30.China’s resolve to safeguard national sovereignty is firm, said Long, the Chinese colonel.India should cherish the hard-won situation in the China-India border areas and abide by relevant agreements and consensus between the two countries and the two militaries, he said in the statement cited earlier.Long said China hopes “India will show sincerity, take actions and work with China to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border areas”.Ahead of Sunday’s talks, Chinese official media and social media handles had renewed their shrill propaganda, blaming India for the border tension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-rejects-indian-proposals-to-cool-lac-tensions-no-breakthrough-in-talks-101633927564376.html
