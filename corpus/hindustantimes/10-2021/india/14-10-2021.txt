This will be the second time that the Indian side will come face-to-face with Taliban representatives at a Moscow Format meeting since 2018, and also the second formal contact between the two sides since the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. India has so far held off on any formal recognition of the Taliban setup in Kabul, with New Delhi saying there are questions about its legitimacy as it is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations. ‚ÄúWe have received an invitation for the Moscow Format meeting on Afghanistan on October 20. We will be participating in it,‚Äù external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a weekly news briefing. There is no confirmation on who will attend the meeting but India is likely to be represented by a joint secretary from the external affairs ministry, he said. India participated in the second meeting under the Moscow Format in November 2018 at a ‚Äúnon-official level‚Äù, sending retired ambassadors TCA Raghavan and Amar Sinha to represent the country. That meeting was attended by a five-member Taliban delegation led by Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, a key player in the group‚Äôs political office in Qatar and the current deputy foreign minister. Stanekzai also met India‚Äôs ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, at the Indian embassy in Doha on August 31, the first officially acknowledged contact between the two sides. The Moscow Format was launched in 2017 as a six-party mechanism for consultations between representatives of Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and Russia. Russia also started the ‚Äúextended troika‚Äù dialogue on Afghanistan that includes the US, China and Pakistan. This will be the first meeting of the Moscow Format since the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Russia and the Central Asian states have concerns about terrorism and instability spilling over from Afghanistan. Russia is particularly concerned about the activities of Islamic State on Afghan soil. The world community has mounted pressure on the Taliban to deliver on its commitments regarding human rights and counter-terrorism even as it tries to fashion a response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Bagchi didn‚Äôt give a direct response to a question on India providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan but reiterated New Delhi‚Äôs call for the world community to create the ‚Äúbest possible enabling environment‚Äù, including unimpeded and unrestricted access for aid providers and non-discriminatory distribution of aid. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs policy towards Afghanistan is guided by our friendship with the Afghan people. We have in the past provided assistance both for infrastructure as well as humanitarian [needs],‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-participate-in-moscow-format-dialogue-on-afghanistan-101634236132269.html

As reported, there have been primarily three findings from Aryan's WhatApp chats.First, the 6 gram charas that was found on Arbaaz Merchant was for the consumption of Arbaaz and Aryan, the NCB has claimed.

The coal minister added they have been supplying 2 million tonnes of coal since Wednesday, indicating the situation is headed towards improvement.‚ÄúClosure of some coal mines and inundation of a few others due to monsoon led to the hindrance in coal supply to power plants,‚Äù news agency PTI quoted Joshi as saying."We can produce two million tonnes of coal per day," he added, acknowledging there is a need to produce more coal.The minister also paid a visit to the Ashoka mine of the Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) at Piparwar in Chatra district of Jharkhand. After the visit, he said the power plants in the country will continue to receive the required amount of coal. Joshi also held discussions with officials of CCL and Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) on the prevailing situation. Apart from holding discussion on the coal crisis, the minister also discussed the issue related to the availability of land for mining at the meeting, PTI reported.Many states in the past few days have given power cut warnings if the coal crisis doesn't improve. While load shedding is already taking place in Karnaraka's capital city Bengaluru, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming that power generation was being affected and requested him to intervene in the matter. Shortly after, the Ministry of Coal said there was ample coal available in the country to meet the demand for power plants.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-shortage-was-due-to-monsoons-pralhad-joshi-101634213491977.html
14-10-2021||India||India backs WHO move for new expert group to probe origins of Covid-19 pandemic||India on Thursday backed the World Health Organization (WHO)‚Äôs decision to create an expert group to examine the origins of new pathogens, including the Coronavirus that causes Covid-19, and said all countries should cooperate with the probe. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the launch of the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) at a news briefing on Wednesday, and Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO‚Äôs health emergencies programme, said this represented the ‚Äúlast chance‚Äù to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2. India has consistently backed all moves by WHO to establish the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, and called on all stakeholders, including China, to cooperate with such efforts. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi reiterated this position when he was asked about the new expert group at a regular news briefing on Thursday. ‚ÄúLet me just reiterate what we have stated till now ‚Äì we have our interest in further studies and data on this issue of the origin [of the Coronavirus] and the need for understanding and cooperation by all concerned,‚Äù he said, without naming China. The Indian side, he said, was gathering details of what the new move by WHO would entail. Raman Gangakhedkar, the Dr CG Pandit National Chair at the Indian Council of Medical Research in India, and Yungui Yang of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, are among the 26 members of SAGO. Responding to WHO‚Äôs announcement, China warned against any ‚Äúpolitical manipulation‚Äù of the renewed probe into the origins of Covid-19 but said it would support the investigation. The Coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, triggering the worst pandemic in a century. Asked about the new probe, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said it should be conducted in the ‚Äúspirit of science‚Äù and not used as a political tool. The result of the previous study on the matter should be respected, he added. ‚ÄúChina will continue to support and participate in international Coronavirus origins -tracing, yet opposes any form of political manipulation on the issue,‚Äù Zhao told a news briefing in Beijing. He added, ‚ÄúChina has always maintained that tracing of virus origins is a serious and complex scientific issue and that research should be conducted by scientists in cooperation.‚Äù Tedros said SAGO will advise WHO on developing a global framework to guide studies into ‚Äúorigins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2‚Äù. He said that while SARS-CoV-2 is the latest virus to spark a pandemic, ‚Äúit will not be the last‚Äù. Ryan noted the current pandemic ‚Äúhas stopped our whole world‚Äù and said the expert group ‚Äúmay be our last chance to understand the origins of this virus in a...collective and mutually responsible way‚Äù. He urged everyone, including countries, to create space for discussions on the issue. Maria van Kerkhove, WHO‚Äôs technical lead on Covid-19, said the expert group is expected to call for further studies in China by international missions. ‚ÄúI anticipate that the SAGO in its discussions about the urgent next steps for understanding the origins of the current pandemic will recommend further studies in China and potentially elsewhere...We very much hope that there will be further missions to China and other countries,‚Äù she said. The 26 members of SAGO were selected from more than 700 applications following a global call. Tedros said they were chosen for their world-class expertise and experience in a range of disciplines, and geographic and gender diversity. There will be a two-week public consultation period for WHO to receive feedback on the proposed members. China has dismissed theories that the Coronavirus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan and has said no more visits by international experts are needed. A WHO-led team spent four weeks in and around Wuhan this year with Chinese scientists, and said in a joint report in March that the Coronavirus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, but further research was needed. Tedros has said this investigation was hampered by a dearth of raw data pertaining to the first days of the Covid-19 outbreak and called for laboratory audits. Van Kerkhove said ‚Äúmore than three dozen recommended studies‚Äù must still be carried out to determine how the Coronavirus crossed from animal species to humans. Reported Chinese testing for antibodies in Wuhan residents in 2019 will be ‚Äúabsolutely critical‚Äù to understanding the virus‚Äôs origins, she said. WHO, in an editorial in Science, said detailed investigations of the earliest known and suspected cases in China prior to December 2019 are still needed, including analyses of stored blood samples from 2019 in Wuhan and retrospective searches of hospital and mortality data for earlier cases. Labs in the area where the first reports of human infections emerged in Wuhan must be a focus, as ruling out an accident requires sufficient evidence, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-who-move-for-new-expert-group-to-probe-origins-of-covid-19-pandemic-101634221548272.html

India says it will attend||The ministry of external affairs on Thursday said India will participate in the Moscow Format meeting on October 20, the first after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The participation will be at the joint secretary level, the ministry has confirmed. This will be the second time New Delhi will be face to face with the Taliban after the group toppled the Ashraf Ghani government in a coup on August 15, and the first meeting after the Taliban announced its Cabinet.Moscow Format is a negotiation mechanism established in 2017 to address the issues of Afghanistan. It includes countries like Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Iran and India. The United States too had participated in Moscow Format before. This is not the first time that the Taliban will be invited to the platform, but the first time after they have their government in Afghanistan.At G20 special summit on Afghanistan, PM Modi calls for inclusive administration in KabulAmid international appeal for an inclusive government in Afghanistan, Russia has decided to continue its Moscow Format. The Taliban too are looking for international recognition while the countries are buying time before recognising the Taliban government in Afghanistan.On international platforms, India has clarified its stance that it will stand by the Afghan people. PM Modi has urged the international community to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism.The first official contact between New Delhi and the Taliban was on August 31 when the ambassador of India to Qatar, Deepak Mittar, met Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of Taliban's political office in Doha. That meeting took place at the Embassy of India in Doha at the request of the Taliban side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-moscow-format-after-taliban-takeover-on-oct-20-india-says-it-will-attend-101634219423530.html
14-10-2021||India||Amid opposition, Adani Group takes charge of Thiruvananthapuram airport||Amid opposition by a section of airport staff as well as the ruling LDF government in Kerala, the Adani Group has taken charge of the operation and management of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on Thursday.‚ÄúConnecting lives with cherished travel experiences, we are pleased to share that #Thiruvananthapuram Airport is now a #GatewayToGoodness. We are privileged to serve and welcome passengers to God‚Äôs Own Country filled with lush greenery, beautiful beaches, and exquisite cuisine,‚Äù the group said in a tweet, both in English and Malayalam, after the takeover. The CPI (M)-led state government had tried its best to stall the takeover and last year the state assembly had passed a unanimous resolution against it. Its petition questioning the takeover was rejected by all courts. But Congress MP from the state capital Shashi Tharoor has hailed the move and said it will help develop the airport and increase its connectivity. In February 2019, the government-owned Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) participated in the open bidding for the airport but Adani Enterprises won it with the highest bid. Adani group offered to pay a fee of Rs. 168 per passenger, followed by KSIDC at ‚Çπ135 and GMR Group at ‚Çπ63. Though KSIDC was also given a 10% discount since it was a government entity, Adani quoted more than 30% to win the bid. After losing the bid, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him not to hand over the airport to a private entity, citing the successful public-private partnership model of Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) and Kannur airports. He said the state deserved preferential consideration over a private group, taking into account its experience in running two airports.

Earlier, he went to Delhi to delay procurement of paddy and now this... If you are deploying the BSF in Punjab it shows your motive to impose governor rule.‚ÄùHis comment was in response to Amarinder Singh praising the decision of the Union government to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) to conduct searches, arrest suspects and make seizures up to an area of 50km (which was 15km earlier) inside the Indian territory from the International Border with Pakistan and Bangladesh.Also read | Centre raises BSF's area of jurisdiction, Punjab CM wants decision rolled backCalling it the height of irresponsibility, Singh‚Äôs media advisor Raveen Thukral quoted the former as saying that Pargat Singh and his close ally Navjot Singh Sidhu had nothing better to do than cooking up ‚Äúridiculous stories for cheap publicity‚Äù.‚ÄúThis is the height of irresponsibility from a state minister. You and @sherryontopp are clearly birds of the same feather, with nothing better to do than cook up ridiculous stories for cheap publicity.‚Äô: @capt_amarinder to Pargat Singh @INCPunjab @INCIndia‚Äù.Amarinder Singh also slammed Congress leader Randeep Surjewala who said the former did not write about increasing the BSF‚Äôs jurisdiction in Punjab while in the CM‚Äôs chair.Days after resigning as the chief minister following months of tussle over leadership issue within the Congress, Singh met Union home minister Amit Shah amid speculations that he might switch over to the BJP.¬†While he made it clear that he would not join the saffron camp, he said he would definitely leave the Congress having suffered adequate humiliation within the grand old party.¬†He said Surjewala, who could not an election even in his own state, did not have any right to speak on national issues.‚ÄòHow ridiculous!

The development comes as India ‚Äì the world's second largest coal producer, and among the fourth largest reserves ‚Äì battles one of its worst power supply deficits in years. However, the company assured that it is only a temporary move till the situation stabilises."This is only a temporary prioritisation, in the interest of the Nation, to tide over the low coal stock situation at the stressed power plants and scale up supplies to them," the source, familiar with Coal India's plan was quoted as saying by Reuters.The company has not issued any official comment on the same.With India's economic reopening after the prolonged virus-infused lockdown, India has witnessed a surge in power demand to above pre-pandemic levels. This means state-run Coal India's supplies were no longer enough.Coal India said it had stopped all online auctions of coal except those meant for the power sector. Additionally, most of India's 135 coal-fired power plants have fuel stocks of less than three days.The government has even asked power producers in the country to import up to 10% of their coal needs amid fuel shortages in various states. The Centre also warned states against sale of electricity on power exchanges to cash in on surging prices, asserting that federal companies will curb their power supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-india-temporarily-halts-supply-to-customers-outside-power-sector-101634214426065.html

14-10-2021||India||Govt rejigs fertiliser-subsidy regime to continue offering crop nutrients at below-market rates||The Union government has revamped parts of its subsidy regime for fertilisers and crop nutrients to continue providing them at below-market rates, while rolling over special discounts announced for the summer-sown season to the oncoming winter-sown months, according to an official statement on Thursday. International prices of raw materials for some key crop nutrients such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and 22 grades of P&K fertilisers have been increasing for over 18 months, trade data show. Most of these fertilisers have seen a jump of over 50% in prices, forcing the government to expand subsidy. India relies on import of raw materials for crop nutrients as well as finished products and compensates fertiliser companies who sell them at below-inflation rates. Subsidised rates under the so-called nutrient-based subsidy regime -- the mechanism by which the Centre disburses the subsidy to manufacturers ‚Äì will be extended to the winter-sown season at a cost of ‚Çπ28,602 crore, the government‚Äôs calculations show. This means while prices will be allowed to be increased, the roll-over to October 2021 to March 2022 period will keep the retail per kg subsidy rates for a group of nutrients known as nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium unchanged. The second key change is the inclusion of potash-derived from molasses or PDM, a crop nutrient derived from sugarcane waster matter, under the nutrient-based subsidy scheme for the first time. India‚Äôs is the world‚Äôs second-largest cane grower after Brazil. Potash extracted from sugarcane waste will reduce India‚Äôs reliance of 100% import of more than 4.2 million tonne of mineral-based potash, an essential crop nutrient which is critical for India‚Äôs food security. ‚ÄúThis decision will improve the income level of sugarcane growers and sugar mills,‚Äù the official statement said. A ‚Äúspecial one-time package‚Äù for additional subsidy on di-ammonium phosphate or DAP at a projected additional cost of ‚Çπ5,716 crore along with an additional subsidy on three most consumed fertilisers called NPK worth ‚Çπ35115 crore has been approved by the Modi government. The total fertiliser subsidy on account of these new steps could go up to ‚Çπ36,000 crore, an official said. A central team is monitoring availability of fertilisers in the country on a daily basis, according to the official. The government has already directed all the fertilisers companies to ensure the availability of these fertilisers in the market for farmers and sell all old stocks at old prices. ‚ÄúWe expect a nearly 10% increase in fertiliser demand,‚Äù an official of the agriculture ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rejigs-fertiliser-subsidy-regime-to-continue-offering-crop-nutrients-at-below-market-rates-101634216687355.html

In a letter to PM Modi, the Opposition leader of the West Bengal Assembly said the notorious vandals are habituated to targeting the ‚ÄòSanatani‚Äô minority community in Bangladesh.‚ÄúThis time the religious fanatics took to the streets to vandalize several Durga Puja pandals and various temples also. Presently the condition of Sanatani People living in Bangladesh is very miserable,‚Äù he wrote, referring to the term often used to describe Hindu movements.The violent attack on pandals occurred after the alleged desecration of the Quran in Cumilla, a city in the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh, by placing it near the feet of goddess Durga‚Äôs idol at a puja pandal. Citing diplomats in Dhaka and New Delhi, HT earlier reported that the Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) might be behind the attacks with an intention of embarrassing the Sheikh Hasina government.The attacks on pandals mainly took place in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox‚Äôs Bazaar, areas around Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.

14-10-2021||India||Centre mulling making forensics mandatory for serious criminal cases: Amit Shah||Any crime that involves a possible punishment of six years or more needs to necessarily include a forensic investigation, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said in Goa. The minister also indicated that the Union government is considering making it mandatory for such investigation to be conducted. Shah said that forensic evidence strengthens the prosecution‚Äôs hand and can take the conviction rate for criminal cases higher. He was speaking an event to lay the foundation stone for the Goa campus of the National Forensic Science University. ‚ÄúWe are trying to focus on ensuring that there should be compulsory visits of the forensic science team in all crimes where the punishment is more than six years (serious crimes). If we achieve this then in more than 600 districts across the country, one forensic science laboratory, even if small, will have to be set up along with a mobile forensic van,‚Äù Shah said. ‚ÄúIf we have to do this then we will need 30,000 to 40,000 forensic scientists. From where will we get them? On the one hand there is unemployment; on the other hand skilled manpower is not there. If we are to bridge this then education and skilling is the way forward. Which is why we are setting up the forensic science university,‚Äù Shah added. ‚ÄúThe wrongdoer can be brought to justice only when the conviction ratio rises and when the people can rest assured that he will spend a long time in jail. This can happen only when the conviction rate climbs higher. This can happen when the prosecutor has in his hands scientific evidence. The concept had come to our country, even the labs came but there was a shortage of manpower so cases were dragging on and on,‚Äù he added. Shah is in Goa to lay the foundation stone for the Goa campus of the National Forensic Science University which he said will help staff forensic labs across the country ten years from now. ‚ÄúThis is a big gift for the youth of Goa. In this campus, forensic science in general, forensic chemistry, toxicology, biotechnology, fingerprint, DNA science, financial crimes investigation, cyber-security analysis, digital forensic science and wildlife forensic science courses will be available. I call on science stream students from the state to take up these courses,‚Äù Shah said. ‚ÄúNot only for students and children -- police officers, judicial officers and people related to cyber-security and private security researchers will also have the option for diploma courses,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI know that Goa is a small state. But if you look for the number of sailors across the country, you will find that most of them are from Goa. Most of the sailors of the country come from Goa. So I wish to say that in ten years‚Äô time there should be a situation where most of the forensic scientists from across the country come from Goa,‚Äù he added. Shah called on the institute to also offer Goa-specific courses that can tackle issues like tourist security, drugs, narcotics, coastal policing etc. ‚ÄúLook at Goa‚Äôs crime situation as a tourist hub and you need to make some courses ready for tourist security, a suitable centre also needs to be set up for drugs and narcotics and for coastal policing too a centre of the NFSU unit needs to be set up,‚Äù he added. The college is not only for Goa but law enforcement agencies from across west India and neighbouring Karnataka who could use its expertise, he said. The courses at the college will start immediately, the minister informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-mulling-making-forensics-mandatory-for-serious-criminal-cases-amit-shah-101634214106914.html

He claimed that rumours regarding the recovery of ganja and drugs were spread by the anti-drug agency despite none of it was recovered from his son-in-law's possession. The Maharashtra minister said they are moving court against the agency, the harassment meted out to them, and for quashing the case."BJP leaders have been targeting me by saying that I am defaming the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to take revenge over the arrest of my son-in-law. Since the last press conference, which was held on October 9, I have been getting threatening calls. This is why the state government upgraded my security," news agency ANI quoted Malik as saying during a press conference on Thursday."The NCB had arrested my son-in-law (Sameer Khan) earlier in July. When his house was raided by the NCB, there was no recovery but still there were rumours that ganja and drugs were recovered. It was done by NCB to defame me," he said."Hearing Khan's bail application, the court released him in September. My whole family including my daughter was in trauma," he added.Nawab Malik, in his presser on October 9, claimed that the NCB had initially detained 11 persons from a Goa-bound cruise ship off Mumbai coast, but let off three of them, including the brother-in-law of BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya, a couple of hours later. He also termed the NCB's raid on the cruise as "fake, planned and conspired to defame the film industry and the Maharashtra government".

The bail plea came up for hearing on Wednesday but as NCB counsel Anil Singh could not finish his argument on Wednesday, the hearing resumed on Thursday. As the court heard both the parties, it reserved the order for October 20, which means Aryan Khan will have to spend this week too in judicial custody. Aryan has now completed his isolation period in Arthur Road jail and has now been moved with other inmates.Aryan Khan regular consumer of drugs, says NCB; compares with Rhea-Showik caseWhat happened during Thursday's hearingThe NCB opposed Aryan Khan's bail plea and said that Aryan Khan can't be granted bail as bail has nothing to do with the quantity of drugs recovered from him. NCB counsel Anil Singh said Aryan is a regular consumer of drugs, his WhatsApp interaction has revealed. The fact that he was not found with drugs is immaterial as there are some provisions in the NDPS Act where the recovery of drugs is not at all crucial, he said.¬†"Innocent until proven guilty doesn't apply in the cases of NDPS offences. In the NDPS Act, the presumption is of culpable a mental state, and it is for the accused to prove that he was not in possession during the trial," Singh said.He also submitted that the NCB will ultimately find out how all the arrested are connected to each other and will establish a case of conspiracy. "This isn't a case of bail at this state. It can be considered at an appropriate stage," he said.'In the land of Mahatma Gandhi': NCB's 5 points opposing Aryan Khan's bail pleaCountering NCB's arguments regarding Aryan Khan's WhatsApp chat, his lawyer Amit Desai said the context of the WhatsApp chats is important as casual conversations between friends on WhatsApp may appear suspicious. He also said that Aryan Khan was overseas for a while where a lot of these things are legitimate.Regarding a WhatsApp chat ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs have a blast' apparently exchanged between Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant, Amit Desai said, ‚ÄúToday's generation has a means of communication, which is English...not the Queen's English‚Ä¶it's sometimes what the older generation will call torture.

"I disagree. This is our future generation. The entire country will be depending on them. This is not what our freedom fighters in the land of Mahatma Gandhi envisioned," Anil Singh said.> NCB officers are working day and night to fight the drug menace. They also get beaten up when they are on the duty, Singh said.> On the specific case of Aryan Khan, Singh said Aryan Khan should not be granted bail as he is part of the conspiracy. He was aware of the possession of drugs.> Aryan Khan is not a first-time consumer of drugs. Referring to his WhatsApp chats, the NCB said that he has been a regular consumer of drugs and the 6 gram charas found from Arbaaz Merchant was for their consumption.> Referring to the Rhea Chakraborty-Showik Chakraborty case, Singh said that the quantity does not always matter, as Rhea Chakraborty's brother Showik Chakraborty was also not found in possession of drugs.On Wednesday, Aryan Khan's lawyer Amit Desai argued that the judicial system should not penalise the ‚Äúkids‚Äù in bail. They are some young kids, Amit Desai said, adding that they should not be considered drug peddlers, racketeers or traffickers.

14-10-2021||India||Farmers blame black marketing, hoarding of fertilizer as MP govt preps to invoke NSA||Farmers looted bags of DAP (diammonium phosphate) fertilizer from a warehouse in the third such incident in Chambal division of Madhya Pradesh in the last five days, police said. There is an acute shortage of urea, especially in the northern parts of the state just before the winter crop sowing season and farmers are becoming desperate, they added. The farmers in the region have also resorted to blocking roads, demanding distribution of urea. Most of the warehouses are almost empty and the supply is not in consonance with the demand, said local government officials. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said there was no shortage of fertilizer in the state. MP requires 4 lakh tonnes of urea for the Rabi season and the state has already received 2.5 lakh tonne, the CM said.State home minister Narottam Mishra, however, said the administration is receiving reports of illegal hoarding and supply of sub-standard fertilizers in DAP bags and the government has decided to invoke the stringent national security act (NSA) against the businessman for black marketing and illegal hoarding of fertiliser. On Monday farmers, who were waiting in the queue in grain market in Sabalgarh in Morena, looted more than 50 bags of fertilizer from a truck, police said. Police said a group of farmers stole fertilizer bags from warehouses of cooperative societies in Fup and Mehgaon area of Bhind in two separate incidents. An FIR has been registered only in one of these cases, police said.State officials and experts said the major reasons behind the crisis are changes in crop pattern, black marketing and farmers defaulting on loan repayments. Farmers are eligible for fertilizer from the government at subsidised rates only if they have repaid loans. Agriculture expert Vinayak Tomar said: ‚ÄúNearly 61% of total mustard production of the state takes place in Morena, Bhind, Sheopur and Gwalior. With the sudden increase in the price of mustard from ‚Çπ4,800 per quintal to ‚Çπ8,000/per quintal, many farmers, who used to sow wheat and bajra, have started sowing mustard for winter crop also. Mid-September and October is the best time for sowing mustard so the demand for urea has increased suddenly. Earlier, there was a balance as for wheat, farmers need fertilizer by the end of October and in November.‚ÄùThen there is black marketing.‚ÄúThe (state) agriculture department gives fertilizers to cooperative societies according to the agricultural land of registered farmers. There is a ban on open sale of fertilizers from the societies to stop black-marketing in UP and Rajasthan (the fertilizer from the state is illegally shipped there). Similarly, societies are not providing fertilizers to defaulter farmers, who have not cleared their loans,‚Äù said Shiv Mangal Singh, former president of district cooperative bank in Morena. He added that private shops have stock of urea that are being sold at a premium of ‚Çπ200-300 for a 50 kg bag. In the past two days, Gwalior and Morena district administration raided warehouses of two traders and recovered more than 200 bags, which were being hoarded. A resident of Gurema village in Morena, Shankar Singh Jadon, 62, said, ‚ÄúThis is the peak season of sowing and I am standing in queue daily for the past 15 days and I received only two bags for my three acres of land. At one time, the society manager is providing only two bags to a farmer. In the (open) market, the same bag is being sold at ‚Çπ1500. The government is promoting black marketing.‚ÄùAnother farmer from Gormi in Bhind, Ran Singh Narwariya, said, ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt find urea on time, sowing will be affected. The state government is compelling us either to borrow money to purchase the fertilizer in black or steal it from the warehouse.‚ÄùMP Kisan Congress president Dinesh Gurjar said, ‚ÄúThe government should make fertilizer available within a week or we will intensify our protest.‚Äù On Tuesday, Chouhan instructed all the collectors to ensure a smooth supply of fertilizers to farmers.Farmers‚Äô welfare and agricultural minister Kamal Patel said, ‚ÄúThere is no crisis of fertilizer (availability) in MP and it is being supplied smoothly. Some defaulting farmers are creating a ruckus but we are ensuring that they get DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate) bags at subsidized rates from the market. We are also conducting raids to stop the hoarding of fertilizers‚Äù.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-blame-black-marketing-hoarding-of-fertilizer-as-mp-govt-preps-to-invoke-nsa-101634208466250.html

Earlier he went to Delhi to make a delay in paddy procurement and now this... If you are deploying BSF in Punjab it shows your motive to impose governor rule...,‚Äù news agency ANI quoted Pargat Singh as saying.‚ÄúI want to appeal to the Union home minister to not take Punjab in different directions for the 2022 and 2024 elections. We will not allow anyone to make Punjab communal,‚Äù Singh added, referring to the assembly polls scheduled to be held in the state next year and the general elections later.On Wednesday, Amarinder Singh extended his support to the move and urged people not to drag central armed forces into politics. ‚ÄúOur soldiers are being killed in Kashmir.

These include, for example, tribes such as Onge and Jarawa, researchers said.¬†Both the tribes are isolated from the population on mainland India, as these are found on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Speaking about the research, Professor Gyaneshwer Chaubey of the BHU, who co-led the exercise with CSIR‚Äôs Kumarasamy Thangaraj, said, ‚ÄúThere might be some speculations on the effects on Covid-19 among isolated populations. However, for the first time, we used genomic data to study the risk of the infection on 227 isolated Indian populations. It was found that the ones which carry long homozygous segments in their genome are highly susceptible to Covid-19.‚ÄùThe team investigated the high-density genomic data of more than 1600 people across these 227 groups. Among these, high frequency for Covid-19 risk alleles (gene) was found among the Onge and Jarawa tribes.Besides these, the other groups found on here are the Great Andamanese and Sentinels.‚ÄúThe study noted that these inhabitants live in protected areas and the general public is not allowed to interact with them. However, after seeing the number of cases among the islanders, it can be said that they are at greater risk mainly from illegal intruders and health workers. The total census of this population is less than 1000 in number,‚Äù Chaubey, who teaches molecular anthropology at BHU, further said.On Thursday, two more people tested positive for coronavirus in the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar, pushing the cumulative tally to 7637, according to a health department bulletin. This includes 7499 recoveries and nine active cases, while the toll remained unchanged at 129.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolated-populations-of-india-are-at-higher-risk-of-covid-19-study-finds-101634201424692.html
14-10-2021||India||WPI inflation eases to 10.66% in September on lower food prices||India‚Äôs headline wholesale price inflation for September rose 10.66% from a year ago, a six-month low, signalling cooling prices, government data showed on Thursday. The key gauge of producer prices in September, however, remained in double-digits. In August, wholesale inflation was 11.39%. The easing of wholesale prices was led by a decline in prices of food articles, especially vegetables. Fuel and power category prices rose slightly at a slower pace to stand at 24.81% in September from a year ago, compared with a 26.09% rise in August. Prices of manufactured goods, the biggest component in the WPI basket, rose 11.41%, marginally lower than August‚Äôs 11.39%. Price rise is a key determinant of monetary policies. Moderate inflation helps the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low to spur economic activity hit by the pandemic. The slide in prices was largely driven by declining food prices at the wholesale level, which can pressure farm incomes. Inflation, or the rate at which prices rise, of food articles, dropped by nearly 5%, Thursday‚Äôs data showed. Vegetable inflation fell by 32.5%. Within horticulture items, wholesale onion rates saw a 1.9% decline in September, after a sharp rise of 62.8% in August from a year ago. Data released on October 12 showed retail inflation eased in September. The Retail inflation rate, as measured by the widely watched consumer price index, stood at 4.35% in September 2021. In August consumer prices rose 5.3%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/september-wholesale-inflation-cools-to-six-month-low-at-1066-101634201267656.html

In the case of Showik Chakraborty, the brother of Rhea Chakraborty, there was no recovery. But the court at that time said that the matter was being investigated, Anil Singh said.¬†"The record and the evidence before your honour shows that he is a regular consumer of contraband for last few years. The contraband in possession of Arbaz Merchant who accompanied Khan was for the consumption of both of them," Anil Singh said as he continued his argument opposing the bail plea on Thursday.Aryan Khan drugs case hearing to continue today. Here's where things standThe agency in its reply to the bail plea, which was submitted in front of the special NDPS court on Wednesday, said the quantity of the recovery is immaterial as the initial probe has revealed that Aryan Khan is a regular consumer of drugs and used to procure through Arbaaz Merchant."There are provisions in the NDPS Act which have got nothing to do with quantity so that can not be the argument to say that the punishment is only for a year. Once the connection is established, then the quantity is not important. My submission is that this is not a case for grant of bail," Anil Singh said.The NCB counsel also said that the "innocent until proven guilty" does not apply in the cases of NDPS offences. "In the NDPS Act, the presumption is of culpable a mental state, and it is for the accused to prove that he was not in possession during the trial," Anil Singh said.As he argued on Wednesday, Anil Singh had said Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant are friends and they know each other for years. Though no drug was found from Aryan Khan, he knew about the possession. His WhatsApp chats revealed references to ‚Äòbulk quantity‚Äô, which can not be for individual consumption, the NCB counsel said accusing Aryan Khan of illicit drug trafficking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-regular-consumer-of-drugs-says-ncb-compares-with-rhea-showik-case-101634200726833.html

In the 10-second-long video, which is being shared widely on social media, Pragya Thakur is seen playing a round of kabaddi with local players at a Kali temple in Bhopal. Pragya Thakur was reportedly asked by the players, who were already there, to join them.The video of Pragya Thakur, who is often seen in a wheelchair in public, is from Wednesday. The video has been retweeted by various Congress leaders, who took a jibe at Pragya Thakur, asking about her next appearance with the National Investigation Agency (NIA).This comes just days after another video was posted on Twitter showing Pragya Thakur performing Garba. A controversial figure, she is often targeted over videos showing her dancing at weddings and playing basketball.A member of Parliament from Bhopal, she has been charged for terrorist activities and she is currently out on bail. She has skipped hearings in the Malegaon blast case citing serious injuries because of alleged custodial torture.Pragya Thakur is among the seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case in which six people were killed and 100 others were injured. Pragya Thakur was arrested after it was found that a motorcycle used in the blast was registered in her name. She was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and murder and fanning enmity between communities under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). She was granted bail in 2017 after the special NIA court dropped charges of being a member of a terrorist organisation as well as those under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

Addressing a press conference, Malik also said that his son-in-law Sameer Khan, who was recently granted bail in a drugs case after nine months, will move the high court to seek quashing of charges levelled against him by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Khan was arrested by the NCB in January this year in an alleged drug case. He got bail last month. Apart from the recent drugs bust on board a cruise liner off the Mumbai coast, that led to the arrest of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, the NCB last year investigated a drug case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and several other matters related to narcotics involving high-profile people.Malik last week alleged that the NCB's raid on the cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2 was ‚Äúfake‚Äù, and no narcotic drugs were found during it. On Wednesday, the minister alleged that the ‚ÄúNCB has malafide intentions and is involved in only selective leaks to frame people.‚ÄùHe also said that his security was beefed up after he started getting ‚Äúthreats‚Äù when he raised doubts over the NCB's investigations.Referring to the bail order issued by an NDPS court in connection with the case involving his son-in-law Sameer Khan, Malik said there was ‚Äúno prima facie evidence of a drug syndicate.‚ÄùIt is surprising that an agency like the NCB cannot differentiate between drugs that fall under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and tobacco-related items, the NCP leader said. ‚ÄúIt (NCB) said ganja was seized (in the case involving Sameer Khan), but there was none. I just had to make things clear today after the bail order, since the BJP was targeting me over my son-in-law when I raised issues about the NCB's fake case of the cruise drug party,‚Äù the NCP leader said.Malik also claimed his family faced trauma and stigma due to the NCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-slams-ncb-alleges-malafide-intentions-behind-selective-leaks-to-frame-people-101634198957725.html

Officials said the two are so far not being treated as suspects in the case and that they are assisting the agency in connecting some dots.The ED earlier in August recorded Fernandez‚Äôs statement as she may have been duped by Chandrasekhar. Chandrasekhar, who is lodged in Delhi‚Äôs Rohini jail, is under Delhi Police and ED‚Äôs probe for cheating, conspiracy, and extortion.

He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and was lodged in Rohini Jail. Despite being lodged in jail, Sukesh Chandrashekhar did not stop conning people. He has used technology to his aid and advantage and spoofed calls to dupe people as the numbers reflecting on the seven of the called party were from Government officers and he claimed to be Government officer offering to help people for a price of course. In this case also, Sukesh Chandrasekhar extorted money to the tune of ‚Çπ200 Crores by impersonating Senior Government officials,‚Äù the ED said in the statement. ‚ÄúDuring the search, it was revealed that she (Paul) along with Sukesh Chandrashekhar lead a lavish life in a bungalow in Chennai which is no less than a resort and have various luxury cars including BMW, Range Rover, Mercedes. The house is luxurious sea facing bungalow with home theatre and a fleet of cars and servants.

The announcement came following a series of targeted attacks that left seven civilians dead in the region this month. Displaced Kashmir Pandit employees expressed apprehensions about their postings in far-flung areas after the attacks.Around 3,000 such employees are posted across Kashmir and a bulk of them stay in guarded transit government accommodations. A teacher from Jammu was among the civilians killed in the targeted attacks that prompted many displaced Kashmiri employees to leave the Valley.A statement quoting divisional commissioner (Kashmir) Pundurang K Pole on Wednesday said he has instructed deputy commissioners and senior police superintendents to regularly visit colonies and accommodations of displaced Kashmiris. It added they were being briefed about the security, confidence-building measures, facilities, and other arrangements being put in place for their safety and security. ‚ÄúThe officers have been issued clear cut directions to preferably post these migrant employees in safe and secure zones instead of far-flung and vulnerable areas for the time being.‚ÄùOffice bearers of employees‚Äô unions have visited some of the transit accommodations to express solidarity with the displaced Kashmiri employees.The Centre told Parliament in July that 3,841 displaced Kashmiris have moved back to Kashmir and have taken up jobs across Kashmir under the Prime Minister‚Äôs Rehabilitation Package. It added 6,000 residential units were being constructed for the Kashmir Pandit employees in the Valley and that 1,000 of them have been allotted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/displaced-kashmiri-employees-to-be-posted-in-safer-areas-after-attacks-on-civilians-101634191905159.html

Even after he was released, police repeatedly conducted searches and raids often threatening him with dire consequences which forced him to go underground and subsequently surrender,‚Äù Nongtraw elaborated while affirming that Suchen was never involved in the planting of any IED explosive as alleged by the police.‚ÄúSimply because they failed to gather concrete evidence regarding the IED cases, the state police resorted to random arrests of former cadres of the HNLC as well as innocent youths as if they were chickens in a farm, but it is not easy to arrest cadres of the outfit. Such arrests only show that they (police) are weak and have become like swines drunk on fermented corn,‚Äù Nongtraw scoffed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-hnlc-directs-people-not-to-vote-for-npp-in-bypolls-101634191545590.html

14-10-2021||India||Global edible oil producers are outsmarting India‚Äôs moves to curb prices||International edible oil producers are synchronizing price increases with India‚Äôs series of actions to soften their domestic rates by slashing import duties. This has had the effect of making India‚Äôs steps to ease the price of cooking oils less effective, market watchers say.Higher food inflation not only impacts poorer households more, which tend to spend a larger share of their monthly budgets on food, compared to the well-off, but they also throw the Reserve Bank‚Äôs inflation targets off gear.Inflation must stay within a ‚Äútolerable‚Äù range to enable India to quickly consolidate gains from a nascent economic recovery underway since the pandemic took a heavy toll on Asia‚Äôs third-largest economy.In a key policy move to tame inflation, India on Wednesday virtually abolished basic customs duty on crude imports of three edible oils, a basic ingredient of most Indian cooking. But international markets are coordinating prices to thwart India‚Äôs moves to make imports cheaper, market data show.India has also pared basic customs duty on refined varieties of edible oil to 17.5% from 32.5%. Both these measures should offer at least short-term relief to consumer prices, while the government would lose out on revenue needed to keep borrowing under check.‚ÄúAlmost instantly, major producer penciled in the duty cuts by India and raised prices to a similar extent so that there is no impact or very less impact on rates by the time it reaches the consumer,‚Äù said Atul Chaturvedi of the Indian Solvent Extractors‚Äô Association, the industry body of oilseed processors, after analysing movement in a fresh increase in Malaysia‚Äôs prices.The tariff cuts announced by India on Wednesday will be in force until March 2022. This is the fifth reduction in import tariffs on vegetable oils since February. Edible oils have inflated household budgets since India imports up to two-thirds of its domestic consumption requirements of edible oils.Duty cuts should -- other market factors remaining the same -- immediately lower prices and potentially stave off food inflation soaring to multi-year highs. ‚ÄúHowever, prices are moving sinisterly in the global edible oil markets, almost in response to India‚Äôs measures,‚Äù said Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.Soon after India‚Äôs decision to cut duty rates, exportable edible oil rates in Malaysia moved by an extent enough to match India‚Äôs cuts. So, what is at play here? Simply, India‚Äôs moves to depress the rates of edible oils are being negated by an almost similar increases in the rates such that international prices remain high.The main advantage of international producer nations is that India has a gluttonous appetite for edible oils. The country imports up to two-third of its domestic demand for edible oil through imports since the domestic output is not sufficient.Palm is one of the most widely consumed oils, which is found in everything from bread to ice-creams. Edible oil is India‚Äôs third most high-value import, after crude oil and gold. India typically imports from producers such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina and Russia.According to a central notification, imported crude palm oil, the most widely consumed of edible oils in the Indian market, will now be charged an agri infrastructure cess of 7.5%, while unrefined soyabean and sunflower oils will attract a cess of 5 %, down from 20%.The lowering of the cess will bring down the effective customs duty on palm, soyabean and sunflower oils 8.5%, 5.5% and 5.5% respectively, according to the government‚Äôs notification.The reductions will cut prices by up to ‚Çπ20,000 a tonne, which is expected to have a pass-through effect on final consumer prices. However, a fresh increase in Malaysian prices has made market watchers unsure to what extent Indian consumers will benefit from duty cuts.According to official data, the share of rural and urban consumption in total is 3.8% and 2.7%. Much of the demand comes from commercial users, like biscuit and snack makers.‚ÄúIf international prices increase further, the duty cuts may not be effective because they will necessitate further reductions,‚Äù said Agrawal. ‚ÄúWe are getting into this trap.‚ÄùIn June, the government cut duties on palm oil by 5% and lifted restrictions on the import of refined palm oil, as food inflation worries mounted.Edible oil prices have risen by up to 60%, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry from a year ago. Average costs of a litre of mustard oil rose to ‚Çπ170 in August compared to ‚Çπ120 a year ago.India‚Äôs usual levies on edible oil imports ranges between 32.5% (for palm oil, the cheapest edible oil) and 35% for soyabean oil. The country produces about 11 million tonnes of edible oil but consumption hovers around 24 million tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-edible-oil-producers-are-outsmarting-india-s-moves-to-curb-prices-101634188006321.html

As travel restrictions have eased following the pandemic, demand for rental cars has also increased. ‚ÄúThe bookings are mainly from Tier 1 cities, such as Delhi and Bangalore. While the lockdown forced people to stay at home, there is a pent-up demand for travel and we are seeing people renting premium/luxury cars to have a comfortable and luxurious experience,‚Äù said Sunil Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Avis India.A MakeMyTrip spokesperson said that they are seeing strong demand for hotels and homestays during the upcoming long weekend of Dussehra with many opting for a quick weekend getaway to the hills or to the beaches of Goa and Pondicherry. ‚ÄúOn MakeMyTrip, advance bookings for the upcoming festive season have touched 75% of pre-Covid levels.

"There are thousands who have been forgotten," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The remarks were made in response to All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi's comments, who said that that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will soon declare the RSS ideologue as "the father of the nation".A row broke over on Wednesday after defence minister Rajnath Singh said that it was on Mahatma Gandhi's request that Veer Savarkar filed mercy petitions. Singh also claimed that there was a deliberate conspiracy to defame Savarkar.The comments prompted immediate criticism from the opposition parties which accused him of "trying to rewrite history".The Union minister was speaking after releasing a book on Savarkar.
14-10-2021||India||India moves a step forward in achieving E20 fuel dream||The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has notified test standards for vehicles compliant with ethanol-blended fuel variants E12 and E15 that will act as intermediaries in India‚Äôs target of achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol (E20) across the country by the year 2023. In its notification dated October 11, which was made public on Wednesday, the ministry made it mandatory for all automobile manufacturers to put ‚Äúclearly visible stickers‚Äù on every vehicle informing about its compatibility to the level of ethanol blend (E12, E15, E20).While E12 has 12% ethanol blended with petrol, E15 has 15%. Currently, India is using E10 fuel (petrol blended with 10% ethanol). A MoRTH official said the notification sets the norms for automobile manufacturers for type testing of vehicles compliant with these two bio-fuel variants. ‚ÄúThey can now start production of vehicles that are E12 and E15 compliant, apart from being E20 compliant which is the larger goal,‚Äù the official said. Ethanol blended fuel is less expensive than petrol and has lower carbon emissions, reducing the impact of vehicular pollution. Besides, by introducing ethanol-blended fuel, the central government wants to reduce its heavy dependency on crude oil imports, the rate of which is highly volatile. India currently imports 85% of its total fuel. Produced using sugarcane and grains such as corn, surplus rice, damaged food grains, bajra, jowar, and sweet sorghum, ethanol is considered to be one of most suitable alternative blending, transportation fuel due to its better quality and environmental benefits, according to a NITI Aayog report released in June. The report said the use of this fuel will result in an annual saving of $5 billion in India‚Äôs oil imports.In June, India brought forward its target for producing E20 by two years. Initially set for 2030, the target date was brought forward to 2025. The date was, through another notification, advanced to April 1, 2023.‚ÄúThe notification made public on Wednesday will help automobile manufacturers to introduce intermediary level - E12 and E15 - compliant vehicles. While India has to shift to E20 fuel by 2023 or 2025 maximum, several oil producing companies in India had raised questions to the government as to what happens when the country is hit by a year of bad produce (of sugarcane and other food grains) on account of weather or for some unforeseen reason. That is why these two blended fuel types have also been notified now so that if ethanol production reduces some time, then vehicles can use fuel that has lower ethanol blending,‚Äù said said PK Banerjee, executive director of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-moves-a-step-forward-in-achieving-e20-fuel-dream-101634184705229.html

According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Rules, 2021, these categories include survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest, minors, women whose marital status changes during an ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce), and those with physical disabilities.The new rules also cover mentally ill women, cases of foetal malformation that has a substantial risk of being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped and women with pregnancy in humanitarian settings or disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the government.The new rules come under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021 passed by Parliament in March.Earlier, abortion required the opinion of one doctor if it is done within 12 weeks of conception and two doctors if it is done between 12 and 20 weeks.According to the new rules, a state-level medical board will be set up to decide if pregnancy may be terminated after 24 weeks in cases of foetal malformation and if the foetal malformation has a substantial risk of it being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped.The function of the Medical Board shall be to examine the woman and her reports if she approaches for medical termination of pregnancy and provides the opinion with regard to the termination of pregnancy or rejection of a request for termination within three days of receiving the request.The Board has also been tasked to ensure that the termination procedure, when advised by it, is carried out with all safety precautions along with appropriate counselling within five days of the receipt of the request for medical termination of pregnancy.Poonam Muttreja, the Executive Director of the Population Foundation of India (PFI), said given the advancements in scientific and medical technology, the extended 24 week gestation period should apply to all women and not just 'special categories of women'."We welcome the new rules under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act notified by the Union Government recently, which are an outcome of the ¬†MTP Amendment Act, 2021 passed by Parliament in March this year."However, given the advancements in scientific and medical technology the world has witnessed over the years, the extended 24 week gestation period should be for all women and not just 'special categories of women'," she said."In addition, the creation of state medical boards could potentially create impediments for women's access to abortion services as many women discover they are pregnant at a later stage," Muttreja added.Dr. Jaideep Malhotra, founder of Rainbow IVF and former president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India, said it is a "much-awaited, sensitive and forward-looking amendment" ¬†for both the beneficiaries and the gynaecologists, who faced this turmoil for years and had their hands tied in the face of the law.Dr. Loveleena Nadir, a senior gynecologist, said the new rules of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act notified by the Union Government are a welcome move and a leap ahead for women's reproductive choices."I hope that this is a first step towards making safe abortion accessible to all women and not just restricted to women in special categories," said Dr. Loveleena Nadir, Senior Gynecologist in New Delhi."This would empower women and make India a liberal woman supporting country," Nadir added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-abortion-rules-notified-for-special-categories-of-women-details-here-101634179830782.html

14-10-2021||India||Explained: Why bypolls in 14 states are crucial ahead of Assembly elections||The country is set to witness assembly elections in five states next year. But before that, by-elections to three Lok Sabha seats and 30 assembly seats spread across 14 states will capture the political pulse of the country.These bypolls are being held amid fears of the third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the ongoing farmers' agitation. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and many state governments will be keenly watching these polls.The seats where Lok Sabha by-elections will be held are Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh. In Khandwa, elections were necessitated due to the death of BJP MP Nandkumar Chauhan, while in Himachal, Mandi is vacant since the death of BJP leader Ramswaroop Sharma. The Dadra and Nagar Haveli seat was left vacant due to the demise of Mohan Delkar, an Independent Lok Sabha member.Similarly, the Vidhan Sabha bypolls will be held this year on one seat in Andhra Pradesh, five in Assam, three in Madhya Pradesh, two in Bihar, one in Haryana, three in Himachal Pradesh, two in Karnataka, one in Maharashtra, three in Meghalaya, one in Mizoram and Nagaland, two in Rajasthan, one in Telangana and four in West Bengal.BJP keenly watchingThe BJP leadership is taking these upcoming bypolls seriously, since they will depict the mood of the electorate. The party is in power in Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka - some of the states where bypolls will be held. It will give a chance to the BJP to understand if it is facing anti-incumbency.The BJP has rejigged some of the governments in the states and these bypolls will give it a chance to understand the impact of those decisions.A highly charged political landscapeRajasthan sports minister Ashok Chandna on Wednesday claimed that the Congress will win both the seats in bypolls in the state, and said he will quit politics if the BJP wins even a single seat.Hitting back, BJP's state chief spokesperson Ramlal Sharma said the "minister's ego will definitely be broken when the results will be declared".The BJP has included former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, Union ministers Bhupendra Yadav, Gajendra Singh, Arjun Meghwal and Kailash Chaudhary in the list of 20 star campaigners for the bypolls on Vallabhnagar (Udaipur) and Dhariyawad (Pratapgarh) assembly seats in the state.Congress leader Kamal Nath, who has been campaigning in Khandwa, has said that the results of the upcoming bypolls in Madhya Pradesh will give a message to the nation that people can't be fooled every time. Nath hit out at the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in MP and said people are distressed due to rising prices and a downturn in the economy.The polling will be held on October 3 and counting of votes will take place on November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-why-bypolls-in-14-states-are-crucial-ahead-of-assembly-elections-101634179320201.html
14-10-2021||India||New Kushinagar airport is step towards India firming its Buddhist legacy||Amidst the presence of more than 100 priests and eight high priests from Sri Lanka led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajpaksa‚Äôs minister son Namal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will place Kushinagar, site of Lord Buddha‚Äôs Parinirvana, firmly on Buddhist Tourism circuit by inaugurating the international airport on October 20.Keeping firm sight on 3Ts - trade, tourism, technology - as markers for economic development, PM Modi will inaugurate the new airport also in the presence of ambassadors of at least 10-15 countries, where Buddhism is both practiced and preached. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath will also be present on the occasion and the two leaders are expected to address a political rally afterwards.It is understood that PM Modi will also visit the Parinirvana Stupa, where Lord Buddha after decades of missionary activity is said to passed away in 487 BCE in Kushinagar. It is said that Mauryan king Ashoka the Great visited the parinirvana site, which was expanded to include a reclining statue of founder of Buddhism during Gupta period after expansion during Kushan empire. The present temple was build by the Central Government in 1956.Excavations in the past century in the area by Indian and foreign archeologists have also led them to believe that Piprahwa, some 100 km away from Kushinagar, was the site of the ancient city of Kapilavastu, the capital of Shakya kingdom, where Prince Siddhartha Gautama spent the first 29 years of his life. Others believe that Kapilavastu is in Nepal. It is at Piprahwa that a buried stupa was found containing relics of Buddha. The founder of Buddhism attained Nirvana in Bodh Gaya in adjacent Bihar.According to UP government officials, more than 110 Buddhist priests and eight high priests are flying from Sri Lanka for the inauguration with 35-year-old Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa leading the delegation. The priests will conduct religious ceremonies at the Parinirvana Stupa.The inauguration of Kushinagar international airport will coincide with the city being linked with other Buddhist sites by dedicated trains for Indians and foreigners interested in pilgrimage or religious tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-kushinagar-airport-is-step-towards-india-firming-its-buddhist-legacy-101634179676541.html

14-10-2021||India||Aryan Khan drugs case hearing to continue today. Here's where things stand||The Mumbai cruise drug raid by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the subsequent arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, among others, in recent days has generated quite a buzz. As the investigation into the case progresses, a Mumbai court will on Thursday continue the hearing on bail applications of Khan and other accused Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha. The court had on Wednesday adjourned the hearing after the NCB claimed to have found Aryan Khan's links with the illicit procurement and distribution of contraband.What is the case all about?The NCB had on October 2 busted the alleged drugs party on the Cordelia Cruise ship, which was on its way from Mumbai to Goa. The team seized 13 grams of cocaine, 21gm of Hashish, 22 pills of MDMA, 5gm of MD, and 6 gm of charas. It has made as many as 20 arrests so far, including two Nigerian nationals.The special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court is hearing a plea for bail to Khan and other accused.What NCB has claimed in court so farThe NCB, in its reply filed at the special court on Wednesday, said its investigation has revealed that 23-year-old Khan used to procure drugs from Merchant, his close friend, who was also arrested after the raid on the cruise ship."Investigation has revealed accused number 1 (Aryan Khan's) role in the illicit procurement and distribution of contraband," said the NCB in its reply. The central investigative agency further said, ‚ÄúIt is also revealed in the investigation that accused number 1 (Aryan) used to procure drugs from accused number 2 (Arbaaz) and people connected to Arbaaz.‚ÄùAlso Read | Drugs hidden in sanitary pad, shoes: How those aboard cruise tried to evade securityEarlier, the central agency accessed WhatsApp chats between Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant, and officials familiar with the development said that Merchant may have ‚Äúshared some drugs‚Äù with Khan.‚ÄúAccused numbers 1 and 2 are associated and worked in close collaborations so the offences are attracted against them, especially section 29 of the NDPS Act (criminal conspiracy to commit an offence),‚Äù the reply added.The NCB earlier revealed that those aboard the cruise ship initially planned to evade the security check by attempting to conceal the drugs in personal belongings, including shoes, socks, and even inside a sanitary napkin. Elaborating more on this, the NCB said on Wednesday that six grams of charas were removed from the shoes of accused number 2 (Arbaaz) during the raid by the NCB.Aryan's defenceArguing for Aryan Khan's bail plea, his counsel, senior advocate Amit Desai on Wednesday cited many verdicts related to the seizure of a small number of drugs. As he claimed that his client was not even on the cruise and was apprehended as he was going to attend the party, Desai highlighted a few points regarding international practices.Desai argued that many countries have made substances like cannabis legal and removed them from the schedule of dangerous drugs. They (the accused) are some young kids and they have ‚Äúsuffered enough‚Äù and learned their lessons if at all, the lawyer said, adding that these kids should not be considered drug peddlers, racketeers, or traffickers since the term ‚Äòillicit drug trafficking‚Äô is very serious.Also Read | Many countries have legalised these drugs: 5 things Aryan Khan's lawyer saidAryan was being represented by advocate Satish Maneshinde in all previous hearings. Earlier, the defence insisted that the NCB has no grounds to continue to keep the accused in custody since no drugs were recovered from the personal possession of Aryan Khan and that his WhatsApp chats only consisted of messages about football and other related stuff. However, Aryan Khan's bail plea has been rejected thrice after he was arrested by the NCB on October 3. On October 7, he along with seven others were sent to 1-day judicial custody. A special NDPS court is now hearing the bail plea.Meanwhile, Maneshinde clarified on Wednesday that the bulk of the main argument on part of Aryan Khan will be carried forth by advocate Amit Desai from here on out and that he will only add anything if required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aryan-khan-drugs-case-hearing-to-continue-today-here-s-where-things-stand-101634170590054.html
14-10-2021||India||Navjot Singh Sidhu in Delhi today, to discuss 'organisational matters' with Congress leaders||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu will visit Delhi on Thursday to meet party's general secretary KC Venugopal. He is also scheduled to meet Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat in Delhi.The meeting between Sidhu and the senior leadership of Congress is first since September 28, when he posted his resignation on social media, saying he can‚Äôt compromise on Punjab‚Äôs future and its welfare agenda. The abrupt resignation triggered a fresh turmoil for Congress which was already struggling to control the infighting in the state unit, months before it is set to hold legislative assembly elections.According to Rawat's earlier tweet, Sidhu is arriving in the national capital to discuss the "organisational matters" of the state Congress with the party leaders. "Navjot Singh Sidhu, President Punjab Congress will be meeting me and KC Venugopal for discussion on certain organisational matters pertaining to the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee at Venugopal's office (in Delhi) on October 14," he tweeted on October 12.The meeting also comes two days before the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting in which the forthcoming assembly elections in five states, including Punjab, are on the agenda.The Congress has been in turmoil in Punjab for the past several months and the replacement of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who had faced a revolt by Sidhu and several other ministers and MLAs, has failed to put an end to infighting.The cricketer-turned-politician had expressed his unhapiness over some appointments in new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi's cabinet. Following Sidhu's resignation, both leaders held a meeting and agreed to a ‚Äúconsultation mechanism‚Äù to allow Sidhu to have a say in important decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-in-delhi-today-to-discuss-organisational-matters-with-cong-leaders-101634172374140.html

14-10-2021||India||Ayudha Puja: History, meaning and significance of this Navratri day||Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi greeted the people of the state ahead of Ayudha Puja and Vijayadasami. Ayudha Puja symbolise the victory of good over evil and celebration of the annihilation of demon Mahishasura by Goddess Durga, he said in a statement.It is celebrated as part of the Navratri festival.What is Ayudha Puja?Also known as 'Astra Puja' (worship), it is the day when people worship and clean the instruments they use, weapons (whoever possesses it), machine, tools etc.These tools can be as small as pins, knives or spanners as well as large devices like computers, heavy machinery, cars and buses.In South India, Ayudha Puja is also celebrated along with Saraswati Puja.Historical referenceThe story of Ayudha Puja is connected to the killing of demon Mahushasura. According to Hindu mythology, the demon started massacring innocent people after receiving a boon from Lord Brahma that he could only be killed by a woman.All the gods then pleaded Lord Brahma to find a solution to the problem.Goddess Durga was then assigned the task to end Mahishasura. All the gods gave her their weapons to help her defeat the demon.Spiritual and philosophical meaningAccording to spiritual gurus and experts, the worshipping of instruments and weapons gives a feeling of fulfillment. When a person shows reverence to the things he/she possesses, it brings them to harmony with the universe, according to experts."Reverence in ownership frees you from greed and jealousy," said Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishankar.Rituals performed on Ayudha PujaOn this day, all the instruments are thoroughly cleaned and worshipped. Some devotees also keep their tools in front of the goddess to seek her blessings and mark the victory she achieved.A mixture of turmeric and sandalwood (tilak) is applied on the tools and vehicles. Some people also decorate these things with flowers.While worshipping Goddess Saraswati, some students seek her blessings by keeping booms and study material in front of them.Union minister Rajnath Singh has performed Ayudha Puja (or Shastra Puja) for several years. In 2019, he performed the puja in Paris while receiving the first Rafale fighter jet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayudha-puja-history-meaning-and-significance-of-this-navratri-day-101634170307380.html
14-10-2021||India||North Korean children, elderly risk starving: Report||North Koreans living under strict pandemic restrictions are facing a growing food crisis and the most vulnerable children and elderly people in the isolated Asian nation are at risk of starvation, a UN investigator said in a report released Wednesday.Tom√°s Ojea Quintana said in the report to the UN General Assembly that North Korea‚Äôs agriculture sector appears to be facing multiple challenges due to a drop in imports of fertilizer and other agricultural items from neighboring China, the impact of UN and international sanctions stemming from its nuclear program, and an outbreak of African swine fever.He said prolonged and strict pandemic measures since January 2020 have resulted in ‚Äúsevere economic hardship and increased vulnerability to human rights violations among the general population.‚Äù The measures include a full-scale border shutdown, travel restrictions between cities and regions, and restricted imports of non-essential supplies including humanitarian goods.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Argentine lawyer said, over 40% of North Koreans were ‚Äúfood insecure,‚Äù with many suffering from malnutrition and stunted growth. That number has increased, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, he said, pointing to rising prices for rice and corn in different regions in June and emergency government measures.North Korea said Monday that leader Kim Jong Un urged officials to overcome the ‚Äúgrim situation‚Äù and ‚Äúunprecedented difficulties‚Äù facing the country and make stronger efforts to improve the food and living conditions of his people. State media said that in his speech marking the 76th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party, Kim confirmed the party‚Äôs determination to carry out a five-year plan to boost ‚Äúthe national economy and solving the people‚Äôs food, clothing and housing problems.‚ÄùOjea Quintana painted a grim picture of life for the North Korean people who have ‚Äúalready suffered and waited too long for peace, security, development and basic human rights,‚ÄùSince the COVID-19 restrictions, he said, they have faced a worsening ordeal including further isolation, ‚Äúwider and harsher state command over people‚Äôs lives, the further stifling of economic activity, and the exodus of humanitarian agencies from the country.‚ÄùAs a result, he said, ‚Äúfamilies can no longer support themselves‚Äù and are increasingly taking out loans and selling household items to survive.‚ÄúMany factories and mines have shut down because of a lack of power, machine parts and raw materials,‚Äù Ojea Quintana said. ‚ÄúThe number of homeless people and street children is increasing ... (and) social concerns such as prostitution, drug use, trafficking of drugs and robbery are reportedly on the rise due to economic deprivation.‚ÄùHe said the government has reportedly mobilized urban residents, those recently discharged from the military, orphaned children and married women to bolster agricultural production and work on farms. But floods in early August and a lack of fertilizer, pesticides, fuel for vehicles and agricultural parts are ‚Äúlikely to impact food production,‚Äù he said.In his wide-ranging final report as the UN special investigator on human rights in North Korea, Ojea Quintana called on the Security Council to consider lifting sanctions ‚Äúthat negatively affect humanitarian assistance and human rights, including under the COVID-19 pandemic.‚ÄùHe renewed his call for the UN‚Äôs most powerful body to refer the situation in North Korea to the International Criminal Court or establish a tribunal to investigate possible crimes against humanity.‚ÄúThese crimes are likely ongoing, epitomized by continued operation of large political prison camps,‚Äù Ojea Quintana said.The existence of these camps, known as kwanliso, ‚Äúrepresents the worst excesses of a system of governance that systematically violates the human rights of its people,‚Äù he said.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years due to disagreements over North Korea‚Äôs demand to end US-led sanctions and US demands for significant North Korean steps toward denuclearization.North Korea has ramped up its missile testing activity in recent weeks while making conditional peace offers to South Korea, reviving a pattern of pressuring the south to get what it wants from the United States.‚ÄúThis is the time to send clear signals, take concrete action and find creative ways to give momentum to the stalled diplomatic process for securing a peaceful resolution to the conflict,‚Äù Ojea Quintana said, ‚Äúand it could include the announcement of a peace declaration among parties.‚ÄùSince he was appointed to his post in 2016, North Korea has refused to let Ojea Quintana visit the country. He said COVID-19 has restricted his visits to neighboring countries, so he held a series of online meetings with victims of human rights violations, their family members, civil society organizations, UN agencies and UN member nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-korean-children-elderly-risk-starving-report-101634166816765.html

Like the Maoist leaders are in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other states and their cadres (in Chhattisgarh) do the job of firing bullets and getting hit‚Ä¶ The same is the situation in the RSS. ..The local RSS workers have no value and everything is centered in Nagpur,‚Äù Baghel told reporters who sought his reaction to governor Anusuiya Uikey‚Äôs letter.The RSS, the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs (BJP) ideological fount, is headquartered in Nagpur.In her letter, the governor sought an impartial inquiry into the violence that took place on October 5 in Kawardha, the headquarter of Kabirdham district, during a rally taken out by right-wing outfits. Scores of people have been booked by the police for the violence.On Tuesday, police named former CM Raman Singh‚Äôs son Abhishek Singh and BJP MP from Rajnandgaon, Santosh Pandey, in a case registered for rioting and causing damage to property in connection with the communal violence in the town.

Congress leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted, taking potshots at Singh. ‚ÄúRajnath Singh-ji is amongst the few sober & dignified voices in Modi Sarkar.

14-10-2021||India||Cong leaders caught on tape ‚Äòlinking Shivakumar to graft‚Äô||The Congress in Karnataka was embarrassed on Wednesday after two party leaders were caught on tape purportedly linking state unit chief DK Shivakumar to allegations of corruption.Party media coordinator M A Saleem and former Lok Sabha member VS Ugrappa were heard whispering in front of microphones and cameras of media organisations minutes before a press conference in Bengaluru on Tuesday. Video clips of the incident went viral on Wednesday.In the roughly two-minute-long clip, Saleem and Ugrappa are heard purportedly talking about corruption and money being made by Shivakumar and people close to the leader. ‚ÄúIf they have made 50-100 (crore) imagine how much he has, He is a collection giraki (customer),‚Äù Saleem is heard purportedly saying in Kannada and Ugrappa is passively lending an ear. The verbal exchange is caught on the microphones placed before them.In reply, Ugrappa is purportedly heard saying that he did not know about these things.Next, Saleem is heard hailing former chief minister Siddaramaiah and complaining that Shivakumar stammered in his speeches. The two senior leaders are old rivals.After the video clip went viral, the Congress expelled Saleem for six years and issued a show-cause notice to Ugrappa, who is considered close to Siddaramaiah.‚ÄúBefore the press conference, some internal conversations happened. Congress party keeps discipline in mind and the disciplinary committee will take appropriate action and we will all adhere to it,‚Äù Shivakumar said.He added that he has no connection with the allegations but conceded that the entire episode was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù to the party. ‚ÄúI was never part of any ‚Äòpercentage‚Äô (share in contracts) and I don‚Äôt need it. I have no connection with it,‚Äù he said.Ugrappa feigned innocence and said that he did not respond to Saleem and later pulled up the media coordinator for the statement.‚ÄúWhen I was about to start the press conference, he whispered something in my ear. There was an irrigation scam and he said that they are trying to make such allegations (against Shivakumar),‚Äù Ugrappa said. He added that Shivakumar is a good administrator, disciplined and a pro-people politician who was not into ‚Äúpercentage‚Äù politics.The developments come at a time when the Congress is trying to win some ground back in the October 30 bypolls in Hanagal and Sindgi after a bitter loss in the 2019 general elections and later the collapse of its alliance government with the Janata Dal (Secular).The Congress is also trying to mobilise support on the ground ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluka panchayat elections which is likely to provide a good indication of which way the 2023 assembly polls could go.But its preparations have been marred by a bitter war between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, two of the party‚Äôs tallest leaders in the state who are vying to be the next chief ministerial candidate.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) used the episode to attack the Congress.‚ÄúFormer Congress MP V S Ugrappa and KPCC media coordinator Salim discuss how party president DK Shivakumar takes bribes and a close aid of his has made between 50-100 crores in collection. They are also discussing how he stutters while talking and as if he his drunk,‚Äù party leader Amit Malviya tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leaders-caught-on-tape-linking-dk-shivakumar-to-graft-101634152122195.html
14-10-2021||India||Court rejects discharge plea of minister among 6 in 2015 Kerala assembly violence case||In a setback to the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala, the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday rejected a discharge petition moved by six legislators, including state education minister V Sivankutty in connection with the 2015 assembly violence case. Rejecting the plea, magistrate R Rekha directed all accused to appear before the court on November 22 to frame charges, which will be later read out to them. The accused contended that the video of the assembly proceedings were heavily edited and media blew the incident out of proportion. They also argued that their sole intention was to disrupt the budget speech and furniture was damaged by the security personnel during pushing and shoving in the assembly. However, the court rejected their contention and asked them to face charges. The counsel for the accused said he said he will move the High Court. Earlier the High Court and Supreme Court had rejected their pleas to quash the case. In March, 2015, the Kerala assembly witnessed violent incidents after then opposition LDF legislators tried to prevent finance minister KM Mani, also the Kerala Congress (M) chairman and a constituent of ruling UDF then, from presenting the budget alleging his role in the 2014 bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights during the ruckus, which also resulted in two legislators getting hospitalised. The session was live when the violence took place and property worth ‚Çπ2.20 lakh was destroyed in the melee. Since coming to power in 2016, the LDF tried to withdraw the case but the CJM court rejected the move in 2018. The government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The Pinarayi Vijayan-led government had invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it saying privilege was not a license to unleash violence in the House. Later, in July, the Supreme Court also upheld the lower court‚Äôs verdict and directed all accused to face criminal proceedings. The apex court said acts of destruction of public property cannot be equated with either the freedom of speech of the legislator, or with forms of protest legitimately available to the members of opposition. ‚ÄúPrivileges and immunities are not gateway to claim exemption from the general law of the land, particularly as in this case the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen,‚Äù a bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah had said. Following the SC rap, opposition Congress sought the resignation of one of Sivankutty, but chief minister Vijayan rejected it saying the government will fight it out legally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-rejects-discharge-plea-of-minister-among-6-in-2015-kerala-assembly-violence-case-101634152061684.html
14-10-2021||India||Siddaramaiah, BSY dismiss Kumaraswamy‚Äôs secret meeting claim||Senior Congress member and leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday dismissed JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy‚Äôs claim that both the leaders had secret late night meeting.Kumaraswamy on Tuesday alleged that two others who occupied the top post in the chair were holding meetings as a result of which the Income Tax (I-T) raids were unleashed in an effort to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù Yediyurappa.‚ÄúI had gone to meet Yediyurappa on his birthday. I had not met him personally as chief minister or as the Leader of Opposition. I have not met him (personally) till today. We both were in the same hospital when we were infected by Corona, even then we had not met,‚Äù Siddaramaiah said.The Congress leader said that it was actually Kumaraswamy who held multiple meetings with Yediyurappa when the latter was the chief minister. Terming the claims as ‚Äòblatant lies‚Äô, Siddaramaiah said that he would retire from politics if Kumaraswamy can prove that he had met Yediyurappa.Yediyurappa also took to social media to rubbish the claims made by his predecessor.‚ÄúOther than my birthday on February 27, 2020, I have not personally met Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah. I have no need to have such a meeting. We in the party are working to bring BJP back to power in the state,‚Äù Yediyurappa said in a post on Twitter.He added that his only goal was to bring back BJP to power in 2023 and has been working on the same.‚ÄúI have never compromised on the ideology that I have believed in, and will never compromise in the future. As Siddaramaiah has clarified that no such meeting has taken place, I‚Äôm too clarifying that the reports in the media in this regard are far from truth and meaningless,‚Äù Yediyurappa added.The claims and denial come at a time when the three major political parties in Karnataka are gearing up for the October 30 bypolls in Hanagal and Sindgi that has evolving into a huge electoral battle for all the outfits in the state.Kumaraswamy has been actively making statements against the Congress and the BJP as the former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda-led party is shrug off the tab that it is in a tacit alliance with the saffron outfit to take on the Congress, which they both consider the common enemy.The recent IT raids on close associates of Yediyurappa had given the political opposition another opportunity to attack BJP and its internal rumblings which had led to the 78-year-old stepping down from the top post on July 26.Kumaraswamy on Tuesday hinted that the IT raids on Yediyurappa was part of a possible ‚Çπ20,000 crore irrigation scam, as alleged even by BJP legislator AH Vishwanath.‚ÄúAnyone with the slightest understanding of politics can understand that the recent IT raids were for what reasons. IT raids were with a political motive and it is to control or checkmate Yediyurappa as both (Siddaramaiah and Yediyurappa) had a late night meeting about political developments, and the BJP that has government both at the centre and state got to know about it from their sources, and probably have tightened things,‚Äù Kumaraswamy had said.Though the three chief ministers have spared no opportunity to criticise the other, they have worked together in the past as JD(S) has allied with both national parties at the state level as well as smaller district, zilla and taluka units.Karnataka‚Äôs politics has been defined, in recent years, by coalition building abilities through which Siddaramaiah, Deve Gowda and Yediyurappa have remained relevant in state politics and have seldom allowed Delhi to dictate terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-bsy-dismiss-kumaraswamy-s-secret-meeting-claim-101634151885337.html

Retaining Hangal is even more important for him as it is the neighboring constituency to his Shiggaon assembly segment.The Congress, by ensuring a win, wants to give momentum for its preparations in the run up to 2023 assembly polls in the state, while JD(S) is looking to retain Sindagi seat and thereby prove that it still commands a support base in the northern districts.Congress leaders have alleged that JD(S) deliberately fielded minority candidates for the Hangal and Sindagi by-elections to help the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-candidates-in-fray-from-two-seats-in-oct-30-by-elections-in-karnataka-101634151883037.html

14-10-2021||India||Another building collapses, Bengaluru civic body under lens||Even as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) ordered a survey of old buildings in the city, one building in Kamala Nagar,which is part of Mahalaxmi Layout, partially collapsed on Tuesday night while side wall of a house collapsed on Wednesday. The collapses in the last few weeks have raised questions on the civic body and its ability to monitor the construction of such structures. The building in the Mahalaxmi Layout which had partially collapsed on Monday night was razed on Wednesday by disaster management personnel. ‚ÄúAll the people who lived in those house‚Äôs and within the vicinity have been shifted elsewhere. Accommodation and food arrangements have been made for such families,‚Äù the BBMP said in a statement on Wednesday. Sharing information on the other collapse, the civic body said, ‚ÄúAn old Mangalore tiles house side wall collapsed around 10 am on Wednesday in Ward no 119, second cross, PVN lane, Nagarthpet. No injuries were reported as no one was stayed in the house for last 6 years; as per the neighbours. The house was also not under maintenance. Removal of debris will be started immediately.‚Äù The city, since the last few weeks, has been witnessing a sudden spate of building collapses on account of non-maintenance of old buildings and construction with poor quality of materials and basic design flaws. The BBMP has skirted responsibility on the issue blaming the owners and contractors for the collapses, overlooking at the approvals given by the agency. Experts had also questioned the lackadaisical attitude of the BBMP. ‚Äú I think there is a need for a proactive approach, like the 15-20 year car policy, with regular checks on old and ageing buildings,‚Äù V Ravichandar, a Bengaluru-based urban infrastructure expert, told Hindustan Times.Experts also point out violations of building permits by builders that is often neglected or has the tacit approval of officials.‚ÄúBecause of the violations, the foundation of a building does not have the capacity to take the load,‚Äù Ravichandar said. ‚ÄúIt is important to involve the community and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) for early identification of any signs of cracks or damage.‚ÄùBJP legislator from Mahalaxmi Layout and Cabinet minister K Gopalaiah on Wednesday said that action will be taken against the owners of the buildings. ‚ÄúThe police will take action mercilessly against the owners,‚Äù he said. He added that around 10 homes next to the dilapidated building in Mahalaxmi Layout has been evacuated to ensure there is no threat to human lives. Stating that the building was among the list of dilapidated structures surveyed by the BBMP in 2009, Gopalaiah added that since the owner had not yet returned the rent advance taken from the tenants in the building, hence people were still staying there. The BBMP carried out a survey of dilapidated buildings in Bengaluru and found that there were at least 185 such structures that had to be brought down. However, by the BBMP‚Äôs own admission, only 10 have been brought down so far while people continue to reside in the remaining ones, adding to the possibility of another catastrophe. The BBMP had ordered a rapid survey of dilapidated buildings last month and had given itself a deadline to complete the exercise within 15 days. Gaurav Gupta, the BBMP‚Äôs chief commissioner on Wednesday said that there were 185 dilapidated buildings in the 2019 survey, of which only 10 have been demolished and action was being taken on the remaining ones. ‚ÄúThe new survey had a 15 day deadline and we have got preliminary results,‚Äù Gupta said in Bengaluru on Wednesday. There have been at least six buildings that have collapsed in Bengaluru in the last couple of weeks and Gupta had instructed zonal joint commissioners and chief engineers to form a committee to conduct a resurvey of dilapidated buildings and submit a report within 15 days.On September 30, revenue minister R Ashok held a meeting with BBMP, the city‚Äôs civic body, to take stock of old and dangerously unstable buildings in the city.Most of Benglauru‚Äôs public infrastructure is crumbling as roads are full of potholes, uncleared garbage, unplanned expansion of the city, encroached and toxic lakes and flooding of homes, offices and streets during heavy rains, making life miserable for the over 12 million residents of a city that aspires a global status on account of its prowess in technology, startups and aerospace among other sectors. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), at least 18 people in Bengaluru are said to have died due to negligence of civic bodies in the whole of last year which is more than six times of such fatalities recorded across at least six other urban centres in the country including Delhi and Mumbai. The BBMP has blamed the heavy rains witnessed in Bengaluru as the reason for some of these deaths and accidents but has never clarified why the quality of roads and civic infrastructure in one of India‚Äôs richest cities remain this poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-building-collapses-bengaluru-civic-body-under-lens-101634151822985.html
14-10-2021||India||Karnataka CM Bommai‚Äôs remark on moral policing triggers row||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday stoked a controversy with his statements that appeared to justify incidents of moral policing and communal disharmony in the state.‚ÄúThere are several sentiments in the society. Those emotions should not be affected and such should be the behaviour. When such emotions are hurt there is likely to be an action and reaction,‚Äù Bommai told reporters in Mangaluru, about 350 km from Bengaluru.Besides policing, Bommai said, the government‚Äôs duty is also about taking action to maintain harmony in society.‚ÄúEven youngsters should watch their actions to ensure it does not hurt sentiments of the society,‚Äù he said, adding that there should be ‚Äúmorality in the society and we cannot live without it‚Äù.Reacting to the CM‚Äôs remark, a statement endorsed by 35 human rights activists and organisations stated that the justification of moral policing and communal violence by the chief minister sends out a ‚Äúdangerous message‚Äù.‚ÄúThis statement has been made at a time when instances of communal policing have increased in the Karnataka, which has in fact witnessed the killing of persons for the simple act of loving across caste and religion,‚Äù said the statement released on Wednesday.‚ÄúYour statement that social morality is (to) be protected is not an innocent message. It sends out a dangerous message that as far as you are concerned, it is ok to use violence to enforce what some people see as ‚Äòmorality‚Äô,‚Äù the statement added.Activists also said such acts of violence affect the dignity of the youth and instill fear in them. ‚ÄúIt condemns minorities and Dalits to lead the life of second class citizens. It also conveys the message that women have no right in choosing their partners. It is an attack on all women in fact. It also fills the minds of many youth among majority community with hate,‚Äù the statement added.The CM‚Äôs statement comes at a time when Karnataka has been witnessing a surge in cases of moral policing allegedly by individuals associated with right-wing outfits.On Tuesday, police in Bagalkote district arrested eight people after a fight between two Class IXth students took communal colour after members of both Hindu and Muslim groups attacked each other.According to the police, both students are from the same locality. There were allegations that one of the students objected to the other wearing a skull cap, however, police said they are yet to ascertain what led to the fight.On September 28, decapitated body of a 24-year-old Muslim man, Arbaz Mullah, was found on a railway track in Belagavi district. On October 8, police arrested 10 people, including the parents of a woman he was in a relationship with, for his murder.The Belagavi police said the woman‚Äôs parents, Eerappa and Susheela Kumbhar, and Maharaja Nagappa alias Pundalik Mutgekar, a member of Hindu group Sri Ram Sena Hindustan, are the prime suspects in the murder.On Monday, HT reported two separate cases of moral policing in Dakshina Kannada and Shivamogga districts.In the Dakshina Kannada incident, police said two persons belonging to a right-wing group waylaid a car with four occupants, including a Muslim couple and two Hindu girls, and objected to them travelling together.In Shivamogga district, two youngsters were detained in a case of moral policing after they allegedly assaulted a Hindu youth for dropping off a Muslim girl on his two-wheeler.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-bommbai-s-remark-on-moral-policing-triggers-row-101634151821644.html
14-10-2021||India||Govt withdraws quarantine rules for UK nationals||ndia has withdrawn the need for UK nationals to mandatorily quarantine for 10 days upon arrival, irrespective of their vaccination status, days after the government in London added India to the list of countries from where people will be able to show proof of vaccination to skip a similar quarantine rule.The decisions caps a controversy over vaccine passports that reached some of the highest diplomatic channels, beginning with the UK refusing to recognise India‚Äôs vaccine certificates at first and prompting a retaliatory move by New Delhi.In an official memorandum issued on October 11, the Union health ministry said that based on the evolving scenario, it was decided that the revised guidelines stand withdrawn and the earlier guidelines on international arrival issued on February 17, this year, will be applicable to all international travellers arriving in India from the UK, a person familiar with developments said.According to the travel rules from February 17, airlines need to ensure passengers have a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result before they board the flight at UK. On arrival, they need to take a test at the first point of entry. If positive, the passenger needs to be isolated and treated. If they are negative, they need to be in home quarantine for seven days and get re-tested on the eighth day.Initially, the UK recognised Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India but retained the 10-day quarantine period for fully vaccinated travellers from India. The move was attacked as discriminatory by the Indian government. India then decided to impose reciprocal curbs against all British nationals arriving in the country as the contentious issue relating to the UK not recognising Indian vaccine certificates could not be resolved despite holding a series of technical-level talks.UK officials later held multiple discussions with teams in India managing the Co-WIN platform, which is used to issue as well as verify vaccine certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-withdraws-quarantine-rules-for-uk-nationals-101634151762843.html

A meeting would be held with the Covid expert committee soon after Dasara festival next week to discuss the situation, and a decision on relaxing the restrictions in border districts would be taken,‚Äù Bommai said on Wednesday in Mangaluru. The statements come when Karnataka has actively relaxed Covid restrictions across the state to kick-start economic activity around the festive period.The state government has already relaxed restrictions to allow physical classes for students above 6th grade, 100% occupancy in cinema halls, pubs and other places since October 1.There is now a demand for reopening classes for students between 1-5th grades. ‚Äú(A) decision will also be taken regarding reopening of primary schools too,‚Äù Bommai said.The proposal to reopen classes for young students comes even as trials of Covid-19 vaccination for children aged between 2-18 years old are underway.‚ÄúChildren and adolescents will be vaccinated soon. Karnataka is in the forefront of vaccination,‚Äù Bommai said.The Covid-19 infection numbers in Karnataka appear to have stabilised, if government data is anything to go by, allowing the Bommai-led administration to continue easing restrictions after nearly two years of lockdowns and the uncertainty attached to it.Bommai also said that he would take a decision on the withdrawal of cases filed against the public for violation of any Covid-19 norms during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-on-easing-covid-curbs-on-state-borders-after-dasara-cm-bommai-101634151761700.html

14-10-2021||India||Cong meets President, calls for Mishra‚Äôs dismissal||A Congress delegation, including Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, on Wednesday called on President Ram Nath Kovind to demand the immediate dismissal of Union minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Mishra Teni, and ask for an independent judicial investigation by sitting judges of the Supreme Court or high court into the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month.Gandhi said after the meeting with Kovind that when he went to meet the families of the victims last week, they had two principal demands.‚ÄúThe family members told us that they wanted two things. First, they want justice. They want the murderer to be punished. They also said, the father of the person who has committed the murder is the (junior) home minister, so, as long as a person is a minister, a proper investigation and justice can‚Äôt be achieved,‚Äù the Congress leader said.Eight people died after violence erupted after a car mowed down farmers protesting in Lakhimpur Kheri. So far, police have arrested six people--Ashish Mishra, his alleged accomplices Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, former Union minister, late Akhilesh Das‚Äôs nephew, Ankit Das, his gunner Latif alias Kale and his driver Shekhar Bharti -- in connection with the case.The Congress also demanded an ‚Äúindependent judicial investigation by a commission comprising of two sitting judges of the Supreme Court of India or the high court‚Äù, and maintained that such an investigation was necessary. ‚ÄúAjay Mishra Teni in a public function openly threatened the agitating farmers and even boasted about his dubious antecedents. How can justice be done when the original provocation came from Union MoS Home Affairs himself?‚Äù the memorandum to the President said.The seven-member delegation also included general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, and senior party leaders KC Venugopal, AK Antony and Ghulam Nabi Azad.They described the Lakhimpur incident as ‚Äúone of the most gruesome and premeditated acts of bone-chilling murder ever seen and caught on camera‚Äù the memorandum said.They also alleged that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath was making ‚Äúconciliatory statements towards him (the Union minister), [which] suggests this situation is unlikely to change without intervention‚Äù added the memorandum.‚ÄúMishra‚Äôs role is also yet to be investigated and the same is unlikely while he continues in office. Furthermore, which police official would dare to fairly investigate the son of Union MoS Home Affairs with the father occupying a position of such high influence and who enjoys continued endorsements from both the central and the state governments.‚Äù the memorandum said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laskhimpur-violence-congress-meets-prez-calls-for-ajay-mishra-s-dismissal-101634151100991.html
14-10-2021||India||India will administer 1bn vaccine doses by October-end: Mandaviya||NEW DELHI: India will cross an important milestone of having administered a billion vaccine doses by the third week of October, and will then take a call on resumption of exports of locally-made Covid vaccines, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Wednesday. He added that this month, around 280 million doses are available for the country‚Äôs vaccine drive. The government said on September 20 that it would resume exports of vaccines in October. And the numbers have suggested for some time now that India will cross the billion-doses mark around mid-October. Till Wednesday night, India had administered 967 million doses, with 276 million people having received both doses and another 414 million having received one dose. A total of 940 million Indians aged 18 and above are eligible for vaccines. Only China has administered more vaccine doses than India. Bharatiya Janata Party insiders on condition of anonymity said that the government is keen on speeding up the vaccination drive ahead of the upcoming assembly elections and wants to present the inoculation programme as a major achievement of the Narendra Modi administration.On Tuesday, the subject expert committee of the drug regulator recommended the emergency use of Bharat Biotech‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine for those in the 2 to 18 years age-group . India is yet to start vaccinations of those under the age of 18, although another vaccine for those in the 12-18 age group, ZyCoV-D was approved on August 20. ‚ÄúAs on date, 73% of the total population has been given at least a single dose of the vaccine; close to 30% has received both doses and we are following up with states to increase the vaccine administration. There are 80 million doses kept ready for use by the states,‚Äù said a government functionary. In an analysis published on Wednesday, HT pointed out that vaccinations in India may be nearing a ceiling. Most experts believe not more than 75-80% of the population will want to take vaccines. The functionary said that most states have inoculated about 60% of their population (one dose), but without citing numbers said the proportion of vaccinated people is lower in the tribal areas. ‚ÄúThere is no shortage of vaccines, it has however been noticed worldwide that there tends to be a saturation once 70% of the population is covered. So efforts are on to cover the remaining the population and counter any vaccine hesitancy. As for the availability of vaccines, the production for October alone is about 280 million doses. Of this 220 million are of Covishield, 60 million Covaxin and 6 million, the DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D),‚Äù the functionary saidTo a separate question on how the government plans to counter the bar on travels inoculated with Covaxin which is awaiting clearances from the World Health Organisation and not recognised by countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK., the official said, ‚ÄúWhile we are awaiting clearances (from the World Health Organisation) we are also working on country- to- country mutual agreements for waiving the restrictions. So far about 15-16 counties including Italy are allowing travellers with Covaxin jabs.‚Äù Most countries, including Australia most recently, recognise Covishield, the Indian variant of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot. India is also yet to take a call on administering booster doses to senior citizens, healthcare workers and those with comorbidities even though the WHO has recommended booster doses for the immunocompromised. ‚ÄúThere is no expert opinion yet in India on the booster doses. The sero survey that was conducted shows a pan India prevalence of antibodies in 67% of the population and we will also be conducting a survey to study breakthrough cases,‚Äùthe functionary explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-administer-1-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-by-third-week-of-october-mansukh-mandaviya-101634150981684.html

The vaccine is 75% effective among subjects under the age of 60. Sputnik Light has demonstrated a superior efficacy compared with some two-shot vaccines, which have shown a major decline in efficacy against the Delta variant to less than 50% five months after injection,‚Äù said RDIF in a statement based on a study conducted in Russia.The data used in the study was collected in July 2021 in Moscow.‚ÄúIn a certain cohort of Russian people, the efficacy was seen to be as high as 83% also. The vaccine‚Äôs one-shot regimen makes it is a strong solution for countries with low vaccination rates. Sputnik Light can also be successfully used to maintain existing herd immunity as a booster shot,‚Äù said Denis Logunov, deputy director, Gamaleya Center.The data comes as Russia battles soaring infections and hesitancy about vaccines at home.Countries around the world are deploying or considering administering third dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or booster shots to some of their population, although there is no consensus among scientists about how broadly they should be used.Sputnik Light as a booster for other vaccines will be almost as effective against the Delta variant as Russia‚Äôs flagship two-shot Sputnik V vaccine, RDIF added. Sputnik V, in its two-dose regimen, is one of six Covid-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use approval by the Indian drugs regulator.RDIF said Sputnik Light would be over 83% effective against infection and over 94% effective against hospitalisation.Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF, told Reuters he expected Sputnik Light to become the main Russian vaccine against Covid-19. ‚ÄúEventually, we believe that Sputnik Light could be the main vaccine one year from now when many people will just need to get revaccinated or will have had COVID and won‚Äôt need Sputnik V,‚Äù said Dmitriev.Sputnik Light will be produced by RDIF‚Äôs global partners in at least 10 countries (India, China, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico, Argentina, Serbia, Turkey, etc.).Experts said a one-shot regimen may have benefits for some, but a two-dose vaccine will eventually work better. ‚ÄúOne-shot vaccines could possibly be good for people who have been previously infected, as some protection is expected...,‚Äù said Dr Gagandeep Kang, vaccinologist from Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-light-70-effective-against-delta-variant-rdif-101634150561616.html
14-10-2021||India||UK foreign secy‚Äôs visit: Boosting trade, Indo-Pacific security to top agenda||Boosting trade and investment, including negotiations for an interim early harvest deal, and security cooperation across the Indo-Pacific are expected to top the agenda during UK foreign secretary Liz Truss‚Äô maiden visit to India next week.This will be the first visit to Asia by Truss since she replaced Dominic Raab as foreign secretary in mid-September, and only her second trip abroad following a visit to the US and Mexico. She is expected to review bilateral ties with her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and meet top business leaders in New Delhi and Mumbai during her three-day visit.With India and the UK recently sorting out a row over vaccine certification for travellers, both sides are looking forward to meaningful engagement on key issues, especially trade and investment and closer cooperation across the Indo-Pacific. With the two sides set to launch negotiations for a free trade agreement on November 1, the UK is especially keen on finalising an interim early harvest deal by March 2022.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Truss is expected to make a strong pitch for closer economic ties as part of the UK‚Äôs efforts to forge new trade partnerships around the world in the wake of its exit from the European Union. Among the top business leaders Truss is expected to meet during her visit is Ratan Tata, the people said.In a reflection of the UK‚Äôs focus on the Indo-Pacific, Truss‚Äô trip to Mumbai will be timed to coincide with the arrival of a carrier strike group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain‚Äôs largest warship, in the waters off India‚Äôs financial hub on October 21. The aircraft carrier is transiting the Indian Ocean on her maiden deployment and conducted exercises with the Indian Navy in May. The UK carrier strike group will carry out further exercises with the Indian Navy and air force this month.Two executives working in separate industry associations said, requesting anonymity, said the Indian government has been constant touch with domestic industry to obtain its views for trade negotiations with the UK. In order to address concerns of all stakeholders, the commerce ministry sought comments from industry representatives in June, an official of an economic ministry said on condition of anonymity.‚ÄúFTAs cannot be one-sided. It is about give and take. Hence, industry should be prepared for opening up in certain areas and competing with foreign entities. But the gains are immense for both India and the UK, and both partners are taking the views of industry leaders of the two sides for better understanding,‚Äù the official said.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) director general Chandrajit Banerjee said: ‚ÄúWe understand the UK government had done initial consultations with its own industry. In India, industry too was consulted on issues which are part of the early harvest deal as well as for the future comprehensive FTA. These include goods, services, investment and procurement.‚ÄùHe added, ‚ÄúOur trade negotiating team is having regular consultations with industry. Since the target is to complete the early harvest deal by December-end, senior officials have already engaged in negotiations. At the political level, the leaders are likely to meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit and the WTO ministerial conference later this year.‚ÄúIndia is hoping to get preferential access for those products where we lost GSP. That includes textiles, apparel and other labour intensive export-oriented products. Besides, in services, we expect further easing of work visas for Indian professionals, both for intra-corporate transfers and contractual service providers.‚ÄùPHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) president Pradeep Multani said possible opportunities existed in negotiating higher thresholds to ‚Äúreserve some sectors temporarily and to exclude some permanently‚Äù.India should take an aggressive approach instead of a defensive one, as Indian businesses would have easier access to the UK market, he said. ‚ÄúIt is fair to assume that ICT, financial services, food and beverages and pharmaceuticals will benefit the most from the trade and investment agreement, but this will only become evident as discussions proceed,‚Äù he said.According to a spokesperson of FICCI, the two governments have been consulting industry associations in India and the UK. ‚ÄúThese meetings have been ongoing since the announcement of the Enhanced Trade Partnership. Once negotiations start between the two countries, more meetings will be scheduled,‚Äù the spokesperson said, referring to the partnership launched by the Indian and UK prime ministers during a virtual summit in May.‚ÄúFICCI has submitted its recommendations to the commerce ministry covering industry expectations on goods and services,‚Äù the spokesperson added.The British side is expected to demand the removal of tariffs of up to 150% on spirits, which will require more consultations with the industry before offering any concession as this could impact India‚Äôs trade negotiations with the European Union, an industry executive said, requesting anonymity.In the field of services, the UK is expected to demand market access for its legal and auditing firms. This too requires more informed consultations with professional bodies before arriving at any decision, the executive added.As part of the Enhanced Trade Partnership, Britain will open up its fisheries sector to more Indian players, facilitate opportunities for nurses, recognise Indian seafarers‚Äô certificates and enter into a dialogue on a social security agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boosting-trade-indo-pacific-security-to-top-agenda-during-uk-foreign-secy-s-visit-to-india-101634150381523.html

According to them, they received intelligence about the presence of militants in Tilwani Mohalla, in the Waggad area of Tral, and undertook a joint cordon and search operation with the army and Central Reserve Police Force.‚ÄúThe terrorists were given repeated opportunities to surrender; instead, they fired indiscriminately on the joint search party, which retaliated. In the ensuing encounter, one terrorist was killed, and his body was retrieved from the site of the encounter.He has been identified as Shamus-ud-din Sofi alias ShamSofi, a top commander of JeM,‚Äù said a police spokesperson on condition of anonymity.Police said Sofi was active as a militant since June 2019, figuring among the most-wanted Jaish commanders operating in the Kashmir Valley.‚ÄúHe was also part of groups involved in several terror cases, including attacks on security establishments and atrocities on civilians, and there were several cases against him,‚Äù the spokesperson said.The police said Sofi was first arrested in 2004 and detained under Public Safety Act for aiding terror activities.Sofi was arrested for a period of two months and then released on bail.‚ÄúHe provided logistical support to terror groups operating in Tral before joining an outfit himself,‚Äù the police spokesperson said, adding that Sofi also motivated local youth to join terror outfits, recruiting some himself.According to an official document, in 2007, Sofi was arrested again in another case. In 2008, he was detained under PSA as he continued his anti-national activities before being released after the Jammu and Kashmir high court order on bail. In 2019, Sofi left his home and joined the ranks of JeM and was active in the region since then.Sofi lured several young people to join terrorism . He was involved in two cases of civilian killings -- of Mohammad Ayoub Ahenger in 2020 and Shakeela in 2021, states the document. In January 2020, during an encounter in Pulwama‚Äôs Khrew, Sofi‚Äôs escaped, the document added.So far, 121 militants, including top commanders of various militant outfits, have been killed in Kashmir this year. This month alone, 10 militants have been killed in separate encounters.Since Sunday night, six encounters have taken place in Kashmir, following a spate of killings of civilians, including a well-known Srinagar chemist and two school teachers, for which a little-known outfit called The Resistance Front, believed to be backed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-jaish-commander-gunned-down-in-pulwama-encounter-101634150322791.html

The investigation requires sufficient time so as to approach the foreign agency concerned,‚Äù the affidavit said.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for NCB, told the court that bail applications are heard day in and out, but it is not like they have to be decided on the same day. ‚ÄúNCB is a credible agency dealing with drug trafficking. Consumption of drugs by youngsters is affecting the whole nation, not only economically but also otherwise. The agency is concerned about the gangs involved and efforts are made to trace them,‚Äù Singh said.‚ÄúThere are chats that mention about commercial quantities or bulk quantities. There are chats with foreign nationals in reference to hard drugs. Somebody won‚Äôt order bulk quantities for consumption. There is something more. We have spoken to the ministry of external affairs and are trying to locate the foreign national,‚Äù the ASG added.Requesting for bail for Aryan Khan, senior counsel Amit Desai told the court: ‚ÄúThey are not drug peddlers or drug traffickers, but young kids. They have learnt their lessons, let us not penalise them.‚Äù‚ÄúNothing was found on Aryan Khan, whatever was found was from Arbaaz Merchant, that to 6 grams of Charas, the agency has been relying on his statement and claiming that both of them used to consume it. This has a one-year punishment, the involvement in consumption, no substance for sale, and there is no money, so no purchase.‚ÄùDesai told the court that Aryan Khan had no money, so there was no question of purchase.Senior counsel Taraq Sayyad, representing Arbaaz Merchant, Aryan Khan‚Äôs friend, told the court: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a clear case of consumption. The court should immediately grant bail; there is even no need for prosecution. Both were together and they have already accepted the fact; they don‚Äôt know anybody else. They have already spent time in jail so should be granted bail.‚ÄùCounsel Ali Kashif Khan, who argued for Munmun Dhamecha, said: ‚ÄúI am a fashion model who had gone to do a ramp walk on the cruise. They recovered drugs from my room but there were two more people in the same room. I had just reached the cruise when the raid happened.‚ÄùAfter hearing the arguments, additional sessions judge VV Patil adjourned the matter to Thursday.

14-10-2021||India||Political row erupts over move to extend BSF jurisdiction||A decision by the Union home ministry to extend the area under jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in three states sparked a political controversy on Wednesday with the ruling parties in Punjab and West Bengal opposing the decision.The third state, Assam, is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The Union government amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of the existing 15 kms, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam.In Gujarat, which shares border with Pakistan, the same limit was reduced from 80 km to 50 km, and in Rajasthan, it was kept unchanged at 50 km.Punjab, which is ruled by the Congress, called the move an attack on federalism.‚ÄúI strongly condemn the government of India‚Äôs unilateral decision to give additional powers to BSF within 50km belt running along the international borders, which is a direct attack on the federalism. I urge the Union home minister Amit Shah to immediately rollback this irrational decision,‚Äù Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi tweeted.Earlier in the day, the chief minister faced some barbs from former party state unit chief Sunil Jakhar. ‚ÄúHas Charanjit Channi unwittingly managed to hand over half of Punjab to Central govt? 25000sq km (out of total 50,000sq km) has now been placed under BSF jurisdiction,‚Äù Jakhar tweeted.Former chief minister Amarinder Singh supported the move. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not drag central armed forces into politics,‚Äù he said.In Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress opposed the decision.‚ÄúI am sure the Bengal government will oppose this because it (the plan) is infringing on the sovereign rights of the state. The BSF, in any case, is a problematic organisation. There are allegations of links between BSF and smugglers. To let them increase their area of operation would be suicidal. I totally oppose this,‚Äù party MP Saugata Roy told HT.In Bengal, several officers of the BSF are under the scanner of the Central Bureau of Investigation in a 2020 transborder cattle smuggling case.A BSF spokesperson said the decision established uniformity in defining the area within which the force could operate. ‚ÄúThis will also enable improved operational effectiveness in curbing trans-border crime,‚Äù the spokesperson added.The BJP accused the Opposition of politicising national security. ‚ÄúWe hope that political parties would rise above their political interests and not create a precarious situation,‚Äù said party national secretary Subhash Sharma. The Union home ministry issued a notification in this context on October 11 amending a July, 2014 enabling provision for the BSF personnel and officers while they operate in border areas.The notification will allow the force to search, seizure and arrest on par with the state police in an extended area. BSF personnel will continue to invoke these powers in the ‚Äúwhole of the area‚Äù in Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya and the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-row-erupts-over-move-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-101634149961784.html
14-10-2021||India||Coal power generation outage down to 6 GW from 11, says ministry||The coal-based electricity generation outage came down to 6 GW on Wednesday from 11 GW a day earlier, the power ministry said in an official statement. The government statement comes against the backdrop of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) drawing up a plan to ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies to power plants amid some states raising concerns that depleted stocks at power plants may lead to blackouts.‚ÄúThe Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO) reported that the total capacity of units under outage due to low coal stocks has reduced from 11 GW on October 12 to 6 GW on October 13,‚Äù the ministry said.Earlier in the day, coal minister Pralhad Joshi said cumulative coal supplies to thermal power plants crossed 2 million tonne on Tuesday and dispatch of the dry fuel is being enhanced to the plants.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do politics over this. We have already been meeting the total requirement. Today, the requirement is 1.1 million tonnes of coal for power generation and we have already supplied two million tonnes. The stock is also rising because of it. I assure that there will be no problem in meeting the supply for power generation in the country,‚Äù he said.In a letter issued on Tuesday, the Union ministry of power requested all states and UTs to utilise unallocated power of the central generating stations (CGS) to meet the requirement of their own consumers only. In case of excess power, it asked the states to inform the ministry, so that the electricity can be diverted to needy states.‚ÄúIt has been observed that some states are not supplying power to their consumers and imposing load shedding in some areas. At the same time, they are also selling power in the power exchange at a high price,‚Äù read the letter signed by deputy secretary, GoI, Devashis Bose, without naming any state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-power-generation-outage-down-to-6-gw-from-11-says-ministry-101634149722769.html
14-10-2021||India||AAP promises 24-hour power supply, industries in Punjab||Amid the ongoing power crisis due to coal shortage, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is on a two-day visit to Punjab, promised round-the-clock electricity supply in the state if his party is voted to power in the 2022 polls. He said the power scarcity in Punjab was man-made and once the transmission system is upgraded, half the problem will be solved. ‚ÄúWe faced a similar problem in Delhi during our initial years in government. We changed the transmission system, and the situation has improved to the point that people don‚Äôt buy inverters now,‚Äù Kejriwal said. He was speaking during an interactive session with the Jalandhar-based industrialists at a private resort. He unveiled a 10-point agenda for the development of industry, trade and commerce. The chief minister underlined the need to give special focus on MSME and small scale industry sectors. ‚ÄúEk mauka saanu vi (give us a chance too). I assure you that you will forget others,‚Äù Kejriwal said.After listening to the grievances of industrialists, Kejriwal pledged to end red-tapism and ‚Äòinspector raj‚Äô. ‚ÄúCorruption runs in the system because the intentions of the governments are not honest. If the CM and ministers are honest, the entire system will fall in place. We did this in Delhi,‚Äù he said. Kejriwal further said that the problem of delay in VAT(value-added tax) refunds will be solved within 3-6 months after coming to power, and an instalment system will be introduced. To prove his point, the AAP leader said his government in Delhi had stopped ‚Äúraid raj‚Äù and reduced the VAT rate that led to the doubling of tax revenue at ‚Çπ60,000 crores. It happened because the government trusted the traders, he said. Kejriwal also promised the formation of a trade and industry body and its decisions will have to be implemented by the state government. He also underlined the need to make the change of land use (CLU) process transparent to eradicate corruption. AAP Punjab president and MP Bhagwant Mann, MLA Aman Arora and other senior leaders of the party were also present. Meanwhile, a group of farmers opposed Kejriwal‚Äôs event, but the police kept them at bay. Leader of opposition in the Punjab Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said they don‚Äôt organise rallies as advised by the Samuykt Kisan Morcha.

14-10-2021||India||Amend discriminatory info on LGBTQIA+: NMC to institutes||Medical institutions shouldn‚Äôt teach students in a way that is derogatory or insulting to the LGBTQIA+ people and authors of medical textbooks should amend all unscientific and discriminatory information about the community, India‚Äôs apex medical regulatory body said on Wednesday.In an advisory, the National Medical Commission (NMC) said various medical textbooks, especially those in forensic medicine, toxicology and psychiatry contain unscientific and derogatory remarks against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual people. ‚ÄúAll medical universities, colleges, institutions are requested not to approve books as recommended‚Ä¶if the books have unscientific, derogatory and discriminatory information about virginity, LGBTQIA+ community and homosexuals,‚Äù said the advisory, signed by NMC secretary Dr Anjula Jain.The advisory referred to a Madras high court judgment last month that said ‚Äúqueerphobia‚Äù ‚Äì prejudicial and abusive attitudes and behavior towards the community ‚Äì was rampant in medical education. The court referred to a report by Dr Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju who stated that the curriculum of undergraduate forensic medicine described ‚Äúsodomy‚Äù, ‚Äúlesbianism‚Äù and ‚Äúoral sex‚Äù as sexual offences, and ‚Äútransvestism‚Äù (cross-dressing) as a ‚Äúsexual perversion‚Äù.‚ÄúThe NMC‚Äôs advisory based on the Madras HC‚Äôs verdict is a long-awaited and welcome step in India‚Äôs medical history. I applaud it with cautious optimism, and can only hope that authors and institutions across the country abide by the apex med-ed body,‚Äù Dr Gummaraju said. The NMC advisory asked the guidelines to be strictly applied by the government and authorities. ‚ÄúAll medical universities, colleges, institutions are requested that while teaching UG and PG student, where the issue of gender or similar kind arise, the mention of clinical history or complaints or signs or symptoms, examination findings or history about nomenclature shall not be taught in such a way that it becomes/perceived in any way derogatory/discriminatory/insulting to LGBTQIA+ community,‚Äù the document read.Experts hailed the move. ‚ÄúStigmatised, pathologised contents in medical textbooks are getting removed finally. I see the next generation of medical professionals is knowledgeable, wise, compassionate, and ethical in their approach to their patients from the LGBTQIA+ community,‚Äù said Dr Sameera Jahagirdar, a senior clinical fellow at Barts Health NHS Trust in the UK.Research by her, Dr L Ramakrishnan of SAATHII, an NGO, and others found that some authors called lesbians ‚Äúmental degenerates or those who suffer from nymphomania. ‚ÄúLesbians who are morbidly jealous of one another, when rejected may commit homicide, suicide or both,‚Äù read an excerpt from a forensic medicine and toxicology book.Other books listed homosexuality as a disorder and even mentioned conversion therapy, which is banned in several countries and was harshly criticised by the Madras high court.‚ÄúThis is a very encouraging development and we eagerly await its implementation by public and private medical colleges across the country. The issue is, however, not limited to Forensic Medicine and Psychiatry, but extends to other fields such as Gynecology, Pediatrics, and General Medicine,‚Äù said Dr Ramakrishnan.He pointed out that the ‚Äòcompetency-based curriculum‚Äô of the erstwhile Medical Council of India (2018-2019) contained antiquated terms like sodomy and gender identity disorder. ‚ÄúWe hope the NMC will also address content in these other disciplines, and take a stand against conversion therapy.‚ÄùThe landmark Madras HC order had come on a petition by two students from Tamil Nadu who approached the court to seek protection from their families and the police. In response, the HC issued instructions to a slew of state and central agencies to frame guidelines that recognise the rights of the community. ‚ÄúThe case brought to the court‚Äôs attention about wrong and unscientific information in medical textbooks, including conversion therapy. It is a welcome step and another instance where courts have led the way,‚Äù said Manuraj S, the petitioners‚Äô lawyer.The judge, N Anand Venkatesh, even undertook counselling to understand the identity and vulnerabilities of the petitioners, and invited Dr Gummaraju to write a report on the issue. ‚ÄúOriginally, I‚Äôd only sought to impart basic gender/sexuality literacy to justice Venkatesh. However, I believed my report would be incomplete without details of the hopelessly transphobic and queerphobic chapters in the Indian medical syllabus that normalise horrific violence and discrimination at the hands of doctors,‚Äù said Dr Gummaraju. She said these textbooks invalidated her existence and that of thousands of other queer and trans medical students and patients alike. ‚ÄúNow, there is something to slap across the faces of doctors who have practiced discrimination and called it ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô,‚Äù she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amend-discriminatory-info-on-lgbtqia-nmc-to-institutes-101634149481724.html
14-10-2021||India||India rejects China stand on V-P‚Äôs Arunachal tour||India on Wednesday angrily rejected China‚Äôs objection to a visit to Arunachal Pradesh by vice president M Venkaiah Naidu and again called on the Chinese side to work for the speedy resolution of the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The terse exchange between the two countries highlighted tensions caused by the standoff in eastern Ladakh, which has dragged on for more than a year-and-half, and fresh face-offs between troops of the two sides in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh sectors of the LAC.Naidu made a two-day visit to Arunachal Pradesh over the weekend as part of a tour of the northeast, and addressed a special session of the state assembly in Itanagar on Saturday. Responding to a question on the visit from state-run media, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing doesn‚Äôt recognise Arunachal Pradesh (as part of India) and is firmly opposed to visits to the region by Indian leaders.Hours later, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi rejected China‚Äôs objection to the visit and asserted that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India.‚ÄúWe have noted the comments made today [Wednesday] by the Chinese official spokesperson. We reject such comments. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India,‚Äù Bagchi said.‚ÄúIndian leaders routinely travel to the state of Arunachal Pradesh as they do to any other state of India. Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of Indian people,‚Äù he said.India‚Äôs demand for China to speed up the resolution of the standoff in eastern Ladakh was reiterated by Bagchi, who again accused the Chinese side of causing tensions along the LAC through unilateral attempts to ‚Äúalter the status quo‚Äù in the border areas.‚ÄúFurther, as we have mentioned earlier, the current situation along the LAC in the Western Sector of the India-China border areas has been caused by unilatteral attempts of Chinese side to alter the status quo in violation of the bilateral agreements,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúTherefore, we expect the Chinese side to work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols rather than trying to link unrelated issues,‚Äù Bagchi added.The raising of Naidu‚Äôs visit to Arunachal Pradesh by Chinese state-run media was an indication that Beijing intentionally raked up the issued against the backdrop of the lingering tensions due to the LAC standoff.Replying to a question from Xinjiang Television, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao said: ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs position on the boundary issue is consistent and clear. The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh established unilaterally and illegally by the Indian side and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader‚Äôs visit to the area concerned.‚ÄùZhao added, ‚ÄúWe urge the Indian side to earnestly respect China‚Äôs major concerns, stop taking any action that would complicate and expand the boundary issue and refrain from undermining mutual trust and bilateral relations. It should instead take real concrete actions to maintain peace and stability in the China-India border areas and help bring bilateral relations back on the track of sound and steady development.‚ÄùDuring his address to Arunachal Pradesh assembly, Naidu highlighted the transformation of the northeast and said this was evidence of resurgence in the region‚Äôs development after being neglected for decades.China has often objected to visits to Arunachal Pradesh by Indian leaders and even the Dalai Lama as part of its efforts to lay claim to the region, which Beijing refers to as ‚ÄúSouth Tibet‚Äù.The latest exchange between the foreign ministries of India and China came two days after a meeting of senior military commanders was unable to make any progress on disengagement and de-escalation at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.Both countries doubled down on their positions, and the Indian said the Chinese side ‚Äúwas not agreeable‚Äù and ‚Äúcould not provide any forward-looking proposals‚Äù in response to constructive suggestions for ending the standoff on the LAC. A spokesperson for China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) contended India was making ‚Äúunreasonable and unrealistic‚Äù demands.New Delhi has insisted that it is necessary to end the LAC standoff to ensure progress in the overall bilateral relations. Chinese leaders have said in recent months that the border issue should be delinked from other aspects of the bilateral relationship, a suggestion rejected by the Indian side.The standoff on the LAC emerged in the open on May 5 last year following a violent clash in Pangong Lake area. Twenty Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed in a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020. Following several rounds military and diplomatic talks, the two sides withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra area in August.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said India has no option but to continue dialogue with China even as it strengthens its infrastructure, defences and countervailing measures. ‚ÄúIndia should not be in a hurry. The Chinese side will always test your nerve and push the envelope, but two can play the same game,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúChina believes time is on their side, and one shouldn‚Äôt be taken in by their rhetoric,‚Äù he said, noting that it had taken the two countries nine years to resolve a face-off at Sumdorong Chu in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-china-s-objection-to-vp-s-visit-to-arunachal-demands-resolution-of-lac-standoff-101634124759738.html
14-10-2021||India||PM Modi launches mega infra connectivity plan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched a national master plan for multi-modal connectivity to ensure integrated planning and implementation of infrastructure projects in the next four years, with focus on expediting works on the ground, saving costs and creating jobs.The online ‚Äúholistic governance‚Äù system ‚Äì PM Gati Shakti ‚Äì aims to reduce logistics costs and boost the economy with a planned National Infrastructure Pipeline of over ‚Çπ111 lakh crore.The Prime Minister said that with the resolve of ‚ÄúAtmanirbhar Bharat‚Äù (self-reliant India), the foundation for the next 25 years is being laid, and it will provide ‚ÄúGati Shakti (speed and power) to the 21st century India‚Äù.‚ÄúPM Gati Shakti Master Plan not only brings together governmental processes and various stakeholders, but also helps to connect different modes of transportation. This is an extension of holistic governance,‚Äù Modi said while institutionalising an integrated approach of implementing infrastructure projects initially by 16 central ministries. He also inaugurated a new exhibition complex at Pragati Maidan in the national capital.PM Gati Shakti joins different departments for the coordinated development of projects, from road to railways, aviation to agriculture, Modi said. It involves the creation of a common umbrella platform through which infrastructure projects can be planned and implemented in an efficacious manner by way of coordination between various ministries/departments on a real-time basis.The integrated approach is in line with the government‚Äôs plan to raise capital expenditure to boost the economy. Union finance minter Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech on February 1, announced a ‚Çπ5.54 lakh crore capital expenditure (capex) plan in the current financial year. In August, she also unveiled a ‚Çπ6 lakh crore plan to monetise the central government‚Äôs brownfield assets in four years, which is coterminous with the ‚Çπ111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP).Saying that an integrated approach will change the perception behind the age-old signage, ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù indicating incomplete infrastructure projects, PM Modi added that the signage had become ‚Äúthe symbol of lack of trust‚Äù, but ‚Äútoday‚Äôs, 21st century India is leaving behind this old systems and practices‚Äù.‚ÄúToday‚Äôs mantra is ‚Äì ‚ÄòWork for Progress‚Äô, ‚ÄòWealth for Progress‚Äô, ‚ÄòPlan for progress‚Äô, ‚ÄòPreference for progress‚Äô... We have not only developed a work culture of completing the projects within the stipulated time frame but efforts are now being made to complete the projects ahead of time,‚Äù he said.Modi said that during a review of infrastructure projects in 2014, he found that hundreds of projects were incomplete due to the lack of departmental coordination. He brought all projects on a single platform and tried to remove hurdles. ‚ÄúNow the focus is on avoiding delays due to lack of coordination... Because of this, many unfinished projects are being completed,‚Äù he said.The PM said the change in approach has resulted in expeditious completion of infra projects. Before 2014, only 1,900km of railway lines underwent doubling. But, in the last seven years, more than 9,000km of railway lines have been doubled. Only 3,000km of railway lines were electrified before 2014, but in the last seven years, more than 24,000km of railway tracks have been electrified, he said. Similarly, before 2014, only 60 gram panchayats were connected with optical fibre, which is now expanded to 150,000 panchayats in just seven years.Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Piyush Goyal, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Hardeep Singh Puri, Ashwini Vaishnaw and Sarbananda Sonowal were present at Wednesday‚Äôs event.PM Modi said infrastructure had not been a priority for most of the political parties as it was not even visible in their manifesto. Now, some opposition parties are criticising the construction of necessary infrastructure, he said. It is globally accepted that the creation of quality infrastructure is the way for sustainable development, which gives rise to several economic activities and creates employment on a large scale, he added.Speaking at the event, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said: ‚ÄúThis is yet another example where India is setting a global benchmark for digital governance... Building and managing high-quality infrastructure is a national enterprise. Furthermore, roads and rivers do not respect state boundaries. A holistic approach to infrastructure therefore has to navigate the challenges of working through a complex federal system. It is almost like conducting a grand yet complex orchestra. The outcome is a symphony like Gati Shakti.‚ÄùAccording to Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president TV Narendran, the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan is ‚Äúa game changer for industry‚Äù due to ‚Äúscale and speed‚Äù.Narendran, who is also CEO and managing director of Tata Steel Ltd, highlighted key impacts of PM Gati Shakti. ‚ÄúFirst, with a GIS based ERP system to map the existing and proposed connectivity projects, there will be immense clarity on how different regions and industrial hubs in the country are linked, particularly for last mile connectivity,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúSecond, a holistic and integrated transport connectivity strategy which incorporates roads and highways, railways, ports, airports and waterways into a single, well-targeted, synergistic network will greatly support Make in India and integrate different modes of transport,‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gati-shakti-will-expedite-infra-projects-create-jobs-and-bring-prosperity-pm-modi-101634122540736.html
