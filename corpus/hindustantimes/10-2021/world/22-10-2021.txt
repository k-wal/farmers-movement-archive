22-10-2021||World||Joe biden admin: Indian-American Neera Tanden gets big White House promotion||Indian-American Neera Tanden has been named staff secretary to President Joe Biden, a job that will put her in control of all documents headed for the president.It’s a big promotion as the post is considered to be a stepping stone to higher office - the alumni includes Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and former White House chief of staff John Podesta - it is still not a cabinet post that she was nominated to be but did not get earlier because of bipartisan opposition from lawmakers angered by her testy tweets.Neera Tanden will be the first person of colour to hold the position, and the first Indian-American.Tanden will retain her designation of White House senior adviser, in which role she has advised the president on an entire range of issues, The Washington Post said, adding, she will be reporting to White House chief of staff Ronald Klain, who announced the appointment in a morning call with his staff.President Biden had nominated her last year to head the Office of Budget and Management, which is a key cabinet post and it would have made her the first Indian-American to hold a federal cabinet position (Nikki Haley held a cabinet-rank post as President Donald Trump’s ambassador to UN).Neera Tanden’s nomination was withdrawn shortly, at her urging, in the face of persisting opposition from lawmakers who had been the target of some very vicious tweets from her in the past. She had faced intense grilling from lawmakers from both parties at two confirmations hearings.“Your attacks were not just made against Republicans,” senator Bernie Sanders, who had been a major target for her in the 2016 race for the Democratic presidential nomination. “There were vicious attacks against progressives, people who I have worked with - me personally.”President Biden named Neera Tanden a senior adviser after the confirmation fiasco and kept her on as a key member of his team. Her elevation to the post of staff secretary does not require to be confirmed by the senate.Tanden came to the Biden from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, which she headed as president and CEO. Earlier, she had served in the department of health and human services and served as an adviser to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008.Neera Tanden was born in Massachusetts in 1970 to parents from India, who divorced when she was five. Tanden and her brother were brought up by their mother. Tanden has spoken of her family banking on food coupons to get by. She went on to the University of California, Los Angeles and Yale University where she studied law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-admin-indian-american-neera-tanden-gets-big-white-house-promotion-101634918984768.html
22-10-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson says fresh Covid lockdown not on the cards||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday a new Covid-19 lockdown is not on the cards, as advisers warned that acting early with lighter measures to cut rising case numbers would reduce the need for tougher restrictions later.Johnson's government has said there is no need yet to introduce a "Plan B" involving mask mandates, work-from-home orders and vaccine passports, though such measures could be introduced if more people do not come forward for Covid-19 vaccines and booster shots.Johnson scrapped England's Covid restrictions in the summer, and he said that, while case numbers were rising, the trend was in line with what was expected.He said earlier that the widespread deployment of vaccines this year means that the link between cases and deaths has been disrupted, in contrast with earlier stages of the pandemic.Asked on Friday about the possibility of another lockdown over winter, the Conservative prime minister said: "I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that is on the cards at all."While Johnson has scrapped the legal requirement to wear masks, he said they should still be worn in confined spaces, especially when meeting strangers.Covid-19 infections in Britain are up 17.9% over the last seven days, with 52,009 reported on Thursday, and the reproduction "R" number is estimated between 1.0 and 1.2. Any figure above one suggests an exponential growth in cases."In the event of increasing case rates, earlier intervention would reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive, and longer-lasting measures," the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said in minutes from a Oct. 14 meeting, published on Friday."SAGE advises that policy work on the potential reintroduction of measures should be undertaken now so that it can be ready for rapid deployment if required."SAGE added that among Plan B measures, reintroduction of work-from-home guidance would have the biggest impact to cut transmission, and warned that "presenteeism" might become an increasing reason for contagion in the workplace.Behaviour ChangeThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday found that Covid-19 prevalence had risen again. One of the areas with highest prevalence was southwest England, which was impacted by false negative test results from a lab that was suspended last week.The ONS said Covid prevalence was at its highest level since January, when England had just entered a third national lockdown, although deaths are much lower.The current rise in cases has been fuelled by high levels of infections in secondary schools, where 7.8% of children were infected in the latest week, according to ONS statistics.Though young people are less likely to fall seriously ill, ONS figures show the rise in cases there is now feeding through into older age groups.Johnson has said that the government will rely on vaccines rather than lockdowns to navigate a difficult winter, and SAGE said that things were unlikely to be as bad as last winter."Scenarios modelled for the coming winter and into 2022 suggest Covid-19 hospital admissions above the level seen in January 2021 are increasingly unlikely, but there are uncertainties around behaviour change and waning immunity," the minutes said.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was investigating a Delta subvariant of the coronavirus called AY.4.2 as it was possibly more transmissible than Delta, though there was no evidence that it caused more severe disease or rendered vaccines ineffective."It is not unexpected that new variants will continue to arise as the pandemic goes on, particularly while the case rate remains high," UKHSA chief executive Jenny Harries said."However, it should serve as objective evidence that this pandemic is not over."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-says-fresh-covid-lockdown-not-on-the-cards-101634916365349.html
22-10-2021||World||Joe Biden vows to defend Taiwan if attacked by China||The United States will defend Taiwan if it is attacked by China, President Joe Biden said, seemingly changing long-standing American “strategic ambiguity” on the issue.“Yes,” Biden said at a Town Hall hosted by CNN when asked by the anchor, Anderson Cooper, if the US will come to Taiwan’s defence if attacked by China. “Yes, we have a commitment to do that,” the US president said further when the anchor pressed him, on Thursday.Joe Biden’s remarks came just a day after his pick for ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, told US senators at his confirmation hearing that “strategic autonomy” in relation to Taiwan is working and there is no need to change it.The United States recognises China’s claims over Taiwan under its One-China Policy, but under the Taiwan Relations Act, it is committed to helping the island nation defend itself against China. The United States provides Taiwan with massive amounts of military hardware to that end.But the US has kept its commitment to coming to Taiwan’s defence in the event of its invasion by China vague, which is defined as “strategic ambiguity”.President Joe Biden seemingly changed that.The White House sought to walk back his comments. “The president was not announcing any change in our policy, and there is no change in our policy,” a White House spokesperson said after the Town Hall. “The US defence relationship with Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act. We will uphold our commitment under the act, we will continue to support Taiwan’s self-defence, and we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.”That indeed remains the policy of the Joe Biden administration as stated by Nicholas Burns at the hearing. “My own view, and this is also the view ... more importantly of the Biden administration, is that the smartest and effective way for us to help deter aggressive actions by [China] across the Taiwan Strait will be to stay with a policy that’s been in place,” he said in response to a senator’s remarks that Beijing takes strategic ambiguity as a sign of weakness. “This is a policy that can succeed if we execute it consistently and with some strength.”He further said: “We recognise the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. And, yet we have unofficial relations with Taiwan, and we have under the Taiwan Relations Act the ability, in fact, the imperative, of helping Taiwan to defend itself. Every president, Republican and Democrat, has followed that policy.”The United States has been closely watching recent escalation in tensions between China and Taiwan. Beijing sent a “record number” of warplanes close to Taiwan earlier this month forcing a top Taiwanese defence official say that tensions were at their worst in 40 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-to-defend-taiwan-if-attacked-by-china-101634911841956.html
22-10-2021||World||Pfizer says Covid-19 vaccine more than 90% effective in 5- to 11-year-old kids||Kid-size doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine appear safe and nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infections in 5- to 11-year-olds, according to study details released Friday as the U.S. considers opening vaccinations to that age group.The shots could begin early next month — with the first children in line fully protected by Christmas — if regulators give the go-ahead.Details of Pfizer's study were posted online Friday. Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will publicly debate the evidence next week.The FDA is expected to post its independent review of the company’s safety and effectiveness data later Friday. If the FDA ultimately authorizes the shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make the final decision on who should receive them in early November.Full-strength Pfizer shots already are authorized for anyone 12 or older, but pediatricians and many parents are anxiously awaiting protection for younger children to stem rising infections from the extra-contagious delta variant and help keep kids in school.More than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers already have signed up to get the shots into little arms.The Biden administration has purchased enough kid-size doses — in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine — for the nation’s roughly 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds. If the vaccine is cleared, millions of doses will be promptly shipped around the country, along with kid-size needles.A Pfizer study tracked 2,268 kids in that age group who got two shots three weeks apart of either a placebo or the low-dose vaccine. Each dose was one-third the amount given to teens and adults.Researchers calculated the low-dose vaccine was nearly 91% effective, based on 16 Covid-19 cases in youngsters given dummy shots versus three cases among vaccinated children. There were no severe illnesses reported among any of the youngsters but the vaccinated ones had much milder symptoms than their unvaccinated counterparts.In addition, young children given the low-dose shots developed coronavirus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teens and young adults who got regular-strength vaccinations.That’s important information considering that hospitalizations of mostly unvaccinated children reached record levels last month.The CDC reported earlier this week that even as the delta mutant surged between June and September, Pfizer vaccinations were 93% effective at preventing hospitalizations among 12- to 18-year-olds.Pfizer’s study of younger kids found the low-dose shots proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary side effects such as sore arms, fever or achiness that teens experience.The study isn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose, mostly in young men.While children run a lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, Covid-19 has killed more than 630 Americans 18 and under, according to the CDC. Nearly 6.2 million children have been infected with the coronavirus, more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks as the delta mutant surged, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.Moderna also is studying its Covid-19 shots in elementary school-age youngsters. Pfizer and Moderna are studying even younger children as well, down to 6-month-olds. Results are expected later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-covid-19-vaccine-more-than-90-effective-in-5-to-11-year-old-kids-101634905400159.html

The attackers, carrying guns, killed three teachers, two volunteers and a student in the world's largest refugee settlement.The violence erupted when one of the groups opened fire, killing four people at the scene, Police superintendent Shihab Kaiser Khan said. Two others succumbed to their injuries in the hospital."A drive is underway to arrest those responsible for the incident," Khan told Reuters. One Rohingya man with weapons and ammunition had been taken into custody, he said.It was unclear as to why the violence broke out, but the local media reported that the two sides clashed over establishing supremacy in the camp over an illegal drug business. A few Rohingya groups are known to be involved in crimes such as kidnapping and ransom-seeking, Bangladeshi officials have said, and they use the refugee camps to smuggle drugs from Myanmar.The attack comes three weeks after the murder of Mohibullah, a key international representative for Rohingya refugees, in the same sub-district of Ukhiya. Several arrests have been made in this case.More than a million Rohingya refugees inhabit in camps in southern Bangladesh, with most having fled neighbouring Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2007.These settlements grew increasingly violent, as per reports, with armed gangs vying for power, kidnapping critics and warning women against breaking conservative Islamic norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-dead-in-violent-clash-between-rohingya-refugee-groups-in-cox-bazar-101634891476206.html

Li Yundi, 39, and a 29-year-old woman, were detained by the police of Chaoyang district in Beijing on Thursday night.They admitted to the “illegal behaviour” and have been placed under administrative detention, the district police were quoted as saying by local media.Li Yundi, a national icon, wasn’t initially identified by the police who made public the news of the arrest through a cryptic post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.A Weibo post written by the Beijing police on Thursday night, which carried the picture of a piano keyboard, said: “This world is indeed more than black and white, but black and white must be distinguished apart. Make no mistake...”People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China later identified Li Yundi as the person picked up by the police.Li is a celebrity in China where learning piano is hugely popular among children and youth.Li was the youngest pianist, at 18, to win the XIV International Chopin Piano Competition in 2000. In 2015, he served as a judge for the competition.Besides performing across the world, the pianist had also performed several times at China’s national broadcaster, CCTV’s annual Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, Gala, an annual show watched by hundreds of millions in China.On Sina Weibo, the hashtag, “Li Yundi detained for soliciting prostitute,” soared to the top of search rankings after just a few minutes, the Global Times reported.Li Yundi’s verified personal tags on Weibo, which had previously been described as “an international pianist, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a member of the Standing Committee of All-China Youth Federation, and the vice-president of the Hong Kong United Youth Association”, had been revoked and amended to “an international pianist,” the Global Times reported on Friday.The Chinese Musicians’ Association on Friday announced the removal of Li’s membership, for posing “extremely negative social impact”.A documentary film on Li and his rise in the world of classical piano music, titled The Young Romantic was released in 2010.“There are at least 20 million aspiring concert pianists in China. To all of them, Yundi is a hero. The Young Romantic, a documentary portrait of Chinese pianist Yundi - formerly called Yundi Li - captures the poetic intensity of this young virtuoso as he works with the great Maestro Seiji Ozawa to prepare for his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic,” is how the documentary is described on IMDB, a popular online data base on movies.“This is interwoven with Yundi on tour in his home country, where we meet his family, gain insight into his upbringing and are exposed to the massive scale of piano culture in China,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/li-yundi-china-s-prince-of-piano-arrested-for-soliciting-sex-worker-101634891860102.html

22-10-2021||World||'No room for compromise': China tells US to act with caution over Taiwan||China on Friday urged Washington to tread carefully on Taiwan after president Joe Biden said the US would defend the self-ruled island from attacks by Beijing. “China has no room for compromise on issues involving its core interests,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, warning that Washington “should act and speak cautiously on the Taiwan issue.”Authoritarian China regards self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to one day seize the island, by force if needed. Beijing's saber-rattling has ramped up in recent years, exacerbating fears the island of 23 million people could become a major global flashpoint.Joe Biden said on Thursday that the United States would defend Taiwan if the island were attacked by China, a declaration welcomed by the democratic island that risks fury from Beijing. However, Biden's statement was at odds with the long-held US policy known as "strategic ambiguity," where Washington helps build Taiwan's defenses but does not explicitly promise to come to the island's help. The policy is designed to deter a Chinese invasion and also discourage Taiwan from formally declaring independence, something Beijing regards as a red line.At a CNN town hall on Thursday, Biden was asked whether the US would come to Taiwan's defence if China invaded. “Yes,” he responded. “We have a commitment to that.” Biden's comments were welcomed on Friday by Taiwan, which has pushed to bolster international alliances to protect itself from Beijing.“The US government has demonstrated, through actual actions, their rock-solid support for Taiwan,” presidential office spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement.Biden had made a similar pledge in August during an interview with ABC, insisting that the US would always defend key allies, including Taiwan, despite the withdrawal from Afghanistan in the face of the victorious Taliban. The White House subsequently told reporters on both occasions that US policy on Taiwan “has not changed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-room-for-compromise-china-tells-us-to-act-with-caution-over-taiwan-101634889792533.html
22-10-2021||World||Beijing begins Covid booster shots four months ahead of Winter Olympics||Authorities in China have started offering booster shots against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Beijing and surrounding regions, four months before the capital city hosts the Winter Olympics, local media reports said.Beijing rolled out its booster campaign earlier this week and shots will be administered to those taking part or organising the Olympics. In addition, the Chinese capital will administer booster shots to people aged 18 and above who have been fully vaccinated and belong to at-risk groups.The Winter Olympics will begin on February 4 next year. Only residents from China will be allowed in the stands. The government will also mandate a three-week quarantine upon arrival for athletes who are not fully inoculated with vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or other national authorities, according to news agency Bloomberg.Authorities will enact a “closed-loop” which will limit the movement of participants to games venues and other related facilities, with designated transport. A book detailing virus countermeasures for the games might be released soon, Bloomberg further reported.Till now, Beijing has administered both vaccine doses to over 97% of its adult population. The Chinese capital, along with the whole country, has been adhering to a relentless zero-Covid approach with stringent border closures and targeted lockdowns.China, the country from where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, has for far reported 96,665 cases, 4,636 deaths, 91,511 recoveries and 518 active cases due to the viral disease. On Thursday, the country reported 43 new cases of which 28 were locally transmitted.In attempts to get rid of a new outbreak linked to a group of tourists, authorities in China have closed schools, cancelled hundreds of flights and have ramped up mass testing.The new outbreak is traced to an elderly couple who were in a group of other tourists, according to AFP. They had started their trip in Shanghai before going to Xi'an, Gansu province and Inner Mongolia. Dozens of infections have since been linked to their journey, with close contacts in five provinces and regions, including Beijing.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-begins-covid-booster-shots-four-months-ahead-of-winter-olympics-101634883597250.html

However, there have been no fatalities, the CDC said. Most of the cases were reported in August and September and largely from Texas and Oklahoma.The company has also informed health officials that since onions can be stored for months, it may still be in homes and businesses. Consumers have, as a result, been advised to avoid whole fresh red, white, or yellow onions imported from Chihuahua and distributed by ProSource.What is salmonella infection?Salmonellosis or salmonella infection is a bacterial disease caused by the Salmonella group of bacteria that typically cause gastronomical illnesses. According to the CDC, in some cases, it can also cause typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever.Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that usually begin six hours to six days after developing the infection through contaminated food.Some strains of the bacteria can also cause infection in urine, blood, bones, joints, or the nervous system (spinal fluid and brain), and can cause severe disease.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also launched an investigation into the outbreak, along with the CDC and local authorities. “We will provide updates as we learn more,” it said.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/salmonella-outbreak-over-650-fall-ill-in-us-from-disease-tied-to-onions-here-s-more-101634881279051.html

So far this year the total is already double that at 692, as of October 22.There has also been a steady increase in sorties using the kind of planes that would be used to strike Taiwan were an invasion to take place, including the nuclear-capable H6 bomber.In September 2020, the month that year with the highest number of sorties, Taiwan recorded incursions by 32 fighters and three bombers.So far this month, there have been 124 fighter jet incursions and 16 by bombers.Still, analysts say the threat posed by these incursions should not be exaggerated.The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan's territorial airspace.Instead it includes a larger area that overlaps with part of China's own air defence identification zone -- and even covers some of the mainland.Nonetheless, it bears noting that until last year China very rarely crossed into the southwestern sector at all."These are part of what we call 'grey zone' tactics, it keeps psychological pressure on Taiwan," Lee Hsi-min, a retired admiral who stepped down as head of Taiwan's armed forces in 2019, told AFP.Greyzone is a term used by military analysts to describe aggressive actions by a state that stop short of open warfare -- what British defence secretary Ben Wallace has described as "the limbo land between peace and war".Taiwan has seen a surge in these kinds of threats since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, whom China's leaders loathe because she views the island as sovereign and not part of Beijing's "one China".Lee cited grey zone measures such as ramped up cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns to a massive increase in Chinese dredgers taking sand from waters surrounding Kinmen and Matsu, two Taiwanese islands just a few kilometres from the mainland.The ADIZ incursions, he added, allowed China to "improve pilot training", including the occasional night-time sorties, as well as test Taiwan's own defences.They also keep Taiwan's already ageing fleet of fighters under stress. There have been multiple fatal crashes blamed on mechanical failures.'Perfect storm'China, which has vowed to one day seize Taiwan, says little about its ADIZ incursions.But analysts say they send a message to three targets: Taiwan's government and people, China's increasingly nationalist domestic audience, and western powers.This month's record incursions came after naval exercises in the Pacific attended by multiple navies, including two US and one British aircraft carriers and a Japanese helicopter destroyer.It also came after Washington's recent deal to share nuclear submarine technology with Australia and confirmation that US special forces were training Taiwanese troops."Beijing wants to demonstrate that it will not be intimidated by regional security alliances in the making, which undoubtedly are aimed at China," J Michael Cole, an expert with the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute."(It) also demonstrates to a domestic audience that it is not complacent about developments that favour Taiwan," he told AFP.The United States has long maintained a policy of "strategic ambiguity" towards Taiwan, selling its arms without explicitly promising to come to the island's help.But President Joe Biden has now twice stated that US forces would defend Taiwan's people if China made a move on them.While the ADIZ incursions remain far out to sea, many fear the rise in sorties increases the risk of a crash, collision or mistake that could spark a wider war.President Xi Jinping, China's most authoritarian leader since Mao Zedong, has made seizing Taiwan a key pledge as he engineers a third term push next year.China's increased forcefulness has prompted the US and Taiwanese officials to publicly warn that Beijing could be ready to invade in just a few years.Jia Qingguo, an international relations expert at Peking University who advises the Chinese government, published a stark paper earlier this summer in which he warned a "perfect storm" was brewing in the Taiwan Strait.Beijing's more aggressive treatment of Taiwan in recent years was "shaped by its growing military capabilities and increasing domestic demands for unification," he argued.China also feels pressured to act now against the growing relationship between Taiwan and the United States, where defending Taipei has become a rare bipartisan issue."The three sides have seen their interactions caught in a vicious spiral, making a military confrontation and even an all-out war an increasingly likely scenario," Jia warned.Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said Taipei "should be more vigilant but it needn't be over-worried".An amphibious landing across the Taiwan Strait, he told AFP, still remains "the most complex military operation and if any part of the process is undermined, the operation would fail"."(China) could start a war but whether it could win it is a different thing," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-steps-up-psychological-pressure-on-taiwan-with-grey-zone-jet-incursions-101634881944483.html
22-10-2021||World||Islamic State, Al-Qaeda have increased online propaganda, warns FATF||The Islamic State and Al-Qaeda have increased online propaganda to incite unaffiliated individuals to launch attacks and to raise funds since last year and the risk of “self-financed, radicalised lone actor terrorists” is significant, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has warned.The multilateral watchdog expressed “grave concern” over a series of terror attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq and other regions, including Africa and South Asia, in a special statement issued at the conclusion of its plenary meeting on Thursday. The plenary is the decision-making body of FATF, and delegates representing 205 members of the Global Network and observer organisations, including the International Monetary Fund and the UN, participated in the hybrid meeting.“The threat of terrorism remains serious in many regions of the world,” the statement said, adding that the recent terror attacks, claimed either by Islamic State or Da’esh and its “affiliated groups, or conducted by lone attackers inspired by them”, had killed or injured hundreds, mostly civilians. “Since 2020, both ISIL and Al-Qaeda have increased their online propaganda, either to incite unaffiliated individuals to launch attacks, or to raise funds. The risk of self-financed, radicalised lone actor terrorists remains significant,” the statement said. FATF concluded that both groups have “increasingly turned to new payment technologies to raise, move and deploy funds”, and the use of virtual assets by terrorists remains a risk. “In addition, the risk emanating from expansion of affiliates of ISIL and Al-Qaeda has been increasing over the past years,” the watchdog said. Both Islamic State and Al-Qaeda have a presence in Afghanistan, which was taken over by the Taliban following the collapse of the elected government in mid-August. In a separate statement also issued on Thursday, FATF had warned “about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment” in Afghanistan. The territorial defeat of the Islamic State in 2019 had significantly impacted its ability to generate revenue, but the group is “still able to raise and receive funds, through legal and illegal sources, and maintains roughly $25-50 million in reserves”, FATF said. “These funds help the group to sustain some activities and to seek a potential resurgence. Proceeds generated from criminal activities remain an important financing source for ISIL,” it added. In order to increase its revenues, the Islamic State has “focused on looting local civilians and businesses, and has generated funds through kidnapping for ransom, extortion of oil networks in Eastern Syria, and possibly through the trafficking of human beings and the trafficking of antiquities previously looted”. The group also “generates funds from investments in small and medium-sized businesses”.On the other hand, Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have “consistent streams of revenue generated from various sources, including contributions and donations from their supporters, proceeds generated from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and illicit taxation of smuggled goods, as well as revenues generated from investments in legal businesses”. In some instances, these terror groups collected and transferred funds under the disguise of charitable activities.While continuing with its focus on countering terror financing, the FATF has completed projects to analyse the terrorist financing risks associated with illegal arms trafficking and with ethnically or racially motivated terrorism. It has launched projects to study money laundering and terror financing risks emanating from migrant smuggling. The watchdog is also gathering and sharing information on the financing of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates, and will produce “updated risk indicators to help the public and private sectors detect terrorist financing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-expresses-grave-concern-says-islamic-state-al-qaeda-have-increased-online-propaganda-101634879981297.html
22-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada lifts advisory on non-essential travel abroad||The Canadian government has removed its global travel advisory on all non-essential travel outside the country. The caution had been in place since the spring of 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic first spread internationally and into Canada.That advisory was updated on Thursday even as the Canadian government also announced the launch of a vaccine passport, a standardised certification of being fully vaccinated, to facilitate domestic and international travel.However, it has retained the stringent requirement for direct flights to India, keeping in place the need to get a negative RT-PCR test result, taken within 18 hours of departure, from a single laboratory based at Delhi airport.This testing requirement was enforced as the earlier ban on direct passenger flights from India was lifted on September 27. Travellers will still need to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 molecular test from the approved Genestrings Laboratory at the Delhi airport taken within 18 hours of the scheduled departure of their direct flight to Canada and “present the test report with a QR code issued by this laboratory to the air operator before boarding”.“Airlines will refuse boarding to any traveller who’s unable to meet these requirements,” it stressed. These measures have been maintained even as airlines ramp up operations between the two countries with Air Canada announcing a new direct flight from Delhi to Montreal. That city in Quebec will join Toronto and Vancouver with direct flights connecting India and Canada. “Starting October 31, just in time for Diwali celebrations, Air Canada will offer three flights per week to the growing Indian community in Montreal,” the airline had said. It has also increased the frequency of its flights between Toronto and Delhi to ten per week.As per the India-specific travel advisory, Canadians have been asked to “exercise a high degree of caution due to the threat of terrorist attacks throughout the country”. In particular, it warns against all travel to the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir “due to the unpredictable security situation. There is a threat of terrorism, militancy, civil unrest and kidnapping”. That warning excludes the union territory of Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-lifts-advisory-on-non-essential-travel-abroad-101634879978760.html

The move is likely to boost tourism, a sector the Asian country's economy is majorly dependent on.On Thursday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said travellers from these 46 countries can skip mandatory quarantine as long as they arrive via air, are fully inoculated and have a document to show they are Covid-19 free.The quarantine-free travel list also includes most of the countries in the European Union, Australia, Singapore, Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.Earlier, the government announced the mandatory quarantine requirement would end for at least 10 countries, including the US, China, the UK and Singapore.Two days ago, government officials inspected the readiness of Thailand's airports to welcome quarantine-free travellers."The entire time a visitor will spend from getting through the terminal gates to leaving the airport would take no more than 25 minutes," transport minister Saksiam Chidchob told reporters after paying a visit to Bangkok's Don Muang airport on Wednesday, according to news agency Reuters.Chidchod said travellers and investors from at least 10 countries that are in health-safe zones and are also doing great financially could visit Thailand.According to a Royal Gazette issued on Thursday, the capital city of Bangkok and other key tourist spots will be reopened once the curfews are lifted at the end of this month.Reuters further reported that in 2020, Thailand lost about $50 billion in tourism revenue, an 82% drop. This year, just 1,00,000 travellers from abroad are expected to visit the country, the tourism authority of Thailand said.Thailand has so far reported 18,31,389 cases due to the coronavirus disease which include 18,625 deaths, 1,02,317 active cases (at present) and 17,10,447 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-from-november-1-thailand-to-allow-quarantine-free-travel-from-46-nations-101634872074036.html
22-10-2021||World||Bangladesh: ‘Over 3,600 attacks’ on Hindus since 2013, rights groups concerned||With recent violent attacks against Hindus reopening old wounds for religious minorities in Bangladesh, human rights groups have now pointed out that such attacks often go unpunished in the Muslim-majority country even when there has been a “continual pattern” over nearly a decade.According to estimates provided by a Deutsche Welle report citing Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), a Bangladeshi human rights organisation that documents attacks on minority communities, there have been over 3,600 attacks in Bangladesh targeting Hindus since 2013. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), however, told the news agency the actual number of attacks could be much higher than what the ASK has estimated.The study found the attacks against Hindus over the eight years include cases of vandalism and arson targeting over 550 houses and 440 shops and businesses. More than 1,670 cases of vandalism and arson attacks on Hindu temples, idols, and places of worship were also reported during the same period.Also Read | Bangladesh riots: Prime suspect Iqbal Hossain arrested from Cox's BazarAs many as 11 members of the Hindu community died in these violent incidents, while another 862 were injured. Several instances of sexual assault against Hindu women were also reported during this time.Rana Dasgupta, the general secretary of the BHBCUC, also said the real extent of these damages could be much higher. “Although Hindus were also attacked in the 1990s and 2000s, we have been observing a continual pattern of such attacks since 2011, which is alarming,” he said. “We thought the Hindu community would have a better life under the Awami League government, but that didn't happen.”In Bangladesh, Hindus now comprise less than nine per cent of the total population. The census numbers have shown a marked reduction in the Hindu population over the past four decades, as per the report citing government data. It shows that over the course of the last 40 years, the percentage of the Hindu population of Bangladesh declined from 13.5% to 8.5%.Dasgupta said security crisis was the chief reason behind Hindus leaving Bangladesh for neighbouring India, although economic reasons also played a part. “The reason behind the attacks is to drive away minorities from their homes, to minimise the minority population of Bangladesh,” he said.Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh often unpunishedDasgupta blamed religious fundamentalists, particularly supporters of Bangladesh's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami, for attacks on the Hindu community. However, the party has been largely inactive after many of its leaders were executed a few years ago for war crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.Zunaid Saki, the chief coordinator of the left-wing political party Ganasamhati Andolon, told DW the Awami League condemns the attacks, but does little to stop them from happening again.Saki has visited many locations where attacks against the Hindu community have taken place in recent years.“The pattern of these attacks is the same: First, something is posted on Facebook and is marked as ‘insulting to Islam’ by others, and then a group of people attack a particular spot where religious minorities live,” he said.“The ruling Awami League party blames religious fundamentalists after the attack and vows to take action against the culprits. But nothing happens afterward, and nobody gets punished for the attacks.”Several Hindu temples in Bangladesh were ransacked last week during violent protests triggered by video footage that showed the Quran – the holy book in Islam – being placed at the feet of a Hindu idol during Durga Puja celebrations in the country. (With inputs from DW)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-over-3-600-attacks-on-hindus-since-2013-rights-groups-concerned-101634868827734.html
22-10-2021||World||Bangladesh riots: Prime suspect Iqbal Hossain arrested from Cox's Bazar||Hours after one Iqbal Hossain was identified by the Bangladesh police as the key suspect in instigating the recent violence in Comilla and other places, he was arrested from Cox's Bazar on Thursday, according to a report by Dhaka Tribune that cited the Comilla superintendent of police (SP), Faruk Ahmed.The senior officer said Hossain, who was earlier accused of keeping the Islamic holy book Quran at a Durga Puja venue, was nabbed from the Shugandha beach area of Cox's Bazar around 10.10pm.The Bangladeshi newspaper also cited Cox's Bazar additional police superintendent Md Rafiqul Islam, who confirmed the development and said Hossain was sent to Comilla “right away” after the arrest.The 35-year-old Hossain, hailing from the Suhanagar area of Comilla, allegedly placed the Holy Quran at one of the Durga Puja pandals on October 13, which triggered the violence killing at least three persons. The man was identified after police analysed hours of video footage from CCTV cameras installed at Durga Puja venues.Hossain, in the footage, could be seen taking the Quran from a local mosque and entering a Durga Puja site. He was later seen walking away with a club, taken from an idol of Lord Hanuman.Several Hindu temples in Bangladesh were ransacked later amid violent protests after the video footage went viral on social media posts that showed the Quran being placed at the feet of a Hindu idol. On Sunday, a mob damaged 66 houses and set on fire at least 20 homes of Hindus.Police said over 450 suspected temple attackers have been arrested so far in different parts of the country. Forty-one of them have been arrested for the Comilla incident and four of them are Hossain's associates.The attacks on Hindus in the Muslim-majority country are, however, not new; human rights groups say there has been a “continual pattern” of attacks on religious minorities over nearly a decade and the recent spree in violence has only managed to reopen old wounds. According to estimates provided by a Deutsche Welle report citing Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), a Bangladeshi human rights organisation that documents attacks on minority communities, there have been over 3,600 attacks in Bangladesh targeting Hindus since 2013. Other groups, however, note that the actual number of attacks could be much higher than what the ASK has estimated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-prime-accused-iqbal-hossain-arrested-from-cox-s-bazar-101634872140455.html

For more than a week, the country has recorded over 40,000 cases. On Thursday, the daily tally crossed the 50,000-mark with 52,009 people testing positive for the virus, the highest single-day increase since July 17. As many as 115 patients died from related complications, while another 29,000 recovered during the day.At present, the UK has 14,44,489 active cases, while the cumulative tallies stand at 86,41,221 infections, 1,39,146 deaths and 70,57,586 recoveries.On Wednesday, health minister Sajid Javid said daily cases in the UK could rise up to 1,00,000, adding the pandemic was not over yet.Increase in Covid-19 hospitalisationsBesides the rise in cases, there has also been an increase in the number of hospital admissions. On Thursday, 959 patients were hospitalised, pushing the total number of admissions to over 563,000. Health care facilities are once again on the brink of being overwhelmed ahead of winter.“Everything is hitting us at once,” Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London said, according to a New York Times report. “We’re in a no man’s land,” Spector, who is leading a major study of Covid-19 symptoms, added.No fresh restrictions at presentDespite the increased spread of the virus, the Boris Johnson government has said no fresh restrictions will be reimposed for now. “We are looking closely at the data, we are not implementing Plan B at this point,” the health minister said on Wednesday.The UK has virtually lifted all restrictions over the past four months even as the infection rate remained high, the New York Times report said. According to the government, the rapid rollout of vaccines has weakened the link between infection and serious illness.Previously, Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, had urged the Johnson administration to bring back some restrictions such as compulsory wearing of masks in crowded places, working from home (WFH) and imposing a ban on unnecessary indoor gatherings. Several European countries, including France, have reintroduced similar curbs to contain the spread of the deadly infection.‘Watching the numbers very carefully every day’: UK PMThe Prime Minister said on Thursday that his government was watching the Covid-19 figures very carefully every day. “The numbers of infections are high but we are within the parameters of what the predictions were,” Johnson said.Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Johnson and his ministers have repeatedly faced criticism for reacting too slowly at critical stages of the pandemic.(With inputs from agencies, New York Times)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-s-daily-count-crosses-50-000-again-boris-govt-says-no-to-curbs-101634865829854.html

22-10-2021||World||Indian doctors affirm study that says 1st dose of vaccine boosts mental health||A new US study has found that the people who have received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine are less likely to experience stress. Indian doctors affirm that there is a short term effect of vaccination in boosting mental health as highlighted by the study.However, the Indian doctors emphasized the lack of a similar study in India, which could establish a correlation between vaccination and its impact on mental health.The research by the Centre for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California published recently a study in the journal PLOS that stated, "Getting the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine resulted in significant improvements in mental health beyond improvement already achieved since mental distress peaked in spring 2020."The researchers analyzed 8,003 adults who were, surveyed at regular intervals between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2021. It found out that "people who were vaccinated between December 2020 and March 2021 reported decreased mental distress levels in the surveys conducted after receiving the first dose."Talking about the US study, Dr Nand Kumar, professor and in-charge, ICMR CARE in Neuromodulation for Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi said, "I think they have covered a good sample. They have covered over 8000 people. It is a good study. But, for vaccines per se, there is no scientific data that says that there is any biological effect of the vaccine that can boost mental health. But vaccine certainly helps in improving mental health in general."Dr Kumar noted that it is not easy to compare the people who are vaccinated and who are not vaccinated on their mental health."They have looked at the short term effects of vaccination. There have used mental health questionnaire. It's not very easy to compare the people who are vaccinated and who are not vaccinated on their mental health. You need a very robust kind of randomized controlled trial. The short term is fine. A long term study requires logistic support and good funding and design. If the short term effect of the study is concerned, then, I agree with it," he stated."Certainly vaccination has improved mental health not directly but indirectly by boosting people confidence about safety that they are vaccinated and they are safe. People have become more outgoing, confident in going out and meeting people. The fear of the pandemic and that they will be affected by the virus has come down significantly. Before vaccination, there were anxiety, apprehension and fear of getting infected, fear of death," Dr Kumar added.Sharing his observation, Dr Jaswant Jangra, Senior resident Psychiatry at AIIMS New Delhi noted that people have become assured after getting vaccinated against Covid-19."The people, I have observed have become assured after getting vaccinated against Covid-19, that they won't get admitted in hospital due to the infection, that their chance of mortality would decrease after taking the Covid- 19 vaccine," said Dr Jangra.He said that he observed that his patients, especially the ones who have completed both the doses of vaccines are now feeling a bit relaxed and their relapses are less."The stress levels and anxiety level pertaining to Covid- 19 is much less," noted Dr Jangra."However, India has not done any specific studies so far and there is a need for such studies to show a positive correlation between vaccination and mental health," he added.Sharing his insight on the US study, a Psychiatrist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Dr Rajeev Mehta said, "This is not a direct effect of vaccines rather it's the impact of getting vaccinated. And it is true that it decreases anxiety levels."The purpose of the study was to examine short-term changes in mental distress after the first inoculation of the Covid-19 vaccine.The researchers who undertook the study said the results should be interpreted as the short-term direct effects of getting a first vaccine dose."The overall contribution of vaccine uptake on improving mental health outcomes is potentially much larger, as it affects not only those vaccinated but also the unvaccinated," stated the study.An unvaccinated individual may still benefit from the reduced prevalence rates in the population, may become less worried about loved ones, and may benefit from increased social and economic opportunities if the vaccine rollout results in more social and economic activity due to lower disease risk, added the study.The experts also talked about the vaccine hesitancy that the people experienced when the vaccine rollout began. People with mental illness were the worst affected."People with obsessive fear, anxiety disorder had a lot of stress regarding Covid-19. Initially, they had apprehension before vaccination. They asked me whether we should go for vaccination or not. They stressed contraindications on vaccines. However, I always suggested they go for it," said Dr Jangra."A lot of my patients had anxiety whether the jab will produce any result or its just eyewash. Even when people started going for vaccination, there were rumours that soon after getting their vaccine jab, people are got the infection, however, it is false as, it might have been because the people did not follow social distancing, or they mingled with someone who has contracted Covid or has not sanitized their hands properly while waiting in the crowd that came to vaccinate themselves," said Dr Mehta."This misbelieve also created a lot of anxiety among people who generally avoided getting vaccinated or kept postponing it," added Dr Mehta.About half of the population faced the psychological impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Poor sleep quality (40 per cent), stress (34 per cent), and psychological distress (34 per cent) were the most reported problems across various studies, stated a study published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, on the prevalence of psychological morbidities among the general population, healthcare workers, and Covid-19 patients.Dr Kumar in this regard added, "There were relapses in the mental health patients during the Covid-19 pandemic, as they were not able to meet, there was no socialization, there was intense anxiety among people regarding the disease"."About two-fifths (38.2 per cent) had anxiety and 10.5 per cent of the participants had depression. Overall, 40.5 per cent of the participants had either anxiety or depression. Moderate level of stress was reported by about three-fourth (74.1 per cent) of the participants and 71.7 per cent reported poor well-being," stated Psychological impact of Covid-19 lockdown: An online survey from India under the aegis of the Indian Psychiatry Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-doctors-affirm-study-that-says-1st-dose-of-vaccine-boosts-mental-health-101634864737697.html

The Palace said the Queen was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital in London on Wednesday for “preliminary investigations”."Following medical advice to rest for a few days, the Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, returning to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today (Thursday), and remains in good spirits," a statement read.The Queen returned to Windsor Castle on Thursday, where she has been living since March 2020 when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic struck. According to news agency AFP, the decision on self-isolation was taken because of the increased risk of infection due to her age, although she has since been vaccinated against the viral disease.On Wednesday, the 95-year-old British monarch called off her visit to Northern Ireland to mark a century since the creation of the country and Buckingham Palace said she “reluctantly” accepted medical advice to rest for a few days.In less than a fortnight, the Queen is due to host world leaders at the United Nations (UN) climate summit in Scotland.She has had a busy schedule in recent days. Last week, the Queen delivered a speech at the opening of the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff.

Khan, however, said she would "fully support efforts to reassert that authority."Google and Verizon declined comment while the others did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internet-providers-collect-staggering-amounts-of-data-us-ftc-chair-101634854790974.html
22-10-2021||World||‘Countries lobbying to soften climate report’||Documents that were leaked and seen by the BBC have reportedly revealed that a number of influential countries have been seeking to get a game-changing UN scientific report on combating the climate crisis toned down.The development, reported in detail by the BBC and the Guardian, shows that Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among several nations that have been requesting the United Nations to “play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels” in its upcoming report.The revelation has cast a shadow on the COP26 climate talks that are scheduled to open in Glasgow on October 31, where the participating governments will be asked to present their respective targets aimed at cutting emissions in the long run.According to the BBC report, the leak has disclosed that the governments of several rich countries have challenged the idea of paying more to poorer nations to help them switch to greener technologies.Guardian, meanwhile, cited leaked papers seen by Greenpeace, reported that the nations that sought to water down the crucial UN report are ones that produce coal, oil, beef and animal feed.G20 countries split ahead of key summit in RomeThe Group of 20 rich countries are divided over phasing out coal and committing to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as they prepare for a crucial summit in Rome next week, sources familiar with the negotiations said.The need to curb emissions will be high on the agenda of the Rome G20 gathering on October 30-31, seen as a key stepping stone immediately ahead of broader United Nations climate talks, called COP 26, to be held in Glasgow, Scotland.So far, big polluters such as China and India have dug in their heels and little progress has been made since G20 energy and environment ministers met in Naples in July, said three sources, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks.“Countries are not moving, at the moment they are still just making sure their positions are heard loud and clear,” said one of the sources.EU parl seeks legal limits on methane emissionsThe European Parliament asked the EU to legally require companies to fix methane leaks and impose binding targets on countries to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas, setting the scene for legislation Brussels will propose this year. Methane is the second-biggest cause of climate change and is emitted from sources including leaky fossil fuel infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-lobbying-to-soften-climate-report-101634850410405.html

Wearing colourful headscarves they chanted slogans including: “Don’t politicise education”, as traffic drove by shortly before 10am.A foreign journalist was struck with the butt of a rifle by one Taliban fighter, who swore and kicked the photographer in the back as another punched him. At least two more journalists were hit.UN backs women’s rightsUnited Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres made an appeal for reversing a decline in women’s rights in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. “We need to fight back - and turn the clock forward - for every woman and girl,” Guterres told the UN Security Council.“Women will no longer accept reversals of their rights. They shouldn’t have to - in countries in conflict, or anywhere else,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-fm-qureshi-isi-chief-hameed-visit-kabul-hold-talks-with-taliban-leaders-101634850196349.html

The phase three trial with “10,000 participants 16 years of age and older” showed “a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% against disease during a period when Delta was the prevalent strain”, the companies said in a statement.The study presented the “first results” of a booster trial, with a third shot of the vaccine demonstrating a “favourable safety profile”. “These results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.The preliminary results would be shared with regulatory agencies “as soon as possible”, the companies said.Infections, fears rise across Britain, ChinaUnder pressure from rising infections and worried health experts, the British government on Wednesday urged millions of people to get booster vaccine shots but resisted calls to reimpose restrictions such as mandatory mask-wearing.Health secretary Sajid Javid said the government would “stay vigilant, preparing for all eventualities”, but would not trigger its “Plan B” of bringing back restrictions on daily life. He made the plea as he warned that new daily virus cases could rise to 100,000.China reported 20 local infections on Thursday following a flare-up in the northwestern provinces, with cases spreading across the country to areas including Beijing. At least eight provinces have reported infections in the past week, fuelling concerns. Authorities in China cancelled hundreds of flights, closed schools and ramped up mass testing on Thursday to try and stamp out a new Covid-19 outbreak.80,000-180,000 health workers died until MayThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that 80,000 to 180,000 healthcare workers may have been killed by Covid-19 up to May this year, insisting they must be prioritised for vaccination. A WHO paper estimated that out of the planet’s 135mn health staff, “between 80,000 to 180,000 health and care workers could have died from Covid-19 in the period between January 2020 and May 2021”.Melbourne’s lengthy lockdown finally liftedMillions in Melbourne were getting ready to come out of the world’s longest Covid lockdown on Thursday even as cases hover near record levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-dose-of-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-96-effective-study-101634849929575.html

China firmly rejects them,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on Thursday.“Issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong are purely China’s internal affairs that brook no foreign interference. The accusation of the so-called ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is an outrageous lie fabricated,” he said.Burns emphasised building alliances in the Indo-Pacific as essential to countering China. He also gave what would be a rare bit of credit from the Biden administration to its predecessor, praising President Donald Trump and his last secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for reinvigorating a bloc with Australia, India and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-can-t-be-trusted-says-biden-s-pick-as-new-us-ambassador-to-china-101634843032870.html
22-10-2021||World||Facebook to pay French publishers for news content||Facebook said on Thursday it had signed a preliminary copyright agreement with a French news publishers’ lobby group, paving the way for it to pay for news content on its platforms in France.The accord takes the form of a “term sheet” of a few pages, a source close to the matter said, and follows months of talks with Alliance de la presse d’information generale (APIG), a lobby representing leading dailies such as Le Monde, Le Figaro and Les Echos.The preliminary deal lists the main principles of the accord and the copyright fees due to each of its members, the same source said. The “term sheet” will soon be followed by a framework agreement that will allow APIG’s members to sign individual licences with Facebook, the source said.There will be two types of licences, the source said: one for the use of news content on Facebook’s main platform and one for its upcoming Facebook News service, which will curate stories from a select set of publications.Facebook News will be launched in France in 2022, the US company said.The social media group provided no detail about the content of the agreement. It has already signed a licence with Le Monde over the use of the newspaper’s content, the head of Le Monde group Louis Dreyfus saidThe licensing deal is the result of a wider push by authorities in Europe and elsewhere to force Facebook and other social media companies to compensate publishers for content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-pay-french-publishers-for-news-content-101634842707546.html
