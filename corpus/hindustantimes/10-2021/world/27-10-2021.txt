Abedin recounts that the assault took place after a dinner that she went to with a few senators and their aides. “I ended up walking out with one of the senators, and soon we stopped in front of his building and he invited me in for coffee,” she writes, as reported by The Guardian. “Once inside, he told me to make myself comfortable on the couch.”As the senator made coffee, he took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves. “Then, in an instant, it all changed. He plopped down to my right, put his left arm around my shoulder, and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth, pressing me back on the sofa,” Abedin writes.“I was so utterly shocked, I pushed him away. All I wanted was for the last 10 seconds to be erased.” According to Abedin, the senator seemed surprised by her reaction and apologised, saying he had “misread” her. But then he asked her if she wanted to stay.“Then I said something only the twenty-something version of me would have come up with – ‘I am so sorry’ – and walked out,” Huma Abedin writes.After the incident, she avoided the senator a few days. When they met next, he asked if they were still friends. Thankfully, for her, Hillary Clinton walked in at that precise moment “as if she knew I needed rescuing even though I’d told her nothing about that night,” says Abedin.According to Huma Abedin, she had “buried” the incident, but memories of it came surging back during the confirmation hearings of former president Donald Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused by a Christine Blasey Ford of assaulting her when they were both in their teens.Huma Abedin was born in Michigan. Her father Syed Zainul Abedin was born in New Delhi and her mother Saleha Mahmood Abedin was from Pakistan. She grew up in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.She joined the White House as an intern during the presidency of Bill Clinton (1993 to 2001), where she was assigned to the then first lady Hilary Clinton. Abedin went on to become Hillary’s closest aide as she ran for the senate and then the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, which she lost to Barack Obama.Abedin also served as key aide to Hilary Clinton, when she was the secretary of state between 2009 to 2013, and was also senior figure on Hilary’s second presidential run, which she lost in 2016 to Donald Trump.Abedin was married Anthony Weiner, a Democratic party operative, who went to serve seven terms as member of the House of Representatives and then saw his career implode over a sexting scandal and with whom she is now estranged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-aide-huma-abedin-reveals-she-was-assaulted-by-a-us-senator-101635354761191.html

Here's what happened||Since early last year, when the Covid-19 pandemic first swept across the globe, people have been forced to work from indoors. Though the situation has eased considerably since then, and restrictions have been relaxed across several countries, employees, by and large, continue to work from home. Because of this, office meetings have taken place through video calls, and often, while speaking during such meetings, people discovered that their mic was on mute all along.Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to Twitter on Wednesday to share a similar experience. “Always remember to unmute…thanks @KermitTheFrog for joining us on @YouTube #DearEarth and chatting about some of our shared interests,” Pichai tweeted, along with a short, two-minute video clip of the interaction. Always remember to unmute...thanks @KermitTheFrog for joining us on @YouTube #DearEarth and chatting about some of our shared interests:) 🌎🏏🦗 https://t.co/RCIUnPcltK pic.twitter.com/cEd6BjkA6H“Hi there, Sundar,” Kermit, a Muppet character created in 1955 said to Pichai, welcoming him for the interaction taking place as a part of YouTube's “Dear Earth” series. The India-born executive responds to Kermit, but the former is inaudible as his mic is on mute. “Sundar, I think you are on mute. Wow, can't believe I am talking to the CEO of Google, and he is on mute,” Kermit says.At this point, which comes 11 seconds into the clip shared by Pichai, he realises his mistake and says, “Sorry Kermit. I was on mute, and I've done it a few times this year like everyone else. I'm huge fan of you and the muppets,” the Google CEO says, as Kermit returns the compliment.The conversation continues, and eventually Sundar says that he and his children love watching, among other things, cricket highlights on YouTube. Kermit says that he, too, lives cricket, to which Pichai clarifies that he is talking about the game of cricket, and not the insect.“Dear Earth” is a YouTube Originals programming which aims to address the sustainability challenges that the world is facing and solutions which can be adopted to bring about a change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sundar-pichai-fails-to-unmute-his-video-call-here-s-what-happened-101635348630871.html

27-10-2021||World||China added 307 billionaires last year as new energy sector propels wealth||China added 307 billionaires in the past one year with the list of the country’s richest persons now headed by its “bottled water king”, followed by the founder of TikTok and then by the country’s “battery king”, the annual Hurun list of the wealthy revealed on Wednesday.New energy propelled eight of the 10 fastest rising wealthy persons, while embattled property moguls and those facing regulatory scrutiny including the high-profile Jack Ma, who had once topped the Hurun list for three consecutive years, slipped down the ladder, the new rankings revealed.Zhong Shanshan topped this year’s Hurun China Rich List 2021 with his personal wealth pegged at of $60.6 billion because of a surge in the value of his listed companies, Nongfu Spring and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which manufactures vaccines besides Covid-19 diagnostic kits.Zhang Yiming, 38, founder of TikTok, banned in India in 2020 because of national security issues, tripled his wealth last year, and is now second on the list with $52.8 billion in his kitty.Battery king Zeng Yuqun, 53, of CATL, the world’s number of battery-maker for EVs, tripled his wealth to take him to third spot with $47.4bn.Tencent Holdings’ Pony Ma, and Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group rounded out the top five.The rich list is a ranking of the richest individuals in China, with a wealth cut-off of 2 billion yuan, equivalent to $310 million.New energy has had an amazing year, while real estate, home tutoring services, pork production and video gaming have had a bad year, Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report’s chairperson and chief researcher, said.“New energy is the big story of the year, with 8 of the 10 fastest risers related to new energy, led by Zeng (of CATL), and including EV makers Wei Jianjun & Han Xuejuan of Great Wall Motor and Wang Chuanfu of BYD, solar makers Liu Hanyuan of Tongwei and related miners, including Luo Liguo of Hesheng Silicon, up 6.5 times to US$21.7bn.As per the list, the average ‘Hurun Rich Lister’ was born in 1965, started his business in 1994 at the age of 29, broke into the list in 2012 at the age of 47, and is now 56 years old with US$1.9bn.“Twenty years ago, we could only find 19 individuals with $300mn, but over the last 20 years, this has grown over 100 times to almost 3,000, showing the growth of the Chinese economy. Based on this trajectory, expect the Hurun China Rich List to grow to as many as 5,000 within ten years,” according to Hoogewerf.Hoogewerf said that it’s a similar story in China in the context of the rising number of billionaires.“Back in 1999, there were none, with the first wave of 100 coming through in 2007, before breaking through the 500-mark in 2015 and since Covid, almost doubling to 1185 known billionaires today, 50 percent more than the US, which has just under 700 known billionaires. At this rate, expect China to have 2,000 known billionaires by 2030,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-added-307-billionaires-last-year-as-new-energy-sector-propels-wealth-101635329317131.html
27-10-2021||World||Pak army chief won DG ISI battle, PM Imran Khan got the procedural lollypop||Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa revealed both his military clout and political maturity in getting his ISI candidate Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum appointed as head of Pakistan’s spy agency while ostensibly deferring to the process demands made by Prime Minister Imran Khan.With PM Khan having no options but to tow the line of army chief, there is very strong speculation that Gen Bajwa may continue to head the military beyond his current retirement date of November 2022. Gen Bajwa took over as Pak Army Chief on November 29, 2016. On October 6, 2021, he replaced Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as DG, ISI and appointed Karachi V Corps Commander Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the head spook. Gen Hameed, who has been an open supporter of Taliban’s Interior Minister and global terrorist Sirajuddin Haqqani, was appointed as the Commander of XI Corps at Peshawar.The appointment got stuck after PM Khan wanted the due process to be followed as if indicating that he did not want to replace Gen Hameed, who was again seen in Kabul with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi after his replacement has been announced by the Rawalpindi GHQ.While Pak PM showed his ostensible clout with the Army by issuing a press release about Gen Anjum taking over as ISI from Gen Hameed on November 19, fact is that Gen Bajwa had his way with civilian leadership happy with a facile victory. Unlike Gen Bajwa who hardly comments on India unnecessarily, PM Khan showed his political immaturity by gloating on Pak cricket team defeating India in a T20 match in Dubai. His clever offer of a dialogue with India from Saudi Arabia is a non-starter as the Modi government will not open any diplomatic channel till Pakistan stops targeting India through home bred Islamic jihadists. The rabid Islamic comments made by PM Khan’s minister and even former Pakistan cricketers after the T20 victory have been noted by the government. It was seen an attempt by Pakistan civilian leadership to be seen as more aggressive than Pak Army leadership on India for political gains in future.Even though Gen Bajwa allowed Khan to save face by first sending a panel of names of Army commander under consideration of the DG ISI job and then allowing them to be interviewed by Pak PM, the bottom line was that Gen Nadeem Anjum’s name could not be changed by the civilian leadership.The change as directed by Gen Bajwa happened despite Gen Hameed increasing temperatures on both sides of the border with bombings of so-called ISKP in Afghanistan and targeted killings by proxies of Pak terror groups in Kashmir in the run up to his Peshawar posting announcement by Rawalpindi. In the end, Bajwa won the game hands down, Pak PM only managed a lollypop as a consolation prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-chief-won-dg-isi-battle-pm-imran-khan-got-the-procedural-lollypop-101635319452458.html
27-10-2021||World||‘Always been there’: Imran Khan thanks Saudi Arabia on receiving $3 billion aid||After Saudi Arabia sent $3 billion in financial aid to cash-strapped Pakistan for tiding over the ongoing economic crisis, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday thanked Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman for extending the helpful gesture in these “difficult times”.Noting that Saudi Arabia “has always been there” for Pakistan during its difficult phase, Khan expressed his gratitude and noted that at a time when the world confronts rising commodity prices, Saudi generosity did not fail its fellow Muslim ally as the country deposited $3 billion in Pakistan's central bank and financed refined petroleum products with $1.2 billion.Taking to his official handle on Twitter, Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan wrote, “I want to thank HRH Prince Mohammad bin Salman for supporting Pak with $3 bn as deposit in Pak's central bank & financing refined petroleum product with $1.2 bn. KSA has always been there for Pak in our difficult times incl now when the world confronts rising commodity prices.”I want to thank HRH Prince Mohammad bin Salman for supporting Pak with $3 bn as deposit in Pak's central bank & financing refined petroleum product with $1.2 bn. KSA has always been there for Pak in our difficult times incl now when world confronts rising commodity prices.Imran Khan had on Monday met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on the sidelines of the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) summit in Riyadh, which he was invited to attend at the royalty's invitation. Later on Tuesday, the Saudi prince announced that it was depositing $3 billion in Pakistan's central bank to help the cash-strapped country with the foreign reserves. According to Geo News, the announcement was made by the Saudi Fund for Development, which said that not only was it depositing $3 billion in the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) but also had issued an official directive to supply $1.2 billion to finance Pakistan's oil products trade during the year. The news was later confirmed by Pakistan's information and energy minister Hammad Azhar.“This will help ease pressures on our trade and forex accounts as a result of global commodities price surge,” Azhar said as he shared the news.It was reported by the Hindustan Times earlier this month that Pakistan is facing a deep economic crisis, its biggest one in history. According to The News International, one of the largest English language newspapers in Pakistan, the Imran Khan-led regime ideally requires gross external financing of $51.6 billion within a two-year period (2021-2023) in order to fulfill its needs.Also Read | Pakistan in deep economic crisis.

27-10-2021||World||Explained: Why Turkish President Erdogan is backpedaling in diplomatic row||Over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan instructed his Foreign Ministry to declare the ambassadors of 10 states, including those of Germany and the United States, "persona non grata." Following a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Erdogan struck a more conciliatory tone, explaining that the embassies had "taken a step back from this slander against our country and our nation. I believe these ambassadors […] will be more careful in their statements regarding Turkey's sovereign rights" in the future.The move followed a Twitter statement by the US Embassy underscoring its commitment to Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations prohibiting interference in another state's internal affairs. Aykan Erdemir, a former Turkish opposition parliamentarian, said Washington's "strategic ambiguity" allows "Erdogan's spin doctors to claim the West has surrendered, whereas the English version gives the impression that the West remains steadfast on human rights."The diplomatic spat arose after the envoys in question called for the release of Osman Kavala, a philanthropist who has remained jailed without a conviction in Turkey for nearly four years. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) demanded his release back in December 2019.Erdogan's political gambitCharlotte Joppien, an expert on Turkish politics at Hamburg University, said Erdogan is trying to distract attention from domestic problems, pointing out that his approval ratings have been falling for months. Indeed, independent pollster Avrasya reports approval for Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has now dipped below 30%.The government's weakness even seems to be uniting Turkey's long-fractured opposition. Taken together, the Kemalist Republican People's Party (CHP) and the national-conservative Good Party (IYI Parti) now poll at over 40%.Moreover, the existence of numerous other small anti-Erdogan parties and the fact that the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is polling at roughly 10% means Erdogan and the AKP need to worry about losing upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections.Why is Erdogan's popularity tanking?More than anything, the president's waning popularity is tied to Turkey's economic woes — inflation stands at 20%, corruption is rampant and the value of the Turkish lira has been in free fall for years. On Monday, $1 US was worth a staggering 9.59 lira — though the currency rebounded slightly after Erdogan's conciliatory statement.This protracted devaluation of the lira has had dramatic consequences: Key imports, upon which Turkey depends, are growing progressively more expensive. Many Turks who have taken out dollar-denominated loans are struggling to service their debt. In addition, inflation is driving up costs for everyday products.Have similar rows occurred in the past?This is by no means the first time Erdogan has attempted to use an international diplomatic crisis to shore up domestic support. That was the case when Turkey temporarily jailed German journalist Deniz Yücel, as well as in Turkey's clash with France and the US over whether the mass slaughter of Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks during World War I constituted genocide.Erdogan often uses such disputes to claim other countries are trying to keep Turkey down. He also uses them as an opportunity to lash out against media outlets, whom he has accused of peddling fake news. Despite different situations, his polarizing tactics are always based on the same political calculus. He knows confrontation with foreign powers appeals to many nationalist Turks, but he hopes the strategy will also force the opposition to adopt a more jingoist stance.How has the opposition reacted?This time, however, Erdogan's attempted strong-arming of the opposition does not seem to be working. Instead, his political adversaries have publicly lambasted him, with Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the CHP, saying the president is trying to create excuses to explain away "the collapse of the economy that he himself destroyed."The leader of Turkey's Future Party, Ahmet Davutoglu, made similar comments. Davutoglu, who once served as foreign minister and prime minister under Erdogan, said the president is neither truly concerned about Osman Kavala, nor the independence of Turkey's judiciary. Instead, he said, Erdogan is deliberately stoking polarization and swapping "statesmanlike logic for the language of the gutter," bringing "shame upon our country."What are Erdogan's options?Despite fierce criticism at home and considerable pressure from abroad, Erdogan still holds powerful cards in his hands — he could edge Turkey, a NATO member state, even closer toward Russia, for instance. Ankara has already angered NATO allies by ignoring their concerns and outright rejecting objections from the US by purchasing the S-400 air defense system from Russia. As a result, Washington subsequently refused to deliver F-35 fighter jets to Turkey.Now, Turkish decision-makers are mulling whether to purchase Russian combat aircraft alongside further Russian-made air defense systems— no small gesture considering the fact that Turkey maintains the second-largest standing military force in the NATO alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-turkish-president-erdogan-is-backpedaling-in-diplomatic-row-101635308734065.html
27-10-2021||World||Under Biden, US criticises Israel on settlements for first time in years||The United States on Tuesday forcefully criticised Israel for the first time in years on its settlements, with president Joe Biden's administration saying it “strongly” opposed new construction on the West Bank. The reaction comes after four years under Donald Trump in which the United States offered a green light to Israel's activity on occupied Palestinian land, with his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, touring a settlement at the end of his tenure.The State Department under Biden had repeatedly warned against settlement construction and on Tuesday sharply criticized Israel after it moved ahead.“We are deeply concerned about the Israeli government's plan to advance thousands of settlement units” on Wednesday as well as tenders published Sunday for more than 1,300 homes, State Department spokesman Ned Price said."We strongly oppose the expansion of settlements, which is completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm, and it damages the prospects for a two-state solution," he told reporters."We also view plans for the retroactive legalization of illegal outposts as unacceptable."Price stopped short of saying the decision would jeopardize relations with Israel. But he said that the administration would "raise this issue directly with senior Israeli officials in our private sessions."Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is a right-winger close to the settlement movement, although he leads a coalition with centrists who seek to preserve stable relations with the United States.Housing Minister Zeev Elkin is part of the right-wing New Hope party and said the settlements were "essential to the Zionist vision" of strengthening Jewish presence in the West Bank.Gap in USPalestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh had urged Washington to "confront" Israel on the settlements, which he described as "aggression."About 475,000 Israeli Jews live in settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law, on land Palestinians claim as part of their future state.The Trump administration, which was backed by evangelical Christians who see biblical reasons for supporting a Jewish homeland, revised longstanding State Department guidance and said it did not consider settlements illegal.It was a sharp shift from the previous Democratic administration of Barack Obama who faced open criticism from Israel's veteran right-wing prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, particularly over US diplomacy with Iran.In one of its last acts, the Obama administration declined to exercise the routine US veto at the UN Security Council and allowed a resolution against Israeli settlements to pass through.While Biden has long ties with the Jewish state, many in his Democratic Party have increasingly opposed Israeli policies, especially under Netanyahu.In June, dozens of Democratic lawmakers wrote an open letter to Biden urging him to "consistently and proactively" issue "firm public condemnations" of actions that could jeopardize the peace process.Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, a centrist who engineered the coalition to oust Netanyahu, accused the previous government of putting Israel at risk through a partisan alliance with Trump and has pledged to work through disagreements quietly.Lapid last month proposed a development plan for the impoverished Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Islamist militants Hamas who fought a war with Israel in May, but conceded that the idea was not supported across the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-biden-us-criticises-israel-on-settlements-for-first-time-in-years-101635305713967.html

The US secretary underscored the need for a return to the transition civilian government, Price added.Earlier on Tuesday, the Al Hadath broadcaster reported that Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who was ousted in the military takeover, was returning home. Hamdok was reportedly being held at the home of the Sovereignty Council of Sudan Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces.The takeover came as the term of the 11-member transitional Sovereign Council of Sudan was approaching completion. Thereafter, the council was set to transfer power to a civilian government.

It added that an official directive was issued to supply $1.2 billion to finance Pakistan's oil products trade during the year.This comes as a respite for Pakistan, which is battling a deep economic crisis.The news was confirmed by information minister and energy minister Hammad Azhar."This will help ease pressures on our trade and forex accounts as a result of global commodities price surge," Azhar said as he shared the news.Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan had on Monday met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on the sidelines of the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) summit in Riyadh, which he was invited to attend at the crown prince's invitation.Back in May, the federal minister for information Fawad Chaudhry had said Saudi Arabia had agreed, in principle, to revive the facility of oil supply to Pakistan on deferred payments.Finance minister Shaukat Tarin had repeated earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had agreed to provide oil on deferred payment to Pakistan.Earlier, Saudi Arabia had provided a USD 6 billion financial package, including $3 billion deposits into the State Bank of Pakistan and the remaining $3 billion for oil facility on deferred payment on an annual basis.Last year, the decade-long friendship between both countries took a sharp turn when Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's issued a blunt warning to Saudi Arabia after the latter refused to act against India over the Kashmir issue.On the first anniversary of the revocation of Article 370 by India, Qureshi took Saudi Arabia to task in a TV interview for not obliging Pakistan over the issue of 'organising' a meeting of the Council of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Foreign Ministers (CFM) on Kashmir in early February 2020.Qureshi's remarks revived Riyadh's anger, who had forced Pakistan to pay back USD 1 billion prematurely.Riyadh has helped Islamabad many times including helping in paying for Pakistan's first batch of F-16 fighter aircraft in the 1980s and providing USD 6 billion loans that helped Pakistan tide over its balance of payments crisis just two years ago.Saudi Arabia had come to Pakistan's rescue in 2018 when it had agreed to provide USD 3.2 billion worth of oil on deferred payments per annum as part of its USD 6.2 billion packages to help Pakistan tide over its balance of payment crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-sends-3-billion-package-to-help-out-cash-strapped-pakistan-101635301290991.html

27-10-2021||World||Google growth marred by disappointing result in YouTube, cloud computing sectors||Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported quarterly sales that topped Wall Street estimates, reflecting robust advertiser spending, but disappointing results from its YouTube and cloud-computing divisions weighed on the stock.Third-quarter revenue, excluding payments to distribution partners, was about $53.6 billion, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts projected $52.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. YouTube ad revenue and Google Cloud sales both fell short of analysts’ estimates, driving the shares down about 1% in extended trading. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has tried to keep Alphabet’s revenue engine chugging along by prioritising three areas: e-commerce, YouTube, and cloud computing. That helped the internet giant rebound from a dour 2020 when some marketers pared their budgets as they coped with the initial shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the most recent quarter, the retail, travel, and media and entertainment industries heavily advertised on Google’s platforms, the company said. Still, the company’s fortunes remain highly dependent on macroeconomic factors, including supply-chain doldrums that have plagued nearly every industry and could bite retailers and ad companies during the holiday shopping season. The Mountain View, California-based company also has been let down by its video platform YouTube and its cloud arm, both of which are meant to help it diversify away from the core search engine that brings in most of its revenue.The shares fell as low as $2,700 in extended trading after closing at $2,786.17. The stock has jumped 59% this year.Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call that Apple Inc.’s anti-tracking app privacy features had a “modest impact on YouTube’s revenues” in the quarter.Alphabet’s profit was $27.99 a share in the third quarter, beating the average estimate of $23.50. But YouTube ad revenue came in at just $7.2 billion. Analysts were looking for the world’s most popular video-sharing site to generate about $7.5 billion.Sales from the company’s cloud division rose to $4.99 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion. While the unit has gained some market share under Thomas Kurian, it still lags far behind leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp. Pichai said he believes the unit has “continued momentum” on the call. “It was modestly off of the street’s estimate, but we feel very good with the momentum,” Porat said on a call with reporters. “We are very pleased with the ongoing progress across the board, the product innovation, the buildout of our teams, and the strength across verticals.”Alphabet also repurchased $12.6 billion in shares last quarter and said its employee base grew to 150,028, up 18,000 from a year earlier. Porat pledged on the earnings call to continue investing in servers, real estate, and headcount for Google Services and the cloud division. The executive also warned that sales from Google’s app store would suffer from the company reducing its commission this summer after pressure from regulators and software developers. “Google Play’s contribution to revenue growth will remain more muted given the ongoing impact of both lapping the increased level of user engagement that started in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic, as well as the fee change that took effect on July 1,” Porat said on the call. Search and other related businesses generated third-quarter sales of $37.9 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $36.7 billion.“They are benefiting still from some of the commerce moving online because of the pandemic,” Mark Ballard, a researcher at marketing performance firm Tinuiti, said in an interview ahead of the results.Google recently launched its line of Pixel 6 smartphones, the company’s latest effort to break into the competitive consumer-electronics market. But like other manufacturers, Google’s hardware unit is dealing with difficulties getting enough supplies, Porat said.“We’ve been risk-managing the supply-chain challenges well,” Porat said. “We are working closely with suppliers and logistics partners to plan and pivot when and where we need. With the strong reviews and demand on the Pixel 6, we do expect some supply constraints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-growth-marred-by-disappointing-result-in-youtube-cloud-computing-sectors-101635298729129.html
27-10-2021||World||Brazil senators back criminal charges against Bolsonaro over Covid-19 response||A Brazilian Senate committee recommended on Tuesday that president Jair Bolsonaro face a series of criminal indictments for actions and omissions related to the world’s second-highest Covid-19 death toll.The 7-to-4 vote by the 11-member committee ended its six-month investigation of the government’s handling of the pandemic and calls for prosecutors to put Bolsonaro on trial for charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting crime to misuse of public funds and crimes against humanity.Sen. Omar Aziz, the chairman of the inquiry, said he will deliver it to the prosecutor-general Wednesday morning.More than 600,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Brazil. Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing.The Brazilian Senate committee voted on a report, the culmination of the 11-member committee’s six-month investigation of the government's handling of the pandemic. It called for Bolsonaro to face charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting crime to misuse of public funds and crimes against humanity, and so hold him responsible for many of Brazil’s more than 600,000 Covid-19 deaths.Once approved, the decision on whether to file charges is now up to Brazil’s prosecutor-general, a Bolsonaro appointee who is widely viewed as protecting the president. The allegation of crimes against humanity would need to be pursued by the International Criminal Court.Regardless of whether the report leads to charges, it is expected to fuel criticism of the divisive president, whose approval ratings have slumped ahead of his 2022 reelection campaign — in large part because of Brazil’s outsize Covid-19 death toll. The investigation itself has for months provided a drumbeat of damaging allegations.Since the start of the pandemic, Bolsonaro has sabotaged local leaders' restrictions on activity aimed at stopping the virus' spread, saying the economy needed to keep humming so the poor did not suffer worse hardship. He also has insistently touted an anti-malaria drug long after broad testing showed it isn't effective against Covid-19, assembled crowds without wearing masks, and sowed doubt about vaccines.Bolsonaro has defended himself by saying he was among the world's only leaders courageous enough to defy political correctness and global health recommendations, and that he hasn't erred in the slightest.Report author Sen. Renan Calheiros first presented the nearly 1,200-page report last week. It says that by insisting on treatment with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as “practically the only government policy to fight the pandemic, Jair Bolsonaro strongly collaborated for Covid-19's spread in Brazilian territory" and as a result is "the main person responsible for the errors committed by the federal government during the pandemic.”Committee members in the so-called “G7” group of senators who aren’t from Bolsonaro’s base agreed on most of the points in Calheiros' report. They met Monday to hammer out final adjustments to the text.Changes include recommending charges for 13 additional people, many of them former or current Health Ministry employees, as well as the governor of hard-hit Amazonas state, according to Calheiros. The final report recommends charges against two companies and 79 people, including Bolsonaro, current and former members of his administration, dozens of allies, and the president’s three sons, who are politicians.It also adds an additional violation for allegedly spreading false news following Bolsonaro's live broadcast on social media last week claiming incorrectly that people in the U.K. who received two vaccine doses are developing AIDS faster than expected, the senator told the AP.Committee approval is needed before the report goes to the office of Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras, who could ask the Supreme Court for authorization to carry the investigation forward and eventually pursue charges. His office said the report will be carefully reviewed as soon as it is received.The report also contains recommendations for two counts of "crime of responsibility”, which are grounds for impeachment. Lower House Speaker Arthur Lira, a staunch Bolsonaro ally, would need to bring a vote on whether to open impeachment proceedings. That's highly unlikely, considering Lira is currently sitting on more than 120 other impeachment requests, according to information from the Lower House.Bolsonaro’s son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, told journalists Tuesday the report is legally weak and politically motivated.“The intent of some senators on the investigative committee is to cause the maximum amount of wear and tear on the president,” he said.An earlier draft of Calheiros' report had recommended the president also be indicted for homicide and genocide, but that was scrapped even before its presentation last week. Some committee members opposed their inclusion while others expressed concern that bombastic claims could undermine the report’s credibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-senators-back-criminal-charges-against-bolsonaro-over-covid-19-response-101635294414012.html
27-10-2021||World||World on track for 2.7°C temp rise this century, warns UN||The world is on track for an average temperature rise of 2.7°C this century if the only steps on climate action it takes are the commitments announced till now, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Tuesday, a fresh warning ahead of the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) later this month.The 2.7°C breaches the Paris Agreement’s target of 2°C and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been warning of catastrophic consequences if the planet is allowed to warm beyond an average temperature of 2°C compared to pre-industrial age levels.According to the UNEP’s ‘Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On’, the updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by various countries and other commitments made for action till 2030 will only reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 7.5% compared to the previous round of commitments in 2015. Reductions of 30% are needed to meet Paris Agreement’s 2°C goal and 55% to keep global warming under 1.5° C, it added.As of September 30, 120 countries, representing just over half of global greenhouse gas emissions, had communicated new or updated NDCs. UNEP has also considered announcements of new mitigation pledges for 2030 by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea which have not yet been submitted as NDCs for analysis in the report.India is also among countries that hasn’t announced an updated NDC or announced an enhanced target as yet.There is a 66% chance of hitting global warming of 2.7°C by end of the century with the present formally submitted and announced NDCs. “To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we have eight years to take an additional 28 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions, over and above what is promised in the updated NDCs and other commitments - equivalent to almost halving current greenhouse gas emissions,” the report warned.“Today I have bad news. Less than one week before COP26 in Glasgow, we are still on track for climate catastrophe. The 2021 Emissions Gap Report shows that even with present Nationally Determined Contributions and other commitments of countries around the world, we are indeed on track for a catastrophic global temperature rise of around 2.7°C,” UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres said during the launch of the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-on-track-for-2-7-c-temp-rise-this-century-warns-un-101635289977647.html
27-10-2021||World||FDA advisers back Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11||The US moved a step closer to expanding Covid-19 vaccinations for millions more children as a panel of government advisers on Tuesday endorsed kid-size doses of Pfizer's shots for 5- to 11-year-olds.A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted unanimously, with one abstention, that the vaccine’s benefits in preventing Covid-19 in that age group outweigh any potential risks — including a heart-related side effect that's been very rare in teens and young adults despite their use of a much higher shot dose.While children are at lower risk of severe Covid-19 than older people, ultimately many panelists decided it's important to give parents the choice to protect their youngsters — especially those at high risk of illness or who live in places where other precautions, like masks in schools, aren't being used.The virus is “not going away. We have to find a way to live with it and I think the vaccines give us a way to do that,” said FDA adviser Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas.“I do think it’s a relatively close call,” said adviser Dr. Eric Rubin of Harvard University. “It’s really going to be a question of what the prevailing conditions are but we’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it.”The FDA isn’t bound by the panel’s recommendation and is expected to make its own decision within days.If the FDA authorizes the kid-size doses, there’s still another step: Next week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have to decide whether to recommend the shots and which youngsters should get them.Full-strength shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech already are recommended for everyone 12 and older but pediatricians and many parents are clamoring for protection for younger children. The extra-contagious delta variant has caused an alarming rise in pediatric infections -- and families are frustrated with school quarantines and having to say no to sleepovers and other rites of childhood to keep the virus at bay.States are getting ready to roll out shots for little arms -- in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine -- as soon as the government gives the OK. More than 25,000 pediatricians and other primary care providers have signed up so far to offer vaccination.While there is less Covid-19 among 5- to 11-year-olds, they still have faced substantial illness -- including over 8,300 hospitalizations reported, about a third requiring intensive care, and nearly 100 deaths.A study of elementary schoolchildren found the Pfizer shots are nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection -- even though the youngsters received just a third of the dose given to teens and adults.Pfizer’s study tracked 2,268 children ages 5 to 11 who got two shots three weeks apart of either a placebo or the kid dose. Vaccinated youngsters developed levels of virus-fighting antibodies just as strong as teens and young adults who got the full-strength shots.The kid dosage also proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary side effects — such as sore arms, fever or achiness — that teens experience. At FDA’s request, Pfizer more recently enrolled another 2,300 youngsters into the study, and preliminary safety data has shown no red flags.The study isn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose, mostly in young men and teen boys.Statistical models developed by FDA scientists showed that in most scenarios of the continuing pandemic, the vaccine would prevent far more Covid-19 hospitalizations in this age group than would potentially be caused by that very rare side effect, heart inflammation, that's the big unknown.But with cases falling across the US, the FDA panel had to consider whether the pandemic might recede so much that more children could face side effects from the vaccine than would be protected from Covid-19.“If the trends continue the way they are going then the emergency for children is not what we might think it might be,” said Dr. James Hildreth of Meharry Medical College.Moderna also is studying its vaccine in young children, and Pfizer has additional studies underway in those younger than 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-advisers-back-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-ages-5-to-11-101635280110234.html

India has paid for five and they are expected to be delivered this year.Under CAATSA, a defence deal becomes sanctionable as soon as the purchased equipment is delivered - as it happened when Turkey, a NATO ally, received its S-400s in December 2020.India expects it will be exempted from sanctions for several reasons. It began negotiating the purchase before CAATSA became law in 2017 and there was not a counter-offer from the United States at the time. The US subsequently offered Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Patriot Advance Capability (PAC-3) in 2019, by which time the S-400 deal had been finalised.There is also a hope in New Delhi that the United States will not jeopardise the relationship, which is booming, by imposing sanctions on India.While the Trump administration gave no assurances, former secretary of defence Jim Mattis had argued for India and Vietnam to be exempted from CAATSA sanctions saying they have been cutting their dependence on Russia military hardware and sanctions could prove counter-productive.The Biden administration has not made any public remarks on the issue, but secretary of defence Lloyd Austin did raise the issue of S-400 during his visit to New Delhi in March 2021.Robert Menendez, the Democrat who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had urged Austin to raise the issue during his India visit. The senator is a Russia hawk and has pushed for CAATSA sanctions to be used to discourage countries from buying Russian defence equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-admin-to-exempt-india-from-caatsa-curbs-101635273916480.html

Sajjan’s departure from defence, which he held since 2015, was widely expected as he was criticised for the institutional sexual misconduct crisis that erupted in the Canadian Armed Forces under his watch.Meanwhile, outgoing foreign minister Marc Garneau has not returned to the cabinet and has been replaced by Melanie Joly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-anita-anand-appointed-canada-s-defence-minister-101635270616152.html

There were even fears in political circles about a change at the highest levels of the government if the army decided not to continue propping up Khan.A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office in Islamabad said Khan had “seen and approved the appointment” of Anjum as the director-general of the ISI from November 20. It added that the current ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, would continue to hold the post till November 19.The face-off between Khan and the army began when the military issued a statement to the media on October 6 naming Anjum as the next ISI chief, replacing Hameed.According to convention, the army forwards the names of three lieutenant generals to the prime minister, who picks one as the ISI director-general. Though the formal announcement about the choice is made by the PM, it is widely understood that the army chief conveys which of the three officers should be picked for the post.Under a reshuffle announced by the army on October 6, Hameed was to be moved out of the ISI to head Peshawar-based XI Corps. A stint in an operational command is needed to put Hameed in contention for becoming army chief after the current chief, Gen Qamar Bajwa, completes his extended term in November 2022.Khan, however, continued to hold up a formal announcement about the next ISI chief as different theories did the rounds in Pakistan. Some said Khan believes Hameed should be retained as the ISI chief for an extended period because of the role he played in shaping developments in Afghanistan and in liaising with the Taliban.After differences emerged among the Haqqani Network and other Taliban factions over forming a setup in Kabul, Hameed rushed to Kabul to cobble together an interim cabinet that put hardliners in control.There was speculation that Khan’s wife, a pirni or spiritual guide, had suggested the time was not auspicious to make a change in the ISI. Similar speculation swirled again on Tuesday over the move to retain Hameed as the ISI chief till November 19.Though Hameed accompanied foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on his recent first visit to Kabul since the Taliban assumed power in mid-August, the ISI chief did not join Khan for a visit to Saudi Arabia last week as had been anticipated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-names-new-isi-chief-ending-standoff-with-pakistan-army-101635254895221.html
