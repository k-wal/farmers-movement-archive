This comes in the aftermath of an IS-linked suicide bombing outside Kabul international airport late August that targeted evacuation efforts of the United States. The blast, one of the deadliest attacks in years, had killed 169 Afghans and 13 US service members.Speaking to The Associated Press, Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said that Friday's raid was conducted in the city of Charikar in Parwan province, located north of Kabul. However, he did not provide more details.Subsequently, the Taliban arrested two IS members linked to a roadside bombing that targeted their vehicle and wounded four fighters, Karimi said. The arrested militants were interrogated and based on the information the Taliban identified the hideout, he added.The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has certainly increased the attacks by IS militants on Taliban members, widening the conflict between the long-time rivals.Although, the Islamic State is dominant in eastern Nangarhar province, the terror group has ramped up attacks across the nation ever since the fall of the Afghanistan government and the Taliban takeover. Taliban fighters have been killed in IS attacks in the provincial capital of Jalalabad, while in response, the ruling group have carried out crackdowns on the IS in Nangarhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-raid-is-hideout-in-afghanistan-s-parwan-province-several-militants-killed-101633108687046.html

She was born on Sept. 18 at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, weighing in at 6 pounds and 2 ounces (2.78 kilos).Beatrice, 33, is already stepmother to Mapelli’s son Christopher Wolf, who is known as Wolfie, from a previous relationship.“We are all doing well and Wolfie is the best big brother to Sienna,” Beatrice said.Beatrice is 10th in the line of succession to the British throne, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York.After a whirlwind romance, Beatrice and Mapelli tied the knot in July 2020 in a private wedding ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, after their initial wedding date in May was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Sienna’s arrival has come at a time when Andrew is facing a U.S. civil sexual assault lawsuit.The duke, who stepped down from royal duties in 2019, is being sued by Virginia Giuffre for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She claims she was trafficked by Andrew’s friend — convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — to have sex with the duke when she was aged 17.Andrew, who denies all the allegations, was pictured driving from the queen’s Balmoral home in Scotland this week, prompting speculation that he was on his way to meet his newest grandchild.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-princess-beatrice-names-first-child-sienna-elizabeth-101633109262737.html

01-10-2021||World||Amazon records least September fires in 20 years||The number of fires in Brazil's Amazon during September dropped to the lowest for the month in two decades, according to data from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.September is historically Brazil's worst month for forest fires and, while the data is positive, environmental experts question whether the trend will be confirmed by coming months.The number of Amazon fires was just over half the level recorded in September last year, according to the data. That helped push down the nationwide total, along with a sharp drop in the amount of fires in the Pantanal wetlands. Fires in September retreated to the lowest number for the month since 2018, several months before President Jair Bolsonaro took office.Since taking office, Bolsonaro has encouraged development within the Amazon and dismissed global complaints about its destruction as a plot to hold back the nation's agribusiness. His administration also weakened environmental authorities and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections, emboldening land grabbers.More recently, he has sought to demonstrate heightened environmental commitment in the face of criticism from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and troubled institutional investors. At the United Nations this month, he credited his administration's redoubled efforts for the plunge of Amazon deforestation alerts in August, which followed a year-on-year decline in July. September results will be released in the coming week.Environmentalists roundly dismiss his shift as disingenuous and say his deployment of the military to the Amazon is ineffective for preservation; an Associated Press investigation last year found the same results.Márcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups, welcomed September fire data, but said he would need to see lower figures through at least year-end before declaring it a trend, particularly given still-elevated deforestation levels and limited enforcement.“As government action in the Amazon is very weak, even with these variations, it's hard to say it will be maintained. Why would it be maintained?" Astrini said. "The government isn't there, there's no repression. So it depends on the will of the people who are deforesting, setting fires.?Severe drought and early data at the start of the forest fire season had raised widespread concern that this year's blazes would reach the same destruction recorded in the past two years.But rainfall in the Amazon during August was significantly above average. That was the main inhibitor keeping ranchers from setting fire to felled trees in September, which seemed “almost divine intervention,” said Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute.By contrast in the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands, there has been a shift in behaviour from last year leading to far fewer fires, despite the ongoing drought that has rendered the area a powder keg, Alencar added.Fires are down by more than two-thirds in the first nine months of 2020 after last year's explosion brought ruin to the local tourism industry.“The disaster of last year served to help people better organize firefighting and prevention this year,” Alencar said. “The economic losses last year had an important impact in making people think more about their actions and, with peer enforcement, reduce the use of fire.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-records-least-september-fires-in-20-years-101633107056568.html
01-10-2021||World||Australia looking to diversify trade ties amid difficulties with China: Trade minister Dan Tehan||Australia is seeking to diversify its trading relations with countries such as India against the backdrop of difficulties in its economic ties with China, Australian trade and investment minister Dan Tehan said on Friday. A day after India and Australia agreed to reach an interim trade deal on goods and services by December and to conclude talks on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) by the end of 2022, Tehan said the two sides had also seen a “lot of movement” on cooperation in rare earth minerals. “Australia currently has some difficulties in our economic relationship with China; they’ve been very well documented. It’s one of the reasons why we’ve been looking to diversify our trade relationships,” Tehan told reporters at a media roundtable at the Australian high commission. “We obviously want to have a very constructive engagement with China but we also understand, given the difficulties that we are facing at the moment, that there is a need for us to diversify,” he said. While China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, relations between the two sides have been hit by a trade war. China has imposed stiff tariffs on Australian barley and wine exports and created barriers for products such as Timber and coal. Tehan said the focus of his discussions with commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday was the economic partnership between Australia and India, and the ambitious interim and final trade agreements. Though both sides were going into the negotiations with a “win-win spirit”, he acknowledged it would be hard for the two sides to pull off an interim trade deal within just three months. The current level of bilateral trade, which stands at about $25 billion trade, does not represent the capacity of the two economies to grow and work with each other, he said. Tehan said there has been a “lot of movement” in cooperation with India on rare earth minerals, and a key development was an announcement last week by Prime Minister Scott Morrison about Export Finance Australia establishing an Australian $2 billion critical minerals facility to help with exploration and processing of minerals and development of supply chains for exports to countries such as India. “This will help us be able to develop that partnership between Australia and India in the critical minerals space. There is also a clean technology agreement that has been agreed between Australia and India, and that also will help in the critical minerals space,” he said. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, the two countries had been exploring the possibility of cooperation in mining and processing rare earth metals such as lithium, neodymium and dysprosium, of which Australia has the world’s sixth largest reserves. India, which imports more than 90% of the rare earth metals it needs from China, has been looking to diversify sources. In 2016, imports from China were worth $3.4 million. Tehan said his discussions with Goyal had also taken in e-commerce, the use of merino wool for manufacturing textiles in India, phyto-sanitary measures for the export and import of fruit and vegetables, and Australian investments in India’s food processing sector. He said negotiations on e-commerce will have to wait till India passes important legislation on the issue, though it will be part of the final trade agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-looking-to-diversify-trade-ties-amid-difficulties-with-china-trade-minister-dan-tehan-101633107517025.html

The employees have also raised concerns regarding the toxic working culture at the company and claim that it doesn't adhere to proper safety protocols.However, Blue Origin has rejected the charges, saying it has "no tolerance for any kind of harassment or discrimination" and that it stands by its safety record.The allegations were outlined in a blog post that has signatures from 21 employees including Alexandra Abrams, the company's former head of employee communications.In the essay, employees stated that "numerous senior leaders have been known to be consistently inappropriate with women". They also claim that many company leaders were "unapproachable" and showed clear bias against women."Workforce gender gaps are common in the space industry, but at Blue Origin they also manifest in a particular brand of sexism," the employees stated in the blog.It also mentioned an incident where a senior executive reported sexual harassment "multiple times," but it remained within the "loyal inner circle" of CEO Bob Smith.The blog mentions a former executive employee who frequently referred to women as "'baby girl,' 'baby doll,' and 'sweetheart.'"The employees stated that Blue Origin company was more focused on beating billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk in the space race rather than addressing the safety issues that would have slowed down the schedule.On July 21, Bezos blasted off to space in a spaceflight developed by his company Blue Origin. However, he was defeated by Bezos in the race by nine days by Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson who pushed ahead and travelled to space in his own flight from New Mexico."Some of us felt that with the resources and staff available, leadership’s race to launch at such a breakneck speed was seriously compromising flight safety," the employees said.Refuting the allegations, Blue Origin said it believes "New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-employees-accuse-blue-origin-of-sexist-toxic-culture-company-denies-101633102585102.html

The move comes as several nations among Covax’s 140-plus beneficiary states are still inoculating the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine when other developed countries have moved on to administer booster shots.“For the October supply we designed a different methodology, only covering participants with low sources of supply,” Reuters reported quoting WHO assistant director-general for access to vaccines, Mariangela Simao during a conference presentation last week.Displaying slides during the conference, Simao showed that among over 90 poorer countries served by Covax, nearly half had administered Covid-19 vaccine doses to less than 20 per cent of their eligible population, the Reuters report added. Meanwhile, several richer countries have already achieved 70 per cent vaccination coverage. As many as 49 countries, identified as the least covered beneficiary states, will be provided with nearly 75 million Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca. However, the names of the countries were not revealed by the WHO.The Covax initiative has overseen the allocation of more than 500 million coronavirus vaccine doses, of which around 300 million have been shipped to recipient countries.  The requirement for Covid-19 booster doses has been a topic of controversy since August when the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on the same, even as several nations including Canada decided to do otherwise. Last month, he stressed on his viewpoint yet again, saying that he “won’t stay silent” when firms and nations in-charge of the global supply of vaccines “think the world’s poor should be satisfied with leftovers.” According to a latest BBC report, more than 50 countries have missed the deadline set by the WHO to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of their population with both doses of Covid-19 vaccines. The list includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Myanmar and Yemen, among others. US President Joe Biden on Monday took the booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine, encouraging his fellow country people to follow suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccines-via-covax-to-be-sent-only-to-least-covered-nations-in-oct-who-101633093559084.html

The decision comes as nearly 80 per cent of the population aged 16 and older have been fully vaccinated, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday. However, no official date has been announced yet welcoming international tourists back.Australians have had to argue for rare exemptions from the travel restrictions, among the most stringent any democracy in the world imposed on March 20 last year. Many people failed to reach relatives' death beads, missed funerals and weddings simply because Australia was trying to keep the Covid-19 disease at bay.The only exceptions to the travel ban were government employees and essential workers but tourism was never accepted as a reason to cross the border.“We've saved lives. We've saved livelihoods, but we must work together to ensure that Australians can reclaim the lives that they once had in this country,” Morrison said, as quoted by Associated Press.New South Wales is expected to become the first state to reach the 80 per cent vaccination benchmark while Sydney's airport will be the first to resume international flights, the Australian prime minister said. Sydney-based Qantas Airways has already announced that international flights to London and Los Angeles would resume from November 14.“We'll be working towards complete quarantine-free travel for certain countries, such as New Zealand, when it is safe to do so,” he said.Australia had earlier imposed a cap on the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed to return each week to reduce pressure on two-week hotel quarantine, amid reports of the highly contagious delta variant. The cap would only apply to the unvaccinated under the new regime. At the same time, those fully vaccinated will be able to quarantine at home and for only a week.Australia has also added Indian-made Covishield and China's Sinovac to a list of Covid-19 vaccines recognised by the country.Travel restrictions will remain in place for Australians who chose not to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, those who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons or children too young to get the jab have been exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-lift-travel-ban-from-november-international-flights-to-resume-soon-101633084960746.html

You gave up your lives to defend the dignity of your country. We sacrifice our youth to make a promise that is as heavy as a mountain,” the report added.Condolences were extended to the four PLA soldiers killed: Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuran.In one sequence, PLA soldiers are shown bowing their heads in silence in front of what appears to be machine guns.Another aerial sequence, possibly shot by a drone, shows the personnel standing in a row on a narrow pathway on the side of a cliff.Etched in Chinese on a cliff in the background are the words: “Never give up an inch of the beautiful motherland”.Towards the end of the video, the new leader of the squad, who took over after the death of Xiao Siyuan, is shown pledging to carry forward the “Dagger squad spirit”, comprising qualities like hard work and defending the territorial integrity of the country.Chinese media outlets have released several videos this year that have sought to portray Indian troops as trespassers and aggressors since the PLA death toll was made public in February this year.China’s official English channel, CGTN, had uploaded a video on one of the four PLA soldiers who died, Chen Hongjun, on social media and its website to mark the armed forces’ founding day on August 1.Besides interviews of Chen’s family members including his wife, the video showed edited footage of the clash between the two armies; Chinese equipment on the banks of the fast flowing river, soldiers, mostly Chinese, precariously wading in knee-deep water and personnel from the two sides charging at each other.The video, evidently pitched as a propaganda piece aimed at a domestic Chinese audience, begins with a one-sided introduction to the 2020, June 15 clash.“Indian army violated the bilateral consensus and crossed the Line of Actual Control on June 15, 2020,” it claimed, a claim repeatedly dismissed by India.The videos, which purportedly portrayed the build-up to the Galwan Valley clash, identified the Indian soldiers only as “foreign” troops and the accompanying commentary painted them as trespassers - an allegation consistently denied by India.In February, several versions of a video, ranging in length from a little more than a minute to eight minutes, were released by outlets such as CGTN and the Global Times, showing troops from the two sides negotiating and jostling with each other. The background comprises ravines, a flowing river, and steep cliffs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-releases-galwan-valley-video-marking-death-of-pla-soldiers-101633086696205.html

Dave Butler said.General Milley and Mrs Milley, ahead of the meeting, welcomed CDS Rawat during an Armed Forces full honour arrival ceremony on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. He also thanked CDS Rawat for contributing to the strengthening of the defence partnership between the US and India.“The US and India share a strong military-to-military relationship under the US-India Major Defence Partnership, which supports a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Butler added.According to the White House fact sheet, the US aims to further strengthen its defence partnership with India, continue the progress made as Major Defence Partners. The fact sheet also highlighted US' to bolster its relationship with the Indian military and said that the US-India Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) agreement signed between both nations in July this year points towards that commitment.Under the DTTI, both nations will co-develop air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles. It currently encompasses four working groups. Another meeting will take place later this year to expand defence industrial collaboration.Both nations, during the meeting between PM Modi and US president Joe Biden, also committed to ensuring a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military power in the region.

Some had glued their hands to the ground and chained themselves together using bicycle locks.Their protest brought traffic at a roundabout near the M4 motorway's Junction 3 to a standstill.Police eventually cleared the road, dragging handcuffed activists away from the site."Officers arrested 13 people for obstruction and conspiracy to commit public nuisance," London's Metropolitan Police said on its Twitter account.Insulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes in an effort to curb fossil fuel use and fight global warming.The group said on Friday that it also blocked a roundabout near the M1 motorway at Junction 1, its latest action after it stopped traffic on London's M25 orbital motorway multiple times over the last three weeks, and blocked the Port of Dover.In an attempt to stop the disruption, the transport ministry has sought injunctions from the High Court which mean that the protesters may face jail time for repeating their actions.But Insulate Britain says its actions will continue until Britain makes a meaningful statement to insulate the country's homes, which it says are the most energy inefficient in Europe.Britain, which aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, will host the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson will push world leaders to commit to ending reliance on fossil fuels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-climate-activists-arrested-for-blocking-heathrow-airport-access-road-police-101633082680187.html

Announcement on Monday||Scientists behind COVID-19 vaccines could be in the running to win the Nobel Prize for Medicine even though the pandemic is far from over. Some scientists say it is just a matter of time: If the work that went into developing the vaccines is not recognised when this year's prize is announced on Monday, it will win the award in years to come.More than 4.7 million people have died from COVID-19 since the first cases of the novel coronavirus were registered in 2019, and many countries still live under severe restrictions intended to curb its spread.But COVID-19 vaccines have helped some wealthy states return almost to normality while others are yet to receive vaccine doses in large quantities.Among those seen by other scientists as potential winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine are Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko and American Drew Weissman for their work on what are known as Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines.The mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have revolutionised the fight against the virus. They are quick to produce and highly effective."This technique will get the prize sooner or later, of that I am sure," said Ali Mirazami, professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. "The question is when."Traditional vaccines, which introduce a weakened or dead virus to stimulate the body's immune system, can take a decade or more to develop. Moderna's mRNA vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.The mRNA carries messages from the body's DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes including digestion or fighting disease.The new vaccines use laboratory-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus' spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus. DECADES OF WORKThe mRNA was discovered in 1961 but it has taken scientists decades to cure the mRNA technique from problems such as instability and causing inflammatory conditions.Developers now hope it can be used to treat both cancer and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in the future."In addition to the fact that they have been shown to generate a very effective immune response, you do not have to tailor the production every time you make a new vaccine," said Adam Frederik Sander Bertelsen, Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen and chief scientific officer at vaccine company Adaptvac."It has actually saved countless thousands of people due to its speed and efficiency, so I can well support that."Kariko, 66, laid the groundwork for the mRNA vaccines and Weissman, 62, is her long-time collaborator."They are the brain behind the mRNA discovery," said Mirazami. He added: "They might be too young, the (Nobel) committee usually wait until the recipients are in their 80s."Kariko, with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, made a breakthrough by figuring out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive.The Nobel Prize was founded by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel and is awarded for achievements in Medicine, Chemistry, Literature, Peace and Physics. This year's winners are announced between Oct. 4 and 11, starting with Medicine.

In addition, more than 15,000 people are estimated to have crossed the border into India. A further 7,000 people crossed into Thailand, all of whom have returned and remain internally displaced in Myanmar,” the Secretary-General said in the report, which covers the period from August 15, 2020 to August 14, 2021.Myanmar shares an over 1,600 km long unfenced and porous land border with India as well as a maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. Four North-Eastern states - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram share the international boundary with Myanmar.Guterres said in the report that since February, tensions have increased throughout the country, including in areas covered by the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement and where there was relative peace before February 1, when the Myanmar military seized power and detained top political figures, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint.“Mostly in states and regions along the borders with Thailand, China and India, armed clashes have erupted between the Tatmadaw, ethnic armed organisations and newly formed civilian people’s defence forces, raising concern about regional implications of the crisis and the potential for a large-scale armed conflict,” the report said.The UN chief notes in the report that Rohingya continue to undertake risky journeys across the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.“In June, a boat carrying dozens of Rohingya refugees reached Aceh, Indonesia, after leaving Bangladesh or Myanmar – engine failure caused it to remain adrift in the Andaman Sea for several months, leading to the deaths of some refugees. Another boat was rescued by the Indian Coast Guard in February,” he said.The report added that brutality by the security forces against people opposing the military takeover and the self-declared State Administrative Council, including those participating in the civil disobedience movement, has been wide-ranging.“Those expressing opposition to the military and joining democratic movements, as well as their relatives and associates, have been subject to arbitrary killings and detentions, disappearances, night raids, intimidation, and torture,” it said.There have also been numerous reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by the security forces as well as numerous reports of acts of violence targeted at the security forces, such as the killing of individuals suspected of collaborating with the military.“The Secretary-General has called for maximum restraint by all sides,” the report said.Guterres said he has repeatedly called on the military to respect the will of the people, to refrain from violence and repression, and to act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country.The UN Security Council has expressed deep concern at the arbitrary detention of members of the Government, including President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and others, and called for the immediate release of all those detained arbitrarily, while condemning the ongoing violence.“Neighbouring countries could leverage their influence over the military and call on it to respect the will of the people and to act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country and region,” he said.Guterres voiced concern that Myanmar is facing a prolonged period of insecurity and instability and it is important that concerted efforts are made among domestic, regional and international actors to enable fully civilian rule in line with the will of the people.“The risk of a large-scale armed conflict requires a collective approach to prevent a multi-dimensional catastrophe in the heart of South-East Asia and beyond," he said."Grave humanitarian implications, including rapidly deteriorating food security, an increase in mass displacements and a weakened public health system compounded by a new wave of COVID-19 infections require a coordinated approach in complementarity with regional actors,” Guterres said.He said that the United Nations will focus its efforts on further strengthening a system-wide coherent approach to providing humanitarian and life-saving assistance to support the people of Myanmar and help to prevent further regional ramifications.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet had said last week that more than 1,120 people have been killed since the coup and military authorities have also arrested over 8,000 people, including elected officials, protesters and journalists during arrests and raids.At least 120 people have reportedly died in custody, and some have been denied access to medical treatment, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-over-15k-may-have-crossed-the-border-into-india-says-un-chief-101633067673025.html

The development was first reported on by Fox News, which cited US defence officials who identified the terrorist. Later, the US Central Command (Centcom) told the Military Times that Abu-Ahmed was killed in the September 20 drone strike near Idlib in Syria, adding that there were zero civilian casualties this time.Centcom spokesperson Major John Rigsbee said while speaking to the Military Times that Salim Abu-Ahmed was a notorious al Qaeda leader responsible for “planning, funding, and approving” a multitude of ‘trans-regional’ attacks. “There are no indications of civilian casualties as a result of the strike,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the United States will continue to target international terrorist networks abroad whose actions risk its interests and allies across the world.On September 20, the Associated Press reported, citing rescue workers and a war monitor, that the US drone strike in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria hit a vehicle travelling on a rural road; and that at least one person was killed in the incident. White Helmets, a civil defence team, told AP that the “unidentified body” was lifted from the car along the Idlib-Binnish road east of the Idlib province in Syria. The charred vehicle, split in the middle, lay on the side of the rural road in an orchid.The US central command later said that American forces had conducted a “kinetic counterterrorism strike” near the Idlib province targeting a senior leader of al Qaeda. In a statement at the time, US navy lieutenant Josie Lynne Lenny said that “initial indications are that we struck the individual we were aiming for, and there are no indications of civilian casualties as a result of the strike.” No additional details were released officially thereafter.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that the vehicle carried “a militant from one of the radical groups operating in the province,” adding that it was “linked to al Qaida” but stopped short of identifying the group.Notably, Washington has earlier carried out attacks in the Idlib region before targeting al Qaeda terrorists and the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was hiding in the province after fleeing from eastern Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-al-qaeda-leader-salim-abu-ahmad-killed-in-us-strike-in-syria-reports-101633062335213.html

Meanwhile, the news outlet CTV News reported that Jag Sahota has retained a law firm to file a motion before a court to annul the results of the election. That is likely to be moved next week.Constituent Glenn Pennett had earlier released security camera footage on Facebook that showed Chahal, better known as George, personally removing Sahota’s flyer from his doorstep and putting his own campaign material there. That could comprise a contravention of the Canada Elections Act, according to Canadian media. CTV News also reported that Pennett has filed a complaint in this regard with local police.While the CCE does not confirm its investigations into individual cases, Sahota’s representatives have said that the office has approached them in this matter as part of its investigation.George Chahal’s campaign has maintained that the flyer he removed had the wrong information about the polling station for Pennett. However, that has been refuted by Pennett who has said the flyer George Chahal placed instead had incorrect information.A statement from the Liberal Party said “Chahal and his team will always be available to respond to any inquiries with respect to this recent election”.Following his victory, George Chahal was considered a certainty for inclusion in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s next Cabinet. However, emergence of the footage showing him removing election material has jeopardised that possibility.Justin Trudeau is expected to name the Cabinet this month and till date has announced that only Deputy Prime Minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland will retain her portfolios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-chahal-case-canada-conducts-inquiry-into-violation-of-election-rules-101633066056472.html

Here’s how||A 24-year-old motorcyclist was taken to a hospital just in time after his smartwatch called for help following an accident. Mothership, a community news service, reported that on September 25, Muhammad Fitri was hit by a van in Singapore and he was knocked out and left stranded in a desolate street in the Ang Mo Kio area. Fitri was wearing an Apple Watch Series 4, which has a fall detection feature that notifies its wearers’ emergency contact and local emergency services if they are not responsive. The users can respond to the fall alert and if they are not in the condition to dismiss it, the watch calls for help.According to Mothership, Fitri’s Apple Watch detected a hard fall late in the evening and after he failed to respond to the hard fall alerts, it alerted his emergency contacts as well as emergency services who rushed to the spot and took him to the hospital. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) told Mothership that they were alerted to the accident at around 8:20pm and Fitri was taken to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.In June this year, a 78-year-old man from North Carolina in the US fell unconscious after a fall and his Apple Watch detected that he had fallen and was immobile. It called for help after 60 seconds later. A month later, a 25-year-old man was rushed into surgery after his Apple Watch's fall detection feature recognised the fall and alerted emergency services. He underwent brain surgery after subsequent CT scans revealed a fractured skull and multiple hematomas that were growing in size.The fall detection feature was introduced with Apple Watch Series 4 and is part of a biometric monitoring suite that covers heart health, blood oxygen levels, mobility, fitness among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/an-apple-watch-saved-a-singapore-motorcyclist-s-life-here-s-how-101633055625226.html

In a news briefing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that Pakistan must remember to uphold its equities and responsibilities with respect to terrorism in “that part of the world”. Kirby added that the United States is well within its rights to conduct airstrikes in Afghanistan as a means to curb the terror threat, even though its ground troops left the country over a month ago ending a 20-year war.Also Read | Pakistan involved in harbouring Taliban, must 'line up’: Blinken“We've been very honest about our concerns with Pakistan for a long time, about the safe havens that exist on their side of the border along that spine. And those concerns are still valid today,” Kirby was quoted as saying by the PTI news agency. He said that US leaders are keeping on their “candid conversations” with their Pakistani counterparts to make sure that as Afghanistan's neighbour, Pakistan continues to uphold its own “equities and responsibilities”.“I think it's important to continue to remind that the Pakistani people, likewise, have been rendered victim by terrorist threats that emanate from those groups and along that same border,” the Pentagon press secretary said.For context, Pakistan has for many years been under fire from political quarters across the globe for providing a safe haven to terrorist outfits, including al Qaeda, among others. Most recently though, the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan, backed by the United States, raised its concerns about Islamabad providing the Taliban terrorists with a safe haven and even medical help when needed.The Taliban later swept Kabul in a lightning-fast offensive and seized control of the state apparatus. Soon after, top military and intelligence personnel from Pakistan were seen scheduling meetings with the Taliban leaders, and many believed that Islamabad had no less of a role to play in the blitzkrieg, a move rendered in the hope of cutting a piece of the pie in Kabul and discomforting India in the process.Also Read | After Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, terror attacks in Pakistan highest in 4 yearsBut for all its ambitions, the Afghanistan manoeuvre could very well prove fatal for the Pakistani leadership; a recent report showed that terror attacks in Pakistan have increased to their highest level in more than four years after the US military withdrew from the war-torn land of Afghanistan and the Taliban seized power. According to data compiled by the South Asia terrorism portal, Pakistan saw at least 35 terror attacks that killed 52 civilians in August alone, the highest since February 2017. Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, now alleges that Afghanistan harbours the anti-Pakistani group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan—the Pakistani Taliban—and also the secessionist Balochistan Liberation Army.In its Thursday news briefing, the Pentagon took note of the rapidly evolving situation in the frontiers of Afghanistan and said that the US will continue to conduct drone strikes inside the war-ravaged country, in order to “protect the nation”. “We believe we have the authorities that we need to continue to protect the nation,” he said. “We have the authorities that we need to continue to defend our interests and the security of the American people there and around the world, and we're going to do that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-honest-concerns-about-pakistan-being-a-safe-haven-for-terrorists-101633051342709.html

He also reiterated the North's demands that South Korea abandon a “double-dealing attitude” over the North’s missile tests if Seoul wants to see the resumption of talks and major cooperation steps.South Korea has said it would prepare for the restoration of the hotlines, which it called necessary to discuss and resolve many pending issues. The cross-border phone and fax lines have been largely dormant for more than a year.Some experts say North Korea wants South Korea to persuade the United States to ease punishing economic international sanctions on it. Other say North Korea is pressuring South Korea not to criticize its ballistic missile tests, which are banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions, as part of its quest to be recognized internationally as a nuclear power.North Korea also recently has test-fired a new hypersonic missile, a newly developed cruise missile and a ballistic missile launched from a train. South Korea’s military assessed the hypersonic missile to be at an early stage of development, but experts say the two previous missile tests displayed the North’s ability to attack targets in South Korea and Japan, both key U.S. allies that host U.S. troops.The North's recent tests were in line with Kim Jong Un's earlier vows to introduce sophisticated weapons and enlarge his nuclear arsenal to defend itself against U.S. hostility — a reference to U.S.-led sanctions on the North and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul that North Korea believes are an invasion rehearsal.Nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington has been largely deadlocked since early 2019.North Korea hasn’t tested a long-range missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland for about four years, an indication it wants to keep alive its chances for diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-claims-it-test-fired-new-anti-aircraft-missile-in-4th-round-of-weapons-firings-101633051598706.html

The K-8 school was placed on lockdown and students were taken by bus to a nearby church to be reunited with frantic parents.Memphis police identified both the victim of the shooting at the Cummings School and the alleged shooter as 13-year-old boys, Assistant Police Chief Don Crowe said. Both were students at the school.The wounded child underwent surgery at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital and was expected to recover, officials said. Crowe said the shooting took place in a stairwell. Video footage showed there were no other students in the stairwell when the shooting occured, Crowe said.The suspect fled the school after the shooting, but later surrendered at a police precinct. He was expected to be charged with criminal attempt of first-degree murder and taken to juvenile court, Crowe said.Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, where the alleged shooter got the gun, and where on his body the wounded child was shot. School officials said Cummings performs random metal detector scans on students.“We also have to think, ‘How did a 13-year-old get their hands on a gun?'” Crowe said. "It's a question we all want the answer to. I'm not sure we'll ever find the full truth. But certainly, it begs of everyone to keep their guns secure."After the shooting, parents held umbrellas in a light drizzle and talked with each other as they waited for children to arrive at the church. Ebonnie Hayslett rushed to the school to make sure her two nieces were safe.“The worst news you could receive is a shooting at a kids school," she said. "My main concern was the kids being OK, the teachers, the faculty. No one wants to go pick up their kids and be surrounded by SWAT cars and police officers.”A school resource officer who was inside the building responded to the shooting and informed police about it, said Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray. A school nurse applied pressure to the child's wound to help stop the bleeding, Ray said.Students were lined up and taken out of the school into buses, which brought them to the church.Tempers flared briefly as parents lined up outside the church, demanding information about the shooting and pushing for the release of their kids. When the students were dismissed, some of them were crying and hugging their parents as they left the church.Ray said emergency procedures were followed closely. He praised teachers and staff for keeping the children calm and safe, and for using training from an active shooter drill held in early September.Ray became emotional while speaking with news reporters outside Metropolitan Baptist Church.“We’re doing all we can to keep our students safe,” Ray said. “We can’t allow our children to hurt from gun violence.”School board president Michelle McKissack acknowledged that the relatively young age of the detained student, 13, was shocking.A former TV news reporter, McKissack recalled covering the 1998 Westside Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas, which was committed by two boys ages 13 and 11. Four students and a teacher were killed, and 10 others were wounded.“It was very shocking today to find out that this was happening at a middle school,” McKissack said.The shooting is the latest in a rash of incidents in the past two years in which children in Memphis have been shot, some fatally.Dr. Barry Gilmore, chief medical officer at Le Bonheur, said more than 100 children have been treated for gunshot wounds this year at the hospital. He added that Le Bonheur was expected to surpass its single-year record of 135 child gunshot patients, set last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boy-shot-and-critically-wounded-at-tennessee-school-juvenile-detained-101633047513780.html
01-10-2021||World||Ecuador declares prison emergency after 116 killed in riot||Ecuador's president has declared a state of emergency in the prison system following a battle among gang members in a coastal lockup that killed at least 116 people and injured 80 in what authorities say was the worst prison bloodbath ever in the country.Officials said at least five of the dead were found to have been beheaded.Dozens of police and military vehicles, as well as ambulances, entered the prison eompound on Thursday. Helicopters flew over the area.There could be more bodies or seriously injured people in the prison, said Col. Tannya Varela, the national police commander.Hundreds of people gathered outside the crime lab in Guayaquil, hoping to collect the bodies of relatives they believed were killed in the prison. The prosecutors’ office said on Twitter that police were working to identify bodies.Henry Coral, a police official, asked family members to help speed the identification of bodies by telling authorities about any tattoo, scar or other distinguishing feature of prisoners believed to have been killed. Some bodies were mutilated or burned, making identification harder.President Guillermo Lasso decreed a state of emergency Wednesday, which will give the government powers that include deploying police and soldiers inside prisons. The order came a day after bloodshed at the Litoral penitentiary in Guayaquil that officials blamed on gangs linked to international drug cartels fighting for control of the facility.“It is regrettable that the prisons are being turned into territories for power disputes by criminal gangs,” Lasso said, adding that he would act with "absolute firmness” to regain control of the Litoral prison and prevent the violence from spreading to other penitentiaries.Images circulating on social media showed dozens of bodies in the prison’s Pavilions 9 and 10 and scenes that looked like battlefields. The fighting was with firearms, knives and bombs, officials said. Earlier, regional police commander Fausto Buenaño had said that bodies were being found in the prison’s pipelines.Outside the prison morgue, the relatives of inmates wept, with some describing to reporters the cruelty with which their loved ones were decapitated and dismembered.“In the history of the country, there has not been an incident similar or close to this one,” said Ledy Zúñiga, the former president of Ecuador's National Rehabilitation Council.Zúñiga, who was also the country's minister of justice in 2016, said she regretted that steps had not been taken to prevent another massacre following deadly prison riots last February.Earlier, officials said the violence erupted from a dispute between the “Los Lobos” and “Los Choneros” prison gangs.Col. Mario Pazmiño, the former director of Ecuador's military intelligence, said the bloody fighting shows that “transnational organized crime has permeated the structure" of Ecuador's prisons, adding that Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels operate through local gangs.“They want to sow fear,” he told The Associated Press on Wednesday, urging the government to temporarily cede control of the prisons to the National Police. “The more radical and violent the way they murder,” the more they achieve their goal of control, he added.Luis Hernández, an analyst on political and military affairs who was a general in Ecuador's army, said imprisoned gang members extend their control from prisons to the streets, managing debts, deliveries and other aspects of the illegal drug trade.Ecuador is a key transit point for drug trafficking organizations because of its good road infrastructure, three international maritime ports and two international airports, Hernández said.Ecuador's president said that care points had been set up for relatives of the inmates with food and psychological support. He added that a $24 million program to address the country's prisons will be accelerated, starting with investments in infrastructure and technology in the Litoral prison.The former director of Ecuador's prison bureau, Fausto Cobo, said that inside penitentiaries authorities face a “threat with power equal to or greater than the state itself.” He said that while security forces must enter prisons with shields and unarmed, they are met by inmates with high-caliber weapons.In July, the president decreed another state of emergency in Ecuador’s prison system following several violent episodes that resulted in more than 100 inmates being killed. Those deaths occurred in various prisons and not in a single facility like Tuesday's massacre.Previously, the bloodiest day occurred in February, when 79 prisoners died in simultaneous riots in three prisons in the country. In July, 22 more prisoners lost their lives in the Litoral penitentiary, while in September a penitentiary center was attacked by drones leaving no fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ecuador-declares-prison-emergency-after-116-killed-in-riot-101633047036094.html
01-10-2021||World||Joe Biden signs government funding bill to avert a shutdown||President Joe Biden on Thursday signed a nine-week stopgap funding bill that averts a government shutdown but fails to resolve the threat of a US default linked to the debt limit.The legislation was hastily passed by both chambers of Congress earlier in the day, and keeps funding levels for government departments and agencies flat until Dec. 3. Had it not been approved, parts of the US government would have begun suspending operations on Friday.The measure, however, doesn’t include a provision sought by Democrats to suspend the nation’s debt limit, after Republicans in the Senate blocked a version of the bill that included the debt provision. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that if lawmakers fail to raise the debt limit by about Oct. 18, the government may not be able to pay its bills, posing a dire risk to the US economy. The bill passed both chambers after Democrats dropped an earlier attempt to attach a debt-ceiling suspension to the bill in face of implacable Republican opposition to that measure. GOP senators blocked a version of the bill containing the debt ceiling language on Monday. The federal government would be kept open through Dec. 3 under the legislation. The bill also contains $28.6 billion for states recovering from hurricanes and wildfires as well as $6.3 billion to resettle refugees from the US war in Afghanistan.Republicans said the last minute stopgap vote was the fault of Democrats who had tried to tie the bill to the debt ceiling last week.“We did not need to be in the place just hours before the deadline,” said Appropriations Committee top Republican Kay Granger of Texas said on the House floor, noting she had voted against the bill last week over the debt issue.House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said Republicans are threatening the economy to play politics on the debt ceiling.“This is not about as some of colleagues would like to say about paying for spending going forward. This is about paying for the past,” she said. “Now is the time for us to raise the debt ceiling in order to do that.”Biden, in a message accompanying the White House announcement that he had signed the bill, thanked Granger, DeLauro as well as Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, and Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, “for their leadership.”Democrats urged GOP senators to consent to passing that via a simple majority with only Democratic votes. So far Republicans have rejected that, trying instead to force Democrats to undertake a weeks-long budget process to do the same thing. “Why do the Republicans refuse the raise the debt limit?” said Leahy, the Senate Appropriations Chairman.  “Why are they willing to make us look like idiots in front of the rest of the world? Why are they willing to put so many people out of work?”A stopgap spending bill is needed because none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for fiscal 2022 have been enacted into law amid a dispute between Democrats and minority Senate Republicans over spending levels for the military and domestic programs. Leahy said Wednesday he plans to unveil draft spending bills soon to jump-start the process of negotiating a solution before the new deadline. The stopgap bill did not include a proposed $1 billion for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system despite widespread support for the provision. The House has passed a standalone bill providing that funding, and the Senate may take that bill up soon according to senators in both parties. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, held up the provision over aid going to Afghanistan that he argues will benefit the Taliban government. Paul has said the assistance should instead be used to offset the cost of the Iron Dome system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signs-government-funding-bill-to-avert-a-shutdown-101633046436349.html
