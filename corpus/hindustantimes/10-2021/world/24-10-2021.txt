Currently there is no safety risk to people on shore, however the situation will continue to be monitored," the agency said.Video obtained by Reuters showed fire cascading down from the deck of the ship into the water.The Zim Kingston reported on Friday that it had encountered rough weather west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca."This is extremely concerning. The ship and containers are very close to Victoria, BC, and a big storm is forecast to hit tonight. We ... are worried this may be yet another environmental disaster," said David Boudinot, president of Surfrider Foundation Canada, an environmental organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-breaks-out-on-cargo-ship-containers-off-british-columbia-101635088415668.html

The power pylon was destructed in a bomb blast, Xinhua reported citing the Afghan national power company’s statement. Terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the explosion.“The Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) personnel completed the restoration of a destroyed electricity tower in Qala-e-Muradbig area of Kabul province at midday on Sunday…The power supply is now back to normal,” the company’s statement read.The explosion took place in a region located on the northern outskirts of Afghanistan’s Kabul. The destruction of the power pylon cut the main power supply line to Kabul, thereby leaving the city in complete darkness. Additionally, Afghanistan has been facing power shortages for some time now, and has imported electricity from multiple neighbouring nations, including Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, among others, Xinhua reported. Owing to the blast, the supply line distributing imported electricity to Kabul was cut.Meanwhile, the Taliban said that they have arrested three people in the power pylon blast case so far.This latest attack is among several similar ones that the Islamic State has been carrying out in Afghanistan since the country was recaptured by the Taliban from the United States after two decades. The Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb blast of a Shiite Mosque in Kandahar, which took the lives of 60 people. The terrorist group later issued a threat to Shia Muslims as well, saying that they will be targeted everywhere – from their homes to centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/power-supply-restored-in-afghanistan-after-isil-bomb-blast-damaged-main-line-101635089350240.html

Most of the infections that spread in nearly 11 provinces since October 17 have been found to be due to cross-region tourism activities.Deputy Director of the NHC, Wu Liangyou said that the epidemiological investigations of the infections, discovered 106 out of 133 infections to be from tourism-related activities.According to the newspaper, the official said that the increase in the number of cases is going to increase as the screening continues.The official also urged the public to take the booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccines to reduce the risks of the resurgence of cases, reported Global Times.Meanwhile, Gansu, China's Northwest province, has announced the suspension of all tourism activities after a surge in the Covid-19 cases in the region, reported local media.All tourists in Lanzhou -- where most Covid-19 cases in the province were reported -- required to stay in wherever place they were and be quarantined, said Global Times Gansu registered -- from October 18 to Saturday night -- a total of 41 confirmed cases, of which 30 are from Lanzhou, seven from Zhangye, two from Jiayu Pass, one from Tianshui, and one from Longnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-health-commission-anticipates-surge-in-covid-19-cases-triggered-by-delta-variant-101635078464343.html
24-10-2021||World||US supported by India is inimical to CPEC: Pakistan PM’s aide||The Chief of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority has accused the United States of sabotaging the multi-billion dollar project, reported news agency PTI. The ambitious CPEC was launched in 2015 and is considered the economic lifeline of Pakistan.“From the point of view of the emerging geo-strategic situation, one thing is clear: the United States supported by India is inimical to CPEC. It will not let it succeed. That’s where we have to take a position,” PTI quoted Khalid Mansoor as saying while addressing the CPEC Summit at the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi on Saturday. Mansoor is the Special Assistant to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on CPEC affairs.The PM's aide further said the United States and India continue to “make attempts to manoeuvre Pakistan out of” China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a global infrastructure development plan — under which the Chinese government has been investing heavily in about 70 countries, PTI reported, quoting a report in the Dawn newspaper.“There’s no way Pakistan will forgo any of its benefits. It has more than once burnt its fingers in (the Western) alliance in the past,” he said, adding that their attempts to dilute China’s strategic influence in the region will fail. Mansoor said the Western powers view the CPEC as a symbol of China’s political ambition.“That’s the reason CPEC is seen suspiciously by both the United States and Europe… they view CEPC more as a move by China to expand its political, strategic and business influence,” Mansoor said, noting that China has been able to allay that apprehension “to a great extent”.The United States is now “taking stock of the economic and political consequences” of withdrawing from the region, he reasoned.“I had a detailed discussion with the people in the American embassy. I told them CPEC is available for them as well. They have also expressed their wish that they would like to develop some kind of involvement and see how it can be beneficial for both countries,” he said.Mansoor also stated that Islamabad is seeking the expansion of the CPEC to Afghanistan, adding there has been a “deep interest” in developing economic connectivity between Afghanistan and Pakistan.According to Western think tanks, the CPEC is an economic trap that has already resulted in bloated public debt levels alongside disproportionately high Chinese influence in Pakistan’s economy, the Dawn newspaper further said.The CEPC aims to connect western China with the Gwadar seaport in southwestern Pakistan through a network of roads, railways and other projects of infrastructure and development. Islamabad is the seventh largest recipient of Chinese overseas development financing with 71 projects worth USD 27.3 billion currently underway as part of the CPEC.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supported-by-india-is-inimical-to-cpec-pakistan-pm-s-aide-101635070629409.html
24-10-2021||World||Singapore PM Lee rules out indefinite Covid-19 lockdown||Singapore cannot go into an indefinite lockdown and stand still, but also cannot “simply let go and let things rip”, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said."We have to travel this road to get to living safely with Covid-19. We want to get there with as few casualties as possible,” Lee said in a Facebook post on Saturday.Singapore’s multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday a slew of measures for the effective opening up of the affluent city-state.These include requiring vaccination for all staff returning to the workplace from Jan 1, 2022, as well as adding China's Sinovac to the national vaccination programme and expanding the home recovery scheme to certain pregnant women, The Straits Times newspaper reported.The task force is co-chaired by Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.In his post, Lee highlighted the weekly infection growth rate -- the ratio of community cases in the past week over the week before.Two weeks ago, this figure was 1.5, meaning that cases were doubling roughly every fortnight.It now stands at 1.15, meaning that cases are growing 15 per cent each week. This works out to case numbers doubling about every month.If the ratio drops below one and Singapore's hospital and intensive care unit situations remain stable, some measures can be eased, Lee said."Many of you have written to express your frustrations about the restrictions, while others have voiced concerns that we are opening up too fast!" he noted."I fully understand how you feel. It has been a long journey, and the continuing uncertainty and disruption is hard on all of us." Certain sectors, such as the food and beverage industry, have had an exceptionally tough time, the Prime Minister explained.He urged everyone to continue doing their part and exercise social responsibility as Singapore works towards living safely with the virus.This includes taking vaccinations or booster doses when offered, as they reduce an individual's chances of getting seriously ill, he said.“Let's continue to stay safe and keep working together,” Lee added.The Health Ministry reported 3,598 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, which includes 790 from migrant workers' dormitories, and six deaths from complications due to the virus. Three hundred people have died from coronavirus linked complications while 169,261 infections have been reported since the virus broke here last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-pm-lee-rules-out-indefinite-covid-19-lockdown-101635066162716.html

24-10-2021||World||Uzbekistan votes in presidential polls; Afghanistan, economy key issues||Voters across Uzbekistan on Sunday were casting their ballots in a presidential election in which the situation in Afghanistan and the need for greater connectivity to boost development figured in the low-key campaign. Incumbent President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, 64, is widely anticipated to win a second term in the absence of any real opposition from the four other parties that are in the fray. Voting across the Central Asian country of some 36 million people began at 8 am local time and will continue until 8 pm. Voting percentage at about 12 noon local time was 12.3%, as per official data. As part of the campaign, meetings and roundtables were organised in Tashkent to discuss pressing issues such as economic recovery in the post-pandemic era and the situation in Afghanistan. With some 800,000 first-time voters among the 19 million registered voters, many youngsters actively participated in the roundtables that were joined by several ministers.Mirziyoyev came to power in 2016 after the death of his mentor, Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan’s first post-independence president who ruled the country for 27 years. A second term for Mirziyoyev will allow him to deepen his reform campaign and further open up Uzbekistan to foreign trade and investment. Mirziyoyev has also struck a balance in his country’s relations with Russia and the West, while pushing forward with connectivity projects with South Asia. Also Read: Islamic State, Al-Qaeda have increased online propaganda, warns FATFDuring a virtual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 11 last year, Mirziyoyev had proposed that Uzbekistan, India and Iran should hold a trilateral dialogue to promote connectivity through Chabahar port. India responded with alacrity to this suggestion and the first meeting of a trilateral working group was held just three days later. During the campaign, the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in mid-August also came up for discussion, and senior Uzbek officials insisted that the war-torn country should not be isolated in view of its urgent humanitarian needs. The officials also called for the formation of a government in Kabul that includes all ethnic groups and is based on democratic principles. The officials also said Uzbekistan plans to diversify the landlocked country’s connectivity options to increase access to the ocean and large markets such as India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uzbekistan-votes-in-presidential-polls-afghanistan-economy-key-issues-101635058319209.html
24-10-2021||World||Voting underway for presidential election in Uzbekistan||Voting was underway in Central Asian Uzbekistan's presidential election Sunday, with incumbent Shavkat Mirziyoyev facing no real opposition but plenty of challenges as he bids to reform the ex-Soviet country and still maintain its authoritarian foundations.Mirziyoyev has been credited for launching what he calls a "New Uzbekistan", ending a decades-old system of forced labour and introducing limited media freedom.He came to power in 2016 after the death of his mentor, dictator Islam Karimov, who ruled Uzbekistan for 27 years.The new leader presided over an unprecedented boom in foreign tourism in the country that borders Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and counts China and Russia among its partners.But as his first term ends, the 64-year-old is struggling to counter impressions that his government is sliding back towards the habits of his long-reigning predecessor.The effects of the pandemic have also blunted his initial economic achievements, with unemployment rife amid sharp rises in living costs."We expect changes. For instance, salary increases -- our salaries are small and we don't always get them," said 20-year-old student Urazali Ergashev. He added that his mother, a teacher, often faced salary delays.Voting across the landlocked country of 34 million people began at 8:00 am local time (0300 GMT) and will last until 8:00 pm (1500 GMT).Prolonged isolation under Karimov meant that commodity-rich Uzbekistan fell well short of its economic potential for most of independence.It is against the founding president's brutal rule that the successes of Mirziyoyev's reforms have been judged.His public disavowal of torture and campaign to clean up mass forced labour in cotton fields -- where thousands of schoolchildren once toiled alongside their teachers -- gained international praise.But the last two years have seen a crackdown on dissent, rights groups said, particularly in internet freedoms that bloomed after 2016.Mirziyoyev has also sidestepped reforms that would allow competition to his rule.He faces four regime-loyal opponents plucked from parties in the rubber stamp parliament in his bid to secure a second five-year term.A would-be independent challenger, academic Khidirnazar Allakulov, fell at the first hurdle after failing to register a party that could nominate him.Human Rights Watch said this month that officials "harassed (Allakulov's) party supporters and interfered in their efforts to collect signatures for registration".Still, most Uzbeks interviewed by AFP in Tashkent said they were unconcerned by the lack of real choice on the ballot."When things are going well, why do we need so many choices?" asked pensioner Yakub Otazhanov."Let Mirziyoyev (get on with it)."Under his rule, Uzbekistan has strengthened traditional relations with Beijing and Moscow, while welcoming back international organisations and media outlets effectively banned under Karimov.But for many in the capital Tashkent, poverty rather than rights is the issue of the day."There are a lot of poor and homeless people. We need to find housing for people," said a 26-year-old money-changer at the city's Chorsu market.The man, who gave his first name, Sardor, said he would vote for Mirziyoyev."I hope he will help solve these problems."His colleague, who did not want to be named, implied that the president's reforms were cosmetic."New buildings do not mean new Uzbekistan," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/voting-underway-for-presidential-election-in-uzbekistan-101635050978749.html
24-10-2021||World||China adopts new land border law amid military impasse with India||China on Saturday passed a new law to strengthen land border protection amid the ongoing military tension along the disputed boundary with India, firming up the military-civilian role in defending the country’s borders.The legislation formalises combining the military defence of China’s land borders with improving social and economic development in border areas.It further strengthens the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) policy to work closely with civilians staying in border areas - for example, Tibetan villagers living along the border with India, Bhutan and Nepal - to work as the first line of defence.Long-standing border disputes should be resolved through negotiations, the new law adds, according to Chinese official media.India and China have been locked in a border row for 17 months, a phase that witnessed the deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, 2020 when troops from both sides fought for hours with iron rods, clubs covered with barbed wire and rocks.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, the first fatalities on the Line of Actual Control since 1975; four Chinese soldiers were killed and one was injured as well.China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Saturday voted to adopt the “…new law on the protection and exploitation of the country’s land border areas, which will take effect on January 1, 2022”, the news agency Xinhua reported.The law will now govern how China guards its 22,000-km (13,670-mile) land border shared with 14 countries, including Russia, nuclear-capable North Korea and Mongolia besides India and Bhutan - two countries Beijing has land border disputes with.The state, the law says: “…shall take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines territorial sovereignty and land boundaries.”The law, which has 62 articles, stipulates that the state “…shall take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines territorial sovereignty and land boundaries”, it says.The law stipulates that the state shall take measures to “…strengthen border defence, support economic and social development as well as opening-up in border areas, improve public services and infrastructure in such areas, encourage and support people’s life and work there, and promote coordination between border defence and social, economic development in border areas”.The law “stipulates the relevant responsibilities” of the PLA, the armed militia, and local governments to support and coordinate border defence and management of areas at the border and the building of border infrastructure.Article 7 says: “Under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, relevant military organs shall organise, guide and coordinate the defence and control of land borders, maintain social stability, handle emergencies and cooperate in border defence and other related work.”The law laid out that the state has to nurture border towns and improve their overall “supporting capacity”.China has already built hundreds of border villages - by some counts more than 600 - across the country’s borders in Tibet.Article 43 of the law says: “The state supports the construction of border towns, improves the system of border towns, improves the functions of border towns and strengthens the construction of supporting capacity.”On the issue of resolving border disputes, the law says: “The state shall, following the principle of equality, mutual trust, and friendly consultation, handle land border related-affairs with neighbouring countries through negotiations to properly resolve disputes and longstanding border issues.”Gao Jinlu, from the foreign affairs committee of the NPC was quoted as saying by state media, that the land border law establishes a standardised legal framework for managing China’s land border affairs.President Xi Jinping signed orders to promulgate the law.Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over the closing meeting of the 31st session of the 13th NPC Standing Committee, which ran from Tuesday to Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adopts-new-land-border-law-amid-military-impasse-with-india-101635050098420.html

The restaurant will continue to display 12 other Picasso works.The highest price was fetched by the 1938 painting "Femme au beret rouge-orange" of Picasso's lover and muse Marie-Therese Walter, which sold for $40.5 million, some $10 million over the high pre-sale estimate.The large-scale portraits "Homme et Enfant" and "Buste d'homme" sold for $24.4 million and $9.5 million respectively, while smaller works on ceramic, like "Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe" which sold for $2.1 million, went for three or four times their pre-sale estimate.The buyers' names were not disclosed.Saturday's sale was part of a bid by casino and hotel group MGM Resorts to further diversify its vast collection to include more art from women, people of color and emerging nations as well as from LGBTQ artists and artists with disabilities.American museums and art galleries have been working to broaden their collections in the wake of the widespread cultural reckoning in 2020 over racism at all levels of U.S. society.A 2019 Public Library of Science study of 18 leading US museums found that 85% of the artists on display are white and 87 per cent are men.The MGM Resorts Fine Arts Collection boasts about 900 works by 200 artists, including modern pieces by Bob Dylan and David Hockney.

The FO statement read: “No such understanding was in place.”However, it added: "Pakistan and the US have long-standing cooperation on regional security and counter-terrorism and the two sides remain engaged in regular consultations."CNN News had reported quoting three sources familiar with the details of a classified briefing with members of the US Congress that took place on Friday that the US was nearing an agreement with Pakistan for use of its airspace to conduct operations in Afghanistan.The Pakistan Opposition parties had also demanded the government to give an explanation on the reports that Pakistan had allowed the US military to use its airspace.Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview had categorically said that Pakistan would "absolutely not" allow any bases and use of its territory for any sort of action inside Afghanistan."Absolutely not. There is no way we are going to allow any bases, any sort of action from Pakistani territory into Afghanistan.

24-10-2021||World||‘Otoniel’, Colombia's most-wanted drug lord, captured: Government||Colombia's most-wanted drug trafficker "Otoniel" has been captured, the government said Saturday, a major victory in the world's top cocaine exporter.Dairo Antonio Usuga, who headed the country's largest narco-trafficking gang known as the Gulf Clan, was captured near one of his main outposts in Necocli, near the border with Panama.Images released by the government showed the 50-year-old Otoniel in handcuffs and surrounded by soldiers."This is the hardest strike to drug trafficking in our country this century," president Ivan Duque said in a message, adding that the arrest was "only comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar," the famed Colombian narco-trafficking kingpin.The United States had offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Otoniel, who is one of the most feared men in Colombia.Otoniel was indicted in the United States in 2009, and faces extradition proceedings to the country, where he would appear in the Southern District of New York federal court.The Colombian government blames the group -- financed mainly through drug trafficking, illegal mining and extortion -- for being one of the main drivers of the worst bout of nationwide violence since the signing of a peace pact with FARC guerillas in 2016.The Gulf Clan is present in almost 300 municipalities in the country, according to the independent think tank Indepaz.Life of violence Although Otoniel announced in 2017 he intended to reach an agreement to participate with the Colombian justice system, the government instead responded by deploying at least 1,000 soldiers to hunt him down.His Clan has been decimated recently by authorities with Otoniel forced to hide in the jungle and unable to use telephones, according to police.He took over the leadership of the Gulf Clan -- previously known as the Usuga Clan -- from his brother Juan de Dios, who was killed by police in 2012.Born to a poor family, Otoniel joined the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), a Marxist guerrilla group that demobilized in 1991.After laying down his arms, he later returned to fighting, joining far-right paramilitary groups.Many of these were demobilized in 2006 at the initiative of former right-wing president Alvaro Uribe's administration, but Otoniel decided to remain in the fight.Colombia is the world's top provider of cocaine, with the United States as its principal market, despite half a century of trying to clamp down on the drug trade.In remote areas where there is little government presence, criminal groups like the Gulf Clan, dissident FARC guerrillas and leftist ELN rebels fight bloody turf battles to control drug trafficking corridors and illegal mining operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/otoniel-colombia-s-most-wanted-drug-lord-captured-government-101635039887702.html
24-10-2021||World||After California wildfires, more than 10,000 ‘hazard trees’ to be removed||In the wake of California wildfires, upwards of 10,000 trees weakened by fires, drought, disease or age must be removed, work that will keep a nearby highway closed to visitors who seek the world's two largest sequoia trees.The hazard trees could potentially fall onto people and cars on the section of State Route 180 known as Generals Highway, or they could create barriers for emergency and fire response, the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said on Friday.The highway is closed due to the KNP Complex blaze, which was 60 per cent contained after burning 138 square miles (357 square kilometers) of the forest, and will remain blocked off to visitors after the fire is out while saw crews cut down trees and trim branches. Cooler weather has helped slow the flames and the area was expected to see rain starting Sunday.The highway connects Giant Forest, home to the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world's largest by volume, and Grant Grove, home to the General Grant Tree, the second-largest tree in the world. The trees along the highway include sequoias, pine, and conifer trees, said fire spokeswoman Kimberly Caschalk.The KNP Complex has been burning since September 9, when lightning ignited two fires that later merged.Forest officials said earlier this month the fires may have killed hundreds of giant sequoias, but the full extent of the damage has not been determined.The fire's impact on giant sequoia groves was mixed. Most saw low- to medium-intensity fire behaviour that the sequoias have evolved to survive, and the most notable trees survived.Firefighters took extraordinary measures to protect the sequoias by wrapping fire-resistant material around the bases of some giants, raking and clearing vegetation around them, installing sprinklers, and dousing some with water or fire-retardant gel.On Friday, forest staff unwrapped the base of the General Sherman tree after danger from the fire had passed."We're confident that tree is relatively safe," Caschalk said.Drought in the West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years — meaning the rain and snow that does fall is likely to evaporate or absorb into the soil — and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.Recent storms have helped contain some of the nation's largest wildfires this year, including one that threatened the popular Lake Tahoe resort region this summer and is now 100 per cent contained after snow blanketed the western side of the blaze and rain dropped on the eastern side. But this week's storms won't end the drought that's plaguing California and the western United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-california-wildfires-around-10-000-hazard-trees-to-be-removed-101635038591749.html
24-10-2021||World||Obama warns of Republican threat to democracy in US battleground Virginia||Former US president Barack Obama urged voters Saturday to back the Democrat in a neck-and-neck state election touted as a test of the party's prospects in next year's midterm elections -- casting the Republican as a threat to democracy.Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who is vying for a second term as Virginia's governor, has seen his lead extinguished in recent polls and is in a dead heat with Republican Glenn Youngkin ahead of the November 2 vote.Obama told a cheering crowd of several hundred rapt supporters at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond that Youngkin would cut teaching jobs, restrict abortion access and back Donald Trump's fraudulent campaign to convince Americans that the last election was stolen from him by President Joe Biden."As far as I can tell, the big message of Terry's opponent is that he's a regular guy because he wears a fleece. And he's accusing schools of brainwashing our kids," Obama said,"He's also said he wanted to audit the voting machines used in the last presidential election again. Really? Encouraging the lies and conspiracy theories that we've had to live through all this time? And yeah, we're supposed to believe he's going to stand up for our democracy?"The McAuliffe camp fears turnout among supporters in an off-year election may be low and has brought in some of the party's heavy hitters in the final stretch, including First Lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.Biden won Virginia by 10 points in 2020 and the last time Republicans won a statewide race there was 2009.But the McAuliffe-Youngkin battle has been tightening, with a survey released this week by Monmouth University showing the Democrat's earlier lead evaporating.A McAuliffe win would boost Washington Democrats' push for twin infrastructure and social welfare mega-bills that are the cornerstone of Biden's vision for remaking the economy.But a loss could spook moderates already nervous over the high price tag, which they are trying to chisel down from a combined total of almost $5 trillion to around $3 trillion.Party chiefs hope Obama, still the most popular Democrat on the national stage five years after leaving office, will galvanize Black voters, a key constituency in Virginia."I'm here today because I believe Virginia will make the right choice. I believe America, ultimately, will make the right choice," Obama told the crowd of a few hundred cheering supporters."I believe you right here in Virginia are going to show the rest of the country, and the world, that we're not going to indulge in our worst instincts. We're not going to go back to the past that did so much damage, we're going to move forward with people like Terry leading the way."The first genuinely competitive election since Biden took office is expected to be a harbinger of the national political landscape ahead of next year's midterm elections.Wedged between the Washington suburbs in northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold, and the state's conservative south and southwest, Richmond could go either way.McAuliffe, 64, has tried to make the race a referendum on twice-impeached Trump.Youngkin, 10 years his junior, has focused on the fight over schools, with Republicans railing against mask mandates and running ads showing McAuliffe saying he doesn't want parents involved in education.In a delicate high-wire act, Youngkin has been trying to conjure the spirit of Trump while not specifically endorsing his false election fraud claims that are backed by the majority of Republicans.The former president has not visited, although he called into a pro-Youngkin "Take Back Virginia Rally" on October 13 featuring former White House advisor Steve Bannon and other prominent promoters of Trump's election fraud lies.McAuliffe, who took the stage before Obama, pledged to work with "Reasonable Republicans" to improve the lives of Virginians."I'll work with you, but let me make one thing perfectly clear today. Glenn Youngkin is not a reasonable Republican. I call him Donald Trump in khakis," he told the crowd of a few hundred."Do we want a lapdog for Donald Trump to be our governor here in the Commonwealth? No, we don't."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-warns-of-republican-threat-to-democracy-in-us-battleground-virginia-101635030700389.html
24-10-2021||World||Russia puts torture video whistleblower on wanted list||Russia on Saturday placed a former prison inmate who leaked harrowing videos of rape and torture inside a Russian prison on a wanted list.A notice on the interior ministry's website said Sergei Savelyev -- a Belarus national who is seeking asylum in France -- was wanted in connection with an unspecified criminal case.Savelyev smuggled footage of abuse out of a jail in the central city of Saratov. Fearing reprisals, he fled the country in February and last week arrived in France, where he asked for asylum.While serving 7.5 years for drug trafficking, he worked as an IT maintenance officer, earning access to the prison's internal server and those of other jails, where he found several videos.He saved them on a USB stick that he hid near the prison exit.Some of the videos were then published by the Russian rights groups Gulagu.net, prompting an official probe and the sacking of several officials.Savelyev said that while the interior ministry did not provide details of why he was wanted, he thought it was for "leaking state secrets"."They are going down the only path they know, the path of force," he said in a video from France published by Gulagu.net.Russian authorities are trying "to shut my mouth"."It's a shame that instead of using the time to reform the system and investigate all this terrible evidence we gave them, they are trying to hide the truth," he said.'Serious mistakes'Russia's vast prison system has long been an arena of torture and sexual violence inflicted on inmates, monitors say, but the videos have cast new light on such abuses.In an interview with AFP earlier this week, Savelyev said the abuse was often doled out to try to force inmates to confess or inform on other prisoners.The videos of the abuse were then used to blackmail the victim into compliance.After Gulagu.net published the videos of the abuse, the head of the jail, where prisoners needing medical attention for tuberculosis are held, was sacked, along with three regional prison officials.The top prison official for the Saratov region was also to be relieved of his post over "serious mistakes", authorities said.Savelyev told AFP he still had many other videos he had collected in jail, but refused to say what he planned to do with them.He said before he fled Russia he had been approached by Russian agents who offered him a shorter sentence in return for his cooperation."They weren't interested in knowing anything about human rights violations," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-puts-torture-video-whistleblower-on-wanted-list-101635030745330.html
24-10-2021||World||Chinese economy risks deeper slowdown than markets realise||China’s economy risks slowing faster than investors realize as President Xi Jinping’s push to cut its reliance on real estate and regulate sectors from education to technology combine with a power shortage and the pandemic.Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are among those sounding the warning that expansion will fall short this year of the 8.2% anticipated by the consensus of economists. The slump could last into next year, forcing growth below 5%, they warn. Outside 2020’s 2.3%, that would be the weakest in three decades.Strategists at Bank of America muse that Xi may even be embracing a once-in-two decades restructuring of the economy akin to Deng Xiaoping’s modernizations of the late-1970s and Zhu Rongji’s revamping of state-enterprises and finance in the 1990s.“If so, the data flow from China could confound even the pessimists, and we are on guard for that scenario unfolding,” the strategists, led by Ajay Kapur, told clients in a report last week, in which they predicted growth of 7.7% this year and 4% in 2022.Beijing is determined to shift its economic model from its boom years, in which the country loaded up on debt and propelled itself to become the second-largest economy. Xi is now overseeing a plan to stabilize debt growth -- in order to ease financial risks -- curb inequality and channel financial resources into hi-tech manufacturing to counter the threat of technology restrictions from the U.S.Data released last week already showed a sharp slowdown in growth to 4.9% in the third quarter from 7.9% in the previous quarter, with more pain likely to come as electricity shortages persist.Even before the pandemic hit, China was surprising economists with slower-than-expected growth caused by Beijing’s resolve to ease debt risks, which meant it avoided broad stimulus even as the U.S.-China trade war threatened expansion.After modest easing to cushion the worst effects of the coronavirus, its debt-control policy resumed, with real estate companies such as China Evergrande Group feeling the biggest impact.Xi also set about seeking to reshape the consumer technology, private tutoring and real estate sectors, with officials arguing they represent a wasteful use of the country’s limited resources. Officials have mostly embraced the resulting slowdown.China’s Premier Li Keqiang in March announced a growth target of “above 6%” for the year. While analysts saw this as a signal that Beijing was prioritizing other policy goals such as financial stability and environmental protection above economic growth, most at the time saw the target as extremely conservative.“I’ve joked that maybe Li Keqiang knew more than we did,” said Bert Hofman, a former director of the World Bank’s China office who now heads the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute.But Beijing has signaled in recent weeks that it could loosen some policies, telling banks to pick up the pace of mortgage lending even as it repeated vows not to use the property sector as a short-term stimulus.Any policy loosening in the next few months will be aimed at “preventing disaster” rather than supporting growth, Hofman said. “As long as growth is above 6%, I think China would feel relatively happy,” he added.People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang recently said he sees about 8% expansion for this year, and to achieve that, the economy would only need to expand 3.9% in the current quarter, according to calculations from Bloomberg Economics. China’s slowdown comes as the global recovery from Covid-19 risks losing momentum.“When China’s economic engine sputters, growth fizzles the world over,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong.Among those at risk from less investment in China are commodity exporters such as Australia, South Africa and Brazil. Slower trade could also hit the likes of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The impact could be felt further afield, according to Tuuli McCully, Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank. “Countries such as Chile and Peru ship significant amounts of commodities to China and will feel the impact of weaker real estate and other fixed asset investment activity in China,” she said.Financial market spillovers may be more contained given the 18% peak to trough correction in China’s CSI 300 Index this year did not spark global contagion, said Alvin Tan, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. One possible upside from a cooling Chinese economy is that it could alleviate global inflation pressures, Tan said.“Nonetheless, the net impact is decidedly negative for a world that is still recovering from the pandemic,” Tan said.For now, even the most pessimistic economists expect growth to come in above 7.5% this year, a relatively rapid rate for an economy the size of China’s. Beijing has set a goal of doubling gross domestic product from 2020 levels by 2035, which implies annual growth of around 5%. That may prove to be a floor for policy makers.China could see real estate investment fall 10% in the first half of next year and still achieve 5% annual growth as its credit cycle is close to its bottom and fiscal policy could pick up ahead of a crucial Communist Party congress in the autumn, said Bo Zhuang, China economist at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia.He predicts Beijing could set a growth target around 5.5% for next year.Still, the recent weakness when combined with concerns over Evergrande is prompting analysts to wonder if they remain too sanguine on near-term prospects.Bank of America’s strategists outlined a “bearish scenario” involving a disorderly adjustment to the real estate market in which property prices fall 10%, cutting sales and deterring banks from lending to the sector. In that scenario, growth could reach as low as 7.5% this year and 2.2% in 2022.The other risk is that China’s policy makers may struggle to flick the switch back to growth mode if they feel that’s needed. Citigroup economists led by Xiangrong Yu noted that the electricity shortages that are crimping industrial production will make it harder to cushion growth by boosting investment in infrastructure. That kind of policy could only work next year once the power crunch eases, they said.Local governments are also struggling to find viable projects to invest in while property developers’ tight financing has slowed their land purchases, threatening to undermine a $1 trillion revenue source for local governments.“Property and energy problems will continue to affect growth in the fourth quarter,” said Houze Song, a China economy researcher at U.S. think tank, the Paulson Institute. It “seems likely that full year growth will end below 8%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-economy-risks-deeper-slowdown-than-markets-realise-101635030893362.html
24-10-2021||World||Facebook assesses country risks for decisions on content removal||Facebook Inc. said it’s developed a strategy since 2018 to monitor and remove content that violates its policies, especially in countries most at risk of offline violence.The factors used for such evaluations include social tensions and civic participation, as well as how the use of its social media tools affect that country, it said, citing elections in Myanmar, Ethiopia, India and Mexico as recent examples. It also considers how the information may shed light on a current problem, such as crime, elections, violence and Covid-19 transmission and vaccination rates, it added. “This allows us to act quickly to remove content that violates our policies and take other protective measures,” according to a Facebook blog Saturday by Miranda Sissons, director of human rights policy, and Nicole Isaac, international strategic response director. “We know that we face a number of challenges with this work and it is a complex and often adversarial space — there is no one-size-fits-all solution.”   As rioters breached barricades and bludgeoned police with flagpoles before storming the US Capitol on Jan. 6, some Facebook employees took to an internal discussion board to express shock and outrage. Many of the posts were imbued with a dawning sense that they and their employer -- whose platforms for weeks had spread content questioning the legitimacy of the election -- bore part of the blame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-assesses-country-risks-for-decisions-on-content-removal-101635030935346.html
24-10-2021||World||Saudi Arabia targets net zero emissions||Top crude exporter Saudi Arabia will aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, its de facto ruler said on Saturday, days before the COP26 global climate summit.The kingdom, one of the world’s biggest polluters, said it would also join a global effort to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030.The United Nations says more than 130 countries have set or are considering a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, an objective it says is “imperative” to safeguard a liveable climate.“I announce today Saudi Arabia’s target to reach net zero emissions by 2060,” Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told the Saudi Green Initiative forum.COP26 President Alok Sharma welcomed the announcement. “I hope this landmark announcement... will galvanise ambition from others ahead of #COP26,” Sharma tweeted, adding he was looking forward to seeing more details on the Saudi plan.Shortly after, energy giant Saudi Aramco said it committed to being a net zero enterprise by 2050. “Saudi Aramco will achieve an ambition of being also a net zero from our operation by 2050,” Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said at the forum.Separately, Sharma said success at the upcoming COP26 climate summit is “definitely harder” than the 2015 Paris talks which resulted in a landmark accord.The October 31-November 12 gathering in Glasgow is the biggest climate conference since the Paris summit and is seen as crucial in setting worldwide emission targets to slow global warming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-targets-net-zero-emissions-101635019752579.html
24-10-2021||World||New whistleblower, more leaks add to FB’s troubles||A former Facebook worker reportedly told US authorities on Friday the platform has put profits before stopping problematic content, weeks after another whistleblower helped stoke the firm’s latest crisis with similar claims.The unnamed new whistleblower filed a complaint with US financial regulator Securities and Exchange Commission that could add to the company’s woes, said a Washington Post report. Facebook has faced a storm of criticism over the past month after former employee Frances Haugen leaked internal studies showing the company knew of potential harm stoked by its sites. In the SEC complaint, the new whistleblower recounts alleged statements from 2017, when the company was deciding how to handle the controversy related to Russia’s interference in the 2016 US presidential election.“It will be a flash in the pan. Some legislators will get pissy. And then in a few weeks they will move onto something else. Meanwhile we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine,” Tucker Bounds, a member of Facebook’s communications team, was quoted in the complaint as saying, The Washington Post reported.The second whistleblower signed the complaint on October 13, a week after Haugen’s scathing testimony before a Senate panel, according to the report.According to local media on Friday, Facebook held back from doing all it could to stop users from being radicalised and US election misinformation from flooding the social network. Examples included an internal finding that 10% of political content viewed by US users in the days after the election perpetuated the falsehood that the vote had been rigged.What has come to be known as the “Big Lie” has been repeated relentlessly by former president Donald Trump and enraged his supporters, who stormed the US Capital in a deadly attack on January 6. Revelations published on Friday indicated that Facebook could have anticipated such trouble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-whistleblower-more-leaks-add-to-fb-s-troubles-101635019565713.html
24-10-2021||World||‘Act now’, say UK scientists as Covid infections surge||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday a new Covid-19 lockdown is not on the cards, as advisers warned that acting early with lighter measures to cut rising case numbers would reduce the need for tougher restrictions later.Johnson’s government has said there is no need yet to introduce a “Plan B”. Asked on Friday about the possibility of another lockdown over winter, the prime minister said: “I’ve got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that, that is on the cards at all.”While Johnson has scrapped the legal requirement to wear masks, he said they should still be worn in confined spaces. Covid-19 infections in Britain are up 17.9% over the last seven days, with 52,009 reported on Thursday, and the reproduction “R” number is estimated between 1.0 and 1.2. Any figure above one suggests an exponential growth in cases.“In the event of increasing case rates, earlier intervention would reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive, and longer-lasting measures,” the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said in minutes from a October 14 meeting, published on Friday.“SAGE advises that policy work on the potential reintroduction of measures should be undertaken now so that it can be ready for rapid deployment if required.”SAGE added that among Plan B measures, reintroduction of work-from-home guidance would have the biggest impact to cut transmission, and warned that “presenteeism” might become an increasing reason for contagion in the workplace.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday found that Covid-19 prevalence had risen again. The ONS said Covid prevalence was at its highest level since January, when England had just entered a third national lockdown, although deaths are much lower.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was investigating a Delta subvariant of the coronavirus called AY.4.2 as it was possibly more transmissible than Delta, though there was no evidence that it caused more severe disease or rendered vaccines ineffective.Meanwhile, Russia reported a record number of new cases and deaths on Saturday. The national coronavirus headquarters said there were 37,678 new cases and 1,075 deaths in the last day, the most in both categories since the pandemic began.Austria could lock down only for unvaccinatedAustria has laid out a framework for potential new lockdown measures to apply only to unvaccinated people, as inoculations lag and cases rise sharply.“I will do everything I can to ensure that the health system in this country does not reach its limit and is not overloaded because we have too many procrastinators,” Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said in a statement Saturday.If the number of Covid patients in intensive care units hits 500, or 25% of the country’s capacity, unvaccinated people would be barred from hotels and restaurants. If ICU capacity reaches one-third, or 600 units, a lockdown would go into effect for the unvaccinated, who would only be allowed to leave their homes for certain reasons.Singapore removes India from restriction listSingapore on Saturday announced the removal of India and five other South Asian countries from its travel restriction list as the island-state continues to adjust border measures in response to the global Covid-19 situation.All travellers with a 14-day travel history to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from Wednesday, the health ministry said.However, travellers from these countries will be subjected to the tightest of border measures, which involve a 10-day, stay-home notice period at a dedicated facility, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/act-now-say-uk-scientists-as-covid-infections-surge-101635019370225.html
24-10-2021||World||Alec Baldwin was told gun was 'cold' before movie set shooting||As a film crew and actors in Western garb prepared to rehearse a scene inside a wooden, chapel-like building on a desert movie ranch outside Santa Fe, assistant director Dave Halls stepped outside and grabbed a prop gun off a cart.He walked back in and handed it to the film's star, Alec Baldwin, assuring him it was safe to use because it didn't have live ammo.“Cold gun,” Halls yelled.It wasn't, according to court records made public on Friday. Instead, when Baldwin pulled the trigger Thursday, he killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her.Authorities were alerted to the shooting by a 911 call that hints at panic on the movie set, as detailed in a recording obtained by the Albuquerque Journal.“We had two people accidentally shot on a move set by a prop gun, we need help immediately,” a script supervisor told an emergency dispatcher. “We were rehearsing and it went off and I ran out, we all ran out.”The dispatcher asks if the gun was loaded with a real bullet.“I cannot tell you. We have two injuries,” the script director saidThe tragedy came nearly three decades after Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, died in a similar case, and it prompted horrified questions about how it could have happened again. The executive producer of ABC’s police drama “The Rookie” announced Friday the show would no longer use “live" weapons because the “safety of our cast and crew is too important.”Details of the shooting at the ranch on Bonanza Creek Road were included in a search warrant application filed by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators were seeking to examine Baldwin’s blood-stained costume for the film “Rust,” as well as the weapon that was fired, other prop guns and ammunition, and any footage that might exist.The gun was one of three that the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being acted, according to the records. Halls grabbed the gun from the cart and brought it inside to Baldwin, unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in the search warrant application.It was unclear how many rounds were fired. Gutierrez removed a shell casing from the gun after the shooting, and she turned the weapon over to police when they arrived, the court records say.Halls did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. The Associated Press was unable to contact Gutierrez, and several messages sent to production companies affiliated with the film were not immediately returned on Friday.The film’s script supervisor, Mamie Mitchell, said she was standing next to Hutchins when she was shot.“I ran out and called 911 and said ‘Bring everybody, send everybody,’ ” Mitchell told The Associated Press. “This woman is gone at the beginning of her career. She was an extraordinary, rare, very rare woman.”Mitchell said she and other crew members were attending a private memorial service on Friday night in Santa Fe.Baldwin described the killing as a “tragic accident.”“There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours. I’m fully cooperating with the police investigation,” Baldwin wrote on Twitter. “My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.”No immediate charges were filed, and sheriff’s spokesman Juan Rios said Baldwin was permitted to travel.“He’s a free man,” Rios said.Images of the 63-year-old actor — known for his roles in “30 Rock” and “The Hunt for Red October” and his impression of former President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live” — showed him distraught outside the sheriff’s office on Thursday.Guns used in making movies are sometimes real weapons that can fire either bullets or blanks, which are gunpowder charges that produce a flash and a bang but no deadly projectile. Even blanks can eject hot gases and paper or plastic wadding from the barrel that can be lethal at close range. That proved to be the case in the death of an actor in 1984.In another on-set accident in 1993, Lee was killed after a bullet was left in a prop gun, and similar shootings have occurred involving stage weapons that were loaded with live rounds during historical re-enactments.Gun-safety protocol on sets in the United States has improved since then, said Steven Hall, a veteran director of photography in Britain. But he said one of the riskiest positions to be in is behind the camera because that person is in the line of fire in scenes where an actor appears to point a gun at the audience.Sheriff’s deputies responded about 2 p.m. to the movie set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch after 911 calls described a person being shot there, Rios said. The ranch has been used in dozens of films, including the recent Tom Hanks Western “News of the World.”Gutierrez, the film’s armorer, gave an interview in September to Arizona-based podcast “Voices of the West" in which she said she had just finished her first movie while working as the head armorer, a project in Montana starring Nicholas Cage titled “The Old Way.”“I was really nervous about it at first and I almost didn’t take the job because I wasn’t sure if I was ready but doing it, like, it went really smoothly," she said.Gutierrez is the daughter of Thell Reed, a quick-draw exhibition shooter and gun coach for stars who worked on films such as “Tombstone" and “The Quick" and “the Dead," according to his IMDB profile. Gutierrez said she grew up around guns and her father had been teaching her a little bit about firearms since she was a teenager.Hutchins, 42, worked as director of photography on the 2020 action film “Archenemy” starring Joe Manganiello. She was a 2015 graduate of the American Film Institute and was named a “rising star” by American Cinematographer in 2019.“I’m so sad about losing Halyna. And so infuriated that this could happen on a set,” said “Archenemy” director Adam Egypt Mortimer on Twitter. “She was a brilliant talent who was absolutely committed to art and to film.”Manganiello called Hutchins “an incredible talent” and “a great person” on his Instagram account. He said he was lucky to have worked with her.After the shooting, production was halted on “Rust.” The movie is about a 13-year-old boy who is left to fend for himself and his younger brother following the death of their parents in 1880s Kansas, according to the Internet Movie Database website. The teen goes on the run with his long-estranged grandfather (played by Baldwin) after the boy is sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alec-baldwin-was-told-gun-was-cold-before-movie-set-shooting-101635016057366.html
