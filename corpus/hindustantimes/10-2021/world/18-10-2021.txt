It also gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked by making it more difficult to directly sue the state.Critics of the law have said this provision lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters, a characterisation its proponents reject.The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-administration-asks-us-supreme-court-to-block-texas-abortion-law-101634580974308.html
18-10-2021||World||Colin Powell: Former US secretary of state dies from Covid-19 complications||Colin Powell, the first African-American secretary of state and national security adviser to the US president, died on Monday of complications related to Covid-19. He was 84.Over four decades of life in US government, Powell would be remembered most distinctly for his speech, as secretary of state, at the UN Security Council that paved the way for the US invasion of Iraq in March 2003, wrongly alleging that Saddam Hussein, then Iraqi leader, had built a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). No WMD was ever found in Iraq. “A failure will always be attached to me and my UN presentation,” Powell wrote in It Worked For Me, his 2012 book. “I am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me.”“General Colin L. Powell, former US secretary of state and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, passed away this morning due to complications from Covid-19,” the Powell family said a statement on his official Facebook page. “He was fully vaccinated [against Covid-19]. We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment. We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American.”CNN reported that Powell had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, which left him immunocompromised.Colin Powell visited India four times as secretary state, the first of which took place in October 2001, just days after the US invaded Afghanistan in search of Osama bin Laden and others responsible for the September 11 terror attacks.Powell’s last visit came months after India turned down a request from the Bush administration to send peacekeeping troops to Iraq. The US had expected the deployment of a full Indian army division of 17,000 troops, according to reports at the time.A cabinet committee of the Vajpayee government decided in July 2003 to turn down the request after months of intense discussions.Colin Powell’s visit in March 2004 was dominated by outsourcing and trade. “My previous visits here in India were during times of great tension, crisis when people worried about the possibility of conflict,” he had said a town hall hosted by NDTV. “But now I am here at the time when people are talking about peace. We are talking about economic and trade issues for most of the day, not tension and conflict and the likelihood of war. “And I think this is a tribute to the leaders, a tribute to your Prime Minster and the members of this government, a tribute to President [Pervez] Musharraf, but really a tribute to the desire on the part of the Indian people to find a way forward, to find a way towards lasting peace in this part of the world. And for you young people, it’s especially important that you be advocates for peace as well, because it is your country that you’re going to be inheriting and leading.”A four-star general, Colin Powell made history in 1987 when then president Ronald Reagan named him his national security adviser, the first African-American to hold that position.He was followed years later by Condoleezza Rice. In 2001, then president George W Bush named him his secretary of state, once again the first African-American named as the top US diplomat.Born to parents from Jamaica, Powell fought in the Vietnam war and went to become the youngest and first African-American chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, a post he held during the 1990 Gulf War, when his strategy of using overwhelming force - after exhausting diplomatic, politician and economic means - came to be called the “Powell Doctrine”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colin-powell-former-us-secretary-of-state-dies-from-covid-19-complications-101634581052805.html

All countries on the grey list have “strategic deficiencies” in their measures to combat money laundering and terror financing.Virtually connected delegates will join those who travel to Paris for three days of meetings to discuss “key issues to strengthen global action against the financial flows that fuel crime and terrorism”, the watchdog said.Delegates will discuss the “outcomes of the FATF’s survey to identify areas where divergent anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules or their implementation cause friction for cross-border payments”. FATF is leading work on this aspect of the G20’s priority to improve cross-border payments.The meeting will also discuss the next steps to strengthen FATF’s standards on transparency of beneficial ownership, and finalise key reports, including revised guidance on virtual assets and their service providers.Under the German presidency of Marcus Pleyer, delegates representing 205 members of the global network and observer organisations, including the International Monetary Fund, United Nations and Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, will participate in the plenary meeting.After its last plenary, FATF had said that Pakistan had completed all but one of the 27 items in an old action plan that was drawn up to tackle money laundering and terror financing. The action plan was finalised after Pakistan was placed on the grey list in June 2018.The remaining item in the action plan was demonstrating that investigations and prosecutions of terrorist financing target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups.The new action plan to tackle money laundering was drawn up after FATF’s regional partner, the Asia Pacific Group, identified a “number of serious issues” during an assessment of Pakistan in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-to-review-pakistan-s-measures-to-fight-terror-financing-at-plenary-meeting-101634579673923.html

The militant group has also continued to search for “high-profile” women in the province, the watchdog claimed.The women interviewed by Human Rights Watch and San Jose State University (SJSU) Human Rights Institute have painted a bleak picture of their life under Taliban rule in Herat.“For the women in Herat we interviewed, life as they knew it had vanished overnight, and they were left hiding indoors, waiting in fear to see whether the Taliban would come for them,” an Afghan scholar associated with the project said.Adding that “for these women, the best-case scenario is to be unharmed but forced to live a drastically diminished existence. The worst-case scenario is to be arrested or attacked for their past achievements or for their fight to keep their hard-earned rights.”The on-ground situation Herat is appalling for women since they were the first ones to protest the Taliban’s takeover, in which two protesters were shot dead for defying the Taliban. However, two months after the takeover, women activists have stopped organising anti-Taliban protests and have restored to asking the rulers to respect their basic rights.Herat, which was once the stronghold of warlord Ismail Khan, fell to the Taliban after Khan was captured by the militant group. Khan, popularly known as the ‘Lion of Herat’ had returned to the frontlines in July after almost two decades to thwart the Taliban’s attempts of capturing the province but he was ultimately defeated.The Taliban abide by the strict Sharia law which has restricted women’s access to basic human rights all over the country.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-committing-widespread-violations-against-afghan-women-girls-in-herat-claims-human-rights-watch-101634568550452.html

And as far as conversion to Islam is concerned, this hypothesis is weakened," Omholt added.On Saturday, police announced the identities of the five victims, four women and one man: Andrea Meyer, 52, Hanne Merethe Englund, 56, Liv Berit Borge, 75, Gunnar Erling Sauve, 75 and Gun Marith Madsen, 78.Brathen had been living in Kongsberg, home to about 25,000 people some 80 kilometres (50 miles) west of the capital Oslo, for years and authorities have said he has a medical history, although details have not been made public.The Norwegian security services PST, which are responsible for counter-terrorism, also said the man had been on their radar.In the days following the attack police mentioned "fears of radicalisation," dating back to 2020 and before, which they said had been followed up at the time.According to public broadcaster NRK, a first warning had been received in 2015 and, according to Norwegian media, PST had warned in 2018 that the suspect could commit "a small-scale attack".News website Nettavisen also published a video that Brathen allegedly posted to social media in 2017, in which he issued a "warning" while declaring his Muslim faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-attacker-killed-victims-with-sharp-object-not-arrows-says-police-101634565977884.html

According to local reports, the violence came after an image was posted on social media that was perceived as insulting to the country’s Muslim majority.Also watch | Bangladesh: Hindu homes attacked over 'Facebook post' after violence at pandalsThe Bangladesh Chhatra League led the protest march, blaming the Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir for the attack, as they blocked a major intersection in Dhaka along with the university teachers and students to demand justice. Several other Hindu groups also joined the peaceful protest at the Shahbagh intersection.News website bdnews24.com reported citing the district’s superintendent of police Mohammad Qamruzzaman as saying that the police rushed to the fishing village as tension mounted over a rumour that a young Hindu man of the village had ‘dishonoured religion’ in a Facebook post. The attackers set fire to other homes nearby as the police stood guard around the man’s home, the report said.“Whoever is involved in the incident, will be brought to justice.

Powell, also the first Black secretary of state, was fully vaccinated, according to the family statement.“We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment. We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, grandfather and a great American,” the Powell family said.The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was an American war hero who became the US secretary of state under the Bush administration. While announcing Powell's appointment in 2000, then US President George W. Bush hailed him for his “towering integrity” and his “sense of duty and honour” as a soldier."In directness of speech, his towering integrity, his deep respect for our democracy, and his soldier's sense of duty and honour, Colin Powell demonstrates... qualities that will make him a great representative of all the people of this country."In his remarkable decades-long career, Powell found it hard to live down his infamous speech to the United Nations Security Council, which paved the way for the Iraq invasion and ouster of Saddam Hussein. He had alleged the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which turned out to be a false claim. The misleading intelligence input, resulting in the Iraq invasion, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives."It's a blot... and will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now," Powell said in a 2005 interview with ABC News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colin-powell-first-black-us-state-secretary-dies-of-covid-complications-101634558981468.html

She urged other countries "to step up, too".Her declaration comes in the context of a sharp divide between wealthier regions and poorer ones in terms of Covid vaccination rates.The European Union, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Singapore and Japan are all among those to have more than half of their populations fully vaccinated.Meanwhile many countries in Africa and other places such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Myanmar and Syria have less than 10 percent of their people inoculated.The European Union, which has 65.6 percent of its population fully inoculated according to an AFP tally of official statistics, has been stepping up exports of vaccines.So too is the United States, which has 57 percent fully jabbed. President Joe Biden said last week his government was raising its donations to Africa to a total 67 million doses.G20 countries have pledged to fairer distribution of Covid-19 vaccines after WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala pointed out early this month that, of more than six billion vaccine doses administered worldwide, only 1.4 percent of people in poor countries have been fully vaccinated.The European Union has in place a vaccine export control mechanism under which doses to be sent abroad have to be first approved by Brussels and the member state in which they are produced.Only one shipment -- a 250,000-dose consignment of AstraZeneca meant for Australia -- has been blocked under the scheme, back in April."We have always shared our vaccines fairly with the rest of the world," von der Leyen said."We have exported as much as we delivered to EU citizens. Indeed, at least every second vaccine produced in Europe is exported."She added: "Together with President Biden, we aim for a global vaccination rate of 70 per cent by next year."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-exported-over-1-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-past-10-months-101634552057375.html
18-10-2021||World||‘India’s role key in ensuring stable and secure environment in Afghanistan’||India has a key role as an important regional actor in ensuring a stable and secure environment in Afghanistan though responding to the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country will require interacting with the Taliban, Italian ambassador Vincenzo de Luca has said. De Luca said that such interactions with the Taliban would not be tantamount to recognition of the setup in Kabul, and the Taliban have to act on the call by the G20 states to rescind their links with terror groups and tackle the presence of terrorists on Afghan soil. In an interview, he also elaborated on the outcomes of the extraordinary G20 leaders meeting convened under the Italian presidency on October 12. How does Italy as the president of the G20 plan to get in humanitarian assistance directly to the Afghan people before the onset of winter? What are the possible hurdles in the delivery of aid and its distribution in a non-discriminatory manner? What immediate steps are needed for aid to start flowing? The sense of urgency with respect to a possible humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan was the reason why Italy decided to take action and convene a G20 extraordinary leaders’ meeting on Afghanistan. In his closing remarks, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi underlined how the meeting confirmed a strong will to act immediately by the G20 countries, since the international community is dealing with a colossal humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. In this scenario, the only way to ensure effective distribution of aid is through the role and the activity of the United Nations, which seem to have received a broad mandate to coordinate all the relief efforts directed at the Afghan people and to respond to the humanitarian emergency. The G20 leaders’ meeting expressed support for the United Nations to carry out this mandate, operating in accordance with internationally agreed humanitarian principles, to make sure that aid is delivered in an efficient and non-discriminatory way. What role does Italy see for India in efforts to deliver this humanitarian assistance? Is there anything India should be doing to help the Afghan people ?Being an important regional actor, India’s involvement in consultation and coordination activities is key to ensure a stable and secure environment and effective initiatives aimed at humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. Italy and India share the view that Afghanistan needs immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. To this end, the continued presence of the United Nations in Afghanistan must be preserved. Italy will also contribute through a consistent national financial pledge, on the one hand, and by supporting the European Union in the implementation of its relief initiatives, on the other hand. As far as the latter is concerned, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced a 1 billion Euro support package for Afghanistan in the meeting. The Indian PM has called for a unified response by the world community to ensure the desired change in the situation in Afghanistan but the absence of the top leaders of China and Russia at the G20 extraordinary summit suggests there are divisions on the approach towards Afghanistan. Your comments. All G20 members were involved in the preparatory process of the leaders’ meeting. Chinese and Russian ministers attended the event on October 12 and both countries actively contributed to the virtual G20 foreign affairs ministers meeting on Afghanistan last September 22. In the G20 leaders’ meeting, a consensus on some lines of action emerged: Firstly, the G20 will play an advocacy role within the international community to fully support UN activities and respond to UN appeals on humanitarian assistance. Secondly, the G20 called on the Afghan authorities to ensure the safety, security, and freedom of movement of all UN and associated personnel throughout the country. Thirdly, the G20 countries strongly called on the Taliban to rescind their links with terrorist groups and tackle their presence on Afghan soil. G20 leaders have made it clear they will not recognise the Taliban and there is opposition to unfreezing the foreign assets of Afghanistan. Could this lead to the collapse of the economic and financial system in Afghanistan?Any action in tackling the current situation in Afghanistan would require interacting with the Taliban. If we want to respond to the humanitarian crisis effectively and to prevent the economic collapse of the country, there is no alternative to having contact with the Taliban. This, however, will not entail their recognition. At present, Afghanistan is also experiencing a crisis of the payment system and risks the collapse of its banking system. This issue must also be urgently addressed because if money doesn’t flow and payments cannot be done, the entire economy of the country might crumble, making any sort of assistance nearly impossible. In this framework, the World Bank and the IMF will play a key role. The G20 countries have called on the Taliban to rescind links with terrorist groups and tackle their presence on Afghan soil. What immediate steps by the Taliban would be seen as a suitable response to this call? How does Italy, as the president of the G20, view India’s position regarding Pakistan backing cross-border terror from Afghan soil? As stated in Resolution 2593 adopted by the UN Security Council on August 30, there is a strong expectation that the Afghan territory is not used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts. There is a common understanding of the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan and of the fact that security, including counterterrorism, and development are intertwined. At the G20 leaders’ meeting, it was clearly reiterated that Afghanistan must not become a safe haven for terrorists and a threat to international security. Are any steps being planned by the G20 to keep Kabul airport operational and for opening up other Afghan airports to facilitate the departure of foreign nationals and Afghan citizens who wish to leave? At the same time, are there concerns about an influx of Afghan refugees into Europe? A preliminary condition for carrying out the humanitarian activities is that the Kabul airport remains open and in operation and our PM thanked Turkey and Qatar for their action toward this end. The same principles are reiterated in the Chair’s Summary of the meeting, whereby it is stated that the G20 fully supports current and future technical efforts to keep the Kabul international airport wholly operational and the future reopening of other Afghan airports to commercial flights. Moreover, close cooperation with UN agencies and local authorities in the region should be pursued and substantial relief should be provided to migrants and refugees in these countries. The resilience of hosting communities should also be supported. To relieve pressure on countries in the region, options of safe and legal pathways from these countries for Afghan refugees could be explored, in cooperation with the UNHCR. What specific steps will be taken to ensure the human rights of the Afghans, especially women and minorities, and to preserve the gains of the past 20 years? Participants in the G20 leaders’ meeting addressed a strong request to the Afghan authorities to respect human rights, with particular regard to women’s and minorities’ rights. The Taliban were also urged to fully respect their own commitment to allow the safe passage of those who wish to leave the country. The issue of the human security of the Afghan people is at the core of the G20 concerns. The provision of public services, such as education and healthcare, and the fight against Covid-19 in Afghanistan will be addressed through all means available and within the United Nations framework of assistance. The G20 members finally agreed that substantial relief should also be provided to Afghan migrants and refugees in neighbouring countries, especially for women and children. In conclusion, in the Italian Prime Minister’s words, the virtual G20 leaders’ meeting on Afghanistan proved to be the first useful multilateral exercise for a common response to the Afghan crisis, with a particular focus on the humanitarian emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-ambassador-underscores-india-s-role-in-afghan-situation-g20-s-take-on-taliban-101634552250040.html

The paper said the feat had "caught U.S. intelligence by surprise"."It was not a missile, it was a space vehicle," ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing in Beijing when asked about the report, adding it had been a "routine test" for the purpose of testing technology to reuse the vehicle.The significance of a reusability test is that it can "provide a cheap and convenient method for humans to peacefully travel to and from space", Zhao said, adding that many companies had carried out similar tests.The foreign ministry said the test had taken place in July, not in August as reported by the Financial Times.The United States is closely watching China's military modernisation programme to assess the possible risks posed to it by its increasingly assertive strategic competitor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-a-space-vehicle-china-denies-report-of-hypersonic-missile-test-101634551126616.html

However, Hlaing refused to share any details regarding who will be released. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 7,300 people continue to remain behind bars in Myanmar.Hlaing's remarks come two days after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) said on Saturday that he will be excluded from the association's upcoming summit on October 26.Instead, foreign ministers of the bloc decided to invite a non-political representative from Myanmar to its summit, in what was seen as a snub to the military leaders behind the coup against Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in February.Also Read| Asean decides to exclude Myanmar military chief from key summit on October 26: ReportsThe bloc, which has been widely criticised as a toothless organisation, took a stand after the junta rebuffed requests that a special envoy meet with "all stakeholders" in Myanmar- a phrase seen to include Suu Kyi.In a televised address on Monday, the Junta chief made no mention of the ASEAN’s decision but urged it to consider the provocations and violence being carried out by its opponents."More violence happened due to provocations of terrorist groups. No one cares about their violence and is only demanding we solve the issue. ASEAN should work on that," Hlaing said.Min Aung Hlaing led the February coup in Myanmar, which resulted in widespread protests across the Asian country and the military resorted to violence to disperse the demonstrators.Hlaing's administration justified the takeover as it cited alleged rigging in the 2020 elections, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won. Suu Kyi currently stares at a raft of charges in a junta court that could see her jailed for decades.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-to-release-over-5-600-prisoners-jailed-for-anti-coup-stir-101634540546967.html
18-10-2021||World||China’s economy slows due to power shortage, supply disruptions, Covid-19||China’s economy grew at just 4.9% in the third quarter of 2021 - the slowest growth this year - as it scrambles against a crippling power shortage, disruptions in the global supply chain, and sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks, data from the national bureau of statistics (NBS) showed on Monday.Rising commodity prices and restrictions on the real estate market are adding to woes for the second largest economy in the world.The slowdown is adding pressure on the policy makers of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to help recover economic growth. China’s economy had seen a remarkable recovery in the first quarter of the year after successfully controlling the Covid-19 pandemic.The slump that China’s economy is going through is telling. In the third quarter (Q3), the country’s GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year, slower than the growth of 18.3% in Q1 and 7.9% in Q2, NBS statistics showed.The country’s GDP expanded 9.8% year-on-year in the first three quarters, putting the average growth for the period in the past two years at 5.2%, according to the NBS data.Experts told Chinese official media that China’s GDP growth in the fourth quarter will face extra pressure, which may further drag down GDP growth for the whole of 2021.“The domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,” NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui said in Beijing on Monday. “Since entering the third quarter, domestic and overseas risks and challenges have increased.”In September, China was hit by its worst power crisis in recent years.“Surging electricity demand in a rebounding economy, plunging coal supplies and Beijing’s climate change policies create a perfect storm disrupting global supply chains,” the business website Caixin reported.Spokesperson Fu remained optimistic about tackling the power shortage. The power crisis had a “certain impact” on normal production, Fu said, but he added that the impact on China’s economy “is controllable”.Rising energy prices globally as well as tight domestic supplies of coal and electricity partly led to power outages in some regions that affected normal production orders, Fu was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.China has rolled out a series of measures to ensure power supply and keep electricity prices stable, he said, adding that as these measures gradually take effect, the power crunch would be eased and its impact on economic operation will be alleviated.“Global worries about a possible spillover of credit risk from China’s property sector into the wider economy have also intensified as major developer China Evergrande Group wrestles with more than $300 billion of debt,” Reuters reported on Monday.On Sunday, it was widely reported that as winter approaches, Chinese authorities fear what is being called a “twindemic” - a likely combined increase in Covid-19 outbreaks and influenza cases across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-economy-slows-due-to-power-shortage-supply-disruptions-covid19-101634542170392.html

The post was meant to criticise his former employer over non-payment of retirement funds.But the missing punctuation mark caused a defamation case to be filed against him, reported The Guardian.The incident happened in October last year, reported The Guardian, when New South Wales (NSW) Central Coast realtor Anthony Zadravic posted on Facebook, "Oh Stuart Gan!! Selling multi-million $ homes in Pearl Beach but can’t pay his employees superannuation. Shame on you Stuart!!! 2 yrs and still waiting!!!"Since the word ‘employees’ didn't have an apostrophe, it indicated that he was referring to several employees of Gan rather than himself. The post was meant to highlight non-payment of his dues.Though Zadravic deleted the post within 12 hours, Gan was made aware of it and he filed a defamation case against his former employee, the report further said.Zadravic pleaded the court to dismiss the petition, saying the failure to punctuate social media post was trivial. But the court last week allowed the case to proceed pointing to the seriousness of the claim in it, said The Guardian report.Judge Judith Gibson said the missing apostrophe suggests "a systematic pattern of conduct", saying that the failure to pay looks deliberate.The judge also noted to such instances where Facebook posts cost their authors dearly, the report added.Zadravic is now facing the prospect of paying more than $1,80,000 in damages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-an-apostrophe-in-facebook-post-lands-real-estate-agent-in-legal-trouble-101634540309114.html
18-10-2021||World||Merck Covid-19 pill sparks calls for access for lower income countries||The plan to roll out Merck & Co's promising antiviral pill to treat COVID-19 risks repeating the inequities of vaccine distribution, potentially leaving the nations with the greatest need once again at the back of the line, international health groups say.For example, only about 5% of Africa’s population is immunized, creating an urgent need for therapeutics that could keep people out of hospitals. That compares with more than a 70% inoculation rate in most wealthy nations.Merck on Oct 11 applied for U.S. emergency clearance of the first pill for COVID-19 after it cut hospitalizations and deaths by 50% in a large clinical trial. The medicine, made with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, could gain authorization as soon as December.The U.S. drugmaker has taken the unusual pandemic step of licensing several generics of its antiviral molnupiravir before its branded version was even authorized for marketing.But international health officials said even that is not enough for the medicine to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers, while noting shortcomings and red tape among global organizations that could further slow distribution.Merck this year plans to produce 10 million treatment courses of the pill, which is taken twice a day for five days, and another 20 million next year.In addition, its licensing deals with eight Indian drugmakers will allow cheaper generic versions for 109 low- and middle-income countries including in Africa, a move international groups acknowledge is a positive concession.But as wealthy nations secure molnupiravir supply deals - the United States has already locked up 1.7 million courses with an option for 3.5 million more by January of 2023 at about $700 per course - concerns grow over who might be left out.NOT MOVING QUICKLY ENOUGHMerck said it has worked on the technology transfer needed to start generic manufacturing, in contrast to vaccine makers who continue to resist calls to waive patents or allow for generic versions to boost supplies.But a recent report prepared for the United Nations' Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator program tasked with buying COVID-19 therapeutics for poor countries cited concerns that U.N. agencies were not moving quickly enough to secure adequate volumes of potential new treatments ahead of time, including Merck's drug.Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, has 24 companies signed up and willing to make the drug if Merck agrees to expand the licenses.“If you're not in the license, you're relying on Merck, and it looks to us that that could mean a potential supply shortfall as well as overpricing," said Peter Maybarduk of Public Citizen, who sits on the MPP governance board. He suggested that could lead to wealthy countries outbidding poor nations for the medicine.It is unclear how many generic pills will be available or when. The licensed Indian manufacturers including Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla Ltd, Dr. Reddy’s Labs , Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Sun Pharmaceuticals, and Torrent Pharmaceuticals declined to provide details on production plans.In addition, manufacturing for low-income countries in many nations also requires World Health Organization (WHO) approval, a regulatory process that typically takes months.Merck said it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country’s ability to pay. A spokesperson confirmed it is in discussions about expanding licenses for generic molnupiravir "to build sufficient global supply of quality-assured product to meet orders globally."But middle-income countries will be hard pressed to negotiate against the richest nations, another MPP official said.The governments of Australia, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia said they already had deals or were negotiating supply contracts with Merck. The EU is considering buying the pill after Merck applies for authorization in Europe.The eight generic manufacturers chosen by Merck all have WHO pre-qualified facilities to allow them to supply buyers like the Global Fund, according to Paul Schaper, Merck's executive director of global public policy. They will set their pricing and decide how much they plan to manufacture.“What we are anticipating and hoping for is that they will compete with each other on pricing,” Schaper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merck-covid-19-pill-sparks-calls-for-access-for-lower-income-countries-101634527066288.html
18-10-2021||World||China growth slides to 4.9% in third quarter||China's economic growth tumbled more than expected in the third quarter, official data showed Monday, as the property sector struggled with tighter policy measures and an energy crisis loomed.After a swift coronavirus bounceback, recovery in the world's second-biggest economy is losing steam, with gross domestic product growth coming in at 4.9 percent on-year, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), citing an "unstable and uneven" domestic rebound.The latest figure disappointed expectations of 5.0 percent growth predicted by analysts polled by AFP, and was a sharp three percentage points down from the 7.9 percent expansion in the April to June period."We must note that current international environment uncertainties are mounting and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven," NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said Monday.But GDP for the third quarter rose 0.2 percent over the three months before that, authorities added.Meanwhile, industrial production growth slowed further to 3.1 percent on-year in September."Growth was dragged down by a slowdown in real estate, amplified recently by spillover from Evergrande's travails," said Oxford Economics' head of Asia economics Louis Kuijs.The struggles of property giant Evergrande -- under a mountain of debt worth more than $300 billion -- have been weighing on sentiment among prospective buyers.Kuijs noted there was an "additional hit in September" from electricity shortages and production cuts due to strict implementation of climate and safety targets by local governments.He added that the damage was visible in the slowdown of industrial output.Power rationing in recent weeks, along with surging raw material costs and the government's climate push, has led to reduced mining and manufacturing activity.But retail sales picked up to 4.4 percent -- improving from 2.5 percent in August -- with fewer virus containment measures in China, which has imposed swift local lockdowns over a handful of cases.The urban unemployment rate was 4.9 percent last month.The Chinese government is trying to recalibrate the economy to one driven by consumers and away from investment and exports.But officials presently have to walk a fine line between supporting growth and keeping a lid on inflation, with factory-gate prices rising at their fastest rate in a quarter of a century.Despite still-strong foreign demand, factors such as extreme weather and virus outbreaks -- on top of energy shortages and the cooling housing market -- have all weighed on China's economy, analysts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-growth-slides-to-4-9-in-third-quarter-101634524732687.html

By Friday, when some curbs will be lifted, the Australian city of 5 million people will have been under six lockdowns totalling 262 days since March 2020.Australian and other media say this is the longest in the world - exceeding a 234-day lockdown in Buenos Aires, Argentina.While coronavirus cases keep rising in Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, the state’s double-vaccination rate is set to reach 70% this week, allowing for the ease in restrictions.“Today is a great day,” said Victoria premier Daniel Andrews while announcing the lockdown. “Today is a day when Victorians can be proud of what they have achieved.”When hospitality venues and some businesses reopen, their capacity will remain heavily restricted. More easing, including the reopening of many retailers, will come once 80% of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated - estimated by November 5 at the latest.Grand Mosque in Mecca drops social distancingThe Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia operated at full capacity on Sunday, with worshippers praying shoulder-to-shoulder for the first time since the pandemic began.Workers removed floor markings that guide people to social distance in and around the Grand Mosque, which is built around the Kaaba, the cubic structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.Tycoon Robert Durst on ventilator, has Covid-19US real estate mogul Robert Durst, sentenced to life in prison for killing his best friend, has been placed on a ventilator after becoming infected with Covid-19, according to a US media report published on Saturday.Durst, 78, was given a life sentence this week with no possibility of parole after a jury found him guilty of killing his friend in 2000 at her Beverly Hills home to keep her from talking to police about the disappearance of his wife two decades earlier.1 hurt in French nightclub shooting over Covid passTwo men who were refused entry to a French nightclub for producing a fake Covid-19 health pass have been arrested over a shooting at the venue that left one party goer injured, prosecutors said on Sunday.The incident had taken place on Thursday night in the outskirts of the eastern town of Montbeliard.“It has been confirmed that one of the men tried to present a health pass that did not match his identity,” the public prosecutor for the area, Ariane Combarel, told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-gears-up-to-lift-lengthy-covid-lockdown-101634496543761.html

Al-Naba, the IS group’s weekly, has published a warning and it further read that Shia Muslims will be targeted in their homes and strongholds, reported Khaama Press.The statement has especially threatened Shia Muslims living in Afghanistan. From Baghdad to Khorasan, Shia Muslims will be target everywhere, said IS.The warning came after a powerful explosion rattled a Shia mosque in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province on Friday, killing over 60 worshippers while wounding more than 80. The attack was claimed by Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).
