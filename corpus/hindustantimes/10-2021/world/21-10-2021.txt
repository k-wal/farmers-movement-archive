In particular, UNSCR 2593 (2021) demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts,” the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog said in a statement.“The FATF calls on all jurisdictions' competent authorities to provide advice and facilitate information sharing with their private sectors on assessing and mitigating any emerging ML/TF risks identified, in accordance with the risk-based approach,” it further said.Meanwhile, the watchdog also mentioned that non-profit organisations working in the war-torn country and other actors providing humanitarian assistance should be ensured of delivering the aid needed in the region “without delay, disruption or discouragement.”“The FATF calls on all jurisdictions to protect NPOs from being misused for terrorist financing,” it said. The recommendations by the FATF to ensure this included conducting sustained and targeted outreach that were consistent with their recommendations, “while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.”Mentioning that it would “closely monitor” the changes in money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Afghanistan, the FATF also said that it would consider all options to “help promote security, safety and the integrity of the global financial system.”On Thursday, the FATF also retained Pakistan in its grey list. “Pakistan has largely addressed 30 out of the 34 items, most recent action plan which was in June this year focused on money laundering,” FATF president Marcus Pleyer said. Further, the body also placed Turkey under surveillance for shortcomings in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-expresses-concerns-about-terrorist-financing-risk-environment-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101634837208692.html

The report, which was released on Thursday, has also named two regions of concern, countries on the African continent.“The IC (Intelligence Community) identified 11 countries and two regions of concern from the threat from climate change,” the report said, adding, “Building resilience in these countries and region would probably be especially helpful in mitigating future risks to US interests.”The report said the intelligence community assessed that these countries are likely to face “warming temperatures, more extreme weather, and disruption to ocean patterns that will threaten their energy, food, water, and health security”. Intensifying and more frequent heat waves and droughts will in turn “create water supply volatility and probably strain their electric utility operations, while growing economies and populations will increase electricity demands to handle rising temperatures”.More frequent and intense cyclones are likely to contaminate water sources and increase vector populations and the diseases they transmit in several of the 11 countries, the report said. It went on to say that projection models suggest that the incidence of dengue will probably increase in India, Afghanistan, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, and Pakistan.These 11 countries including India will “lack” the financial resources or governance capacity to adapt to climate change effects, the report said, which, will heighten the “risk of instability-induced migration and displacement flows” including to the US southern border and raise their already high level of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance.The US intelligence community also names other countries that are “comparatively more exposed and have fewer resources to adapt to climate change effects”. These countries are China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.In a separate fact-sheet, the White House said, “Climate change will increasingly exacerbate a number of risks to US national security interests, from physical impacts that could cascade into security challenges, to how countries respond to the climate challenge. While the IC judges that all of these risks will increase and that no country will be spared from challenges directly related to climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-puts-india-10-others-on-list-of-countries-of-concern-on-climate-101634837490679.html
21-10-2021||World||FATF keeps Imran Khan’s Pakistan in grey list, says now prosecute terror leaders||NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Thursday retained Pakistan in its grey list and urged the country to do more to investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups involved in terror financing.FATF president Marcus Pleyer said after a three-day plenary meeting of the multilateral watchdog that Jordan, Mali and Turkey have been added to the list of countries under increased monitoring or grey list because of serious issues in their regimes to counter money laundering and terror financing. Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, FATF also expressed “concern about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment” in the war-torn country. “Pakistan remains under increased monitoring,” Pleyer told an online news briefing.“Pakistan has taken a number of important steps but needs to further demonstrate that investigations and prosecutions are being pursued against the senior leadership of UN-designated terror groups,” he said.Pakistan was added to the grey list in mid-2018 and given a 27-point action plan by FATF to control money laundering and terror financing. In June this year, FATF asked Pakistan to implement another seven-point action plan to address serious deficiencies related to money laundering.Pleyer said Pakistan “addressed or largely addressed” 30 out of the 34 items in the two action plans. He said the country made “good progress” on the 2021 action plan by tackling four out of the seven items, including checks on businesses and enacting legislative amendments to ensure international cooperation. But Pleyer insisted Pakistan must deliver on the sole remaining item in the 2018 action plan by demonstrating that its investigations and prosecutions are targeting senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated groups. He brushed aside several questions from Pakistani journalists that FATF’s actions were political in nature and said that the watchdog made all decisions within a technical framework following voting by the organisation’s members. FATF said in a statement that Pakistan made significant progress in addressing its “strategic counter-terrorist financing-related deficiencies”. The statement added: “Pakistan should continue to work to address its other strategically important AML/CFT deficiencies, namely by: (1) providing evidence that it actively seeks to enhance the impact of sanctions beyond its jurisdiction by nominating additional individuals and entities for designation at the UN; and (2) demonstrating an increase in ML investigations and prosecutions and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with Pakistan’s risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze, and confiscate assets.”In a separate statement on Afghanistan, FATF said the watchdog, “as the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, expresses its concern about the current and evolving money laundering and terrorist financing risk environment in the country”.FATF affirmed the UN Security Council Resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan, especially resolution 2593 which “demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts”.The statement on Afghanistan added, “The FATF calls on all jurisdictions’ competent authorities to provide advice and facilitate information sharing with their private sectors on assessing and mitigating any emerging ML/TF risks identified, in accordance with the risk-based approach.”At the same time, FATF reiterated the “utmost importance of ensuring non-profit organisations (NPOs) and all other humanitarian actors can provide the vital humanitarian assistance needed in the region and elsewhere, without delay, disruption or discouragement. The FATF calls on all jurisdictions to protect NPOs from being misused for terrorist financing.” The FATF, together with its affiliates APG, EAG and the Global Network, will “closely monitor the situation, including any changes to money laundering and terrorist financing risks in Afghanistan”, and consider all options to help promote security, safety and the integrity of the global financial system.At its last virtual plenary meeting in June, the watchdog had retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to adequately investigate and prosecute leaders of UN-designated terrorist groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-keeps-imran-khan-s-pakistan-in-grey-list-says-now-prosecute-terror-leaders-101634837189330.html

Putting to rest the initial police reports that the car was on autopilot, the US National Transportation Safety Board said in an investigative update that a man was behind the wheel and was applying the accelerator in the moments leading up to the fatal crash.First responders had found one man in the front passenger seat and another man in the back seat. But the preliminary findings of the investigation suggest that both the driver and the passenger were in the front seats when the Tesla car hit a drainage culvert, a raised manhole and a tree, and burst into flames.The NTSB said the damage to the steering wheel was due to an impact as the car had reached a speed of 67 miles (107.83 kilometres) per hour before crashing into the tree. Though the agency said the crash is still under investigation, the preliminary findings effectively clear Tesla’s controversial Autopilot system which has been involved in dozens of other crashes.“The NTSB continues to collect data to analyze the crash dynamics, postmortem toxicology test results, seat belt use, occupant egress, and electric vehicle fires,” the agency said.The fatal trip began from the Tesla owner’s residence which was near the end of a cul-de-sac. Investigators analysed the footage from the owner's home security camera which showed the man entering the driver’s seat and the passenger riding the shotgun. The report hasn’t clarified how the driver unbuckled the seat belt and changed seating positions.The road did not have lines to define the travel lanes and no speed limit signs were posted in the crash area, even though the maximum speed limit for the road was 30 mph, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-crash-probe-finds-driver-behind-wheel-how-he-changed-seats-still-unclear-101634835810026.html

The global financial watchdog said that Pakistan addressed or largely addressed 30 of the 34 action plan items.“Pakistan remains under increased monitoring (grey list). The Pakistan government has two concurrent action plans, with a total of 34 action plan items. It has now addressed or largely addressed 30 of the items,” Dr Marcus Pleyer, the FATF president, said.Pakistan has been asked by FATF to demonstrate ‘an increase in MB investigations and prosecutions and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with its risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze, and confiscate assets.’Pakistan was placed on Paris-based FATF's grey list for gaps in its counter-terror financing and anti-money laundering regimes in June 2018. The FATF gave Pakistan three months in June this year to fulfil the remaining conditions by October.The FATF asked Pakistan to address issues regarding the investigation and prosecution of senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups. FATF’s Pleyer however noted that the country largely addressed ‘26 out of 27 items on the action plan it first committed to in June 2018.’The FATF also placed Turkey under surveillance and said there are serious offences remaining regarding the nation’s control over financial operations, news agency AFP reported. On the Afghanistan issue, the FATF said that it will continue to monitor closely any changes to money laundering and terrorist financing risks in the war-torn nation.It also stressed that the Afghan territory must not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts.The FATF congratulated Mauritius and Botswana after they were removed from the ‘grey list’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-remains-on-grey-list-of-fatf-101634834252914.html

Some provinces and territories, like Ontario, have already started issuing the certificate since last week.A release from the prime minister’s office said that Ottawa is “also engaging with international partners to obtain recognition and acceptance abroad, so the proof can also be used to facilitate travel around the world”. Addressing the media in Ottawa along with Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland, Justin Trudeau said they were “very confident” this certificate “is going to be accepted at destinations worldwide as proof of vaccination”.The Justin Trudeau-led government also noted that for Canadians travelling, it was “a reliable and secure way to demonstrate their Covid-19 vaccination history, both in Canada and abroad.”In fact, the vaccine passport will also be required for travelling domestically by air as a new mandate comes into effect on October 30. Proof of vaccination will be required for all air passengers flying on domestic or international flights departing from airports in Canada, rail passengers on certain trains like VIA Rail, and marine passengers on non-essential passenger vessels, such as cruise ships, on voyages of 24 hours or more.Approximately 83% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated and can register to access the digital document.It is also intended to ease returning to the country for Canadians abroad, as it can be used with the ArriveCan app which is required when they arrive at Canadian airports.The government also said that privacy was a “key priority” and the data contained within the document “only includes the minimum information needed to determine whether a traveller meets their entry and public health requirements”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-justin-trudeau-launches-vaccination-certificate-for-jabbed-canadians-101634832088571.html
21-10-2021||World||‘Truth Social’: Ex-US prez Donald Trump gets his own social media platform||Former US president Donald Trump misses the social media megaphones he had before the January 6 insurrection. Shut out by them, he has now unveiled his own digital media venture that will launch a new social media platform in November called “Truth Social”, ostensibly to give him back his megaphone.A beta version of the platform is expected to be launched next month, but only for some invited guests. The national rollout is slated for the first quarter of 2022.“I created Truth Social and TMTG to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech,” the former president said in a statement issued in his capacity as chairman of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which will launch the new social platform. “We live in a world where the Taliban have a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favourite American president has been silenced.”Donald Trump was shut down by Twitter, Facebook and Google’s YouTube in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol in which, instigated by him at a rally, his supporters had stormed the US Congress. It aimed to prevent a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate from certifying President Joe Biden’s election as president, which is usually a formality but Trump tried to use it to remain in power in defiance of the election mandate.Donald Trump has railed against the ban and he and his supporters have wrongly claimed it is violation of the First Amendment of the US constitution that guarantees free speech, but only from government restrictions and clampdowns.Trump has also sued to get his social media accounts restored. His attorneys filed lawsuits against Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in July demanding overturning of their ban claiming it violated his First Amendment rights and of other conservatives also closed down by these companies. Earlier in October, he filed a motion asking a federal judge to order Twitter to restore his account.The former president has now launched his own technology company and a new social media platform. He announced the merger of TMTG with Digital World Acquisition Corp, which is a special purpose acquisition company, an increasingly popular alternative to initial public offerings.Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter when his account was closed. Since then, he has used email to convey his thoughts and remarks, with similar frequency and wordage. But they don’t have the same explosive impact as his tweets that had rung around the world in an instant.Donald Trump has returned to holding political rallies and events and has tightened his grip on the Republican party. Polls show he remains a favourite for the party’s presidential nomination for 2024 by an overwhelming margin. He has teased the possibility of a run but has not publicly committed to it yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truth-social-ex-us-prez-donald-trump-gets-his-own-social-media-platform-101634830288392.html
21-10-2021||World||Israel poised to welcome fully vaccinated foreign tourists back to country||Israeli leaders on Thursday recommended reopening the country to fully vaccinated tourists beginning on Nov. 1, a year and a half after closing its borders to most foreign visitors due to the global coronavirus pandemic.The decision, which still requires formal government approval, comes as Israel emerges from a fourth wave of coronavirus infections. Israel in July began an aggressive booster-shot campaign, offering a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to virtually anyone over the age of 16. That campaign appears to have brought the outbreak under control.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said that foreigners who were fully vaccinated less than six months ago, or who have received a booster shot more recently, will be eligible to enter the country. People who recovered from COVID-19 less than six months ago may also visit.The rules recognize most internationally recognized vaccines, including Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sinovak and Sinopharm - but not Russia's Sputnik. Bennett's office said people coming from “red” countries with high outbreaks would not be permitted, while officials will monitor new variants, including a strain identified in Israel this week.The decision could give a boost to the struggling tourism industry, which has been hit hard by the lack of tourists. It comes just ahead of the busy Christmas season, when tens of thousands of foreigners visit holy sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank.Senior Cabinet ministers, along with health, tourism, economic and security experts, took part in Thursday’s decision.Some details, including whether foreigners will have to be tested or undergo quarantine upon arrival, were not immediately announced.Throughout the closure, Israel has allowed some foreigners to visit, including people with close relatives in the country and people coming for work or study. It began allowing organized tour groups in September. Those visitors must take coronavirus tests before their incoming flights, upon arrival and before they fly out of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-poised-to-welcome-fully-vaccinated-foreign-tourists-back-to-country-101634827834086.html
21-10-2021||World||US envoy nominee Nicholas Burns’ remarks smack of Cold War mentality: China||China on Thursday “firmly rejected” US ambassador nominee Nicholas Burns’ tough comments on Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang, saying his remarks show a Cold War and zero-sum mentality.“The remarks of Mr Burns smack of Cold War zero-sum mentality and run counter to facts. China firmly rejects them,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday.Wang was responding to Burns’ remarks made during his US Senate confirmation hearing hours earlier where he said that the “genocide in Xinjiang”, abuses in Tibet, and bullying of Taiwan must stop.Calling China, the US’s “most dangerous competitor”, Nicholas Burns said Beijing was “blasting past” its pledge to maintain only a minimum nuclear deterrent.He added that Washington should work with allies in Europe and elsewhere to build economic leverage.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry issued a strong rebuttal to Nicholas Burns’ comments.“Issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong are purely China’s internal affairs that brook no foreign interference. The accusation of the so-called ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is an outrageous lie fabricated by a few anti-China scholars in Western countries and US politicians, with the true intention of oppressing and containing China’s development,” Wang Wenbin said.“The one-China principle is a political foundation of China-US relations and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory,” the Chinese spokesperson added.“We advise Mr Burns to be keenly aware of the overall trend of world development and people’s aspirations, learn the real situations of China objectively, view China and China-US ties in a rational manner and avoid underestimating the strong resolve, determination and capability of the Chinese people to defend their rights.” Wang Wenbin said.Ties between the US and China have been fraught over a range of issues ranging from trade to human rights and transparency over the origins of the coronavirus, which triggered the Covid-19 pandemic.During a phone conversation in September, President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart, Joe Biden that US’ China policy had resulted in serious difficulties in bilateral ties and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the common interests of the world.Xi Jinping suggested that on the basis of respecting each other’s core concerns and properly managing differences, the two sides “…continue with contact and dialogue, and advance coordination and cooperation on climate change, epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery as well as major international and regional issues”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-nominee-nicholas-burns-remarks-smack-of-cold-war-mentality-china-101634825967785.html

Qureshi was accompanied by the ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed to meet with Taliban officials of Afghanistan's interim government, news agency PTI reported.As part of the visit, Qureshi met with the interim Prime Minister of Afghanistan Mohammad Hasan Akhund, deputy PM Abdul Salam Hanafi and the interim foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. The two sides discussed “various aspects” of matters concerning mutual interest and enhancing cooperation in trade and economic departments, Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Meanwhile, Afghan foreign minister Muttaqi welcomed the Pakistan delegation in Kabul. “The talks between the two sides will cover the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and focus on ways and means to deepen cooperation in diverse areas,” news agency PTI reported citing the Pakistan foreign office.Further, Qureshi will also share Pakistan’s perspective on issues of regional peace and stability, the foreign office said. Pakistan also highlighted that the country has always stood by Afghanistan and kept the border crossing points open for trade and pedestrian crossing under Covid protocols, the PTI report also showed.The meeting came a day after the international meeting hosted by Russia and attended by the Taliban. During the meeting Russia said that the country recognised the “efforts” of the Taliban to “stabilise” the volatile situation in Afghanistan. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, during his address to the meeting, said, “A new administration is in power now.We note their efforts to stabilise the military and political situation and set up work of the state apparatus,” news agency AFP reported.Russia expressed concerns over the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and also called for more humanitarian aid and the assistance of the international community to the war-torn nation.

That being said, today, Pakistan Foreign Minister Makdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi landed in Kabul along with Lt General Faiz Hameed, who is still functioning as DG, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and were received by Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.According to Kabul watchers, Hameed, who is at the centre of a fight between PM Khan and Army Chief Gen Qamar Jawed Bajwa, had recently visited Tajikistan to win support for the Taliban terrorist regime. Despite Gen Bajwa transferring Hameed as XI Corps Commander at Peshawar on October 6 and replacing him with Karachi Corps Commander Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum, Gen Hameed is staying put in Rawalpindi under the protection of Imran Khan. Gen Hameed was publicly seen at Serena Hotel in Kabul on September 6 as he brokered the Taliban government formation.Also Read: Former DG (ISI) could succeed Gen Bajwa as Pakistan Army ChiefIt is understood that Qureshi and Hameed landed up in Kabul today to convince the hardline Sunni regime to make their government open to more minority representation particularly women so that the international community gets a face-saver to recognize the rabid Islamist regime. To date, even China, Russia, Qatar, Turkey, the closest supporters of the Taliban regime apart from controller Pakistan, have not recognized the Sunni Islamist government in Kabul. The democratic world has made it clear that the Taliban must fulfil conditions stipulated in UNSC resolution 2593 as the first step towards recognition.Also Read: China with Pak support has advantage in Taliban ruled AfghanistanWhile Pakistan is using its good offices with other countries to secure recognition for the government in Kabul, there is infighting within the Taliban government with Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob on one side and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of eponymous terror network, his chief rival. Such is the level of mistrust among the Taliban leaders that Deputy PM and Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Gani Baradar has refused to take personal security from the Interior Ministry and has decided to keep his own trusted people to guard him.It has been two months since the Taliban militarily occupied Kabul but there is no sign of any governance in the ventilator state with rival factions imposing their diktat through guns. Recently, when the Taliban government issued order allowing women to work at the Culture ministry, they were stopped by the guards saying that this was against the Islamic tenets and threatened to use force on women who just wanted to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-s-dg-isi-returns-to-kabul-wants-taliban-to-get-minority-reps-on-board-101634819604649.html

Pfizer-BioNTech announced the results on Thursday from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a 30-µg booster dose, the same dosage strength as those in the primary series, of the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. “These results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.More than 10,000 individuals who had completed the primary two-dose series of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine participated in the booster dose trial. Half of the trial participants received a 30-µg booster dose while the other half received a placebo. The researchers identified five Covid-19 cases in the booster dose group while 109 cases in the placebo group.Citing multiple subgroup analyses, the study suggests that booster dose efficacy was consistent irrespective of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions.The US and German partners are the first to publish efficacy results from any randomized, controlled Covid-19 vaccine booster trial.“In addition to our efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated, we believe boosters have a critical role to play in addressing the ongoing public health threat of this pandemic,” Bourla added.Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid vaccines are at the centre of the immunisation programme in the United States to fight the pandemic.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already authorised the third dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine for emergency use among individuals 65 years of age and older, all adults at high risk of severe Covid-19, and those with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-say-their-covid-vaccine-booster-dose-95-6-effective-101634816988733.html
21-10-2021||World||China drops Caixin Media from list of official publications; WeChat, Weibo added||China has removed Caixin Media, one of the country’s most independent and well known business publications, from an expanded list of news sources from which other online news providers are allowed to reprint content.The expanded list has added mobile apps and China’s Twitter-like Weibo and WeChat social media accounts run by official media sources for the first time.The crackdown on Caixin Media, respected for its investigative stories, comes amid the Chinese government’s efforts to tighten the flow of information as well as wide-ranging regulatory curbs implemented on e-commerce and education sectors, social media as well as reality television and artistes.China’s internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) dropped Caixin from a list of 1,358 news outlets and government agencies whose content can be republished.Online platforms are barred from publishing content from non-approved sources, the CAC said in a statement published on its website on Wednesday.Caixin Media was on the previous list, published in 2016.Another independent Chinese newspaper, The Economic Observer, was also dropped from this year’s list.The CAC said that outlets removed from the latest list “no longer meet requirements, have poor daily performance and lack influence”. The aim was to maintain the “seriousness and credibility” of the list, it said.The CAC said that from now on, when online news service providers reprint news information, they must follow the latest version of the “List of Internet News Information Sources”, and those “…who reprint beyond the scope will be punished in accordance with laws and regulations”.The omitting of Caixin Media means that its stories cannot be shared on China’s hugely popular online platforms like WeChat and Twitter-like Weibo.The ban could impact the outlet’s advertisement flow as well.Besides investigative stories related to business, corruption and pollution, Caixin’s coverage of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic in the central Chinese city of Wuhan was widely appreciated.Most recently, it had done a series of in-depth stories on China’s crippling power shortage.“Caixin is among the few news outlets in China that criticise government officials for perceived shortcomings. In 2016, it took the unprecedented step of reporting on how one of its own articles had been deleted by the Cyberspace Administration of China, exposing a practice that the government has sought to keep out of the public eye,” Bloomberg said in a report on Caixin’s ouster.The outlet had highlighted the issue of censorship in China in a rare show of defiance against the Communist government after an interview of a government adviser was removed from its website.Then helmed by one of China’s most well-known journalists Hu Shuli, it put out a bold rejoinder on its English language website after China’s multi-layered censors removed an earlier interview of the adviser who had called for freedom of speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drops-caixin-media-from-list-of-official-publications-wechat-weibo-added-101634815106250.html

21-10-2021||World||Covishield, Pfizer may be 90% effective against death by Delta variant: Report||Two doses of Covishield and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines may be 90 per cent effective at preventing deaths from the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday.The study, using data from the Scotland-wide EAVE II COVID-19 surveillance platform, is the first to show across an entire country how effective vaccines are at preventing death from the Delta variant, the dominant form of the virus in many other countries.The research team from Universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland analysed data from 5.4 million people in Scotland between April 1 and September 27, 2021.During this period, 115,000 people tested positive for COVID-19 through a PCR test conducted in the community, rather than in hospital, and there were 201 deaths recorded due to the virus.The study found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 90 per cent effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, is 91 per cent effective in preventing deaths in people who have been double vaccinated, but who have tested positive for coronavirus in the community."With the Delta variant now the dominant strain in many places worldwide and posing a higher risk of hospitalisation than previous variants seen in the UK, it is reassuring to see that vaccination offers such high protection from death very shortly after the second dose," said Professor Aziz Sheikh, Director of the University of Edinburgh’s Usher Institute, and EAVE II study lead."If you still have not taken up your offer to be vaccinated, I would encourage you to do so based on the clear benefits it offers,” Sheikh said.The researchers defined death from COVID-19 as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test, or with COVID-19 recorded as a cause of death on their death certificate.The study analysed a dataset as part of the EAVE II project, which uses anonymised linked patient data to track the pandemic and the vaccine roll out in real time.The researchers said to increase confidence in these early findings, the study needs to be repeated in other countries and settings, and with longer follow-up time after full vaccination.They noted that because of the observational nature of the study, data about vaccine effectiveness should be interpreted with caution and it is not possible to make a direct comparison between both vaccines."Our findings are encouraging in showing that the vaccine remains an effective measure in protecting both ourselves and others from death from the most dominant variant of COVID-19," said Professor Chris Robertson, from the University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland."It is very important to validate these early results in other settings and with a longer follow-up study," Robertson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covishield-pfizer-may-be-90-effective-against-death-by-delta-variant-report-101634799466926.html

The surgery, carried out on September 25, is being considered as a "potential miracle" by the surgeon who led the procedure.The surgery involved a genetically modified donor animal and a brain dead patient on a ventilator whose family had given permission for the two-day experiment, for the sake of advancing science, reported AFP."It did what it's supposed to do, which is remove waste and make urine," Robert Montgomery, director of the transplant institute at New York University (NYU) Langone, told AFP in an interview. The surgey went on for around two hours.The team of doctors joined the kidney to blood vessels on the top of one of the patient's legs, so that they could observe it and take biopsy samples.Montgomery told AFP that the patient wanted to be an organ donor but their organs were not suitable. However, the family "felt a sense of relief that this was another opportunity for donation," he said. The patient was taken off the ventilator and passed away following the 54-hour test.After the surgery, it was found that the organ was able to reduce the level of the molecule creatinine, a key indicator of kidney health.According to earlier research, kidneys from pigs are viable in nonhuman primates for up to a year. However, this was the first time that the same had been attempted with a human patient. The donor pig belonged to a herd that had undergone a genetic editing procedure to knock out a gene that produces a particular sugar."It is still a question what would happen three weeks from now, three months, three years," said Montgomery. "The only way we're really going to be able to answer that is to move this into a living human trial. But I think this is a really important intermediate step, which tells us that at least initially, things are probably going to be okay."Robert Montgomery plans to submit the findings to a scientific journal in the next month, and is expecting a clinical trial in around a year or two. The outside experts welcomed the news but said they would like to see the peer-reviewed data before drawing firm conclusions.The news comes amid a dire shortage of transplant organs. According to official US data, there are nearly 107,000 Americans awaiting an organ - 90,000 of whom need a kidney. Seventeen Americans die each day while waiting for an organ.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pig-kidney-works-in-human-patient-potential-miracle-hails-us-surgeon-101634787803264.html

Comilla's Superintendent of Police Farooq Ahmed told Dhaka Tribune that the man's name is Iqbal Hossain from Sujanagar area of the city.Ahmed said the 35-year-old placed the Holy Quran at one of the Durga Puja pandals on October 13, which triggered the violence in which three people were killed.Also Read | VHP wants MPs to visit Bangladesh, conduct probeDhaka Tribune said in its report that the police identified Hossain after analysing video footages of the CCTV cameras installed at the Durga Puja venues. He has not yet been arrested.In the footage, Hossain is seen taking the Quran from a local mosque and walking into a Durga Puja venue. He was later seen walking away with the club of Lord Hanuman.Ahmed said that the police will hold a briefing on Thursday where more details about Hossain will be shared.Attacks on Hindu temples have intensified in Bangladesh since last Wednesday after a post surfaced on social media showing the Quran kept at a Durga Puja pandal. Late on Sunday, a mob damaged 66 houses and set on fire at least 20 homes of Hindus.The police said over 450 suspected temple attackers have been arrested so far in different parts of the country. Forty one of them have been arrested for the Comilla incident and four of them are Hossain's associates.On Tuesday, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina instructed her home minister to initiate immediate action against those who incited violence using religion as she asked the people not to trust anything on social media without fact-checking.Hindus make up some 10 per cent of the Muslim-majority Bangladesh's 169 million population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-police-identify-man-behind-quran-incident-which-triggered-violence-101634784740482.html
21-10-2021||World||Enforce UN sanctions on North Korea, say US & EU||The United States and several European countries on Wednesday condemned North Korea’s recent missile tests and said Pyongyang’s technical advances demonstrate the urgent need to ramp up implementation of UN sanctions on its nuclear and missile programs and its economic activities.US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged North Korea to stop its “reckless provocations” that violate Security Council sanctions resolutions. She said it should start talks with the Biden administration without preconditions toward the goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.She urged all countries to fully implement UN sanctions “so that we can prevent the DPRK from accessing the funds, the technology, the know-how it needs to further develop unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.”Thomas-Greenfield reiterated to reporters before an emergency closed meeting of the council on North Korea’s latest missile tests that the United States has offered to meet officials from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea -- the country’s official name -- “and we have made clear that we have no hostile intent toward the DPRK.”In a separate statement, the three members of the European Union on the Security Council -- Ireland, France and Estonia -- said Monday’s reported test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile “forms part of a pattern of provocations by the DPRK” in recent weeks, including launches of short-range ballistic missiles, long-range cruise missiles, “and what it has claimed to be a hypersonic glider.”They said the new submarine missile launch “underlines the continued enhancement of the nuclear and ballistic program of the DPRK, which stated the ambition to ultimately acquire sea-based nuclear capabilities.”The EU council members urged North Korea to immediately end its “destabilizing actions and take concrete steps to abandon its ballistic missiles” and other weapons of mass destruction including its nuclear program “in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.”Ireland, France and Estonia also urged North Korea to respond positively to the repeated offers by the US and South Korea for dialogue saying “there is no other way to achieve peace, security and stability on the Korean peninsula.”The 15-member Security Council heard a briefing on the latest missile tests from UN Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari, but did not issue a statement.The council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions on North Korea severely restricting its imports and exports while demanding an end to its nuclear and ballistic missile activities. But North Korea has repeatedly flouted council resolutions and continues to launch increasingly sophisticated missiles, escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the region.Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration is committed to working with the international community to reduce tensions and maintain peace on the Korean peninsula. And the US commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan “is ironclad," she said.She criticized the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions on North Korea, saying it “is not doing its job.”“We must enforce these violations,” she said. “We need to ramp up the implementation of the sanctions and we’ve not done that. And particularly, we need to focus on those who are violating the sanctions and others who are engaging in activities that break the sanctions.”The US ambassador didn’t name any countries, but the panel of experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions has cited alleged violations by North Korea’s neighbors China and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/enforce-un-sanctions-on-north-korea-say-us-eu-101634783084413.html
21-10-2021||World||Covid-19: US FDA approves Moderna, J&J booster shots; says yes to vaccine mixing||The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for eligible individuals the use of third doses (booster shots) of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The public health agency has also approved the administration of a ‘mix and match’ booster dose after eligible individuals have completed the primary vaccination schedule with a different available vaccine.The FDA, in a press release, elaborated on the booster dose schedule that has now been approved in the United States. A single booster dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine may be administered to individuals 18 years of age and older at least two months after the completion of the single-dose primary regimen.To be eligible for the third dose of the Moderna vaccine, however, individuals have to be 65 years of age and older, since the federal agency considers this section of the population at ‘high risk’ of severe infection. Alternatively, the Moderna Covid-19 booster dose may also be administered to people 18 years of age and above whose job exposes them to the novel coronavirus or if they are at high risk of infection, according to the US FDA release. The third dose of the Moderna vaccine is to be administered at least six months after eligible individuals receive their first dose of an approved Covid-19 vaccine.However, the Moderna booster shot approved by the FDA will be half the dose that is given in the primary two-shot regime.In addition, the FDA said individuals may receive a booster shot from a different manufacturer compared to the doses they received earlier this year. "The use of each of the available Covid-19 vaccines as a heterologous (or "mix and match") booster dose among the eligible individuals following completion of primary vaccination with a different available Covid-19 vaccine," the FDA said in its press release.The clearances came after a panel of expert advisers to the FDA unanimously backed the Moderna and J&J booster regimens in two days of meetings last week. Regulators have now signed off on boosters for all three coronavirus vaccines available in the US.According to the Bloomberg news agency, the recent move by the FDA means that the United States will now have a larger toolkit to try to limit a potential coronavirus rebound this winter. The summer’s delta-variant fueled spike in Covid-19 infections helped increase the urgency to make boosters available, and health officials across the US are eager to forestall a rebound in cases that could cripple hospitals and disrupt work and school in winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-fda-approves-moderna-j-j-booster-shots-says-yes-to-vaccine-mixing-101634780660227.html
21-10-2021||World||France may announce energy, trade sanctions amid fishing dispute with UK||France will announce potential sanctions over energy prices and trade “by the end of the week” in its fishing dispute with the United Kingdom, the government spokesman said Wednesday. France vehemently protested the decision last month by the UK and the Channel Island of Jersey to refuse dozens of French fishing boats a license to operate in their territorial waters. Paris called the move “unacceptable”.France considers the restrictions as contrary to the post-Brexit agreement that the British government signed when it left the European Union.“We are obviously in a position to take sanctions if the agreement is not respected,” French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said. “There are several types of sanctions that are possible: energy prices, access to (French) ports, tariffs issues.”Jersey, which is only 14 miles (22 kilometers) off the French coast, is a British Crown dependency outside of the UK. As such, it has its own powers with regard to who is allowed to fish in its territorial waters.Attal said the sanctions would take effect in November if no deal is reached with the UK and Jersey.France has asked its European Union partners to act as one in the dispute, urging the 27-nation bloc to prepare retaliation measures.A top French official declined Wednesday to say whether French president Emmanuel Macron will discuss the issue with his counterparts at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. He spoke anonymously in accordance with the French presidency's customary practices.Earlier this month, France and 10 other EU nations issued a joint declaration denouncing UK's attitude over fishing licenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-may-announce-energy-trade-sanctions-amid-fishing-dispute-with-uk-101634780052123.html
21-10-2021||World||Europe the only region with surge in Covid-19 infections last week, says WHO||The World Health Organization said there was a 7% rise in new coronavirus cases across Europe last week, the only region in the world where cases increased, and said uneven vaccine uptake posed a threat to the continent.In its weekly assessment of the pandemic, the UN health agency said there were about 2.7 million new Covid-19 cases and more than 46,000 deaths last week worldwide, similar to the numbers reported the previous week.WHO said the two regions with the highest rates of Covid-19 incidence were Europe and the Americas. Globally, the US reported the biggest number of new cases, more than 580,000, which still represented a 11% decline.Britain, Russia and Turkey accounted for the most cases in Europe.The biggest drop in Covid-19 cases were seen in Africa and the Western Pacific, where infections fell by about 18% and 16%, respectively. The number of deaths in Africa also declined by about a quarter, despite the dire shortage of vaccines on the continent.But for the third consecutive week, coronavirus cases have jumped in Europe, with about 1.3 million new cases. More than half of countries in the region reported a rise in their Covid-19 numbers, WHO said. Britain and Russia each reported about a 15% increase in new cases.In a statement Wednesday, WHO's Europe office said 1 billion coronavirus vaccines have now been administered across the continent and described uneven vaccine uptake as “the region's biggest enemy in the fight against Covid-19.”In the past week, Russia has repeatedly broken new daily records for Covid-19 cases and the number of infections in the UK has surged to levels not seen since mid-July.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday backed a Cabinet proposal to keep Russian workers home for a week in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.Russian officials have struggled to vaccinate the population but due to vaccine skepticism, only about 32% of people have been immunized despite the availability of its Sputnik V vaccine. It has by far the largest virus death toll in Europe, with more than 225,000 deaths.Although the head of Britain's National Health Service has urged the government to introduce stricter Covid-19 protocols including mask-wearing and the faster vaccination of children, politicians have so far demurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-the-only-region-with-surge-in-covid-19-infections-last-week-says-who-101634779136336.html

But its Production Gap report found that total fossil fuel production would rise until at least 2040. Development plans would produce 110% more fossil fuels this decade than consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, and 45% more than for a world where temperatures rise 2°C.Putin will not attend Glasgow climate talksRussian President Vladimir Putin won’t go to next month’s UN climate summit, the Kremlin said.

The EU states with the lowest vaccination rates are all part of the former eastern bloc, including Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Poland, Latvia and Estonia.Romania, where one person is dying of Covid-19 every five minutes, had the world’s highest death rate per capita this week, with Bulgaria close behind.EU’s first new lockdownLatvia has imposed a month-long lockdown, becoming the first EU country to shut down again since the bloc began reopening this year as vaccines became widely available.Bulgaria, where only a quarter of the population has taken a first dose of vaccine, banned access to indoor public spaces this week for anyone who cannot show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from a recent infection.Poland’s health minister said on Wednesday “drastic measures” could be needed to respond to a sudden surge of infections there, although he said no new lockdown was being considered.Concern in Britain, tooHealth chiefs in the UK have urged the government to legally enforce some of the Covid-19 prevention measures, such as mandatory face coverings in enclosed spaces, as infections in Britain continue to spike over the 40,000 mark daily.The NHS Confederation, a membership body of the country’s National Health Service (NHS), said a back-up strategy, or “Plan B plus”, is required as pre-emptive action over winter. The warning comes as the UK hit a daily high of 43,738 cases and 223 deaths on Tuesday.Bolsonaro says ‘guilty of nothing’ amid chargesAfter Brazil’s senators said Jair Bolsonaro should be charged for nine crimes, including charlatanism, malfeasance and crimes against humanity in their conclusion of a probe into the government’s handling of the pandemic, the president insisted he’s “guilty of nothing”.A Senate commission presented a final report on Wednesday after six months of hearings.
