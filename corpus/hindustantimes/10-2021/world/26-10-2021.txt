We have to do it concretely," he said in Doha."They went through something that none of us can imagine, and we managed to get them out."The Taliban overthrew Afghanistan's former US-backed government in August and have since been trying to win backing and financial support for their Islamist regime, promising a more flexible rule than last time.But with some women still effectively banned from work, fear of reprisals for practising sport is widespread.And although they have yet to publicise a formal policy on women in sport, the Taliban have made comments that indicate serious participation will be impossible.‘Girls are also human’When they last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned women from sporting activity and even going to matches.Sports stadiums were regularly used for public executions.The all-male Taliban government has shut down the ministry of women's affairs and replaced it with one that earned notoriety for enforcing religious doctrine during the hardliners' first stint in power.The Taliban have since denied the removal of the ministry, insisting they were "arranging a framework for it".Joyce Cook, FIFA's chief social responsibility and education officer, said the 158 people from the sports community and their families would head from Doha to Albania until a permanent solution is reached.They are part of a list of 545 people who are seeking to leave, she said."We really need countries to come forward now," Cook told AFP, adding that the "biggest challenge now is to find permanent countries" for their resettlement."FIFA has 211 member associations, that's 211 countries, and we're calling on all of those countries to help us now."In Afghanistan, women have long faced open hostility to their involvement in sport and, in rural areas, it is extremely rare for them to participate.Even in cities, many women's leagues are at a fledgling stage.One 24-year-old woman who has been playing with the national football team since 2011 said everything changed for her when the Taliban seized power in mid-August."There are very narrow-minded people (who think) girls are nothing... I want to show them that girls are also human... this is why I joined football," she said, declining to be identified."It was hard, even for my family... slowly, slowly they started to support me, but sometimes the situation became tough," said the woman, who is also a young medical professional and used to run a clinic in Afghanistan.Dreaming of CanadaWith arms and legs full of bruises from training on concrete for hours on end, she said football was "like a relaxing medicine".Using water bottles to mark their goals, her team now plays in flip-flops and jeans in a compound in Doha, all sharing the same hopes."I and the other girls with me, we have a dream that we will go to Canada," she said.Some members of the Afghan women's youth football team and their families have already sought refuge in Portugal and are back training in the Lisbon suburbs."If Canada, United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand... if they could give us a signal and welcome some of these girls, I think it would be a fantastic message of solidarity and unity that only football can bring," Infantino said.Australia and New Zealand are hosting the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023, while the US, Mexico and Canada will host the 2026 men's World Cup.For Cook, the stories of the Afghan athletes reflect "a humanitarian tragedy"."It's heartbreaking to hear their stories. And it's heartbreaking to try to be in their shoes and try to imagine how they must be feeling," she said."These are people who deserve to be able to start a new life."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fifa-urges-international-community-to-help-in-getting-afghan-athletes-new-home-101635270515228.html

China is among the very few which seem to have started engaging with the outfit. Other members of the international community are taking a wait and watch approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-provides-1-mn-to-afghanistan-after-wang-yi-mullah-baradar-meet-in-doha-101635259662354.html
26-10-2021||World||Iran says cyberattack closes gas stations across country||A cyberattack crippled gas stations across Iran on Tuesday, leaving angry motorists stranded in long lines.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which rendered useless the government-issued electronic cards that many Iranians use to buy subsidized fuel at the pump.It bore similarities to another attack months earlier that seemed to directly challenge Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the country's economy buckles under American sanctions. Those economic problems worsen as the U.S. and Iran have yet to jointly re-enter Tehran's tattered nuclear deal with world powers.State television quoted an unnamed official in the country's National Security Council acknowledging the cyberattack, hours after it aired images of long lines of cars waiting to fill up in Tehran. Associated Press journalists also saw lines of cars at Tehran gas stations, with the pumps off and the station closed.“I have been waiting a couple of hours for the gas stations to reopen so that I can fill up," said a motorcyclist who gave his name only as Farzin. "There is no fuel wherever I go.”The semiofficial ISNA news agency, which first called the incident a cyberattack, said it saw those trying to buy fuel with a government-issued card through the machines instead receive a message reading “cyberattack 64411.” Most Iranians rely on those subsidies to fuel their vehicles, particularly amid the country's economic problems.While ISNA didn't acknowledge the number's significance, that number is associated with a hotline run through Khamenei's office that handles questions about Islamic law. ISNA later removed its reports, claiming that it too had been hacked. Such claims of hacking can come quickly when Iranian outlets publish news that angers the theocracy.Farsi-language satellite channels abroad published videos apparently shot by drivers in Isfahan, a major Iranian city, showing electronic billboards there reading: “Khamenei! Where is our gas?” Another said: “Free gas in Jamaran gas station,” a reference to the home of the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.State TV said Oil Ministry officials were holding an “emergency meeting” to solve the problem. Some gas stations that accept only cash and are not in the subsidy card network continued pumping fuel.The use of the number “64411” mirrored an attack in July targeting Iran's railroad system that also saw the number displayed. Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point later attributed the train attack to a group of hackers that called themselves Indra, after the Hindu god of war.Indra previously targeted firms in Syria, where President Bashar Assad has held onto power through Iran's intervention in his country's grinding war.Cheap gasoline is practically considered a birthright in Iran, home to the world’s fourth-largest crude oil reserves despite decades of economic woes.Subsidies allow Iranian motorists to buy regular gasoline at 15,000 rials per liter. That’s 5 cents a liter, or about 20 cents a gallon. After a monthly 60-liter quota, it costs 30,000 rials a liter. That’s 10 cents a liter or 41 cents a gallon. Regular gasoline costs 89 cents a liter or $3.38 a gallon on average in the U.S., according to AAA.In 2019, Iran faced days of mass protests across some 100 cities and towns over gasoline prices rising. Security forces arrested thousands and Amnesty International said it believes 304 people were killed in a government crackdown. Tuesday's cyberattack came in the same month in the Persian calendar as the gasoline protests in 2019.The attack also came on the birthday of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who, stricken with cancer, fled the country in 1979 just before the Islamic Revolution.Iran has faced a series of cyberattacks, including one that leaked video of abuses at its notorious Evin prison in August.The country disconnected much of its government infrastructure from the internet after the Stuxnet computer virus — widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli creation — disrupted thousands of Iranian centrifuges in the country’s nuclear sites in the late 2000s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-cyberattack-closes-gas-stations-across-country-101635259182421.html

Lt Gen Anjum will take over the reins of the spy agency from November 20. Incumbent ISI chief Faiz Hameed will continue in his position till November 19, according to the notification issued by Imran Khan's office.The formal announcement from the Pakistan prime minister’s office was issued on Tuesday evening but earlier in October Pakistan military's media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations issued a notification announcing lieutenant general Anjum’s elevation as the chief of Pakistan's spy agency.Earlier on Tuesday, before the notification was issued by the prime minister's office, lieutenant general Faiz Hameed, Pakistan army chief general Qamar Javed Bajwa and PM Imran Khan met at the ISI Secretariat, people familiar with the developments told Geo News.Anjum belongs to the Punjab regiment of the Pakistan army and has also served as a commander of the Karachi corps. He has led several expeditions in Balochistan against elements which Pakistan perceives as a threat to the nation’s security. Lt Gen Anjum also held command postings in the eastern border of Pakistan i.e. the Line of Control (LoC). His subordinates often refer to him as the ‘man with glacier brain but sharp reflexes’, according to reports by Pakistani news agencies. A graduate of the Royal College of Defense Studies in the UK, Anjum also holds a degree from the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies, Honolulu.The announcement made earlier by the Pakistan military's media wing led to speculations that there could be differences between the Imran Khan-led government and the country's army, which is influential when it comes to the nation’s security and foreign policy-related matters. Acknowledging that there were some "technical issues" between Imran Khan's office and the Pakistani army, the former earlier said that issues would soon be resolved, people familiar with the developments told Pakistani news agency Geo News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-clears-appointment-of-lt-gen-nadeem-anjum-as-isi-chief-101635254506144.html

It's like we are on the game, hearing the music and seeing this doll,” Seoul resident from the Philippines, Sung Hye-jin, said, standing in front of the doll.From toddlers to adults to even dogs, some park visitors were seen wearing green tracksuits with number tag ‘456’, similar to the outfits of show's main character."I really enjoyed the show, so came here wearing this costume for Halloween,” said South Korean resident Ko Dae-hwan, dressed in green.'Squid Game' has been watched by 142 million households since its September 17 debut, helping Netflix add 4.38 million new subscribers.The doll is planned to be displayed at the park until November 21, according to a park official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/red-light-green-light-squid-game-doll-at-seoul-park-draws-fans-101635251143453.html

He reiterated CPEC’s strategic role in bilateral ties, adding that “history has fully proved that the two countries are each other’s most reliable iron-clad brother”.The two countries will “jointly build the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor with high quality and strengthen their cooperation in such fields as agriculture, digital economy and people’s livelihood”, Xi Jinping further told the Pakistan’s prime minister, calling on the “two countries to stand together even more firmly and push forward the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two sides, and build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era”.The CPEC is a flagship project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which New Delhi has opposed as it violates India’s territorial sovereignty. Beijing has paid little attention to New Delhi’s serious reservations about the CPEC and have pumped in billions in money and resources in building infrastructure projects under the economic corridor.In a separate statement issued by the Pakistan’s foreign ministry, Imran Khan “lauded the successful, timely and high-quality implementation of the CPEC projects, and welcomed Chinese investments in the CPEC Special Economic Zones”.He “underscored that early start of work on the ML-1 railway project would complement Pakistan’s geo-economics vision for national and regional development”, according to the Pakistani press readout.The Chinese readout did not share details on what the two leaders discussed on Afghanistan, where Beijing and Islamabad are closely communicating with the Taliban government.In a rare move, however, the leaders of the two countries appealed for international aid for Afghanistan, a statement from the Pakistan foreign ministry said. “Regarding the situation in Afghanistan, both leaders called on the international community to provide immediate humanitarian and economic assistance to the Afghan people to alleviate their suffering, prevent instability and flight of people, as well as continued engagement for the rebuilding of the country,” the statement said.The appeal came as Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi held two days of talks with Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar.The Chinese president “noted that the two sides should strengthen counterterrorism and security cooperation”, Xinhua reported.The two sides should maintain close strategic communication, further synergize development strategies and enhance the sharing of experience on governance, Xi Jinping said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-imran-khan-discuss-cpec-in-phone-call-101635250095042.html
26-10-2021||World||Who are Japan's Princess Mako and her husband, Kei Komuro?||Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, on Tuesday married her college sweetheart, a commoner named Kei Komuro, by submitting documents to register her marriage, after a long engagement marked by intense media scrutiny and opposition.The two, both 30, will move to New York, where Komuro works in a law office, although news reports say Mako will stay behind in Tokyo to make preparations, including applying for her first-ever passport.Following are some facts about Mako, who will now be known as Mako Komuro, gaining a surname for the first time in her life, and her new husband.MAKOBorn on October 23, 1991, Mako is the first child of the current emperor's younger brother, Prince Akishino, and his wife, Princess Kiko - who were college sweethearts, like Mako and Komuro.The birth of the first granddaughter to then-Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko was greeted by intense media coverage despite the fact that she could not, by law, inherit the throne. This included the proud father telling reporters after viewing his newborn daughter: "She's cute. She looks like me."Mako was followed three years later by her sister Kako, and the two were joined by their brother Hisahito in 2006, the first male born to the imperial family since 1965.Though Mako initially followed royal tradition and attended the elite Gakushuin school through the end of high school, she broke with custom by not continuing at the institution for her university studies, choosing instead to attend Tokyo's International Christian University.She graduated in 2014 with a degree in art and cultural studies, having spent a year abroad at the University of Edinburgh. She later obtained a master's degree in Art Museum and Gallery studies.Mako first met Komuro at a meeting of students planning to go abroad in 2012.Also Read | Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, finally marries college sweetheart after battling scandals and PTSDKEI KOMUROKomuro was raised by a single mother, with some media reports saying part of his education was funded by his mother's former fiance.At one point, he earned some money by working for tourism promotion near Tokyo.Trouble erupted a few months after he and Mako announced their engagement in 2017, when tabloids reported a financial dispute between Komuro's mother and her former fiance, with the man claiming mother and son had failed to repay a debt of about $35,000.Komuro later said the money had been a gift, not a loan. But in 2021, he submitted a 24-page explanation and later reportedly said he would pay a settlement.In September 2018, he left for studies at New York's Fordham University and didn't return until September this year, after having graduated from law school and started working at a New York law firm. He took the bar exam in July, with results due in December.When he returned to Japan, he was dressed casually and sporting long hair drawn back in a ponytail, setting off a media frenzy because it was deemed "disrespectful".But on Tuesday morning, ponytail shorn and dressed in a crisp dark suit and tie, he left to claim his bride. Most of his face was covered with a mask in line with Japan's coronavirus protocol, but he looked happy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-are-japan-s-princess-mako-and-her-husband-kei-komuro-101635249503347.html
26-10-2021||World||Former South Korean president Roh Tae-woo dies at 88||Former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, a major player in a 1979 coup who later became president in a landmark democratic election before ending his tumultuous political career in prison, died in hospital on Tuesday in the capital of Seoul. He was 88.Roh, who ruled South Korea as president from 1988-1993, died of complications from various illnesses after his condition worsened while dealing with a degenerative disorder, Kim Yon-su, head of Seoul National University Hospital, told a news conference.Roh was a key participant in the December 1979 military coup that made his army friend and coup leader Chun Doo-hwan president after their mentor, dictator Park Chung-hee, was assassinated following 18 years of rule.Roh led his army division into Seoul and joined other military leaders for operations to seize the capital. In the following year, the military under Chun and other coup leaders launched a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in the southern city of Gwangju, killing about 200 people, in one of the darkest moments in South Korea's turbulent modern history.Roh was Chun’s hand-picked successor, which would have assured him the presidency in an easy indirect election. But a massive pro-democracy uprising in 1987 forced Roh and Chun to accept a direct presidential election that was regarded as the start of South Korea’s transition to democracy.Despite his military background, Roh built a moderate and genial image during the campaign, calling himself an “average person.” He eventually won the hotly contested election in December 1987, largely thanks to a split in liberal votes between opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who both later became presidents.During his five-year term, Roh aggressively pursued ties with communist nations under his “Northward Diplomacy” as communism fell in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union dissolved.South Korea was then deeply anti-communist because of its rivalry with North Korea, but under Roh it opened diplomatic relations with a communist nation for the first time — Hungary in 1989, the year when the Berlin Wall fell and communism crumbled across Eastern Europe.Roh’s government established relations with the Soviet Union in 1990 and with China in 1992. Relations with North Korea improved under Roh, with the two sides holding their first-ever prime ministers’ talks, adopting a landmark joint statement on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and joining the United Nations at the same time.Earlier, Roh oversaw the hosting of the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the final Olympics of the Cold War era that showed how South Korea had rebuilt itself from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea boycotted the 1988 games.Ties between the two Koreas have since suffered ups and downs. Despite numerous denuclearization pledges — including one made during Roh’s presidency — North Korea still maintains its nuclear weapons program which it views as a means of survival.On domestic politics, Roh was seen by many as lacking charismatic and aggressive leadership. His nickname, “Mul (Water) Tae-woo,” implied his administration had no color and no taste. He still brought more openness by allowing more political criticism, in contrast with his authoritarian predecessors, Park and Chun. The governments led by Park and Chun often used security laws to suppress political opponents and restrict speech under the pretext of guarding against civil disorder and North Korean threats.After his successor, Kim Young-sam, investigated the coup and military-led crackdown, Roh was arrested, convicted of mutiny, treason and corruption and received a 22-year and six-month prison term. Chun was sentenced to death.The Supreme Court reduced those sentences to life imprisonment for Chun and 17 years for Roh. After spending about two years in prison, both Roh and Chun were released in late 1997 under a special pardon requested by then President-elect Kim Dae-jung, who sought national reconciliation amid an Asian financial crisis.Roh had stayed mostly out of the public eye following his release from prison, refraining from political activities and speeches. In recent years, he suffered prostate cancer, asthma, cerebellar atrophy and other health problems.Last April, his daughter, Roh So-young, wrote on Facebook that her father had been bed-bound over the past 10 years without being able to speak or move his body. She said her father sometimes made eye gestures for communications but looked to “have a tearful face” when he failed to express his feelings and thoughts properly.Roh’s son, Roh Jae-heon, repeatedly offered an apology over the 1980 crackdowns and visited a Gwangju cemetery to pay respects to the victims buried there on behalf of his bed-ridden father.But unlike Roh’s family, Chun, who reportedly suffers Alzheimer’s disease and a blood cancer, has yet to apologize over the crackdowns.Last August, Chun appeared at a Gwangju court to defend himself against charges that he defamed a now-deceased Catholic priest who had testified to seeing Chun’s troops shooting at protesters from helicopters in Gwangju. Chun left the court after 20 minutes, complaining of breathing problems. In his memoir, Chun called the priest “a shameless liar.”Both Roh and Chun were earlier ordered by a court to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars they collected illegally. Roh has paid back his shares but Chun hasn’t done so, according to South Korean media reports.Roh is survived by his wife and their two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-south-korean-president-roh-tae-woo-dies-at-88-101635247230348.html
26-10-2021||World||'Malicious slander': North Korea dismisses UN rights investigator report||A report this month by a United Nations rights investigator expressing concern about the human rights and humanitarian situation in North Korea is "malicious slander", a North Korean organisation said on Tuesday.In his latest report, Tomas Ojea Quintana, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said the country's most vulnerable people risk starvation after it slipped deeper into isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.Ojea Quintana said international sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme should be eased to provide more aid, but he also criticized abuses such as political prison camps and said self-imposed border lockdowns to prevent a Covid-19 outbreak had worsened conditions."The 'special rapporteur', not being content with distorting our reality, has pointed a finger at our 'people's livelihood' and viciously picked on the most realistic and appropriate anti-epidemic measures taken by our state for our own specific need in order to cope with the global epidemic," an unidentified spokesperson for the Korea Association for Human Rights Studies said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.The statement said North Korea does not recognise Ojea Quintana's mandate, and accused him of being part of a US-backed scheme to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries."Our state takes full responsibility for the life security and livelihood of our people, and we have never asked anyone to worry about the living conditions of our people," the statement said.Leader Kim Jong Un said in June the food situation was “tense” because of natural disasters last year, and acknowledged that citizens had faced sacrifices during the pandemic.North Korea has not reported any Covid-19 cases and has imposed strict anti-virus measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-malicious-slander-north-korea-dismisses-un-rights-investigator-report-101635241418069.html

26-10-2021||World||China re-imposes fresh lockdowns amid rising Covid-19 cases||China is re-imposing fresh lockdowns amid rising Covid-19 infections, the country recorded more than 100 cases across 11 provinces over the last week."Since October 17, there have been multiple scattered local outbreaks in China, and they're expanding rapidly," Mi Feng, a spokesman at the National Health Commission (NHC), said at a news conference Sunday. "There is an increasing risk that the outbreak will spread even further," reported CNN.The rapid spread comes despite about 75 per cent of China's population -- of more than a billion people -- being fully vaccinated, according to Mi.The spread of coronavirus infections worried the Chinese government, which insists on a strict zero-Covid policy to stamp out infections.The outbreak was first detected on October 16 among a tour group of fully vaccinated senior citizens from Shanghai who travelled in several northern regions. Among the 133 infections reported as of Sunday, 106 were linked to 13 tour groups, according to Mi, the NHC health official, reported CNN.Infections have been reported in nearly a third of the country's provinces and regions, with all medium- and high-risk regions concentrated in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Guizhou and Beijing.Authorities have banned travel agencies from organising cross-provincial tours in these regions.On Sunday, the Chinese capital tightened entry restrictions into the city, requiring travellers from places with confirmed cases to present a negative coronavirus test and undergo 14 days of health monitoring, reported CNN.The city has recorded 14 confirmed cases in the latest outbreak, including 12 over the past three days, according to a CNN tally of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission's daily reports.A widespread Covid outbreak in Beijing would be the last thing Chinese leaders want to see as the city gears up for the 2022 Winter Olympics in February.The Chinese authorities in Beijing are making an example of six residents who allegedly broke Covid rules with criminal detentions.Among them, two went out to eat and invited friends home for mahjong despite having developed fevers upon returning from a Covid-infected tourist destination in Inner Mongolia.

26-10-2021||World||Asia suffered hottest year on record in 2020: UN||Asia suffered its hottest year on record in 2020, the United Nations said Tuesday ahead of the COP26 summit, with extreme weather taking a heavy toll on the continent's development.In its annual "State of the Climate in Asia" report, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said every part of the region had been affected."Extreme weather and climate change impacts across Asia in 2020 caused the loss of life of thousands of people, displaced millions of others and cost hundreds of billions of dollars, while wreaking a heavy toll on infrastructure and ecosystems," the WMO said."Sustainable development is threatened, with food and water insecurity, health risks and environmental degradation on the rise."The report comes days before COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference being held in Glasgow from Sunday to November 12.The report also laid bare the total annual average losses due to climate-related hazards.China suffered an estimated $238 billion, followed by India at $87 billion, Japan with $83 billion and South Korea on $24 billion.But when the size of the economy is considered, the average annual losses are expected to be as high as 7.9 percent of gross domestic product for Tajikistan, 5.9 percent for Cambodia and 5.8 percent for Laos.Increased heat and humidity are forecast to lead to an effective loss of outdoor working hours across the continent, with a potential cost of many billions of dollars."Weather and climate hazards, especially floods, storms, and droughts, had significant impacts in many countries of the region," said WMO chief Petteri Taalas."Combined, these impacts take a significant toll on long-term sustainable development."Many weather and climate-related displacements in Asia are prolonged, with people unable to return home or integrate locally, the report said.In 2020 floods and storms affected approximately 50 million people in Asia, resulting in more than 5,000 fatalities.This is below the annual average of the last two decades (158 million people affected and about 15,500 fatalities) "and is testimony to the success of early warning systems in many countries in Asia", with around seven in 10 people covered.Asia's warmest year on record saw the mean temperature 1.39 degrees Celsius above the 1981-2010 average.The 38.0 C registered at Verkhoyansk in Russia is provisionally the highest known temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle.In 2020, average sea surface temperatures reached record high values in the Indian, Pacific and Arctic Oceans.Sea surface temperatures and ocean warming in and around Asia are increasing more than the global average.They have been warming at more than triple the average in the Arabian sea, and parts of the Arctic Ocean.Arctic sea ice minimum extent (after the summer melt) in 2020 was the second lowest on the satellite record since 1979.There are approximately 100,000 square kilometres of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas -- the largest volumes of ice outside the polar regions and the source of 10 major Asian rivers."Glacier retreat is accelerating and it is projected that glacier mass will decrease by 20 percent to 40 percent by 2050, affecting the lives and livelihoods of about 750 million people in the region," the report said."This has major ramifications for global sea level, regional water cycles and local hazards such as landslides and avalanches."A quarter of Asia's mangroves are in Bangladesh. However, the tropical storm-exposed country's mangroves decreased by 19 percent from 1992 to 2019, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-suffered-hottest-year-on-record-in-2020-un-101635227812120.html
26-10-2021||World||Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, finally marries college sweetheart after battling scandals and PTSD||Japan's Princess Mako, the emperor's niece, has married her commoner college sweetheart on Tuesday and left the royal family after a years-long engagement beset by the scrutiny that has left the princess with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Mako and fiance Kei Komuro, both 30, announced their engagement four years ago, a move initially cheered by the country. But things soon turned sour as tabloids reported on a money scandal involving Komuro's mother, prompting the press to turn on him. The marriage was postponed, and he left Japan for law studies in New York in 2018 only to return in September.Their marriage consisted of an official from the Imperial Household Agency (IHA), which runs the family's lives, submitting paperwork to a local office in the morning, foregoing the numerous rituals and ceremonies usual to royal weddings, including a reception.Mako also refused to receive a one-off payment of about $1.3 million typically made to royal women who marry commoners and become ordinary citizens, in line with Japanese law.Television footage showed Mako, wearing a pastel dress and pearls, saying goodbye to her parents and 26-year-old sister, Kako, at the entrance to their home. Though all wore masks in line with Japan's coronavirus protocol, her mother could be seen blinking rapidly, as if to fight off tears.Though Mako bowed formally to her parents, her sister grabbed her shoulders and the two shared a long embrace.In the afternoon, Mako and her new husband will hold a news conference, which will also depart from customs. While royals typically answer pre-submitted questions at such events, the couple will make a brief statement and hand out written replies to the questions instead."Some of the questions took mistaken information as fact and upset the princess," said officials at the IHA, according to NHK public television.Komuro, dressed in a crisp dark suit and tie, bowed briefly to camera crews gathered outside his home as he left in the morning but said nothing. His casual demeanour on returning to Japan, including long hair tied back in a ponytail, had sent tabloids into a frenzy.Money scandalJust months after the two announced their engagement at a news conference where their smiles won the hearts of the nation, tabloids reported a financial dispute between Komuro's mother and her former fiance, with the man claiming mother and son had not repaid a debt of about $35,000.The scandal spread to mainstream media after the IHA failed to provide a clear explanation. In 2021, Komuro issued a 24-page statement on the matter and also said he would pay a settlement.Public opinion polls show the Japanese are divided about marriage, and there has been at least one protest.Analysts say the problem is that the imperial family is so idealised that not the slightest hint of trouble with things such as money or politics should touch them.The fact that Mako's father and younger brother, Hisahito, are both in the line of succession after Emperor Naruhito, whose daughter is ineligible to inherit, makes the scandal particularly damaging, said Hideya Kawanishi, an associate professor of history at Nagoya University."Though it's true they'll both be private citizens, Mako's younger brother will one day become emperor, so some people thought anybody with the problems he (Komuro) had shouldn't be marrying her," Kawanishi added.The two will live in New York, though Mako will remain on her own in Tokyo for some time after the wedding to prepare for the move, including applying for the first passport of her life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-princess-mako-the-emperor-s-niece-finally-marries-college-sweetheart-after-battling-scandals-and-ptsd-101635226467986.html
26-10-2021||World||Covid-19: To travel to United States, get fully vaccinated||Indians planning to undertake air-travel to the United States starting November 8 are required to be fully vaccinated under a new protocol released by the Biden administration on Monday for all incoming non-citizen and non-immigrant international travellers.Children under-18 will be exempted as are participants in clinical trials, people with certain contraindications to the vaccine and those in need to travel in emergency or for humanitarian reason, which will have to be certified by the US government. They will still have to undergo tests for Covid-19, except children below 2.The onus for implementing the new travel rules, which were announced earlier but are now been operationalised, will be on airlines bringing travellers to the United States, much in the same fashion as the mandatory testing requirement they have been enforcing.“We’re taking an important step forward in operationalising this new system as it relates to international air travel by releasing a series of documents that will help airlines and travellers get ready for November 8 and ensure a smooth transition to the new system,” a senior Biden administration official said to reporters previewing the regulation.The United States is a popular destination for international travellers for business, tourism, studies, medical and other reasons. It got nearly 80 million international visitors in 2019, the year before Covid-19 shut down international travel to and from the United States, barring exceptions episodically.According to the latest data available 1.2 million Indians visited the US in 2017, which was 6.5% more than in 2016.Travellers to the US are currently required to provide a current negative test result for Covid-19 before they are allowed to board the flight.Under the new protocol, airlines will required travellers to furnish proof of vaccination issued by an official source - for example, the fact sheet said public health agency, government agency - in the country where the vaccine was given.All travellers - US citizens, non-citizens, immigrants and non-immigrants - will also be required to produce a negative test for Covid-19, done in the past 24 hours. The airlines will only accept WHO-approved vaccines. “Individuals can be considered fully vaccinated ≥2 weeks (more than two weeks) after receipt of the last dose if they have received any single dose of an FDA approved/authorised or WHO EUL (emergency use listing) approved single-dose series (i.e., Janssen), or any combination of two doses of an FDA-approved/authorised or WHO emergency use listed Covid-19 two-dose series (i.e. mixing and matching),” the White House said.WHO recognises 10 vaccines. One of them is the Serum Institute of India’s Covidshield, which is the widely administered Indian version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine that the US has not approved but pre-ordered million of doses for its stockpile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-to-travel-to-united-states-get-fully-vaccinated-101635221413278.html
26-10-2021||World||Sudan coup generals determined not to lose long-held power, say analysts||By ousting senior civilian figures and disrupting a transition to democracy, Sudan's generals have ensured they maintain control in the East African country, as they have for most of its post-independence history, analysts say.On Monday security forces detained civilian leaders, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who have shared power with the military following the ouster of the autocratic president Field Marshal Omar al-Bashir more than two years ago.General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared a state of emergency and dissolved the cabinet, as well as the ruling Sovereign Council of military and civilian figures which he has led since August 2019.The Council was supposed to pave the way for full civilian rule.Since its independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956, Sudan has experienced rare democratic interludes, but overwhelmingly years of rule under military leaders.The latest putsch "looks very much like an attempt by the security forces to maintain control over economic and political interests, and to resist the flip" to a civilian order, said Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group.The army's move "epitomises their fears" of civilian rule "in a country which was under the control of the military for 52 out of its 65 years of independence," Horner said.To Magdi el-Gizouli of the Rift Valley Institute "the coup was far from surprising".The Sovereign Council ruled the country alongside a transitional government led by Hamdok, an economist, but the role of civilian leaders had been receding.The main civilian bloc, the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) which led anti-Bashir protests, splintered into two opposing factions, one of which held demonstrations in support of the military.- An 'engineered' crisis - Critics alleged those protests were being driven by members of the military and security forces, and involved counter-revolutionary sympathisers with the former regime."The crisis at hand is engineered -- and is in the shape of a creeping coup," mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman said two days before the military made its move.Last month the government said it had thwarted a coup attempt, and Burhan dismissed as "slander" suggestions that the army was involved in that manoeuvre.Ahmed Soliman, an analyst from Britain's Chatham House think-tank, told AFP the military has resisted significant reforms including "professionalisation and civilian oversight" of its institutions, as well as its business interests.The military dominates lucrative companies specialising in everything from agriculture to infrastructure projects.Hamdok said last year that 80 percent of the country's public resources were "outside the finance ministry's control", although he did not specify the proportion controlled by the army.Such "really critical issues in the transition have fuelled very recent turmoil that is taking place in Sudan and perhaps set the stage for this hostile takeover by the military," Soliman said.The military's actions are likely to lead to more instability, he added, so "apart from securing their own interests" it is difficult to know what the officers are trying to achieve, Soliman added.Protests against the coup have already led to three deaths on Monday, and there will be "heavy civilian resistance", Gizouli said."The military will have little option but to crush it by force," he said.Gizouli believes Burhan will remain in power for the foreseeable future but might talk with civilian leaders who remain free, like Foreign Minister Mariam al-Mahdi."He still needs a civilian face for the government," Gizouli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-coup-generals-determined-not-to-lose-long-held-power-say-analysts-101635218228247.html
26-10-2021||World||US announces new Covid-19 international air travel rules||The Biden administration on Monday (local time) announced new Covid-19 international air travel rules starting from November 8.Starting on November 8, foreign national air travellers to the United States will be required to be fully vaccinated and to provide proof of vaccination status prior to boarding an airplane to fly to the United States, with only limited exceptions, read US Department of State release.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that for the purposes of entry into the United States, vaccines accepted will include those US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or authorized, as well as vaccines with an emergency use listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO) that includes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.As per the guidelines mixing and matching of approved shots will be permitted.Fully vaccinated air travellers will continue to be required to show documentation of a pre-departure negative viral test from a sample taken within three days of travel to the United States before boarding. That includes all travellers - US citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPRs), and foreign nationals.To further strengthen protections, unvaccinated travellers - whether US citizens, LPRs, or the small number of excepted unvaccinated foreign nationals - will now need to show documentation of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of travel to the United States, read the release.The travel advisory by the US Department of State also said that both US citizens and foreign nationals who are fully vaccinated should travel with proof of their vaccination status to provide to their airline prior to departure to the United States.That proof of vaccination should be a paper or digital record issued by an official source and should include the traveller's name and date of birth, as well as the vaccine product and date(s) of administration for all doses the traveller received, added the advisory.While vaccination proof is not required for US citizens and LPRs, fully vaccinated US citizens and LPRs (and their dependents) will continue to be able to show documentation of a negative viral test from a sample taken up to three days before departure to the United States. They must present proof of vaccination to qualify for the three-day test window. US citizens and LPRs who are unable to show that they are fully vaccinated will have to show documentation of a negative viral test taken no more than one day before departure.However, children under 18 are exempted from the vaccination requirement for foreign national travellers, given both the ineligibility of some younger children for vaccination, as well as the global variability in access to vaccination for older children who are eligible to be vaccinated, said the advisory.Regarding testing requirements for children, the advisory added that children between the ages of 2 and 17 are required to take a pre-departure test.If a child is not fully vaccinated and traveling with a fully vaccinated adult, they can show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within three days before departure (consistent with the timeline for fully vaccinated adults).If an unvaccinated child is traveling alone or with unvaccinated adults, they will have to show proof of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of departure.While children under 2 years of age are excepted from the testing requirement, CDC recommends a pre-departure test for these children whenever possible.The test must be administered no more than three calendar days before the date of the international flight to the United States.This new global travel system replaces the existing country-by-country restrictions, putting in place a consistent approach worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-new-covid-19-international-air-travel-rules-101635216774188.html
26-10-2021||World||Facebook removes Jair Bolsonaro video linking Covid-19 shots to AIDS||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro found himself in social media time-out Monday after his video warning of a supposed link between Covid-19 vaccines and AIDS triggered action by Facebook and YouTube.Facebook removed the offending video, while YouTube went further, suspending the far-right leader for one week in addition to blocking the clip."We removed a video from Jair Bolsonaro's channel for violating our medical disinformation policies on Covid-19 by claiming that vaccines do not reduce the risk of contracting the disease and that they cause other infectious diseases," YouTube said in a statement sent to AFP.Bolsonaro's latest run-in with social media networks including Facebook, on which he heavily relies to rally his base, came after he cited purported "official reports" from the British government -- since debunked -- in his weekly live address on Facebook last Thursday.He claimed the reports "suggest that people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 are developing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome much faster than expected.""I recommend you read the article," he added, without saying where the information came from."I'm not going to read it here, because I don't want to lose my Facebook live video."Facebook, which took down the comments late Sunday or early Monday, has removed Bolsonaro posts in the past.Earlier, it found he spread misinformation or incited people to violate social distancing policies. But this is the first time it has taken down one of his weekly live addresses, a cornerstone of his communications.Bolsonaro has violated YouTube standards once before as well, and the company said the president will not be able to post new videos or do live broadcasts for seven days.The rest of his videos on the channel, where he has 3.5 million subscribers, will remain accessible.The British government denied any such "reports" cited by Bolsonaro, in response to an AFP fact-checking team.The Brazilian Society of Infectious Disease Specialists said in a statement there was no evidence of any relationship between Covid-19 vaccines and AIDS.Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The president has said he does not plan to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and joked in the past the vaccine could "turn you into an alligator."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-jair-bolsonaro-video-linking-covid-19-shots-to-aids-101635214124888.html

AWS declined to comment on the report.In February, Britain's cyber spies at the GCHQ eavesdropping agency said they had fully embraced artificial intelligence to uncover patterns in vast amounts of global data to counter hostile disinformation and snare child abusers.GCHQ has been using basic forms of AI such as translation technology for years but is now stepping up its use, partly in response to the use of AI by hostile states and partly due to the data explosion that makes it effective.Earlier on Monday, GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming told a conference the number of ransomware attacks had doubled across the UK in 2021, compared with last year, according to the FT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-signs-deal-with-uk-spy-agencies-to-boost-use-of-ai-for-espionage-report-101635211901156.html
26-10-2021||World||Australia announces climate plan, aims to zero out carbon emissions by 2050||Australia, one of the world’s top per-capita polluters, finally agreed to a plan to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the target days before he is scheduled to head to Europe for G-20 talks and then the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It follows a new round of fractious domestic debate on climate policy, an issue that’s riven Australia’s politics for more than a decade and comes after pressure from allies including the U.S. on Australia to show more urgency in action to limit global warming. “We will set a target to achieve net-zero by 2050, and have a clear plan for achieving it,” Morrison said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “We won’t be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It’s about getting it done.”The government will stick with 2030 goals that have been criticized by activists and business leaders alike as too weak, adding to the sense that timid pledges from developed nations are stifling prospects for major progress at the climate talks. Morrison on Tuesday reiterated that Australia was on track to “meet and beat” its target and that he would provide an update on progress in Glasgow.Australia is one of the top suppliers of fossil fuels, and the sector accounts for almost a quarter of its export earnings. The nation is being looked at to help show leadership that’ll encourage developing countries to step up their efforts. Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, on Saturday pledged to a goal to hit net zero by 2060.Morrison has frequently ruled out taxes for polluters, and backed the country’s top emitters to devise the best solutions to help Australia hit net zero. His government also hasn’t ruled out subsidizing new coal-fired power stations, with the fuel still responsible for the bulk of the nation’s electricity generation.That’s a blow for COP President Alok Sharma, who has struggled to win momentum for his ambition to “consign coal to history.” Nations like Australia and China, which are lifting coal output to ease an energy crisis, have resisted calls to more quickly phase out their own consumption of fuel. While every Australian state and territory -- and key trading partners China, Japan, and South Korea -- have committed to net-zero emissions, a national target is politically complicated for Morrison, who must hold elections by May and trails the main Labor opposition in opinion polls. Lawmakers within the National Party, the junior member of Australia’s governing coalition, have raised concerns over the threat to rural jobs, particularly in coal-mining communities, from an energy transition and demanded a series of concessions in return for their support. The Australian newspaper reported that the Nationals had received a guarantee that the government would take no action to pursue a methane target. The U.S. and the European Union have been seeking to use COP26 to announce that at least 35 countries joined a global pact to cut methane emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-announces-climate-plan-aims-to-zero-out-carbon-emissions-by-2050-101635211311352.html

According to the Dawn newspaper, Khan said that India and Pakistan had only one issue--the Kashmir issue--and urged for resolving it like "civilised neighbours”."We have excellent relations with China, but if somehow we improve our relationship with India - I know after last night's thrashing by the Pakistan team in the cricket match, it's not a very good time to talk about improving relations with India," he said while addressing the Pakistan-Saudi Investment Forum in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.Imran Khan’s comments came a day after Pakistan defeated India by 10 wickets in the ongoing T20 World Cup on Sunday.Also read | Will rather talk to people of Kashmir than Pakistan: Amit Shah"It's all about human rights and the rights of the people of Kashmir for self-determination as guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council 72 years ago.

The majority of the mall has been cleared but police were still looking for any additional victims.Police didn't release any other information, saying the investigation was ongoing.Police are asking people to avoid the area. Police also said they were notifying the families of those involved.The Boise Towne Square shopping mall is located in Idaho’s largest city and is the city’s largest mall.Police were interviewing dozens of people outside the entrance to Macy's, one of five large department stores at the mall that has 153 stores in all.Police are also investigating what appears to be another crime scene at a restaurant near the mall.Cheri Gypin, of Boise, was in the mall with a friend where they walk for an hour three or four times a week. She said she heard several large bangs, but thought something had fallen from the ceiling. Then about 60 people, including families pushing strollers, came running at them, some of them shouting that there was an active shooter.“My friend was trying to process it,” said Gypin, 60. “I just looked at her and said, 'We've got to run.' So we just ran and kept running until we got to the outer perimeter of the parking lot.”They made their way back to their car, where police told the crowd of people who had fled the mall to leave the parking area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-die-4-injured-in-idaho-mall-shooting-police-101635204790357.html
26-10-2021||World||Facebook invests billions in metaverse efforts as ad business slows||Facebook Inc said on Monday it will start breaking out the financials for its virtual and augmented reality unit, an announcement that comes as its main advertising businesses face "significant uncertainty."Facebook warned that Apple Inc's new privacy rules would weigh on its digital business in the current quarter, after the social media company reported quarterly revenue below market expectations.Chief Financial Officer David Wehner also said Facebook expected its investment in its hardware division, Facebook Reality Labs, to reduce overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion.The financial commitment by the world's largest social media company to building the "metaverse" https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sets-up-new-team-work-metaverse-2021-07-26 comes as the company is swamped by coverage of documents leaked by former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. Facebook has said Haugen mischaracterized its work.Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has said Facebook in the coming years will be seen as metaverse company rather than a social media company, as it makes a number of investments to expand the technology.The metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades earlier, has attracted much buzz across Silicon Valley. It refers broadly to a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR)and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, this year created a product team to work on the metaverse. This month, it said it plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on this initiative.Wehner said that starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, it would break out FRL as a separate reporting segment from Facebook's family of apps.Shares of the company were trading up about 2% at $336 in extended trading on Monday. Facebook, whose shares have gained about 20% so far this year, is about $85 billion away from regaining a spot on the $1 trillion club and joining new entrant Tesla Inc.The world's largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.The whistleblower documents, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have intensified scrutiny on the company. They include internal research and reports about Instagram's effects on the mental health of teens and about whether its platforms stoke divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in the company's content moderation for users around the globe.Reuters on Monday reported that Facebook employees have warned the company was failing to police rule-breaking content in countries where it was likely to cause the most harm, according to former employees and the cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Haugen.Facebook said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Analysts had forecast $34.84 billion in revenue, or a 24.1% jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Its third-quarter revenue too faced the brunt of Apple's privacy rules that made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook.Daily active users, a metric watched closely by advertisers and investors, grew 6% to 1.93 billion from a year ago, matching expectations.The company's total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose to $29.01 billion in the third quarter from $21.47 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' estimates of $29.57 billion.Facebook said it repurchased $14.37 billion in stock during the third quarter and announced an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.The company did not announce any new name as part of an expected rebranding effort. In response to the Verge's report last week on its name-change plans, Facebook said it does not comment on "rumor or speculation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-invests-billions-in-metaverse-efforts-as-ad-business-slows-101635197360742.html
26-10-2021||World||Taliban officials celebrate cricket win but Kabul streets subdued||Taliban officials took to social media on Monday to congratulate the Afghan national cricket team for winning a match in the Twenty20 World Cup, but there was a muted response on the streets of Kabul where such wins were celebrated enthusiastically in the past.Afghanistan beat Scotland in a match played in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates - the first major victory for the team since the Taliban takeover of the country.While the Taliban frown on many forms of public entertainment, cricket has always been an exception, a game fighters followed closely even during the war whenever the national team was playing."Congratulations to the team and wish them more success in the future," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter.A spokesman for the Taliban's Qatar office also joined in the praise, adding: "We hope for similar and even higher achievements in other fields, especially in the political, economic and scientific fields."The highest profile message came from Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of Afghanistan's current acting Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani - the head of the Haqqani Network."Afghanistan won," the younger Haqqani said.The Taliban's representative-designate to the United Nations Suhail Shaheen tweeted: "Well done boys!"However, there was relative silence across Kabul, where such victories were previously met with jubilation in the streets, fireworks and celebratory gunfire. There were only a few, small fireworks seen in the Kabul sky.The streets were mostly empty or silent.The Taliban's foes also saw the victory as significant for the country. Amrullah Saleh, the ex-vice president who became one of the leaders of the anti-Taliban forces after the fall of Kabul, pointed out on Twitter that the cricket team had sung a national anthem and raised a flag which are not recongnised by the Taliban.President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country in August, said the victory had "installed new hopes in the hearts of all that this nation is alive and no one can hold it hostage!"Despite years of violence and upheaval, Afghanistan has an enthusiastic and widespread following of cricket and residents of Kabul were eagerly anticipating the cricket world cup matches.The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) will meet next month to determine the game's future in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-officials-celebrate-cricket-win-but-kabul-streets-subdued-101635197787142.html
26-10-2021||World||New York City police union files lawsuit to block vaccine mandate||New York City's police union filed a lawsuit on Monday against a vaccine mandate for municipal workers ordered last week by Mayor Bill de Blasio.The mayor on Wednesday ordered all city employees to show proof of inoculation against Covid-19 or be placed on unpaid leave, drawing the union's ire.The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York said on Twitter that it had filed a suit in the state Supreme Court. It asked the court for a temporary restraining order to halt the mandate while the suit remains pending.The union added on Twitter that there was "still no written, NYPD-specific policy guidance on how the mandate will be implemented."The mayor set a deadline of 5 p.m. this coming Friday for employees to show proof of inoculation to a supervisor. Over 70% of all 160,000 New York City workers, including a similar percentage in the police department, have already received at least one dose, the mayor said.Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association representing the city's 50,000 active and retired officers, said they should have the opportunity to choose whether to get the vaccine.De Blasio cited overtime and redeployments as contingency plans should a large contingent of those officers and other unvaccinated city workers refuse to comply with the mandate.Municipalities, school districts and other jurisdictions throughout the country are grappling with masking and vaccination requirements. The number of new Covid-19 cases has steadily declined in the United States since a surge caused by the Delta variant of the virus during the summer.De Blasio had said employees will no longer have the option to be regularly tested instead of getting the vaccine, but added the city will still grant medical and religious exemptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-police-union-files-lawsuit-to-block-vaccine-mandate-101635197932645.html
26-10-2021||World||Seven killed, 140 injured in protests following coup in Sudan: Official||Sudan's military seized power from a transitional government on Monday and a health ministry official said seven people were killed by gunfire and 140 injured in clashes between soldiers and street protesters.The leader of the takeover, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the military-civilian Sovereign Council that had been established to guide the country to democracy following the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising two years ago.Burhan announced a state of emergency, saying the armed forces needed to protect safety and security. He promised to hold elections in July 2023 and hand over to an elected civilian government then."What the country is going through now is a real threat and danger to the dreams of the youth and the hopes of the nation," he said.The Sudan information ministry, which is still loyal to ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, said on its Facebook page that the transitional constitution gives only the prime minister the right to declare a state of emergency and that the military's actions are a crime. Hamdok is still the legitimate transitional authority, it said.The UN Security Council was likely to discuss Sudan behind closed doors on Tuesday, diplomats said.White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said: "We reject the actions by the military and call for the immediate release of the prime minister and others who have been placed under house arrest."Youths opposed to the coup barricaded streets and clashed with troops. The main opposition coalition, Forces of Freedom and Change, which pushed for Bashir's removal and negotiated the military-civilian council, said on Twitter it was calling for peaceful actions in the streets to overthrow the military takeover, including demonstrations, the blocking of streets and civil disobedience.Hamdok, an economist and former senior UN official, was detained and taken to an undisclosed location after refusing to issue a statement in support of the takeover, the information ministry said.The ministry urged resistance and said tens of thousands of people opposed to the takeover had taken to the streets and had faced gunfire near the military headquarters in Khartoum. Central bank employees announced a strike to reject the coup, the ministry said.Troops had arrested civilian members of the Sovereign Council and government figures, the ministry said. Also detained was the news director of state TV, his family said.The US State Department said Washington had nothing to share on Hamdok's whereabouts and condition. A department spokesman said it was pausing $700 million in economic support for Sudan.In Khartoum's twin city Omdurman, protesters barricaded streets and chanted in support of civilian rule."Burhan cannot deceive us. This is a military coup," said a young man who gave his name as Saleh.'RAISE OUR VOICES'Sudan has been ruled for most of its post-colonial history by military leaders who seized power in coups. It had become a pariah to the West and was on a US terrorism list under Bashir, who hosted Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for war crimes.The country had been on edge since last month when a failed coup plot, blamed on Bashir supporters, unleashed recriminations between the military and civilians.In recent weeks a coalition of rebel groups and political parties aligned themselves with the military and called on it to dissolve the civilian government, while Cabinet ministers took part in protests against the prospect of military rule.Sudan is also in an economic crisis. Helped by foreign aid, civilian officials have claimed credit for some tentative signs of stabilisation after a sharp devaluation of the currency and the lifting of fuel subsidies.Washington had tried to avert the collapse of the power-sharing agreement by sending a special envoy, Jeffrey Feltman. The director of Hamdok's office, Adam Hereika, told Reuters the military had mounted the takeover despite "positive movements" towards an agreement after meetings with Feltman in recent days.The military had been meant to pass on leadership of the Sovereign Council to a civilian figure in the coming months. But transitional authorities had struggled to move forward on issues including whether to hand Bashir over to the Hague.Burhan said it was incumbent on the armed forces to act to halt "incitement to chaos and violence".The United Nations, Arab League and African Union all expressed concern. Political leaders should be released and human rights respected, AU Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said in a statement.Britain called the coup an unacceptable betrayal of the Sudanese people. France called for the immediate release of Hamdok and other civilian leaders. Egypt called on all parties to exercise self-restraint.The Sudanese Professionals Association, an activist coalition in the uprising against Bashir, called for a strike.Two main political parties, the Umma and the Sudanese Congress, condemned what they called a coup and campaign of arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-killed-140-injured-in-protests-following-coup-in-sudan-official-101635197952071.html
26-10-2021||World||Sudanese protest into night after general ousts government in coup||Sudanese denouncing a military coup protested into the night Monday after troops rounded up civilian leaders, defying the soldiers who had earlier killed three people when they opened fire, according to medics.The military move by Sudan's top general to declare a state of emergency and dissolve government -- one of several such takeovers in Africa this year -- sparked swift international condemnation.The UN demanded the "immediate release" of the prime minister, while the US suspended aid and urged restoration of a civilian government.General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan's announcement in a televised address came after the armed forces detained government leaders that have been heading the transition to full civilian rule following the April 2019 ouster of autocrat Omar al-Bashir, in one of the world's least developed countries."To rectify the revolution's course, we have decided to declare a state of emergency nationwide... dissolve the transitional sovereign council, and dissolve the cabinet," said Burhan.Clashes erupted in the capital Khartoum after his speech, with the information ministry saying that soldiers had "fired live bullets on protesters rejecting the military coup outside the army headquarters."Three protesters were killed and about 80 people wounded when soldiers opened fire, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudan Doctors.Burning barricades"Civilian rule is the people's choice," demonstrators chanted.Protesters waved flags and used rocks and tyres to create burning barricades, calling: "No to military rule".The violence, largely centred outside the army headquarters in Khartoum, came after soldiers detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, ministers in his government and civilian members of Sudan's ruling council, the information ministry said.Internet services were cut across the country and roads into Khartoum shut, before soldiers stormed the headquarters of Sudan's state broadcaster in the capital's twin city of Omdurman, the information ministry said.The power grab by the army was condemned by the international community, including United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who criticised the "unlawful detention" of Hamdok and other leaders."The Secretary-General strongly condemns the ongoing military coup d'etat in Khartoum and all actions that could jeopardize Sudan's political transition and stability," Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.The European Union, African Union and Arab League also expressed concern, while the United States, which has been a key supporter of Sudan's transition, said it had suspended $700 million in aid."The civilian-led transitional government should be immediately restored," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. He added that Washington had not been able to make contact with the detained prime minister.'Existential moment'Under a 2019 power-sharing deal after the ouster of Bashir, Sudan was ruled by a Sovereign Council of civilian and military representatives tasked with overseeing a transition to a full civilian government.But in recent weeks the cracks in the leadership had grown wide.Hamdok had previously described splits in the transitional government as the "worst and most dangerous crisis" facing the transition.Jonas Horner, from the International Crisis Group think-tank, called it an "existential moment for both sides"."This kind of intervention... really puts autocracy back on the menu," he warned.Bashir, who ruled Sudan with an iron fist for three decades, is in jail in Khartoum following a conviction for corruption.He is wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of genocide during civil war in Darfur.But UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned Sudan risked returning to oppression."It would be disastrous if Sudan goes backwards after finally bringing an end to decades of repressive dictatorship," Bachelet said.Protest callsIn recent days rival protests were held. Sit-ins outside the presidential palace demanded a return to "military rule", and in response, tens of thousands marched to back the full transfer of power to civilians.The two sides represent opposing factions of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), the civilian umbrella group which spearheaded demonstrations that led to the army's overthrow of Bashir.Tensions between the two sides have long simmered, but divisions ratcheted up after what the government said was a failed coup on September 21 this year.The developments come two days after the mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman warned of a "creeping coup", at a news conference in Khartoum that was attacked by an unidentified mob.On Monday, the mainstream FFC appealed for nationwide "civil disobedience".Protesters were seen marching through the streets of Khartoum carrying the Sudanese flag."We will not accept military rule, and we are ready to give our lives for the democratic transition in Sudan," said one demonstrator, Haitham Mohamed."We will not leave the streets until the civilian government is back," Sawsan Bashir, another protester, told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudanese-protest-into-night-after-general-ousts-government-in-coup-101635196163659.html

Preliminary results showed vaccinated children developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said.Data from clinical trials with more than 4,700 children in the age range “demonstrate strong immune response... one month after the second dose,” Moderna said. It added that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain.China delays marathon, brings back restrictionsChina on Monday indefinitely postponed the annual Beijing marathon scheduled to be held later this month as it fights a country-wide surge in Covid-19 cases including in the capital.Beijing authorities also restricted entry to the city on Monday, and sent out directives asking citizens not to leave unless necessary.“The epidemic situation is severe and complex, and the epidemic risk and prevention pressure faced by the capital continue to increase,” a Beijing official said on Monday.Organisers of Beijing’s marathon said in a statement on Sunday that the run would be postponed until further notice “…in order to prevent the risk of the epidemic spreading.More than 30,000 people were expected to take part in the event on October 31.The China-Mongolia border city of Ejin Banner, a region hit hard in the latest coronavirus flare-up, told all residents and tourists on Monday that they must stay indoors to prevent the spread of the outbreak.

26-10-2021||World||‘FB algorithms designed to push divisive content’||Facebook will fuel more episodes of violent unrest around the world because of the way its algorithms are designed to promote divisive content, whistleblower Frances Haugen told the British parliament on Monday.Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team, was appearing before a parliamentary select committee in Britain that is examining plans to regulate social media companies.She said the social network saw safety as a cost centre, lionised a start-up culture where cutting corners was a good thing and said it was “unquestionably” making hate worse.“The events we’re seeing around the world, things like Myanmar and Ethiopia, those are the opening chapters because engagement-based ranking does two things: one, it prioritises and amplifies divisive and polarising extreme content and two it concentrates it,” she said.She said the algorithms pushed users towards the extreme. “So someone centre left, they’ll be pushed to radical left, someone centre right will be pushed to radical right,” she said.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hit back against Haugen’s accusations, saying earlier this month: “The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical.”Reuters, along with other news organisations, viewed documents released to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Haugen.They showed Facebook had known that it hadn’t hired enough workers who possessed both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries.Frances Haugen told UK lawmakers there is a narrowing opportunity to regulate companies that rely on artificial intelligence. “We have a slight window of time to regain people control over AI, we have to take advantage of this moment,” she said. “Right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fb-algorithms-designed-to-push-divisive-content-101635191421044.html
26-10-2021||World||Developed nations fail to meet climate fund target||The chances of the important COP26 climate summit starting in Glasgow later this month succeeding took a hit with rich countries announcing on Monday that they will miss by three years their promise of $100 billion a year as funding to developing and poor countries to help manage the climate crisis.The highly anticipated climate finance delivery plan released on Monday, produced by the minister of environment and climate change for Canada, Jonathan Wilkinson and the state secretary, federal ministry for the environment, Germany, Jochen Flasbarth, said developed countries will likely be able to mobilise $100 billion a year only in 2023, a delay of three years from the 2020 deadline originally promised.COP26 President, Alok Sharma had invited the ministers to draft this climate finance delivery plan in July to gain the trust of developing countries on the funding.The announced plan delivery plan could be detrimental to the success of the summit as it may further erode the trust of developing countries such as India, which have been highlighting the lack of equity and justice in climate negotiations.There was hope that the developed countries would agree to make good the shortfall in funding in initial years in later years, so as to reach an average of $100 billion a year in the five years to 2025, but that was not to be. Sharma said that it was “highly likely” that the funding would achieve that, but this found no mention in the plan that was released.Flasbarth, who said he was “disappointed”, added that “there is a lot of money already on the table” and that it would “increase”.In 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, developed countries committed to a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. They specified that the finance would come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral, and multilateral, including alternative ones. The climate finance goal was formalised at COP16 in Cancun.Separately, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change also released an updated analysis of nationally determined contributions submitted by 143 countries as on October 12 on Monday which suggested that overall there is likely to be a 16% increase in global GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 2010.Comparison to the latest findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that such an increase, unless changed immediately, is likely to cause a temperature rise of about 2.7°C by the end of the century.But the information submitted also confirms that the updated or new climate action plans can be effective in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over time.“This latest report from the UNFCCC makes clear, to protect the world from the most devastating impacts of climate change, countries must take more ambitious action on emissions, and they must act now,” said COP26 president Alok Sharma. “That is why we especially need the biggest emitters, the G20 nations, to come forward with stronger commitments.”“Developing countries are being asked to wait till 2023 for climate finance that was promised in 2009. The document provides no plan to increase urgently needed adaptation finance. Much of the shortfall in climate finance comes from the US , the largest economy and largest historical emitter,” said Ulka Kelkar, economist and director, climate programme at World Resources Institute.COP26 ‘might go wrong’, warns UK PM JohnsonBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said he was “very worried” that the 12-day COP26 climate summit he will host in Glasgow from later this week “might go wrong”.But the UK leader told a special Downing Street press conference with children that he remained hopeful a deal can be done to reduce carbon emissions and limit future temperature rises. “I’m very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it’s touch and go,” Johnson said.“Once again, rich nations have failed to show commitment to provide finance to developing countries for climate action. They need to walk the talk. The delay in delivering the promised USD 100 billion a year of climate finance violates human rights of those who are already facing climate induced loss and damage, due to decades of inaction of rich countries. It is unfair to continue exerting pressure on developing economies to raise ambition on emission reduction, when developed nations are unable to find money that is so critical to support greener and resilient future of current and future generations," said Harjeet Singh, senior adviser, Climate Action Network International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developed-nations-fail-to-meet-climate-fund-target-101635191120579.html
