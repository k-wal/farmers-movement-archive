He made the announcement on the sidelines of the UN’s COP15 summit on biodiversity protection, in the city of Kunming.“China will take the lead and contribute 1.5 billion yuan to set up the Kunming Biodiversity Fund to support biodiversity development of developing countries,” Xi Jinping said, making the remarks while addressing the 15th meeting of the UN-led Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity - also known as COP15 - via video link from Beijing.The UN summit is being attended by scientists, conservationists as well as diplomats where the focus is on forging a global agreement to protect the world’s increasingly fragile biodiversity and prevent the extinction of plants and animals.“Developing countries need help and support and solidarity must be strengthened to allow developing countries to benefit in a fairer way,” Xi Jinping said.Experts say China’s efforts to conserve biodiversity at home have not been matched by efforts to clean up its global supply chains or embark on sustainable investments overseas.Li Shuo, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace China, said the new fund announced at the COP15 summit “should jump-start an urgently needed conversation on biodiversity finance”.“COP15 needs to see donor countries from the developed world contributing in this regard,” Li told Reuters.Other leaders who spoke at the UN conference on Tuesday included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.News agency Xinhua quoted Xi Jinping’s pledge to accelerate the development of solar power in China. “[We will] step up our efforts in the development of renewable energy, and accelerate the planning of large-scale photovoltaic and wind power projects in [our] deserts and nearby areas,” he said.“Phase one of these projects with a combined installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts will begin construction soon in an orderly manner,” the Chinese president added.Xi also announced a plan to consolidate a national parks system in China, the first batch of which would bring a land area of 230,000 sq km under protection.“This area is home to nearly 30% of the key terrestrial wildlife species found in the country,” Xi was quoted as saying.Xi Jinping’s pledges come in the backdrop of China’s worst energy shortages in recent years, following which the government, according to reports, ordered the country’s coal mines to boost output.Widespread power cuts since last month have forced many factories to cut production or stop operations completely. One reason for the power crisis, experts have said, is China’s carbon emission goals - peak emission by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.In his speech on Tuesday, Xi said that to achieve its carbon peak and neutrality targets, China will release implementation plans for peaking carbon dioxide emissions in key areas and sectors as well as a series of supporting measures.China will continue to readjust its industrial structure and energy mix and vigorously develop renewable energy, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop15-xi-jinping-announces-233-million-biodiversity-protection-fund-at-un-meet-101634061080875.html
12-10-2021||World||Biden administration launches new initiative to counter climate crisis||The Biden administration is launching a new government initiative to deliver accessible and actionable information to individuals and communities that are being hit by flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme heat, coastal erosion, and other intensifying climate impacts, the White House said on Tuesday.According to the White House statement, administration officials announced a launch of a redesigned Climate.gov by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the accessibility of accurate and timely climate information.The other announcement includes the "release of two new reports delivered to the National Climate Task Force outlining the ways the federal government will improve access to climate tools and services," the statement said, adding "the initiation of a process by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assess the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) standards to help communities align their construction and land-use practices with the latest understandings of flood risk reduction."The Biden administration also announced the new-and-improved Climate Website. NOAA's Climate Program Office launched a newly redesigned version of Climate.gov, NOAA's award-winning, flagship website that provides the public with clear, timely, and science-based information about climate.Climate.gov also provides access to commonly requested climate data and tools hosted by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.The administration further announced interagency reports on climate information services.President Joe Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, agencies have developed two reports to the National Climate Task Force on climate information services to help governments, communities, and businesses prepare for and adapt to climate impacts.The first report, titled "Opportunities for Expanding and Improving Climate Information and Services for the Public," charts a course for expanding accessibility and use of the federal government's climate information to support all communities, including those who have been historically underserved, on climate planning and resilience activities, the statement said.According to the statement, the report lays out priority opportunities to focus climate services on the challenges that pose the greatest risks and opportunities to society; Foster interagency coordination and strategic public-private partnerships to develop, deliver, and continually advance climate services; Enhance the usability, translation, and relevance of climate services to support use by all Americans; and Strengthen core science capabilities needed to expand and improve climate services.The second report, titled "Advancing the Nation's Geospatial Capabilities to Promote Federal, State, Local, and Tribal Climate Planning and Resilience," focuses on the role the federal government plays in providing geospatial data and mapping tools, and the potential for a collaborative federal mapping service to make climate data more accessible, the statement said.The report recommends: Building on the FGDC's existing GeoPlatform, which provides public access to federal geospatial data, by ensuring that all agencies register their climate-related datasets; Making this data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable; and Exploring potential enhancements to the GeoPlatform model with new software, services, or tools to help agencies and public-private partnerships develop specialized climate information products, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-launches-new-initiative-to-counter-climate-crisis-101634059984504.html
12-10-2021||World||European Union pledges 1-billion euros aid package for Afghanistan||The Taliban held their first face-to-face talks with a joint US-EU delegation Tuesday in Qatar as Brussels pledged one billion euros ($1.2 billion) in aid for Afghanistan.The hardline Islamists are seeking recognition, as well as assistance to avoid a humanitarian disaster, after they returned to power in August following the withdrawal of US troops.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU aid package, meant "to avert a major humanitarian and socio-economic collapse", at a virtual G20 summit hosted by Italy.She stressed the funds are "direct support" for Afghans and would be channelled to international organisations working on the ground, not to the Taliban's interim government which Brussels does not recognise."We have been clear about our conditions for any engagement with the Afghan authorities, including on the respect of human rights," she said.The Taliban badly need assistance as Afghanistan's economy is in a parlous state with most aid cut off even as winter nears, food prices rising and unemployment spiking.EU countries are wary at the prospect of a surge of Afghan asylum-seekers trying to enter the bloc, as happened in 2015 with Syrians fleeing their war.Brussels' calculation is that donating money to help stabilise Afghanistan and assist countries between it and Europe could stem any flow.Positive relationshipsThe direct talks held in Doha on Tuesday were facilitated by Qatar, which has long hosted a Taliban political office."I think engaging with them (the Taliban) is the most important now," said Mutlaq al-Qahtani, a special envoy to Qatar's foreign minister, who brushed aside the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government."A priority as we speak now is the humanitarian (situation), is education, is free passage" of people wishing to leave, he told the Global Security Forum conference in Doha.EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said the meeting would "allow the US and European side to address issues" including respect for women's rights and preventing Afghanistan becoming a haven for "terrorist" groups."This is an informal exchange at technical level. It does not constitute recognition of the 'interim government'," she said.Martin Longden, charge d'affaires at the now evacuated UK mission to Afghanistan, joined the talks Tuesday, saying his country had "pressed for action" on a number of issues."I stressed the UK's support for a safe and stable Afghanistan and our determination to continue our assistance to the Afghan people," he tweeted."The UK has significant concerns on counter-terrorism, freedom of movement, and human rights -- including girls' education -- on which we pressed for action."The Taliban regime is also facing a security threat from the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group, who have launched a series of deadly attacks."We want positive relationships with the whole world," the Taliban's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said at an earlier event in Qatar."We believe such a balanced relationship can save Afghanistan from instability," said Muttaqi, who led the Taliban delegation Saturday for the first in-person talks with US officials since the American pullout.Broken promisesAfghanistan's boys were allowed to return to secondary schools three weeks ago, but girls have been told to stay at home along with women teachers in much of the country, though they can attend primary school.Asked about the exclusion of girls, Muttaqi said their schools had been closed because of Covid-19 -- a public health threat he said had lessened -- but didn't explain why boys' schools had opened.Muttaqi also insisted there was no discrimination against the Shiite community and claimed that IS-K was being tamed."Whatever preparations they had made have been neutralised 98 percent," he said without providing details.IS-K claimed a bombing of a Shiite mosque that killed more than 60 people on Friday, the deadliest attack since the US pullout.Underlining the shaky security situation, the US and Britain warned their citizens on Monday to avoid certain hotels in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-pledges-1-billion-euros-aid-package-for-afghanistan-101634059825386.html
12-10-2021||World||IMF warns pandemic darkening prospects in developing countries | Growth forecasts||In a quarterly update to the World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday published the latest economic growth projections for 2021 and 2022. The IMF projected the global economy to grow 5.9% in 2021, a downward revision from July 2021 update, and 4.9% in 2022. The international financial institution noted that although the global economic recovery is continuing, the fault lines opened up by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic are looking “more persistent.” The rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus and the threat of new variants, it said, have increased the uncertainty about how “quickly the pandemic can be overcome.”IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post that the downward revision reflects “more difficult near-term prospects” for the advanced economy group while the pandemic has considerably darkened the prospects of the low-income developing country group.“The dangerous divergence in economic prospects across countries remains a major concern,” she wrote.The table shows GDP growth forecasts in percentages (Change from the July WEO update in parentheses):||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-warns-pandemic-darkening-prospects-in-developing-countries-growth-forecasts-101634051735563.html

The rate at which debt accumulated in individual countries varied considerably.The World Bank report said that for Pakistan, the 8 per cent increase in external debt stocks reflected the inflow of budgetary support from official bilateral and multilateral creditors and rollover and new credit lines from commercial banks, The News International reported.Net inflows from other private creditors rose 15 per cent in 2020 to 14 billion dollars but were highly concentrated and also reflected rollovers and extension of new credits by commercial bank loans to Pakistan in the context of the IMF program.The FDI inflows to Pakistan fell moderately to 1.9 billion dollars, 5 per cent below the 2019 level, cushioned by continued investment in power generation and the telecom sector from British and Chinese investors.While, in South Asia, debt to China has risen, from 4.7 billion dollars in 2011 to 36.3 billion dollars in 2020, The News International reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-among-top-10-countries-in-list-of-largest-external-debt-stocks-101634049374682.html

Kuwait's deputy prime minister Sheikh Hamad Jaber Al-Ali Al-Sabah, who also serves as the minister of defence, announced the ministerial decision to open the registration for women to join the country's national military service.During the initial phase, the applicants will serve in the field of medical and military support."Kuwaiti women have proven their achievements in several fields, and accordingly the approval was given for women to enter the military corps along with men," he said.Kuwaiti women have been serving as police officers for the past two decades, which paved the way for women to join the army. Announcing the decision, the defence minister affirmed his full confidence in the ability of Kuwaiti women to bear the hardship of working in the army, according to news agencies.Kuwait has made significant progress in the last few years in assuring the rights of women to work in various fields dominated by men. In 2005, the gulf nation passed a bill to grant women the right to vote and run for elected office. The bill paved the way for four female candidates occupying parliamentary seats out of fifty available in a general election a few years later.The number of female judges has also risen to 15 after 7 new female judges were introduced in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-allows-women-to-serve-in-army-report-101634044739361.html

His comments came on a day India, the US, Japan and Australia kicked off the second phase of this year’s Malabar naval drills in the Bay of Bengal, with the exercise seeking to build on the synergy and interoperability developed during the first phase held in August.“In future, that exercise could expand. It is for the partners inside the Quad to discuss that. But remember, there are many exercises that go on in the Indo-Pacific and globally which bring like-minded navies and partners together,” Gilday said, in response to a question on the possibility of more navies coming together under the Malabar banner. He is in India on a five-day official visit.The second phase of the Malabar exercise is being conducted from October 12 to 15. Gilday said the cyber domain is one area that the Quad navies would continue to refine in terms of working together as well as high-end operations in the air, on and under the sea.“We are committed to operationalizing our #USIndiaDefense partnership, including through enhanced information-sharing, regional security, and exercising at sea together,” he wrote on Twitter. The Quad navies conducted the first phase of the exercise off the Pacific Ocean island of Guam from August 26-29. It involved destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, helicopters, long-range maritime patrol aircraft and elite special forces elements, including the US Navy SEALs and the Indian Navy’s marine commandos (MARCOS). The Indian Navy is taking part in the exercise’s second phase with INS Ranvijay, INS Satpura, P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft and a submarine. The US Navy is represented by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson along with USS Lake Champlain and USS Stockdale while Japan is taking part with JS Kaga and JS Murasame. The Royal Australian Navy has sent HMAS Ballarat and HMAS Sirius for the drills. Malabar began as an annual bilateral naval exercise between India and the US in 1992. It has increased in scope and complexity over the years. It was in the 2005 edition of the drills that the aircraft carriers from the Indian and the US Navy operated together for the first time. In 2014, the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) became a permanent participant in the drills followed by Australia in 2020. The Quad navies earlier carried out complex naval drills under the Malabar banner in November 2020 in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Wary of the Quad, China has been monitoring its activities closely. The Quad was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, increasing Beijing’s suspicions as the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in the South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scope-of-malabar-drills-could-expand-in-future-us-admiral-101634046678558.html

On Monday, Merck said in a release that companies are actively working with regulatory agencies worldwide to formally request emergency use or marketing authorization in the coming months."Indeed, this is an interesting development. We would have to see the full data about it. If it holds true, then it is another weapon in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic," the WHO spokesperson told a UN briefing in Geneva.Data on phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational antiviral drug released by Merck earlier this month showed that the risk of hospitalisation or death was reduced by 50% in patients with mild to moderate infection as compared to placebo. Also Read | Experts laud Merck's Covid-19 drug molnupiravir.

12-10-2021||World||IMF cuts China growth forecast for 2021 and 2022||China's economy will grow slower than initially expected this year owing to a "stronger-than-anticipated" pullback in public spending, the International Monetary Fund forecast Tuesday while warning that a weakening property market could bring a further blow.The 8.0 percent prediction in the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report is down 0.1 percentage points from its July estimate as analysts warn China is facing a painful fallout from real estate weakness and shocks from surging coal prices and shortages.But the figure is still China's strongest growth rate since 2011.The world's second-largest economy was the only major one to expand last year after the coronavirus pandemic forced governments across the globe to lock down.The IMF also lowered its outlook for next year to 5.6 percent.Concerns over China have intensified in recent weeks as government curbs on the property market piled pressure on overleveraged developers -- notably Evergrande.Measures by local governments to meet short-term climate targets also led to a power crunch.On Tuesday, the IMF said: "China's prospects for 2021 are marked down slightly due to stronger-than-anticipated scaling back of public investment."The downward adjustment is the IMF's second since April, when it pegged full-year growth at 8.4 percent.It also warned of risks that could threaten the resilience of the recovery."Large-scale disorderly corporate debt defaults or restructuring, for instance in China's property sector, could reverberate widely," it said.The travails of Evergrande, which is struggling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, have thrown a spotlight on China's property developers -- after Beijing introduced metrics to cap debt ratios last year.While analysts generally believe the firm's problems will not trigger a "Lehman moment", many warn they will worsen a slowdown in the property sector, which accounts for a massive part of the Chinese economy.The IMF added that an escalation of trade and technology tensions between the United States and China could "weigh on investment and productivity growth, raising additional roadblocks in the recovery path".Should the world's two biggest economies decouple in basic scientific research, there could also be "big negative effects" on global productivity, with an estimated decline of up to 0.8 percent to start, it said.And in the longer term, demographic challenges in China and other emerging markets make it more pressing to reverse a persistent decline in long-term growth and build a more buoyant post-pandemic global economy.Census results published in May this year showed China's population growing at the slowest pace in decades, fuelling concerns of a demographic slump in the ageing country.Meanwhile, the IMF expects monetary policy in China to be "moderately tight" in 2021, and for this trend to remain into next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-cuts-china-growth-forecast-for-2021-and-2022-101634044790695.html

Speaking at an event in Qatar, Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of the Taliban government, said that the previous government failed to bring reforms in 20 years despite strong international support but the world now wants to bring in the reforms in two months, reported Tolo News."You should not seek your demands through putting pressure on us, ask us through cooperation," Muttaqi said at the event organised by the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.The Taliban government is seeking recognition from the international community but most of the countries have opted for a wait-and-watch policy and demanded the Sunni Pashtun group to fulfil their promises of an inclusive government and respect for human rights, especially that of women and girls.On Sunday, the United States and the Taliban held talks in Doha for the first time after the final withdrawal of US troops in August. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the talks revolved around the safe passage of Americans, other foreign nationals and Afghan partners. Price added that the Taliban will be “judged on its actions, not only its words.”Muttaqi said that "the full implementation of the Doha agreement signed between the US and Afghanistan can address any problem between the two countries," according to Tolo News.The Taliban’s months-long offensive against the Afghan defence forces that led to the ouster of Ashraf Ghani-led government disrupted the work at government offices and several schools were closed. But the group has defended the disruption saying the schools were already closed due to the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19)."Schools for boys and girls were closed before us because of Covid. When Kabul fell to our hands, all schools were closed already. Schools in provinces were closed already. We have started reopening the schools," Tolo News quoted Muttaqi as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-want-world-to-seek-cooperation-not-make-demands-by-putting-pressure-101634028639386.html

Hasina joined the ceremony from Dhaka via video conference.India’s Hindustan Construction Company has bagged a $110 million contract for civil works at the Rooppur plant in a joint venture with Bangladesh’s MAX Group. The Indian company holds a 40% share in the joint venture.Indian firms are able to participate in construction work and supply of non-critical equipment for the project under a trilateral agreement signed by India, Russia, and Bangladesh in 2018.Hasina thanked Russia for its support for the Rooppur project. The installation of the reactor pressure vessel of the first unit of the nuclear plant confirms Bangladesh’s “strong presence in the nuclear world so far as peaceful use of nuclear technology is concerned”, she said.“After being convinced about safety and management of nuclear waste at the meeting with President [Vladimir] Putin in 2013, I decided to go for nuclear,” she said.“As this technology doesn’t have carbon emissions, hence it is eco-friendly and will help fight adverse effects of climate change. This power station will help us achieve SDG goals by 2030 in line with our development plan and facilitate graduation to a developed nation in 2041,” she added.Also Read: Temple located in no-man’s land between India and Bangladesh preps to celebrate Durga PujaWork for installing the reactor pressure vessel started on September 14. Over the course of two weeks, the reactor was moved inside the containment building. The 334-tonne structure was installed into its design position, and Likhachev said the development had brought Bangladesh closer to its goal of developing its nuclear power industry.“The high qualification of specialists and the thorough preparation ensured the performance of the works with pinpoint precision...The development of nuclear power industry will not only resolve the problem of energy supply in Bangladesh but will also contribute to the development of the region and enhance the living standards of the people,” Likhachev said.Following the ceremony, Likhachev and the prime minister discussed issues of strategic cooperation between Rosatom and Bangladesh.The Rooppur nuclear power plant is located on the bank of the Ganges river at a distance of 160 km from the capital Dhaka. The facility is designed and constructed by Rosatom.

12-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada rolls out vaccine mandates, draws ire, sparks tensions||Job losses in Canada’s healthcare sector and confrontations between unions and the government loom as Covid-19 vaccine mandates start being enforced across the North American country amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.The latest flashpoint in Canada is a mandate in Quebec for healthcare workers, with the deadline for compliance this Friday. The Quebec Order of Nurses (OIIQ) announced that those who were not yet vaccinated against Covid-19 would be suspended from practising on October 15. According to the OIIQ, as reported by the news outlet Global News, out of 80,000 nurses in Quebec, nearly 4,000 are not “properly vaccinated” against Covid-19 and the status of another 5,716 is unclear.In a Facebook post in French, the nurses’ union, Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec (FIQ), threatened legal action if the decision to make Covid-19 vaccination mandatory caused “disproportionate harm to our members”.Similar developments are emerging across the country as Covid-19 vaccine mandates gradually come into effect. Layoffs at a hospital in Ontario have already been reported, even as the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing.A wider government mandate, announced by Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week, will come into effect on October 30, and that is also being criticised and challenged by unions.The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents 215,000 government employees, has said while the vast majority of its membership “is fully vaccinated” against Covid-19, it will “continue to represent unvaccinated members who have punitive action taken against them as a result of their vaccination status”.While it stated that it “fully supports a federal vaccination policy to protect the health and safety of our members and the Canadians they serve”, the union also affirmed that the “government rushed their vaccination policy without meaningful consultation with the unions representing federal public service workers”.The point of view was echoed by the union representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which will also come under the Covid-19 vaccine mandate. Brian Sauvé, the National Police Federation’s (NPF) president, said it was “disappointed at the government’s engagement-by-notification approach to the policy’s release”.It added that the NPF will “continue to support [its] members’ access to vaccines, and their choice to be vaccinated or not”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-rolls-out-vaccine-mandates-draws-ire-sparks-tensions-101634022433724.html

A UPS worker, who was on the ground, was the second person to have been killed in the crash. Dr Sugata Das, who worked as an interventional cardiologist at the Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC) in Arizona, owned the small Cessna C340 plane, according to the centre. "We are deeply sad to hear news of a plane owned by local cardiologist Sugata Das, which crashed near Santee (California). As an outstanding cardiologist and dedicated family man, Das leaves a lasting legacy.

They attended the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting, and also held bilateral discussions on the margins of the event.Mary Ng tweeted that they discussed “working together towards economic recovery, which includes progressing bilateral trade, including the flow of agricultural products”. She also said they talked about reforms to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and “ambitious outcomes” ahead of its 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in Geneva, Switzerland later this year.Piyush Goyal tweeted about the meeting saying talks were on “for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), with energy, new technologies, and manufactured goods and services being key areas for future cooperation”.Ajay Bisaria, India’s high commissioner to Canada, described the meeting between Piyush Goyal and Mary Ng on the sidelines of the G20 summit as “excellent” and added that the CEPA, if it is sealed, “will strengthen economic engagement”.After languishing for nearly four years, Indian and Canadian negotiators resumed discussions in June towards a possible trade pact between the two countries.The discussions, held virtually, were undertaken by officials of India’s commerce ministry and those from Canada’s international trade department. They had revisited the planned CEPA, which has been under consideration for a full decade after talks were initiated under then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Stephen Harper, Canada’s PM at that time.The last round of negotiations was held in August 2017. While Canadian officials wanted to clinch a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) prior to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in February 2018, New Delhi was more interested in sealing the CEPA first. However, with bilateral relations turning sour following that visit, fresh talks were not scheduled.In the backdrop of Piyush Goyal’s meeting with Mary Ng alongside the G20 summit in Italy, a senior Indian official said discussions are now on for a “CEPA-lite”, a streamlined version of the deal, which would take into account areas of convergence and interest to the two nations.The last ministerial-level dialogue on CEPA was held in September 2016 by two leaders who are now both finance ministers - Nirmala Sitharaman, then commerce minister, and Chrystia Freeland, minister of international trade at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-in-italy-piyush-goyal-holds-talks-with-canada-s-mary-ng-with-eye-on-cepa-101634017452671.html

The statement comes almost a week after Nato chief Jeans Stoltenberg said that the allies need to stay vigilant about the escalating situation in Afghanistan and "be ready to strike and monitor closely any attempts to reconstitute international terrorist groups in Afghanistan, aiming at us"."The Nato Secretary-General, for a while, may feel his pain and talk about their failures, but they should know that the time for attacks is over," said Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid in an interview with local media. "It was proven twenty years ago that these actions did not work and should be dealt with through diplomacy," Mujahid added.The Taliban officials also said that the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States and now ruling over Afghanistan, will never allow the country to be used as a centre for proxy wars between the world powers.In the interview, Mujahid also spoke against the interference by other countries in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and it "will not accept it." "I have to say 100 per cent that we do not want anyone to interfere, including Pakistan," he said, adding, "We are an independent country. We do not accept these interventions. Pakistan is a separate country. We do not want to interfere in their affairs and they cannot interfere (in Afghanistan's affairs)."On the economic crisis, Mujahid said that talks are on with other regional countries including Uzbekistan for trade support. A promising deal was reached with Iran last week on exports of fuel and food as well as rail and border security, among other issues, the spokesperson also informed at the interview.Taliban took over Afghanistan in a military offensive in the aftermath of troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the United States and its other Nato allies. The chaotic exit led to a major humanitarian crisis for Afghanistan as it brought the country back to 1991 when the group was ousted by the US troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-attacks-is-over-engage-through-diplomacy-taliban-to-nato-101634008111536.html
12-10-2021||World||US 'root cause' of tensions, says North Korea's Kim Jong Un||The leader of nuclear-armed North Korea, Kim Jong Un, has blamed the United States for tensions on the peninsula, state media reported Tuesday.The US is the "root cause" of instability, he said in an opening speech at a defence exhibition, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.Pyongyang is under multiple international sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, which have made rapid progress under Kim.In 2017, it tested missiles that can reach the whole of the continental US and carried out by far its most powerful nuclear explosion to date, and Pyongyang says it needs its arsenal to protect itself against a US invasion.The Biden administration has repeatedly stated that it has no hostile intent towards the North, but Kim told the "Self-Defence 2021" exhibition: "I am very curious if there are people or countries who believe that.""There is no basis in their actions for believing that it is not hostile," he added, according to KCNA.Kim's address came after the North in recent weeks tested a long-range cruise missile, a train-launched weapon, and what it said was a hypersonic warhead.In 2018, Kim became the first North Korean leader ever to meet a sitting US president at the headline-grabbing Singapore summit.But the talks process has been largely at a standstill since a second meeting in Hanoi the following year collapsed over sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.The Biden administration has said it is willing to meet North Korean officials at any time or place, without preconditions, in its efforts to seek denuclearisation.Washington and Seoul are security allies and Washington stations around 28,500 troops in the South to defend it against its neighbour, which invaded in 1950.The South and the United States held joint military exercises in August. The wargames always infuriate Pyongyang, which decries them as preparations for invasion.Seoul is itself on a multi-billion-dollar drive to step up its own military capabilities, successfully testing its first submarine-launched ballistic missile in September -- putting the South among an elite group of nations with proven SLBM technology -- and revealing a supersonic cruise missile.Last week, Pyongyang and Seoul reconnected their cross-border hotline in a sign of thawing ties, with only a few months left in office for the South's pro-engagement President Moon Jae-in.But Kim accused Seoul of "reckless ambition" and a "two-faced, illogical" attitude.Their "unrestricted and dangerous attempts to strengthen military power are destroying the military balance on the Korean peninsula and increasing military instability and danger", he added.Party timeThe exhibition is part of the commemorations for the anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers' Party, and included aerobatics flights and martial arts displays.Pyongyang closed its borders early last year to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic that first emerged in neighbouring China, its key diplomatic ally and main provider of trade and aid.The North insists it has had no cases of the disease -- experts doubt the claim -- but the self-imposed blockade has isolated it more effectively than any sanctions regime and has hit its economy badly.Kim referred to the "grim situation" in a lengthy speech to mark the party anniversary, calling for discipline and loyalty.A United Nations expert panel said this month that the North had continued to pursue its weapons development despite its economic travails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-root-cause-of-tensions-says-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-101633999780011.html
