He mocks car owners lined up at the petrol station and says, “I am on a horse, I don’t need petrol because he runs on carrots. He runs on carrots, he runs on carrots, I don’t need petrol because I’m on a horse,” Dolphin says in his video.A post shared by Gus Lee-Dolphin (@gusleedolphin)Panic buying gripped the UK as it faced fuel shortages last week after the government said that there were not enough truckers to transport fuel to the nation’s petrol stations. Shell, ExxonMobil and Green Energy, the nation’s largest fuel suppliers have said that not fuel but labour shortage has led to a chaotic week where social media platforms were filled with videos of people getting into fights in gas stations and car owners were seen filling petrol on bottles as a reserve.The UK government on Saturday, in a bid to mitigate the crisis, extended an emergency visa programme for truck drivers. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent filling stations, told news agencies that they saw a ‘distinct improvement' in the conditions, though the situation did not improve in several regions, including London.“In London and the Southeast, and possibly parts of eastern England, if anything, it has got worse,” PRA’s Brian Madderson was quoted as saying by news agency BBC. A survey of 1,000 independent petrol stations showed that 16% of stations were still dry, news agency Bloomberg reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-runs-on-carrots-man-on-horseback-has-a-funny-take-on-uk-s-fuel-crisis-101633194996102.html

All you need to know||Merck & Co’s molnupiravir, the Covid-19 pill, claims to help nations which are struggling to vaccinate their citizens. According to an analysis based on a late-stage trial conducted by Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, the pill reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by 50%, news agency Bloomberg reported.Unitaid, the global health agency, is also hoping that an agreement could be reached so that lower and middle-income nations struggling to vaccinate their citizens can benefit from the pill.Molnupiravir is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus and would be the first oral antiviral medication for Covid-19, news agency Reuters said. Merck chief executive Robert Davis said that this aspect of the pill will ‘change’ the conversation regarding how to treat Covid-19. Another expert from the University of Liverpool who is familiar with the developments told news agency Bloomberg that the drug could be very cheap to manufacture and made available at a low price in developing countries.The results of the Phase III trial were promising enough for the company to stop enrolling patients and start the process of getting regulatory clearance.Molnupiravir, according to experts, is less challenging logistically compared to Gilead Sciences’ infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone. These medicines are also administered when the patient is hospitalised.Which countries are interestedMerck and Co earlier this year announced that it signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for molnupiravir with five generic manufacturers in India. It was done to make sure that the availability of the drug in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries could be accelerated following approvals from their regulatory agencies.Malaysia health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said that negotiations between Merck and the Malaysian government have begun to procure the new drugs. The US government has also contracted to buy 1.7 million doses of Merck’s medication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-laud-merck-s-covid-19-drug-molnupiravir-all-you-need-to-know-101633185913633.html

Deputy governor of the province Mullah Nisar Ahmad Ahmadi said the battalion is named Lashkar-e-Mansoori, or "Mansoor army". The battalion is the same as the one that would conduct suicide attacks targeting the security forces of the previous Afghan government, he said.Crediting the suicide bomber battalion for the success of the Taliban against the United States, Ahmadi, as reported by Khaama Press, said, "The defeat of the US would not be possible if not for this battalion. These brave men would wear explosive waistcoats and would detonate the US bases in Afghanistan. These are people with literally no fear who devote themselves for the consent of ALLAH."Afghan interpreters who worked for Netherlands summoned by Taliban: ReportThe announcement is significant at a time when the Taliban and Tajikistan are openly engaging in a battle of words as Tajikistan is demanding more representation of ethnic Tajiks in the Afghanistan government. In his address to the UN General Assembly, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon said, "Various terrorist groups are actively using the unstable military-political situation in Afghanistan in order to strengthen their positions...We are seriously concerned and regret that Afghanistan is once again on its way to becoming a platform for international terrorism."The Taliban have also replied to the Tajik attack and said the Taliban will not allow any neighbouring nation to interfere in the internal matters of Afghanistan.A Reuters report said Tajikistan held military parades in two provinces bordering Afghanistan this week, while Russia has urged both Tajikistan and the Taliban to resolve any dispute in a mutually acceptable manner.Tajikistan, which has become the base of Afghanistan's Resistance Force leaders, has also condemned the violations of human rights in Panjshir province.The Taliban have also deployed tens of thousands of Afghan special forces fighters in the Takhar province, adjacent to Tajikistan, reports said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-deploy-suicide-bombers-at-borders-eye-on-tajikistan-report-101633185276591.html

According to a report in The Daily Wattan, the Sikh community in KPK has started migrating to other parts of Pakistan in hope of safety.The latest to be killed was Satnam Singh, a Unani medicine practitioner, who had migrated to KPK's capital Peshawar from Orakzai district hoping for a safe life, the publication reported. The 45-year-old was gunned down at his clinic on Thursday by unidentified men, police said.He was hit by four bullets and died instantly. The killers escaped from the scene.Singh was a well-known member of the Sikh community and ran Dharmandar Pharmacy on Charsadda Road in Peshawar, the capital of KPK. He had lived in the city for the past 20 years.In a message posted on social media late on Thursday, Islamic State-Khorasan claimed responsibility for the killing.The Daily Wattan report claimed that as many as 13 Sikhs have been killed in KPK by terrorists in the last six-seven years. Dr Swaran Singh, former advisor to ex-KPK chief minister Parvez Khan Khattak, was one of them. Charanjit Singh, a prominent Sikh community leader, was killed by unidentified men in 2018, while television anchor Ravinder Singh was killed in the city last year.Due to rising number of such incidents, the families of the minority community have started shifting to Hasanabdal, Lahore, and Nanakna Sahib which have a sizeable Sikh population, reported The Daily Wattan.Islamic State-Khorasan, which is based in Afghanistan, has stepped up attacks in several Afghan cities since the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15.

It had not offered any overall statistics previously on worker fatalities, injuries or coronavirus infections despite repeated requests from The Associated Press and other journalists.The admission comes after the European Parliament last month urged nations not to take part in Expo, citing the United Arab Emirates' “inhumane practices against foreign workers” that it said worsened during the pandemic. Ahead of Expo, businesses and construction companies are “coercing workers into signing untranslated documents, confiscating their passports, exposing them to extreme working hours in unsafe weather conditions and providing them with unsanitary housing,” the resolution said.At a press conference a day after the event’s opening, Expo spokesperson Sconaid McGeachin claimed the information about fatalities was previously available but did not elaborate. The AP previously had repeatedly asked for the information and received no response from the Expo.She also said authorities would offer more information about casualties at a later, unspecified time.McGeachin also acknowledged that authorities were aware of cases involving contractors “withholding passports” and engaging in suspect “recruitment practices" and workplace safety violations on site.“We have taken steps to ensure those have been addressed and very much intervened in cases on that,” she said, without elaborating.The UAE, an oil-rich sheikhdom that relies on low-paid migrant labor from Africa, Asia and Arab countries to keep its economy humming, faces long-standing criticism from human rights groups for treating those workers poorly. But officials have battled to present a positive image for Expo, the first world’s fair in the Middle East that seeks to show off Dubai’s pride and draw millions of foreign visitors.Laborers in the UAE are barred from unionization and have few protections, often working long hours for little pay and living in substandard conditions.Dubai's searing early autumn heat proved hazardous even for those visiting the site on its opening day Friday, with some tourists fainting in the 40 degree Celsius (104 degree Fahrenheit) humid weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-expo-2020-organisers-say-5-workers-died-on-site-during-preparations-101633176497890.html

Trump's Twitter account was permanently suspended in January this year following the Capitol Hill riots on January 6. Other social media companies too followed suit and took action against the former US President. In July,  Trump sued Twitter, Facebook and Google, as well as their chief executives alleging that their action against Trump was unlawful. In Florida, Trump has filed a request for a preliminary injunction against Twitter arguing that Twitter was coerced by US Congress members to suspend his account. Twitter "exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate," Trump's lawyers said in the filing. Twitter declined to comment on the filing when contacted by Reuters.In the court filing, Trump argued Twitter allowed the Taliban to tweet regularly but censored him even during his presidency by labelling his tweets as "misleading information" or indicating they violated the company's rules against "glorifying violence", Reuters reported. On January 8, Twitter said in its blogpost that after a close review of the recent tweets from Donald Trump's account and the context around them, the company took the decision to permanently suspend the account due to the risk of further "incitement of violence"."Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behaviour from this account in recent weeks," Twitter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-asks-florida-judge-to-force-twitter-to-restore-his-account-says-they-allowed-taliban-101633167455698.html

It said Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them."China has been wantonly engaged in military aggression, damaging regional peace," Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Saturday morning.The first wave of incursions comprised 18 J-16 and four Su-30 fighter jets plus two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and an anti-submarine aircraft, while the second had 10 J-16s, 2 H-6s and an early warning aircraft, the ministry said.The first batch of Chinese aircraft all flew in an area close to the Pratas Islands, with the two bombers flying closest to the atoll, according to a map issued by the ministry.The second group flew down into the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines, a key waterway that links the Pacific with the disputed South China Sea.China has yet to comment. It has previously said such flights were to protect the country's sovereignty and aimed at "collusion" between Taiwan and the United States, the island's most important international backer.The previous largest incursion happened in June, involving 28 Chinese air force aircraft.China's latest mission came less than a day after its government launched a attack on Taiwan's foreign minister, evoking the words of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to denounce him as a "shrilling" fly for his efforts to promote Taiwan internationally.China has stepped up military and political pressure to try and force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty.Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedom and democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-angers-taiwan-after-it-commits-largest-ever-incursion-into-island-101633166448199.html
02-10-2021||World||Qatar votes in nation's first legislative election||Qataris began voting in the emirate's first legislative election Saturday in a symbolic nod to democracy that analysts say will not lead to power shifting away from the ruling family.The vote is for 30 members of the 45-strong Shura Council, a body with limited powers that was previously appointed by the emir as an advisory chamber.Polls opened at 0500 GMT and will close at 1500 GMT with the results expected the same day.At a polling station in the Jawaan bin Jassim school in the Onaiza district of the capital Doha, Qatari citizens wearing white thobes signed in to vote at a registration desk.After queueing briefly, they cast their ballots into a semi-transparent plastic box emblazoned with the dhow boat, crossed swords and palm tree emblem of Qatar.Observers say the decision to hold the election, required under the 2004 constitution but repeatedly delayed in the "national interest", comes amid heightened scrutiny as Qatar prepares to host the 2022 World Cup."It's a way to show that they are moving in the right direction, that they want to achieve more political participation" before the World Cup, said Luciano Zaccara, an assistant professor in Gulf politics at Qatar University.The Shura will be allowed to propose legislation, approve the budget and recall ministers. But the emir, all-powerful in the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, will wield a veto."This is a historic day to participate, choose and vote in the first elected Shura Council, and I feel very happy... I hope that the next council will keep pace with the developments that Qatar and the world are experiencing," voter Ali Abdullah al-Khulaifi, 44, told AFP.The streets of Qatar's towns have been speckled with billboards adorned with beaming candidates sporting national dress.Beyond single-candidate town hall meetings, posters and TV spots, the country's introduction to democracy has been limited, with no change of government possible and political parties outlawed.Candidates have uniformly avoided debate about Qatar's foreign policy or status as a monarchy, instead focussing on social issues including healthcare, education and citizenship rights.'Deliver our voice'All candidates had to be approved by the powerful interior ministry against a host of criteria, including age, character and criminal history.Candidates have also been required to register official campaign events with the ministry in advance, as well as the names of all speakers as authorities seek to clamp down on possible sectarianism or tribalism.The candidates are mostly men, with just 28 women among the 284 hopefuls running for the 30 available council seats. The remaining 15 seats will be appointed by the emir.One woman casting her ballot Saturday, Sabeeka Yousef, said she was not concerned about this imbalance."The most important thing for me in this process is to choose a candidate who is able to deliver our voice," she said.Most of Qatar's 2.5 million residents are foreigners, ineligible to vote.Candidates have to stand in electoral divisions linked to where their family or tribe was based in the 1930s, using data compiled by the then-British authorities.Diplomatic sources suggest families and tribes have already conducted internal ballots to determine who will be elected for their constituencies."When you don't have political parties... people sometimes will tend to vote for people they know, or for members of family or members of tribe," said Courtney Freer, a fellow at Emory College.Qataris number about 333,000, but only descendants of those who were citizens in 1930 are eligible to vote and stand, disqualifying members of families naturalised since then.Some members of the sizeable Al-Murrah tribe are among those excluded from the electoral process, sparking a fierce debate online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-votes-in-nation-s-first-legislative-election-101633165299100.html

However, he had actually flown off to the resort of Tofino in British Columbia for a family holiday and was photographed on the beach by the outlet Global News. Trudeau’s office later updated his itinerary to reflect that reality.That action drew criticism from groups like the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC). Condemning that decision, it issued a statement on Friday expressing “shock and dismay” over Justin Trudeau holidaying in Tofino. NWAC CEO Lynne Groulx said that the “decision to duck out entirely” on this particular day was “astounding for its sheer level of callousness”.Ironically, the day was made a federal statutory holiday by the Justin Trudeau government earlier this year. Trudeau did attend an event with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation on Parliament Hill in the capital on Wednesday.Emotions over the historic treatment of Canada’s indigenous people have been especially high this year due to the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves of children at or close to the location of residential schools that were operated by the Catholic Church across the country from the mid-19th century into the 1970s.This summer, 182 such graves were found near the town of Cranbrook in British Columbia, 751 in Saskatchewan and 215 in Kamloops, also in BC.In a statement datelined Ottawa and released by the prime minister’s office on Thursday, Justin Trudeau was quoted as saying it was a day “to reflect on the painful and lasting impacts of residential schools in Canada, and to honour survivors, their families, and their communities” and “to remember the many children who never returned home”, adding that it “recognises that at least 150,000 Indigenous children from across the country were forcibly separated from their families and their communities”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-faces-flak-for-holidaying-on-truth-and-reconciliation-day-101633151139216.html

The death toll is larger than the population of Boston.This milestone is especially frustrating to public health leaders and medical professionals on the front lines because vaccines have been available to all eligible Americans for nearly six months and the shots overwhelmingly protect against hospitalizations and death. An estimated 70 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, providing kindling for the variant.“You lose patients from Covid and it should not happen,” said Debi Delapaz, a nurse manager at UF Health Jacksonville who recalled how the hospital was at one point losing eight patients a day to Covid-19 during the summer surge. “This is something that should not happen.”Despite the rising death toll, there are signs of improvement.Nationwide, the number of people now in the hospital with Covid-19 has fallen to somewhere around 75,000 from over 93,000 in early September. New cases are on the downswing at about 112,000 per day on average, a drop of about one-third over the past 2 1/2 weeks.Deaths, too, appear to be declining, averaging about 1,900 a day versus more than 2,000 about a week ago.The easing of the summer surge has been attributed to more mask wearing and more people getting vaccinated. The decrease in case numbers could also be due to the virus having burned through susceptible people and running out of fuel in some places.In another development, Merck said Friday its experimental pill for people sick with Covid-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half. If it wins authorization from regulators, it will be the first pill for treating Covid-19 — and an important, easy-to-use new weapon in the arsenal against the pandemic.All treatments now authorized in the U.S. against the coronavirus require an IV or injection.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, warned on Friday that some may see the encouraging trends as a reason to remain unvaccinated.“It’s good news we’re starting to see the curves” coming down, he said. “That is not an excuse to walk away from the issue of needing to get vaccinated.”Unknowns include how flu season may strain already depleted hospital staffs and whether those who have refused to get vaccinated will change their minds.“If you’re not vaccinated or have protection from natural infection, this virus will find you,” warned Mike Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, began seeing a surge of Covid-19 hospitalizations in mid-July, and by the first week of August, the place was beyond capacity. It stopped elective surgeries and brought in military doctors and nurses to help care for patients.With cases now down, the military team is scheduled to leave at the end of October.Still, the hospital’s chief medical officer, Dr. Catherine O’Neal, said the rate of hospitalizations isn’t decreasing as quickly as cases in the community because the delta variant is affecting more young people who are otherwise healthy and are living much longer in the intensive care unit on ventilators.“It creates a lot of ICU patients that don’t move anywhere,” she said. And many of the patients aren’t going home at all. In the last few weeks, the hospital saw several days with more than five Covid-19 deaths daily, including one day when there were 10 deaths.“We lost another dad in his 40s just a few days ago,” O’Neal said. “It’s continuing to happen. And that’s what the tragedy of Covid is.”As for where the outbreak goes from here, “I have to tell you, my crystal ball has broken multiple times in the last two years,” she said. But she added that the hospital has to be prepared for another surge at the end of November, as flu season also ramps up.Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, system medical director for hospital quality at Ochsner Health in Louisiana, said this fourth surge of the pandemic has been harder. “It’s just frustrating for people to die of vaccine-preventable illnesses,” she said.At the peak of this most recent wave, Ochsner hospitals had 1,074 Covid-19 patients on Aug. 9. That had dropped to 208 as of Thursday.Other hospitals are seeing decreases as well. The University of Mississippi Medical Center had 146 hospitalized Covid-19 patients at its mid-August peak. That was down to 39 on Friday. Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia, South Carolina, had more than 190 in early September but just 49 on Friday.But Kemmerly doesn’t expect the decrease to last. “I fully expect to see more hospitalizations due to COVID,” she said.Like many other health professionals, Natalie Dean, a professor of biostatistics at Emory University, is taking a cautious view about the winter.It is unclear if the coronavirus will take on the seasonal pattern of the flu, with predictable peaks in the winter as people gather indoors for the holidays. Simply because of the nation’s size and diversity, there will be places that have outbreaks and surges, she said.What’s more, the uncertainties of human behavior complicate the picture. People react to risk by taking precautions, which slows viral transmission. Then, feeling safer, people mingle more freely, sparking a new wave of contagion.“Infectious disease models are different from weather models,” Dean said. “A hurricane doesn’t change its course because of what the model said.”One influential model, from the University of Washington, projects new cases will bump up again this fall, but vaccine protection and infection-induced immunity will prevent the virus from taking as many lives as it did last winter.Still, the model predicts about 90,000 more Americans will die by Jan. 1 for an overall death toll of 788,000 by that date. The model calculates that about half of those deaths could be averted if almost everyone wore masks in public.“Mask wearing is already heading in the wrong direction,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the university. “We need to make sure we are ready for winter because our hospitals are exhausted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-nears-700-000-just-as-cases-begin-to-fall-101633138078791.html
02-10-2021||World||International Day of Non-Violence: Know its history, significance||The International Day of Non-Violence is observed on October 2, the birth anniversary of India’s Independence movement hero Mahatma Gandhi. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in a resolution adopted on June 15, 2007, established the commemoration as an occasion to spread the message of non-violence through education and public awareness. The resolution reaffirms the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence and the desire to secure a culture of peace, tolerance, understanding and non-violence. "Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man," Gandhi had said.History of International Day of Non-ViolenceThe resolution in the UNGA was passed with a goal to secure a culture of peace, tolerance and understanding with the help of the teachings of Gandhi who inspired millions to adopt the path of non-violence. It was in January 2004 that Iranian Noble Laureate Shirin Ebadi proposed the idea for the day. The idea attracted many Congress leaders, who in 2007 called upon the UN to adopt the idea.The then minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma introduced the resolution in the General Assembly on behalf of 140 co-sponsors. Sharma said that wide and diversified sponsorship of the resolution was an acknowledgement of the universal respect for Gandhi and his philosophy.Significance of International Day of Non-ViolenceThis day is observed across the world to give the message of non-violence. Gandhi has been an inspiration for non-violent movements across the globe. He remained committed to his belief in non-violence even under difficult challenges and led India to freedom. The UN hosts official events around the world to commemorate the resolution of 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-non-violence-know-its-history-significance-101633135203671.html

Why is the country not ready for anything?" said Ata Uriakhil, a 47-year-old Afghanistan-born taxi driver who was first in a line of more than 40 cars outside a closed supermarket petrol station in Richmond."When is it going to end?," Uriakhil said. "The politicians are not capable of doing their jobs properly. The government should have been prepared for this crisis. It is just incompetence."Uriakhil said he had lost about 20% of his normal earnings this week because he has been waiting for fuel rather than picking up customers.The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said members reported on Friday that 26% of pumps were dry, 27% had just one fuel type in stock and 47% had enough petrol and diesel."Independents, which total 65% of the entire network, are not receiving enough deliveries of fuel compared with other sectors such as supermarkets," Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retail Association, told Reuters.Ministers say the world is facing a global shortage of truck drivers and that they are working to ease the crisis. They deny that the situation is a consequence of an exodus of EU workers following Britain's departure from the bloc, and have dismissed concerns the country is heading toward a winter of shortages and power cuts.Though there are shortages of truck drivers in other countries, EU members have not seen fuel shortages.Pig farms strugglingThe Conservative government this week changed tack on immigrant workers, to allow some foreign workers to come in for three months to drive trucks and fill gaps in the poultry sector.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said the government wasn't moving fast enough."The Prime Minister should be taking emergency action today but yet again he’s failed to grasp the seriousness of the crisis. If it needs legislation, then let’s recall Parliament," he said.In addition to the chaos around gas stations, farmers are warning that a shortage of butchers and abattoir workers could force a cull of tens of thousands of pigs.The pig industry implored retailers to continue buying local pork and not cheaper EU products, saying businesses would go bust and livestock would be culled if producers are not given immediate support.The weekly slaughter of pigs has dropped by 25% since August after the pandemic and Britain's post-Brexit immigration rules combined to hit a meat processing industry that was already struggling for workers."As a result of the labour supply issues in pork processing plants, we currently have an estimated 120,000 pigs backed up on UK pig farms that should have gone to slaughter," the National Pig Association said in a letter to retailers."The only option for some will be to cull pigs on farm."The Pig Association said that despite attempts to persuade the government to ease immigration rules, it appeared to have reached an impasse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-gas-pumps-still-dry-britain-brings-in-army-tanker-drivers-to-deliver-fuel-101633133606063.html

If we are not able to get hold of you, we will settle scores with your near ones," said another letter to an interpreter whom the Taliban accused of being responsible for the deaths of some of their fighters.All indications show that the letters, which bear official seals, were despatched by the Taliban, NOS said.It said it had contacted about 10 interpreters or people who had worked for the Dutch and who all said their situation was becoming increasing difficult.The Taliban in June urged interpreters who had worked for foreign forces to repent but urged them to stay on in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of foreign forces and assured them they would not be harmed.Just after taking power, the Taliban declared a general amnesty for Afghan government and military officials.But despite their pledges not to avenge themselves, a confidential United Nations report said the Taliban were tracking down people who worked with foreign forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-interpreters-who-worked-for-netherlands-summoned-by-taliban-report-101633126576620.html

She noted that the Covid-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted marginalised populations, according to a statement from the USISPF. She also highlighted the difficulties women have accessing financial services to increased pressures balancing unpaid care and domestic work while working, and increased underemployment and business closures.USISPF CEO Mukesh Aghi said, “We look forward to working with our member companies to boost entrepreneurship and job opportunities that will enhance economic prosperity and inclusion in India.”The alliance is expected to focus on three areas of action: accelerating women’s entrepreneurship, fostering leadership in the workforce and providing access to career enhancing education and skills building opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-initiative-to-help-women-entrepreneurs-in-india-101633113339589.html
