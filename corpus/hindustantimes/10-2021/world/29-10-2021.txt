As the Sunni Pashtun group starts to take over Afghanistan’s network of foreign delegations, Mohammad Shokaib has reportedly been sent to Pakistan’s capital as the first secretary or charge d'affaires at the embassy.The post of ambassador has remained vacant since the Ashraf Ghani-led government withdrew its envoy, Najibullah Alikhil, over the alleged abduction and assault of his daughter. The Afghan foreign ministry under the previous government had strongly condemned the “heinous act” and expressed its “deep concern over the safety and security of diplomats, their families, and staff members of the Afghan political and consular missions in Pakistan."Pakistan has not officially recognised the new Taliban government which came to power following years of insurgency, but Islamabad has been active in the government formation in the war-torn country. HT had earlier reported about Pakistan’s interference to sideline Mullah Baradar in the Taliban set-up and empower the Haqqani Network, the US-designated terrorist organisation.Pakistan foreign ministry has said that the latest appointment by the Taliban was mainly about ensuring consular functions."There are millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and there are visa issues as well," Reuters quoted the ministry spokesperson as saying.Apart from Shokaib’s appointment, two Afghan officials have also been appointed to run the consulates in Quetta and Peshawar. The appointments are significant in nature as both Pakistani cities are close to the two major border crossings with Afghanistan.Similar arrangements had been made in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, reported Reuters quoting two Taliban officials.The Afghan embassies are still largely run by the ambassador appointed by the Western-backed previous government as no country has given formal recognition to the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-sends-envoy-to-run-embassy-in-pakistan-amid-quest-for-recognition-report-101635523359321.html
29-10-2021||World||India, US call upon Taliban to prevent terror attacks from Afghanistan||India and the United States on Thursday called upon the Taliban once again to ensure terrorists never use Afghan soil to launch attacks on any country and agreed to continue close consultations on developments in that country.In a joint statement issued after the eighth meeting of the US-India Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and Designations Dialogue, the two sides also reiterated their call against terrorist proxies and cross-border terrorism in any form, which is thinly disguised call for Pakistan, which exports terror across its eastern border into India and into Afghanistan across the western front.India and the United States made clear who they meant when they called once again for bringing to justice the perpetrators of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists who had come from Pakistan and received instructions from Pakistani handlers during the attack that had lasted three days.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the attack, is in jail after being finally convicted in November 2020, after years of indulgent treatment by the Pakistani government. And Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, who led the operation, was jailed this past January for terror financing not specific to the Mumbai attack.The joint working group met on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington DC. Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary for counter terrorism at the Indian ministry of external affairs and John T. Godfrey, US state department acting coordinator for counterterrorism, led their respective delegations.The United States reiterated its commitment to standing together with the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism, the two sides said in a joint statement, adding, “Both sides strongly condemned any use of terrorist proxies and cross-border terrorism in all its forms and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack to be brought to justice.” They also called for concerted action against all terrorist groups, including groups proscribed by the United Nations Security Council, such as Al-Qaeda, Islamic State/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)In line with an earlier resolution of the UN Security Council, India and Afghanistan also urged the Taliban to ensure “Afghan territory is never again used to threaten or attack any country, shelter or train terrorists, or plan or finance terrorist attacks”.Both sides said they would continue close consultations on developments in Afghanistan and potential terrorist threats emanating from there. The two sides also exchanged views on countering narco-terror networks and trans-national illegal weapons smuggling networks.The two delegations also discussed ways to restrict the ability of terrorists to undertake international travel and they decided to expand terrorist threat information sharing and best practices on countering terrorism funding and the use of internet by terrorists to spread their message and recruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-call-upon-taliban-to-prevent-terror-attacks-from-afghanistan-101635521873773.html

Like many of its neighbors, Tonga's isolation has helped keep it safe but it faces big challenges should the virus take hold due to its under-resourced health system.The nearby nation of Fiji avoided significant outbreaks until April, when the delta variant ripped through the island chain, infecting more than 50,000 people and killing at least 673.Tonga's Prime Minister Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa said in a radio address that the traveler was among 215 passengers who had arrived on a flight from the New Zealand city of Christchurch on Wednesday and had been isolating at a quarantine hotel.The prime minister planned on Monday to make an announcement about any future lockdowns, according to news website Matangi Tonga.Christchurch had been free from the virus for months until this week, when four community cases were reported after a returning resident caught the virus while in Auckland, where an outbreak has been growing since August.New Zealand health officials said the traveler to Tonga was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and had returned a negative test before leaving for Tonga. The officials said they would be working with their Tongan counterparts to confirm the case and provide more details in the coming days.Tongan Health Ministry chief executive Dr. Siale ’Akau’ola said it was unfortunate the plane had already left Christchurch before the news came of the community cases there, Matangi Tonga reported.’Akau’ola said all frontline workers including health staff, police officers and airport staff who were on duty when the plane arrived had also been put into quarantine after the positive case was confirmed. He added that all those working near the flight had been vaccinated.Located northeast of New Zealand, Tonga is home to about 106,000 people. About 31% of Tongans are fully vaccinated and 48% have had at least one dose, according to research group Our World in Data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-tonga-reports-its-1st-ever-case-from-plane-traveler-101635493037283.html
29-10-2021||World||Will Taliban hand over Bagram airbase for CT ops to China or US?||With a number of international terrorist groups now operating from Afghanistan rising, the Taliban cabinet is convening on Friday to examine if Bagram airbase, north of Kabul, could be handed over to a third country for helping the Sunni Pashtun Islamists to launch counter-terror operations in the country. The two countries in reckoning are Pakistan backed China and the US, which left the airbase on July 5, 2021, after two decades of operations.The jostling of power within the Taliban government with defence minister Mullah Yaqoob on one side and Pakistan ISI backed interior minister and global terrorist Sirajuddin Haqqani on the other side has led to total chaos in governance as a consequence of which terrorist groups have homed in Afghanistan as a base for operations. It is precisely because of this unfolding scenario that Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa differed with outgoing ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as the former felt that there would be a huge Islamic fall-out on Pakistan. While both Pakistan PM Imran Khan and DG ISI gloated over the Taliban occupation of Kabul, army chief Bajwa differed from them as the fear was that Pakistan would turn into a rabid Islamic state like Afghanistan under the Taliban.At present, the US is worried about al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network whose boss runs the Taliban government, and the so-called Islamic State of Khorasan Province growing in numbers in Afghanistan and exporting terror to the west, China is worried about three terrorist groups operating in Af-Pak region that have taken explicitly anti-Beijing positions and followed through violence. India specific groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba who have ideological affiliations with the Taliban vis Deobandi and Ahle-Hadith platforms have also started using Afghanistan for launching operations across the Radcliffe Line.While China has decided to open another military base in Tajikistan to monitor the Wakhan corridor that juts into highly restive Xinjiang province, it is courting the Taliban regime via Pakistan to ensure that Uighur terrorists do not start launching operations against the Xi Jinping regime from Afghanistan. Even for the safety of its Belt and Road Initiative, China is worried about three terrorist groups. They are:· Balochistan Liberation Army: They attacked the Chinese consulate In Karachi with three suicide bombers in 2018/· Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan: An offshoot of Taliban, they claimed responsibility for the April 2021 car bomb explosion next to a hotel in Balochistan’s capital city where the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan was due to stay. The bomb exploded just minutes before the ambassador arrived.· ISKP: An off-shoot of ISIS, the rabid Sunni force has started targeting the Chinese through propaganda if not bombs.It is not only China that is worried about the security situation in Afghanistan but also Central Asian Republics as terrorist groups like the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and theEast Turkestan Independence Movement have taken base in Afghanistan.With the Biden administration now openly acknowledging the presence of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime does not have the much-required air power to fight these terrorist groups as none can afford a prolonged battle on land again.Under the circumstances, the Taliban is considering handing over Bagram airbase for counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan to a third power. While Pakistan wants the Taliban to hand over the strategic base in Parwan province to China for monitoring, a section of the Taliban group is opposed to Beijing and would rather hand it over to the US again. As Central Asian Republics have denied base facilities to the US for over the horizon capabilities and Pakistan is still trying to cut out a deal with the Biden administration on this issue, the option of theUS conducting CT operations from the Bagram base is not ruled out. The benefit of the Bagram base being handed over to the US is that Washington will accompany this Taliban gesture with much required humanitarian and development aid for a country that is facing a severe drought situation. The great game is still not over in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-taliban-hand-over-bagram-air-base-for-ct-ops-to-china-or-us-101635481648530.html

Due to start in January, the online course offered by the Philadelphia-based school costs $3,800 and is expected to attract several thousand students per year.“It’s a program about blockchain and digital assets, we felt that we should talk the talk and walk the walk,” Guido Molinari, managing partner a Prysm Group, which is working with Wharton to develop the program, said in an interview. Wharton will use Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, to accept digital-asset payments.Over the years, there have been many university experiments with cryptocurrencies: Massachusetts Institute of Technology famously gave out Bitcoin to its students in 2014. Other colleges have begun letting students use crypto to pay tuition. In May, the University of Pennsylvania received the largest cryptocurrency gift in its history, $5 million from an anonymous donor. Wharton also has many notable alums actively involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who graduated in 1997, has pushed the company, as well as his SpaceX, to buy Bitcoin for their corporate treasuries. He’s also been a driver of wild price swings in so-called meme coins such as Dogecoin, and was instrumental in pushing the conversation about reducing Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact.Arthur Hayes, who started the BitMex exchange that pioneered perpetual Bitcoin futures, also graduated from Wharton. He faces charges that he failed to implement appropriate anti-money laundering protections on the exchange.Kevin Werbach, who will be the main instructor for the executive education course, has been teaching about the fundamentals of blockchain and crypto at the school since 2018. The new course will go beyond the basics, into how to value digital assets, regulation and policy, and examine various case studies.“Coinbase has 68 million verified users, any one of these users will benefit from this program,” Molinari said.The school doesn’t have any other plans to accept crypto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wharton-school-to-accept-bitcoin-as-mode-of-payment-for-one-of-its-courses-101635482546212.html

The Bangladesh's foreign ministry has maintained that contrary to all the “ongoing propaganda”, only six people died during the recent violence."Contrary to all the ongoing propaganda, only 6 people died during recent violence of which 4 were Muslims, killed during the encounters with law enforcing authorities, and 2 were Hindus, one of whom had normal death and another when he jumped in a pond. None was raped and not a single Mandir was destroyed," Bangladeshi foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said in the statement."However, deities or goddesses were vandalized. While the violence was unfortunate and should not have happened, the government took immediate action. The perpetrators have been arrested and now they are under police custody," Momen added.The foreign minister also called out a few "enthusiastic media houses and individuals" for spreading “cooked-up stories” regarding the violence to embarrass the government, branding it as “unfortunate”.AK Abdul Momen said the law-enforcing authorities are investigating the recent communal violence in the country which happened during the Durga Puja celebrations. "The government is committed to hand out justice to every wrongdoer and to save all its citizens irrespective of their faiths," he added.Momen also informed that a probe is underway in the incident wherein a person left a copy of the Holy Quran near the foot of a deity which sparked outrage on social media."Reportedly a drug-addict person left a copy of the Holy Quran near the foot of a deity when there was no worshippers or organizer at the Puja Mondop and another person took a photo of it and put it up in the social media, Facebook, sparking outrage," he said.Reports of tensions between religious groups of Bangladesh have come to light, days after communal violence that rocked various cities in Bangladesh. According to news agency ANI, at least 71 cases have been filed in different parts of the country in connection with the attacks on Hindus and around 450 were arrested for spreading rumours on social media.Communal violence broke out in several places in Bangladesh earlier this month after news emerged on social media about the alleged desecration of the Quran at a Durga Puja venue on the bank of Nanuar Dighi in the Comilla district of the country.The statement by the foreign ministry comes after Bangladesh information and broadcasting minister M Hasan Mahmud on Thursday said elements close to Pakistan who had opposed the 1971 liberation war want to create communal disharmony in his country. He emphasised that secularism remains the guiding spirit of the "nation and its Constitution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-single-temple-was-destroyed-bangladesh-foreign-ministry-on-communal-riots-101635474449607.html

On this day, the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as other organisations around the world, honour stroke survivors and support countries to identify and apply "best buy" interventions that reduce the risk of strokes.World Stroke Day was established by WSO to increase awareness and drive action on stroke around the world.According to WHO regional director for South-East Asia Poonam Khetrapal Singh, an estimated 70 per cent of strokes and 87 per cent of stroke-related deaths and disability-adjusted life years occur in low- and middle-income countries."The WHO South-East Asia Region is committed to strengthening health care services to prevent, treat and manage stroke, and to provide quality rehabilitative care for stroke-related disability," she said.All of these countries implement multi-sectoral action plans, while also expanding the provision of non-communicable diseases (NCD) services at the primary level, in line with the 2016 Colombo Declaration.Theme for World Stroke Day 2021For 2021 and 2022, the WSO campaign aims to focus on raising awareness of the signs of stroke and the need for timely access to quality stroke treatment. “When somebody has a stroke, every second that goes by is crucial. As brain tissue and millions of neurons begin to fade away, time could not be more precious,” the organisation stated on its website.What is a stroke?According to the World Stroke Organization, a stroke is a non-communicable condition where the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, resulting in oxygen starvation, brain damage and loss of function. A stroke is most frequently caused by a clot in an artery supplying blood to the brain, a situation known as ischemia.The chances of a stroke increase significantly by age and globally, around one in every four adults above the age of 25 have at least one stroke in their lifetime.Evidence has also shown that coronavirus infection increases an individual’s risk of stroke. As a result, countries across the world need to leverage every chance possible to improve health and well-being, increase health system efficiency, and promote social and economic empowerment and growth, the WHO regional director noted."A fairer, healthier, more sustainable region is ours to achieve," Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-stroke-day-2021-timely-access-for-quality-stroke-treatment-101635472571476.html
29-10-2021||World||Market research analyst qualified as speciality job to determine H-1B visa||In a major victory for H-1B employers, a federal court has approved a settlement under which the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has agreed to qualify market research analyst as a speciality occupation for the purposes of determining H-1B visa application of a foreign professional.Based on its prior interpretation of the Occupational Outlook Handbook — a Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics publication profiling hundreds of occupations in the US job market — the USCIS was determining that market research analysts did not qualify as a "specialty occupation".The settlement approved by the federal district court in the Northern District of California would now let companies request that the USCIS reopen and re-adjudicate their denied H-1B petitions."This settlement is an important victory that will benefit hundreds of American businesses and the market research analysts they sought to employ," said Leslie K Dellon, senior attorney (business immigration) at the American Immigration Council."The settlement gives US businesses another chance to have their H-1B market research analyst petitions approved — this time under new guidance worked out by the parties to the lawsuit. Each H-1B petition reopened and approved will represent another opportunity for US employers and the workers they sponsored to advance their business objectives," she said.The class action lawsuit in this regard was filed by the American Immigration Council, American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the law firms Van Der Hout LLP, Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (formerly Joseph & Hall P.C.), and Kuck Baxter Immigration LLC.Jeff Joseph, partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP, said this settlement finally resolves an issue on which immigration lawyers have been battling the government for years."This settlement strikes the right balance between what the regulations actually say and how employers evaluate a candidate's professional qualifications in the real world. It is our sincere hope that USCIS will now interpret other specialty occupations from a perspective that is in line with what actually happens in the free market," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/market-research-analyst-qualified-as-speciality-job-to-determine-h-1b-visa-101635472377272.html
29-10-2021||World||Leaked photo shows Meta's rumoured smartwatch with front-facing camera||Meta Platforms Inc., the company formerly known as Facebook Inc., is developing a smartwatch with a front-facing camera and rounded screen, according to an image of the device found inside one of the tech giant’s iPhone apps.The photo shows a watch with a screen and casing that’s slightly curved at the edges. The front-facing camera -- similar to what you’d see on a smartphone -- appears at the bottom of the display, and there’s a control button for the watch on the right side. The image was found inside of the company’s app for controlling its new smart glasses launched in partnership with Ray-Ban. The picture was located by app developer Steve Moser and shared with Bloomberg News. A Meta spokeswoman declined to comment.The watch has a detachable wrist strap and what appears to be a button at the top of the watch case. Its large display mimics the style of Apple Inc.’s watch -- rather than the more basic fitness trackers sold by Google’s Fitbit and Garmin Ltd. The camera suggests the product will likely be used for videoconferencing, a feature that would make Meta’s device stand out. Apple’s smartwatch doesn’t have a camera, nor do rival products from companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. Facebook has been planning to launch its first watch as early as 2022, but a final decision on timing hasn’t been made yet and the debut could be later, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The company is working on three generations of the product aimed at different release time frames, the person said. The device in the image could ultimately represent a version that is never released, but it’s the first evidence of the company’s work on the project. The presence of the image in the glasses app, called Facebook View, could indicate the watch will be managed on iPhones and Android devices using that app too. Code inside the software indicates that the watch could be dubbed “Milan.” The code also suggests the camera will be capable of capturing both photos and videos and downloading them to a phone.A smartwatch would be a new major hardware category for Meta, which currently sells virtual reality headsets and Portal video-chat devices. On Thursday, the company said it is working on a new high-end headset codenamed “Project Cambria” that mixes virtual and augmented reality. Meta has said a future watch could work as an input device or accessory for its headsets. If Meta launches the watch next year, it would go up against the next generation of Apple devices. That company is planning as many as three new Apple Watches for 2022, including an Apple Watch Series 8 with a body temperature sensor, a new low-end Apple Watch SE and a rugged model geared at athletes, Bloomberg has reported. A move into smartwatches would escalate a rivalry between Meta and Apple, which have battled over app store policies and privacy changes to the iPhone operating system. Apple is also planning to debut its first mixed-reality headset as earlier as next year, which would compete with the upcoming high-end Meta headset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaked-photo-shows-meta-s-rumoured-smartwatch-with-front-facing-camera-101635465981068.html
29-10-2021||World||US returns antiquities to India in stolen art investigation||US authorities returned about 250 antiquities to India on Thursday in a long-running investigation of a stolen art scheme.The items, worth an estimated $15 million, were handed over during a ceremony at the Indian Consulate in New York City. The centerpiece is a bronze Shiva Nataraja valued at $4 million, authorities said.The ceremony stems from a sprawling probe by the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the Homeland Security Investigations arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The investigation has focused on tens of thousands of antiquities allegedly smuggled into the United States by dealer Subhash Kapoor, who has denied the allegations.The case "serves as a potent reminder that individuals who maraud sacred temples in pursuit of individual profit are committing crimes not only against a country’s heritage but also its present and future,” District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.Authorities say Kapoor — jailed in India and facing charges there pending a U.S. extradition request — used his Arts of the Past gallery in New York to traffic looted treasures from India and various countries in Southeast Asia. The investigation has resulted in the recovery of 2,500 artifacts valued at $143 million and convictions of six Kapoor co-conspirators, Vance said.The Shiva Nataraja bronze was sold by the mother of Nancy Wiener, a gallery operator who pleaded guilty in the case this month to charges of conspiracy and possession of stolen property, authorities said. Nancy Wiener sold looted items to major museums in Australia and Singapore, they said.In June, the district attorney’s office returned more than two dozen artifacts worth $3.8 million to Cambodia as part of the investigation. Another 33 objects were sent back to Afghanistan in April.Court papers filed in New York says Kapoor went to extraordinary lengths to acquire the artifacts, many of them statues of Hindu deities, and then falsified their provenance with forged documents. They say Kapoor traveled the world seeking out antiquities that had been looted from temples, homes and archaeological sites. Some of the artifacts were recovered from Kapoor’s storage units in New York.Kapoor had the items cleansed and repaired to remove any damage from illegal excavation, and then illegally exported them to the United States from their countries of origin, according to US prosecutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-returns-antiquities-to-india-in-stolen-art-investigation-101635466307849.html

It said it would not change its corporate structure.The metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley, refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.The company unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, replacing its thumbs-up "Like" logo with a blue infinity shape.Zuckerberg said the new name reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services.The company said in a blog post that it intends to start trading under the new stock ticker it has reserved, MVRS, on Dec. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-be-called-meta-in-nod-to-its-metaverse-vision-101635447377143.html
29-10-2021||World||N. Korea's Kim lost 20 kgs but remains healthy: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has recently lost about 20 kilograms (44 pounds), but remains healthy and is trying to boost public loyalty to him in the face of worsening economic problems, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers Thursday.The National Intelligence Service gave the assessment during a closed-door parliamentary briefing, saying it used artificial intelligence techniques, an analysis of super-resolution video of Kim and other methods to investigate Kim’s condition, said two lawmakers who attended the session.Kim’s health has been a focus of keen outside attention in recent months because he has appeared noticeably thinner in state media photos and videos. Kim, 37, hasn’t publicly anointed a successor and some experts say an abrupt incapacitation could trigger chaos in the impoverished nuclear-armed country.Despite Kim's thinner appearance, longtime North Korea observers have said Kim has no apparent health problems and his weight loss is likely the result of his efforts to improve his physique. They noted that he has continued his regular public activities and no unusual developments have been seen in North Korean videos.But unconfirmed rumors about him have continued to appear, with one tabloid claiming that recent public appearances used an impostor. The NIS dismissed that report as groundless, lawmaker Kim Byung-kee said.He said the NIS told the parliamentary session that Kim’s weight has fallen from about 140 kilograms (308 pounds) to 120 kilograms (264 pounds). The NIS has previously said Kim is about 170 centimeters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall.It said Kim has been engaged in public activities for 70 days so far this year, a 45% increase from the same period last year.The lawmaker said the NIS found that Kim had photos of his late father and grandfather — who ruled North Korea before him — removed from a Workers’ Party conference room.Another lawmaker, Ha Tae-keung, quoted the NIS as saying North Korea has begun using the term “Kimjongunism,” a political ideology named after Kim Jong Un that is independent of existing ideologies named after his father and grandfather, “KimJongilism” and “Kimilsungism.”After about 10 years in office, Kim is struggling to overcome what appears to be the toughest period of his rule due to economic hardships worsened by the coronavirus pandemic.According to the NIS, North Korea’s annual trade with China, its main ally and economic lifeline, declined by two-thirds to $185 million through September this year compared to the previous year, Ha said.North Korean officials are struggling to deal with soaring prices of goods and shortages of medicine and other essential supplies that have accelerated the spread of water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever. The country has also been unable to import the paper and ink it uses to print banknotes, forcing North Korean officials to issue temporary currency, according to Ha’s account of the NIS briefing.While reduced trade has limited the supply of materials needed for industrial activity, North Korean officials are pushing workers hard to increase production. Excessive factory operations caused an explosion at a major fertilizer plant in August, Ha quoted the NIS as saying.The NIS corroborated recent reports by the World Health Organization that North Korea is beginning to ease its tough COVID-19 border restrictions to receive outside help.The western North Korean seaport of Nampo is now “saturated” with supplies from the outside world after authorities recently began allowing increased maritime transport and the entrance of medical supplies, according to the NIS. North Korea is preparing to open another seaport in the northwest, Yongchon, to handle the increased supplies and is also considering restarting rail transport with China and Russia, it said.North Korea has yet to report any cases of the coronavirus. While experts have questioned its claim of a perfect record, Ha said the NIS has yet to see any signs of a major COVID-19 outbreak.Despite its severe virus-related border controls, North Korea hasn’t shown the same kind of urgency for vaccines, as mass immunizations continue to be delayed amid global shortages.Ha said North Korea has rejected outside offers of Russian and Chinese vaccines. Kim, the lawmaker, said the NIS has determined North Korea also hasn't shown interest in obtaining Pfizer vaccines, which would require negotiations with the drugmaker and the U.S.Analysts say North Korea could be uneasy about international monitoring requirements that would be attached to vaccines it receives from the outside world. There are also views that Kim Jong Un has domestic political motivations to tighten the country’s self-imposed lockdown as he calls for unity and tries to solidify his grip on power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-s-kim-lost-20-kgs-but-remains-healthy-report-101635428006576.html
