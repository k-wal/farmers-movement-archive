The Kremlin critic narrowly survived a nerve-agent attack in Siberia last year that he and Western governments blamed on Russian secret services. Russia denied any role in his poisoning.The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, in August accused Bellingcat of being staffed by former foreign secret service agents.The designation of Bellingcat came on the same day that Dmitry Muratov, one of the founders of independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, won the Nobel Peace Prize together with a journalist from the Philippines.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/investigative-outlet-bellingcat-labelled-foreign-agent-by-russia-101633714845255.html

The committee had said that the margin of benefit against risk is “too small” to advise on a universal programme of vaccination for healthy 12 to 15-year-old children.While the United States has continued to administer the Pfizer vaccine to adolescents, it had issued a warning to watch for the symptoms of myocarditis, the rare inflammatory heart condition.In July, European Medicines Agency said that it had found a possible link between myocarditis and mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have developed mRNA-based vaccines which are being used in the United States on a massive scale to vaccinate the population.Here are some of the steps some countries are taking:United KingdomBritain has opted for a cautionary approach in administering mRNA-based vaccines by offering only the first shot Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The second dose of the two-dose regimen will not be offered until at least spring when there may be more data on the cases.SwedenCiting an unpublished Nordic study, Sweden has decided to halt the use of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine for younger groups. The Swedish health agency said it would pause using Moderna's Covid shot for people born in 1991 and later.NorwayThe Scandinavian country has been offering only one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to children aged 12-15.DenmarkThe Danish Health Agency has clarified that the statement suggesting suspension of Moderna's vaccine use was in fact a miscommunication. Denmark on Friday said that it was continuing the use of mRNA-based vaccine among under-18s.FinlandData from some studies have suggested that reported cases of rare heart inflammation were higher after receiving Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech shots. Finland has halted the use of the Moderna vaccine to men born in 1991 and later and instead offer Pfizer's vaccine.Hong KongAn advisory panel to the Hong Kong government has recommended that children aged 12-17 should get only one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heart-inflammation-risk-from-pfizer-moderna-shots-here-s-how-countries-are-responding-101633702972813.html

The total bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan for 2019-20 was at $ 1.5 billion.India also helped operationalise the Chabahar Port in 2017 and also established the India- Afghanistan Foundation (IAF) in the same year which enhances economic, scientific, educational, technical as well as cultural cooperation between the two countries.Jaishankar said that based on what India has done for the people of Afghanistan they are in a better position to understand who has been a better friend. “The differences are obvious,” Jaishankar said.Jaishankar also criticised Pakistan and said that every nation wants to have a good relationship with its neighbours but in a manner that respects the rules-based international order. “Everybody wants to be friends with their neighbours. But you want to be friends on terms which a civilised world will accept. Terrorism is not one of those terms,” Jaishankar said.He said that Pakistan uses terrorism as an instrument of statecraft which is unacceptable. He also said that neighbours exist to foster connectivity, trade, bilateral cooperation and growth. “Nothing like this has happened with this neighbour,” he further added.‘Multipolar Asia’The external affairs ministers said that a multipolar world cannot exist without a multipolar Asia, in an apparent reference to the race between India and China to become the world’s largest superpower. “In the next 75 years, India and China will be among the premier powers in the world.Jaishankar said that both nations should give each other space and mutual respect should remain between both nations. “It is important that there is mutual respect between both nations and they give each other space. I’ve spoken earlier about a multipolar world. I think it's very important we have a multipolar Asia. You're not gonna have a multipolar world if you don't have a multipolar Asia,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-know-who-were-better-friends-jaishankar-slams-pak-for-aiding-terror-101633704473853.html

What do we know about the blast so far||An explosion at a Shiite mosque in Afghanistan's Kunduz city has left at least 100 people killed or wounded, The Associated Press reported citing a Taliban police official. Dost Mohammad Obaida, the deputy police chief for Kunduz province, told AP that the “majority of them have been killed” in the blast, which the Taliban government has deemed as a suicide attack.If the death toll from the latest suicide attack is confirmed, it would be the highest since the US and NATO troops completely pulled out from the war-torn country.Citing initial findings, Matiullah Rohani, director of culture and information in Kunduz, has said that the explosion in the Shiite mosque was a suicide attack, reported news agency AFP. While no group yet has claimed responsibility for the attack, the Islamic State has a long history of targeting Shiite Muslims and has claimed similar recent atrocities.ISIS Khorasan was behind the suicide blast outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport which killed dozens of civilians and 13 US Marines in the final days of US troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan.The blast occurred at the Gozar-e-Sayed Abad Mosque during a Friday noon prayer service, the highlight of the Muslim religious week when the mosques are typically crowded. Photos and videos from the scene showed the stairs at the entrance of the mosque was covered in blood as rescuers were trying to carry a body to the ambulance. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had initially said that an unknown number of “Shiite compatriots” were killed or injured.ISIS-K is made of hardline Sunni Islamist militants, just like the Taliban, but the two groups are sworn enemies. ISIS-K has been involved in some of the deadliest terror attacks in recent years. The leaders of ISIS-K rejected the deal between the Taliban and the US that has led to the withdrawal of foreign troops. According to a UN report, the strength of ISIS-K could be anywhere between 500 to 10,000.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-attack-in-afghanistan-mosque-what-do-we-know-about-the-blast-so-far-101633701106510.html

A number of sailors on board the USS Connecticut were injured in the accident. None of the injuries were life-threatening, a statement from the US Pacific Fleet said on Thursday.It's unclear what the Seawolf-class submarine may have hit while it was submerged."The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition. USS Connecticut's nuclear propulsion plant and spaces were not affected and remain fully operational," the US Navy statement said.Asked for his reaction, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that “China is severely concerned about this accident”.“The US as the side involved in this incident should inform the relevant details including the location, purpose of this navigation, details of the accident and what did the submarine run into and whether any nuclear leakage has taken place and whether local maritime environment was harmed”, he said.He also said that the US' assertion to conduct air and naval sorties in the name of freedom of navigation was the cause for this incident.“I also want to emphasise that for some time the US side has been acting, making waves in the SCS under the banner freedom of navigation. This is the source of this accident, severely threatening and imposing serious risks to the regional peace and stability”, he said.“The US has been delaying uncovering the details of this accident. It is acting without any transparency and responsibility,” he said.Zhao said that China and the relevant countries in the SCS have to doubt the facts and the US intention.China claims most of the SCS. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims over the area. Over the years, China has built a number of military installations in the reclaimed islands in the SCS and deployed a big fleet of its naval ships and submarines.Citing the incident, China also said that the US' move to sell nuclear subs to Australia under AUKUS will increase nuclear risks in the region.“This incident has shown that the sales of the nuclear submarine through AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) to Australia will lead to dissemination of nuclear technology and materials and intensify regional security risks,” he said.This would increase the possibility of nuclear risks in the region.“Relevant countries should abandon the outdated cold war mentality and narrow minded geopolitical vision and stop such wrong acts that will destroy the regional peace and stability as well as development,” he said.China also asked the US to sever defence and official ties with Taiwan while reacting to reports that US troops were training Taiwanese troops.He also asked the US to sever military and official ties with Taiwan, while reacting to reports that a small number of US special operations forces were deployed in Taiwan on rotational basis to train Taiwanese forces.Reports quoted a Pentagon spokesman John Supple as highlighting that the US support for defence relationship with Taiwan “remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China."China views Taiwan as a breakaway province. However, democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state. Beijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification with Taiwan.The One China principle which emphasises that Taiwan is part of China is the political foundation for China-US ties, Zhao said.“The US must sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan and abrogate its mutual defence treaty with Taiwan and must withdraw” from the estranged island, he said.The US should only stick to the commitments to maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan, he said, adding that China is firm in defending its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.Tensions flared up between China and Taiwan as the Chinese military since October 1 flew a record 150 air force jets into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the weeklong holidays to celebrate China’s National Day.The issue figured in Wednesday's talks between top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Zurich during which the two sides have agreed to improve the strained ties.The intensity of China’s air raids prompted US President Joe Biden to remind his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that they have agreed to abide by the “Taiwan agreement” during their telephone talks last month."I've spoken with Xi about Taiwan. We agree ... we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement. We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement," Biden had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demands-answers-as-us-nuclear-submarine-suffers-damage-in-south-china-sea-101633699423928.html

The talk focused on the recognition of the Taliban government in Kabul, international sanctions on Afghanistan, access to Afghanistan and counter-terrorism cooperation, it was reported,The US outlined to Pakistan that it wants the nation to ensure that the Taliban uphold its pledges made during the takeover of government in the war-torn nation. The US wants Pakistan to make sure that the Taliban respect inclusive governance, human rights, education for girls and allow women to work. It stressed that Pakistan should continue making efforts to soften the Taliban stance regarding these issues.The Taliban have disallowed women from working in government offices and have not accommodated any woman minister in its Cabinet.During the meeting with Qureshi, both Pakistan and the US agreed to work together for peace in Afghanistan. “We look forward to continuing to address pressing regional and global challenges,” Sherman said after meeting with Qureshi. Her meeting comes days after Qureshi met US secretary of state Antony Blinken.Sherman met Pakistan NSA Yusuf to also discuss the areas of cooperation in the US-Pakistan relationship as well as the Afghanistan situation.

Peace and tranquility in these areas of differing perceptions has been possible by adherence to existing agreements and protocols between the two countries,” an official told the Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet opposing New Delhi’s consistent stand that the northeastern state is an integral and inalienable part of India.India and China are locked in an ongoing 17-month long military standoff along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged Sino-India bilateral ties to the worst chill in decades.Several rounds of diplomatic and military dialogues have failed to resolve the dragging impasse between the two militaries.The latest incident comes days ahead of the next round of military talks with the PLA, which is scheduled to take place on October 12, as per reports from New Delhi.Speaking at a virtual India-China track-II dialogue in September, India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, had urged China to separate the ongoing border tension in eastern Ladakh from the larger boundary dispute, saying the primary concern now is to restore peace and tranquility along the LAC and not resolving the decades-long boundary disagreement.Misri said day-to-day affairs along the disputed border should be addressed through existing established agreements and protocols, which are not to be confused with the long-term mechanisms in place for the final resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-aware-china-on-reports-of-its-soldiers-detention-in-arunachal-pradesh-101633691888935.html

Pictures showed plumes of smoke rising into the air over Kunduz.Another video showed men shepherding people, including women and children, away from the scene. Frightened crowds thronged the streets.Aminullah, an eyewitness whose brother was at the mosque, told AFP: "After I heard the explosion, I called my brother but he did not pick up."I walked towards the mosque and found my brother wounded and faint. We immediately took him to the MSF hospital."A female teacher in Kunduz told AFP the blast happened near her house, and several of her neighbours were killed. "It was a very terrifying incident," she said."Many of our neighbours have been killed and wounded. "A 16-year-old neighbour was killed. They couldn't find half of his body. Another neighbour who was 24 was killed as well."Kunduz's location makes it a key transit point for economic and trade exchanges with Tajikistan.It was the scene of fierce battles as the Taliban fought their way back into power this year.Often targeted by Sunni extremists, Shiite Muslims have suffered some of Afghanistan's most violent assaults, with rallies bombed, hospitals targeted and commuters ambushed.Persecuted communityShiites make up roughly 20 percent of the Afghan population. Many of them are Hazara, an ethnic group that has been heavily persecuted in Afghanistan for decades.In October 2017, a lone IS suicide attacker struck a Shiite mosque as worshippers gathered for evening prayers in the west of Kabul, killing 56 people and wounding 55 including women and children.And in May this year, a series of bombings outside a school in the capital killed at least 85 people -- mostly young girls. More than 300 were wounded in this attack on the Hazara community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-multiple-causalities-as-explosion-targets-mosque-in-kunduz-city-101633690667794.html

08-10-2021||World||Finland backs Sweden, other nations against Moderna's Covid-19 shots||Finland has joined other Nordic countries in suspending or discouraging the use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in certain age groups because of an increased risk of heart inflammation, a rare side effect associated with the shot.The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare said Thursday that authorities won't give the shot to males under age 30. They will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine instead. The government agency said it found that young men and boys were at a slightly higher risk of developing myocarditis.The move by Finland followed similar decisions by three neighboring countries on Wednesday. Sweden suspended the use of Moderna for people under 30, Denmark said those under 18 won't be offered the Swiss-made vaccine, and Norway urged those under 30 to get the Pfizer vaccine instead.All four countries based their decision on an unpublished study with Sweden's Public Health Agency saying that it signals “an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle or the pericardium” — the double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the main vessels. It added: “The risk of being affected is very small.”The preliminary information from the Nordic study has been sent to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction committee to be assessed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finland-backs-sweden-other-nations-against-moderna-s-covid-19-shots-101633687969740.html

08-10-2021||World||Journalists Maria Ressa, Dmitry Muratov awarded 2021 Nobel Peace Prize||Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize “for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression", which the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a “precondition for democracy and lasting peace.” Announcing the name of the peace prize laureates, Norwegian Nobel Committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen said that Ressa uses freedom of expression to expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in the Philippines, her native country. In 2012, Ressa co-founded Rappler, a digital media company for investigative journalism. Ressa has focussed on Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's controversial “war on drug” campaign that has claimed thousands of lives. Human rights organisations have claimed the Philippines' police are falsifying evidence to justify the unlawful killings. Ressa and her digital media company have also documented the spread of fake news, harassing opponents and manipulation of public discourse using social media.Russian journalist Dmitry Andreyevich Muratov co-founded the newspaper Novaja Gazeta, which, according to the committee, is the most independent newspaper in the country today. The committee said that Murato has for decades defended freedom of speech in  Russia under “increasingly challenging conditions.”The Russian newspaper has been publishing critical articles questioning the abuse of power, corruption, electoral fraud and “troll factories”. Novaja Gazeta's journalists have faced harassment, threats, and violence from its opponents and six of its journalists have been killed so far, including Anna Politkovskaja who wrote “revealing articles” on the war in Chechnya.“Despite the killings and threats, editor-in-chief Muratov has refused to abandon the newspaper’s independent policy,” the committee said.The committee stressed that free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda. It further stated that freedom of expression and freedom of information are crucial prerequisites for democracy and protection against war and conflict.“The award of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov is intended to underscore the importance of protecting and defending these fundamental rights,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-maria-ressa-dmitry-muratov-awarded-2021-nobel-peace-prize-101633682118858.html
08-10-2021||World||Greta Thunberg to Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: Here are the Nobel Peace Prize 2021 favourites||The Nobel Institute will announce the much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize 2021 in the Norweigan capital of Oslo on Friday, and a host of names – from climate campaigner Greta Thunberg to Belarus opposition leaders, and even media watchdogs are among those who have been tipped for the prestigious prize. It is, however, a giant guessing game as the institute is not known to publish a shortlist unlike some of the other Nobel recognitions. The Nobel Peace Prize this year will be announced at 0900 GMT (around 2:30pm Indian time) when the wooden doors of the Nobel Institute's main hall creak open to make way for Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who will announce the winner.The Nobel committee received as many as 329 nominations this year, and it will have the tough task to choose who is deemed most worthy of the prestigious honour in 2021. Among those whose names have been generating the most buzz this year are –> Media watchdogs: Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or the International Fact-Checking Network> Anti-corruption watchdog: Transparency International> Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and her two allies, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo> Ales Bialiatski, another opponent of Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko, who is widely regarded as authoritarian and his claim to power in the August 2020 elections fraudulent> Climate change activists such as Greta Thunberg, who was 2019's TIME Person of the Year and has been a favourite for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since then.> Alexei Navalny, one of the most influential critics of Russian president Vladimir Putin, although his name is being bandied about to a lesser extent this year.> The World Health Organisation could also be a potential laureate this year, considering the impact that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has left in this world and the emergence of a global authority on the associated protocols.> Other world leaders – such as US president Joe Biden, German chancellor Angela Merkel, or New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern, are also said to be in the race, according to TIME Magazine, but the matter is entirely speculative at this point.Whoever wins, it is not yet known whether the laureate will be able to travel to Oslo to pick up the award, due to the pandemic. The prize -- consisting of a diploma, a gold medal and a cheque for 10 million kronor (980,000 euros, $1.1 million) -- is traditionally awarded on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prize creator Alfred Nobel. The Peace Prize is the only Nobel to be awarded in the Norwegian capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-to-svetlana-tikhanovskaya-here-are-the-nobel-peace-prize-2021-favourites-101633679431168.html

The development comes a day after a landmark court ruling that experts said could lead to Poland's divorce from the EU like the United Kingdom's exit."Poland's place is and will be in the European family of nations," Morawiecki said in a Facebook post, adding that joining the bloc was "one of the highlights of the last decades" for Poland as well as the European Union, as quoted by news agency AFP.The Polish top court on Thursday ruled that some EU treaty articles were "incompatible" with Poland's constitution and warned EU institutions not to "act beyond the scope of their competencies" by interfering with the country's judiciary.The ruling rejecting EU's supremacy, France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told the BFM-TV broadcaster in an interview, "is very serious... there is the risk of a de-facto exit" of Poland from the EU. "I do not want the exit of Poland," he added.Poland and the EU are at odds over judicial reforms introduced by Poland's governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party which Brussels warns threaten the country's democracy.However, the EU Commission said that it would use all the tools available to to ensure the primacy of EU law in Poland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-will-be-in-the-european-family-of-nations-pm-morawiecki-on-polexit-speculations-101633679809731.html
08-10-2021||World||Merck's Covid-19 pill must be combined with other treatments to avert resistance, says expert||Merck & Co.’s experimental pill for Covid-19 should be accompanied by other treatments as soon as they’re available to cut the risk of drug resistance that would limit its effectiveness, Welcome foundation director Jeremy Farrar said.While yet to be cleared by regulators, Merck’s molnupiravir has been hailed as a potential breakthrough, as it could be relatively cheap and easy to make, doesn’t require infusion and has shown it reduces the risk of hospitalization in a trial. Yet it may need to be combined with other drugs to head off resistance, Farrar said.Resistance occurs when viruses and bacteria evolve to blunt or defeat drugs’ mechanism of attack. It’s a constant concern for antivirals and antibiotics and has already been seen with Covid treatments such as Eli Lilly & Co.’s antibody therapy. Farrar suggested Merck’s pill would be no exception, despite optimism that it may be a potent new weapon to fight the pandemic. “The thought that you could have an oral drug readily available that you could take as soon as you have a suspicion of infection -- that’s a huge step forward globally,” Farrar said. But he emphasized the importance of combining it with other drugs as soon as possible to “delay the onset of resistance.”Earlier ExperimentsWhile this is always a concern for anti-infectives, the likelihood that it will become a severe problem for molnupiravir appears to be low, said Nick Kartsonis, senior vice-president of clinical research for infectious diseases and vaccines at Merck Research Labs. Earlier experiments with other viruses showed that the evolution of resistant mutations was rare, he said. The course of treatment is short, meaning that viruses get few chances to evolve into resistant forms. Another reason lies in the drug’s mechanism of action. Pioneered by researchers at Emory University and other academic centers and later licensed by Merck’s partner Ridgeback Therapeutics LP, molnupiravir works by introducing errors into the coronavirus’s genetic material. The errors are then replicated until the virus is defunct.Merck’s analysis has shown that the errors induced by the drug are spread more or less randomly throughout the viral genome. That means that the virus has fewer opportunities to develop mutant forms that will overcome those errors. “That in and of itself makes resistance a tough thing,” Kartsonis said. Still, although Merck isn’t pursuing combinations right now, molnupiravir may be more effective if used with other drugs that prove successful, Kartsonis said. That may also lower the potential for resistance even further, he said. Attacking PathogensMany drugs have been far more effective in combination than when used on their own. The first drugs developed for HIV, when used singly, quickly stopped working because resistant strains evolved that could defeat the drugs’ attack. By attacking pathogens from several angles, drug cocktails make the evolution of such variants less likely. Now, HIV combination treatments stay effective in individual patients for years. Numerous other companies are working on pills to treat Covid through a variety of approaches. Pfizer Inc. began late-stage trials of an oral treatment this summer and expects data before the end of the year. Israel-based Redhill Biopharma Ltd.’s experimental therapy, opaganib, cut deaths in a group of patients with moderately severe Covid, according to data released earlier this month. Wellcome itself has pledged 8 million pounds ($11 million) for a project, called Covid Moonshot, to find a drug that would block a key protein the coronavirus uses to replicate. An early study published last week showed molnupiravir has the potential to cut the rate of hospitalization and death by around 50% in mild to moderate Covid patients. A widely available Covid pill could be “massively important” in developing countries where hospital access is limited and vaccinations aren’t readily available, Farrar said.Lining UpCountries are already lining up to secure supplies of the Merck drug. The company has said it will file for U.S. authorization as soon as possible, and European Union drug authorities may begin a rolling review of the drug that could speed clearance there. Still, preventing the disease through vaccines remains a better strategy than relying on treatment, U.S. presidential adviser Anthony Fauci said Wednesday.The Wellcome foundation has been fighting for more equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments for Covid-19 and is funded by a 29 billion-pound ($39 billion) investment portfolio. Farrar spoke in an interview ahead of a conference of Gesda, the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Accelerator, a group that tries to bring scientists and politicians closer together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mercks-covid-19-pill-must-be-combined-with-other-treatments-to-avert-resistance-101633668754130.html
08-10-2021||World||Isolated China, the last country chasing Covid zero, resolves to stamp out every infection||For much of the pandemic, a group of places in the Asia-Pacific brought infections to zero, becoming virus-free havens in a world ravaged by the pathogen. Now, with the rise of the delta variant and the proliferation of vaccines, only one is still holding fast to that goal of eliminating Covid-19: China. With New Zealand preparing to shift away from the zero-tolerance strategy, China’s isolation is complete, raising the stakes on how long it can stick to a playbook that requires closed borders, abrupt lockdowns, and repeated disruption of social and economic activity. One by one, Covid Zero places like Singapore and Australia have decided that the approach is unsustainable, pivoting instead to vaccination to protect people from serious illness and death while easing off on attempts to control the number of infections. In contrast, China’s resolve to stamp out every infection appears to have only grown stronger, though 75% of its vast population is fully vaccinated. The country is now grappling with its fourth delta-driven flareup in two months and this week locked down a prefecture in the western Xinjiang province over two asymptomatic infections during a peak tourism period. The Chinese territory of Hong Kong, which has so far avoided local transmission of delta, has also made clear that its status as a global financial hub is less important than links to the mainland and the joint goal of elimination. The task is likely to get even harder as cold weather -- the conditions in which the virus spreads best -- descends. In three months, Beijing will host the Winter Olympics, welcoming thousands of athletes from around the world. “Covid Zero in the medium- to long-term is unsustainable,” said Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician and professor at the Australian National University Medical School. “Delta shows the almost impossibility of that. It’s hard to see how China will be able to get to zero Covid this winter.” Still, the status has become a political point of pride for China, with authorities trumpeting their success in containing the virus as an ideological and moral victory over the US and other nations now treating the virus as endemic.China’s Covid-Zero strategy risks leaving it isolated for yearsNew Zealand pivot New Zealand’s planned shift underscores the mounting futility of the elimination strategy. In mid-August, the country went into the highest level of restrictions when a single person was diagnosed with Covid-19 in Auckland. No working in the office. No going out to dinner or the gym or church. In most cases, no leaving the house. Seven weeks later, it’s still reporting more than two dozen infections daily, prompting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to acknowledge on Monday that “long periods of heavy restrictions have not gotten us to zero cases.”  “But that is OK,” she said. “Elimination was important because we didn’t have vaccines. Now we do, so we can begin to change the way we do things.”It’s an adjustment already made by Singapore and Australia, two other lauded examples of containment. In both places, fatigue among the population had grown over stop-start cycles of lockdown and travel curbs that imposed weeks of mandatory quarantine on new arrivals. In Taiwan, officials said that elimination was too difficult to achieve earlier this year after a large outbreak, though it’s now reported no cases for several days straight. The abandonment of the zero-tolerance goal now does not mean the strategy was wrong-headed from the start. The approach allowed these economies to suppress Covid fatalities to a very low level, getting through the pre-vaccine period of the pandemic with little damage -- unlike the U.S. and Europe. New Zealand has suffered 27 Covid-related deaths while Singapore has seen just 121. “If New Zealand can vaccinate widely, get access to new treatments and open cautiously, they’ll have escaped the pandemic with little economic or health loss,” wrote Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University Medical School, in Scotland. “They managed to press pause and wait for scientific solutions toward a sustainable exit.” Degree of control The question is now what China’s exit strategy will look like. It reported two new local cases on Oct. 5, one in each of the outbreaks - in Harbin and Xinjiang - that are currently underway. In the most recent flareup in Xinjiang, tens of thousands of residents are being tested, while Yining city has halted all trains and flights and closed the local highways, The Paper reported. Two people were found to be infected in the city of Horgos on Oct. 3, which borders Kazakhstan. Though all 38,376 residents were tested and found negative for the virus, and the two original cases were asymptomatic, all tourists in the prefecture Horgos is located in -- Yili -- have been stopped from returning home and told to stay indoors until further notice. Local governments were arranging food and lodging for them, the Beijing Youth Daily reported.The latest breakout followed the contours of earlier ones. Officials shut down the northern city of Harbin after a single patient was hospitalized in September. The port of Ningbo, one of the world’s busiest, was closed in August, while manufacturing took a hit because of the restrictions. The sporadic resurgences are unlikely to stop, public health experts said. But China’s authoritarian government has always been capable of feats beyond the imagination of most other countries. “The kind of capacity and degree of control they can exert is remarkable,” said Michael Baker, a professor at the University of Otago’s Department of Public Health in Wellington, who sits on the New Zealand government’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Group. “It’s way beyond what we can do, not just from a point of view of resources but the social license that governments have. We wouldn’t be able to exert the kind of control that China is able to exert, even in achieving a good end, which is managing an outbreak.” Officials in China have said they won’t stick to Covid Zero forever, though it will only consider a change when the approach no longer works or the costs are too high -- parameters of which have not been made public. City governments are being asked to create specialized quarantine facilities that could house thousands of overseas arrivals by the end of October, signaling that onerous travel curbs are unlikely to be eased in the near term.  Achieving elimination allowed life in China to be largely normal through most of 2020 and 2021, powering its economy even as most others were sapped by mitigation measures of various efficacy. But as its snap lockdowns and restrictions on movement continue through this year -- and western economies resume full operations after vaccination -- the impact is starting to show more deeply. Retail sales growth slowed to 2.5% in August from a year earlier, falling far short of the 7% expansion estimated by analysts. The best and worst places to be as we learn to live with deltaRegardless of China’s tolerance for the approach, some experts say that Covid-free havens may yet return. Governments like New Zealand could resurrect the goal if and when new medical options become available.“Maybe we are reaching the limits of what we can do with our current tools to eliminate transmission,” said Baker, who believes a Covid Zero strategy is still on the table. “We could find that the next generation of Covid vaccines or anti-virals are so effective that they can eliminate the virus quite effectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isolated-china-the-last-country-chasing-covid-zero-resolves-to-stamp-out-every-infection-101633668485859.html
08-10-2021||World||As concerns rise over Chinese ‘invasion’, Taiwan says it does not seek military confrontation||Days after Taiwan's defence minister expressed concerns that China could launch a “full scale” invasion as early as 2025, Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen said that the country does not seek military confrontation but will do whatever it takes to defend itself. According to the Reuters news agency, Ing-wen made the statement on Friday, amid high tensions in the country over the latest hostile policies initiated by Beijing and the Xi Jinping-led regime ramping up its military might in recent years.Also Read | Taiwan says China could launch ‘full scale’ invasion by 2025, tensions aggravateChina claims the democratic island of Taiwan as its own territory and says it should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan resists, saying it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy in the face of China's aggression.Beijing seems to have aggravated its hostile policies in recent days, with a record number of Chinese military aircraft repeatedly flying over Taiwan's air defence identification zone throughout the week. Taiwan's radars spotted as many as 150 Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing's continued harassment of the island.On Wednesday, Taiwan's defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng, while replying to a lawmaker's question in the country's parliament, said that military tensions with China are at their worst in more than 40 years. He noted that there was an added risk of “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait; and that while China already has the required arsenal to take Taiwan by force, the cost of a “full scale” war for Beijing might be at its lowest by 2025, when a potential invasion seems likely.Meanwhile, Taiwan is doing whatever it can to defend itself. The government has introduced a plan, currently under parliamentary review, for special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for homemade weapons including missiles and warships. Over the next five years, the country plans to invest mostly in naval weapons – including anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems.Also Read | Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-PacificThe United States, Taiwan's main military supplier, has confirmed its “rock-solid” commitment to Taiwan and also criticised China. A small number of US special operations forces have also been rotating into Taiwan on a temporary basis to carry out training of military forces, the Reuters news agency reported citing two people familiar with the matter, on the strict condition of anonymity. The Pentagon, which historically has not disclosed details about US training or advising of Taiwanese forces, did not specifically comment on or confirm the deployment.The United States is Taiwan's largest supplier of weaponry and has long offered some degree of training on weapons systems, as well as detailed advice on ways to strengthen its military to guard against an invasion by China's Peoples Liberation Army. Beijing, on the other hand, blames Washington's policies of supporting Taiwan with arms sales and sending warships through the Taiwan Strait for raising tensions. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-concerns-rise-over-chinese-invasion-taiwan-says-it-does-not-seek-military-confrontation-101633657567335.html

Nasa's Perseverence rover gets images of ancient river delta||Images from Mars reveal how water helped shape the Red Planet's landscape billions of years ago, and provide clues that will guide the search for evidence of ancient life, a study said Thursday. In February, Nasa's Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater, where scientists suspected a long-gone river once fed a lake, depositing sediment in a fan-shaped delta visible from space. The study in Science analysed high-resolution images captured by Perseverance of the cliffs that were once the banks of the delta.Layers within the cliffs reveal how its formation took place.Nasa astrobiologist Amy Williams and her team in Florida found similarities between features of the cliffs seen from the crater floor and patterns in Earth's river deltas.The shape of the bottom three layers showed a presence and steady flow of water early on, indicating Mars was "warm and humid enough to support a hydrologic cycle" about 3.7 billion years ago, the study says.The top and most recent layers feature boulders measuring more than a metre in diameter scattered about, probably carried there by violent flooding.But it is the fine-grained sediment of the base layer that will likely be the target of sampling for signs of long-extinct life -- if it existed -- on Mars.The findings will help researchers figure out where to send the rover for soil and rocks that may contain precious "biosignatures" of putative Martian life forms."From orbital images, we knew it had to be water that formed the delta," Williams said in a press release."But having these images is like reading a book instead of just looking at the cover."Finding out whether life may have existed on Mars is the main mission of Perseverence, a project that took decades and cost billions of dollars to develop.‘Profound’ missionOver the course of several years, the multi-tasking rover will collect 30 rock and soil samples in sealed tubes, to be eventually sent back to Earth sometime in the 2030s for lab analysis. Last month mission scientists announced Perseverance had collected two rock samples in Jezero that showed signs they were in contact with groundwater for a long period.Their hope is that the samples might at one point have hosted ancient microbial life, evidence of which could have been trapped by salt minerals.Learning that Mars might once have harboured life would be one of the most "profound" discoveries ever made by humanity, Williams said.She also expressed wonder at having a window onto an ancient river system on another planet.“It's really eye-opening to see something no one on Earth has ever seen before,” she said.Perseverance landed on February 18, and the study looks at long-distance images it captured during its first three months on Mars.About the size of an SUV, it is equipped with 19 cameras, a two metre (seven foot) long robotic arm, two microphones, and a suite of cutting-edge instruments.One of them is called the SuperCam, a tool that laser-zaps rocks from a distance in order to study their vapour with a device that reveals their chemical composition.It took seven months for Perseverance to travel from Earth to Mars with its sister craft Ingenuity, a tiny helicopter whose rotors have to spin five times faster than Earth versions to get lift in the far-less-dense atmosphere.The plan is for the rover to cross the delta, then the ancient lake shore, and finally explore the edges of the crater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasa-s-perseverence-rover-gets-images-of-ancient-river-delta-101633655916775.html

According to the reports, the US navy officials issued a statement on Thursday informing that there were “no life-threatening injuries” and that the submarine remains “fully operational”; however, the statement missed out on providing any clarity as to the nature of the object that the vessel encountered.Also Read | China lashes out after US warship sails past Mischief Reef in South China SeaThe Seawolf-class nuclear-powered submarine, named USS Connecticut, ran into the said ‘object’ five days ago, but the incident was not announced before Thursday in order to maintain operational security. The statement issued by the US Pacific Fleet was quite brief and did not mention what the object actually was, although it clarified that Connecticut remains in a “safe and stable condition”. The submarine's nuclear propulsion plant also remains unaffected, the statement noted.“The extent of damage to the remainder of the submarine is being assessed,” the US Navy said, without elaborating much on the location of the encounter. It added that that the incident will be investigated.Two officials of the US Navy, however, speaking to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, discussed details not yet announced publicly. They confirmed that the incident occurred in the South China Sea while the USS Connecticut was conducting routine operations. According to the officials, it is not yet clear what exactly the object was that the submarine encountered underwater, but it was definitely not another submarine. One of the officials said that it could have been a sunken vessel, a container, or any other sort of uncharted object.Also Read | Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-PacificThe impact of the encounter was noticeable to everyone on board the submarine, the officials said. Two sailors sustained moderate injuries, while at least nine others had minor injuries like scrapes and bruises.

According to CNN, the USS Connecticut submarine was operating in these international waters as the US with its allies have been carrying out a major multinational show of force in the region, known as Carrier Strike Group 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nuclear-submarine-hits-unknown-object-in-south-china-sea-here-s-what-the-navy-said-101633653153678.html
08-10-2021||World||Tesla will move its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas, says Elon Musk||Tesla Inc. is moving its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas, where a new factory for the Model Y and forthcoming Cybertruck is nearing completion, relocating from California after making the Golden State its home for 18 years.  Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced the move at the Austin plant on Thursday during the electric vehicle maker’s shareholder meeting.Tesla has been based in Palo Alto, California, the leafy Silicon Valley suburb that’s home to Stanford University and several venture capital firms, since its founding in 2003. But the company has grown from a scrappy startup to the world’s most valuable automaker and Texas -- centrally located between the two coasts -- has become its center of gravity in the US.Musk’s decision to move the headquarters to Texas comes despite growing discomfort among some companies with the state’s policies, such as a recent abortion law -- that’s been temporarily blocked -- and efforts to restrict voter rights. But Tesla is just the latest California company to move to Texas, which has lower taxes, a lower cost of living, and fewer business regulations. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. has shifted its base to Houston and Charles Schwab Corp. moved its headquarters to the Dallas area from San Francisco.“We welcome Tesla home!” Austin Mayor Steve Adler said in an email. “It’s a tech company that creates the clean manufacturing, middle-skill jobs Austin needs.”The carmaker joins a number of other tech companies with operations in Austin. Dell Technologies was founded in the city, and Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. have a large presence. Oracle Corp. said last year it was moving its headquarters to Austin from Silicon Valley, one of several transplants to the Texas state capital during the pandemic.“This is the newest economic development trophy on Governor Abbott’s wall,” John Boyd, a corporate relocation consultant based in Princeton, New Jersey, said by phone on Thursday. The move is important to the state’s efforts to attract tech talent and also to Tesla’s efforts to appeal to a wider swath of U.S. consumers with the launch of its new pickup, he said.“Tesla is trying to expand its brand and appeal to Middle America,” Boyd said.Musk said Tesla isn’t abandoning California, noting the electric-car maker will continue to expand manufacturing in the state and aims to boost production at its vehicle factory in Fremont -- and at its Nevada battery plant -- by 50%.  “We will continue to expand our activities in California. This is not a matter of Tesla leaving California,” he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office and the state’s economic development agency didn’t respond to requests for comment. There have been several clues such a move was in the offing. Musk, the world’s richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, moved his private foundation to Texas in December. Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s chief financial officer, bought a house in a tony district of Austin and Tesla has datelined each of its last two press releases from Austin. Musk moved to Texas himself last year to focus on two big priorities for his companies: SpaceX’s new Starship vehicle, under development on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville, and Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin. Texas has no personal income tax, while California imposes the highest personal income levies in the nation on its wealthiest residents. Texas is the company’s third-biggest market in the U.S. after California and Florida, though years of opposition from auto dealers mean it can’t sell its electric cars directly there. In 2010, Tesla purchased a shuttered auto plant across the San Francisco Bay in Fremont. Roughly 10,000 people work at the plant, a former joint venture between General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., and scores of other Tesla employees work at showrooms, service centers, and offices throughout the region. Musk’s long-term relationship with California soured in the spring of 2020 during the first wave of the coronavirus. When Alameda County ordered production stopped at Tesla’s plant in Fremont, Musk openly defied public health officials by closing late and reopening early, blasting the rules as “fascist” on an earnings call. He briefly sued the county, but Tesla has continued to expand its footprint in the Golden State. A new “Megafactory” that will make Mega packs -- the energy-storage product Tesla sells to utilities -- is under construction in the Central Valley city of Lathrop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-will-move-its-headquarters-from-silicon-valley-to-texas-says-elon-musk-101633652579866.html
08-10-2021||World||Pakistan quake kills at least 22||An earthquake of magnitude 5.9 hit southern Pakistan in the early hours of Thursday, killing 22 people, most of them women and children, and injuring about 300, at a time when many victims were asleep, authorities said.Disaster management officials said the death toll may increase, Geo News reported.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre in Islamabad reported that the epicentre of the earthquake was near Harnai at a depth of around 15km. It further said the exact damage has not yet been confirmed.The quake affected Quetta, Sibi, Harnai, Pishin, Qila Saifullah, Chaman, Ziarat and Zhob in Balochistan. Most of the deaths and injuries were reported from the remote north-eastern district of Harnai, with landslides triggered by the jolt blocking some roads and hampering rescue efforts in the area.The US Geological Survey said it was a 5.9 magnitude quake that struck at a shallow depth. Shallow quakes can cause more damage.The death toll of 22 was confirmed by deputy commissioner of Harnai district Sohail Anwar Hashmi. There were six children among the dead.“I was sleeping when suddenly my entire house jolted,” Munir Shah, 40, a resident of Harnai district in Balochistan province, told Reuters.“I took my children and wife outside. It was a terrifying situation as houses in Harnai were collapsing, my house was also damaged,” he added. “I found a large number of people under debris. Some of them might have died.”“I tried to take out my children, but the jolt was so strong,” Rafiullah, a farmer in the mountainous Pakistani district of Harnai, told AFP.The roof of his mud house collapsed and knocked Rafiullah unconscious when the earthquake struck.“When I regained consciousness, I pulled out two of my sons,” he said. But his youngest boy, only around one, had been struck by a wooden beam, and “had already died”.More than 100 mud houses collapsed and many buildings were damaged, said district official Anwar. Television images showed buildings with gaping cracks, caved-in roofs and crumpled walls.About 250 homes collapsed and many people were killed by falling roofs and crumbling walls in the district’s Babu Mohallah neighbourhood, said Nawab Khan, a local journalist.“The entire town is a picture of devastation, as no house looks safe, thousands of people are rendered homeless and are under open sky,” Khan said, adding that almost 70% of power supply to the district had been disrupted.Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered immediate assessment of the damages and offered condolences to families that lost loved ones, adding, “I have ordered immediate assistance on an emergency basis ... for the earthquake victims.”Social media showed houses shaking and light fittings swaying as the quake struck. Stunned residents later gathered in the streets in the dark. Geo Television carried CCTV footage of trucks shaking.Rescuers sifted rubble for survivors, with some of the injured being treated on stretchers in the street by torchlight from mobile telephones.“The earthquake struck at about 3am,” said one resident, Muzaffar Khan Tareen, adding that some of the seriously injured were in hospital awaiting ambulances to take them to Quetta.An army helicopter flew at least nine of the seriously injured to Quetta, state-run Associated Press Pakistan said.Aftershocks were being felt across the region. Pakistan sits on top of colliding tectonic plates and earthquakes are common.A quake of 7.7 magnitude that hit Quetta in 1935 killed between 30,000 and 60,000 and destroying much of the city.In 2005, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 killed about 73,000 people when it struck about 95km northeast of the capital, Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-quake-kills-at-least-22-101633648302047.html
08-10-2021||World||China-US talks: Joe Biden, Xi Jinping likely to meet virtually before year-end||Top Chinese and US diplomats have held talks which were constructive and conducive to enhancing mutual understanding in Zurich, paving the way for further talks in the future, the Chinese official media reported on Thursday.Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met US national security adviser Jake Sullivan for six-hour talks in the Swiss city on Wednesday.While the Chinese official statement on the talks did not mention it, reports quoted a White House official as saying that President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden were likely to have a virtual meeting before the end of the year.According to the Chinese readout, the two sides agreed to take action, following the spirit of the phone call between Chinese and US heads of state on September 10, to strengthen strategic communication and properly manage differences.The two countries, it added, agreed to “…avoid confrontation and conflict, seek mutual benefit and win-win results, and work together to bring China-US relations back on the right track of sound and steady development”.“The US side needs to have a deep understanding of the mutually beneficial nature of China-US relations and correctly understand China’s domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions,” Yang said, adding that China opposes defining China-US relations as “competitive.”Yang Jiechi said that China attaches importance to the positive remarks on China-US relations made recently by Joe Biden, and China has noticed that the US said it has no intention to contain China’s development, and is not seeking a “new Cold War.”White House statement on the Swiss meeting said Jake Sullivan stressed to Yang Jiechi the need to maintain open lines of communication, while raising concerns about China’s recent military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities and Beijing’s efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong.The White House said the meeting was intended to serve as a follow-up to last month’s call between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in which Biden stressed the need to set clear parameters in their competition.The meeting in Zurich was held in the backdrop of heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington over a range of issues including Taiwan.It was Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with Yang Jiechi since their bitter exchanges in Alaska in March, which also involved US secretary of state Antony Blinken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinaus-talks-joe-biden-xi-jinping-likely-to-meet-virtually-before-yearend-101633604642885.html
