Those crew members conducted two spacewalks and deployed a 10-meter (33-foot) mechanical arm before returning to Earth in mid-September.The new crew includes two veterans of space travel. Pilot Zhai Zhigang, 55, and Wang Yaping, 41, the only woman on the mission, and Ye Guangfu, 41, who is making his first trip to space.The crew was seen off by a military band and supporters singing “Ode to the Motherland,” underscoring the weight of national pride invested in the China’s space program that has advanced rapidly in recent years.The crew’s scheduled activities include up to three spacewalks to install equipment in preparation for expanding the station, assessing living conditions in the module and conducting experiments in space medicine and other fields.China’s military-run space program plans to send multiple crews to the station over the next two years to make it fully functional. Shenzhou-13 is the fifth mission to the structure, including trips without crews to deliver supplies.When completed with the addition of two more modules — named Mengtian and Wentian — the station will weigh about 66 tons, a fraction of the size of the International Space Station, which launched its first module in 1998 and will weigh around 450 tons when completed.The two additional Chinese modules are due to be launched before the end of next year during the stay of the yet-to-be-named Shenzhou-14 crew.China's Foreign Ministry on Friday renewed its commitment to cooperation with other nations in the peaceful use of space.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said sending humans into space was a “common cause of mankind,” and China would “continue to extend the depth and breadth of international cooperation and exchanges” in crewed spaceflight and “make positive contributions to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe.”China was excluded from the International Space Station largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese program’s secretive nature and close military ties, prompting it to launch two experimental modules before starting on the permanent station.U.S. law requires congressional approval for contact between the American and Chinese space programs, but China is cooperating with space experts from countries including France, Sweden, Russia and Italy. Chinese officials have said they look forward to hosting astronauts from other countries aboard the space station once it becomes fully functional.China has launched seven crewed missions with a total of 14 astronauts aboard since 2003, when it became only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to put a person in space on its own. Two Chinese astronauts have flown twice.Along with its crewed missions, China has expanded its work on lunar and Mars exploration, including placing a rover on the little-explored far side of the Moon and returning lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s.China this year also landed its Tianwen-1 space probe on Mars, whose accompanying Zhurong rover has been exploring for evidence of life on the red planet.Other Chinese space programs call for collecting soil from an asteroid and bring back additional lunar samples. China has also expressed an aspiration to land people on the moon and possibly build a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects. A highly secretive space plane is also reportedly under development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-3-person-crew-to-its-space-station-on-6-month-mission-101634317567797.html

The mission was the second successful human spaceflight conducted by the company that was founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, one of the front runners in space travel.Following this, the Duke of Cambridge William, in an interview to the BBC, said that earth should first be fixed instead of trying to find the next place to go. “We need some of the world's greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” he said during the interview on Thursday. “I think that ultimately is what sold it for me - that really is quite crucial to be focusing on this [planet] rather than giving up and heading out into space to try and think of solutions for the future,” he further said. However, he made no direct reference to Bezos or Shatner in his comment.Also read | ‘Space? We have a lot to do here’: Bill Gates explains why he is not ‘trying to escape planet earth in a spaceship’In response, Shatner said that William “got the wrong idea” in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “The idea here is not to go, 'Yeah, look at me. I'm in space’...No,” Shatner said defending his journey. Further, he also gave a message to William in which he said that the efforts were the first step in taking polluting industries off of earth.“I would tell the prince, and I hope the prince gets the message, this is a baby step into the idea of getting industry up there, so that all those polluting industries, especially, for example, the industries that make electricity... off of Earth,” Entertainment Tonight quoted Shatner as saying. But he also agreed with the argument that some issues need to be addressed.Certainly William is not the first person who has expressed his criticism for space travel on air. Recently Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates too, during an appearance in a late night talk show, expressed similar opinions and popularly said, “Space? You know, we have a lot to do here on earth.”Also, Bezos is not the only billionaire experimenting on space travel. Previously Virgin group’s Richard Branson himself travelled to space while Tesla founder Elon Musk was a part of the Inspiration4 mission. On their part, Bezos and Musk have both publicly acknowledged the criticism directed at them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/got-the-wrong-idea-william-shatner-responds-to-british-prince-william-s-criticism-on-space-race-101634317747821.html

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s new set-up is likely to again feature four Indo-Canadian ministers after that number dropped to three earlier this year following a resignation.The date of the swearing-in ceremony was announced in a statement issued by Justin Trudeau. The newly-elected House of Commons will meet for the first time on November 22 as parliament will return on that date.Justin Trudeau precipitated mid-term polls hoping to turn his minority government into a majority one. But the elections held on September 20 gave the ruling Liberal Party 160 seats, 10 short of the majority mark, and just three more than what it had captured in 2019. The results were also almost similar for the principal opposition Conservative Party, which ended up with 119 seats, two fewer than in 2019.Justin Trudeau has already said that deputy prime minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland will retain her twin portfolios in the new Canada cabinet. However, there is speculation over some changes that are likely. Most important among them is the potential shifting of defence minister Harjit Sajjan to another ministry, as fallout of a sexual misconduct crisis that erupted in the Canadian Armed Forces under his watch.Of the other Indo-Canadians in the outgoing Canada cabinet, public services minister Anita Anand is almost certain to be promoted after she featured as a star campaigner leading up to the elections as Justin Trudeau referred to her as his government’s “minister of vaccines”.Diversity, inclusion and youth minister Bardish Chagger is also expected to return to the Canada cabinet, but whether she retains that portfolio remains to be seen.There is a strong possibility Trudeau will appoint another Indo-Canadian to the cabinet, since it always featured four in total until then minister Navdeep Bains retired from electoral politics in January.A statement from the PMO said the new Canada cabinet “will remain gender-balanced” and that could provide an opportunity for a promotion for either former parliamentary secretary Kamal Khera, outgoing chair of the House of Commons standing committee on Procedure and House affairs Ruby Sahota, or Sonia Sidhu, who was a member of the House of Commons standing committee on health. Each of them is from the Greater Toronto Area, which played a crucial role in keeping Justin Trudeau in power.Another Indo-Canadian, Harnirjodh George Chahal, who was elected from Calgary Skyview in Alberta, may have been a certainty for a cabinet berth, but as he is being investigated for alleged electoral malpractice, his chances may have receded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-indo-canadians-likely-to-feature-in-pm-justin-trudeau-s-new-cabinet-101634309039175.html
15-10-2021||World||UK MP David Amess dies after being stabbed multiple times in eastern England||British Conservative lawmaker David Amess has died after being stabbed Friday during a meeting with constituents at a church in eastern England. A 25-year-old man has been arrested.The Essex Police force said officers were called to reports of a stabbing in Leigh-on-Sea just after noon Friday. It said “a man was arrested and a knife recovered.“We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the wider public," police said.The force said later that a man injured in the stabbing had died. It did not release his name. The suspect is being being held on suspicion of murder, police said.Sky News and others said Amess was attacked during a regular meeting with constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in a residential area of Leigh-on-Sea, a seaside town east of London.Aerial footage showed several ambulances and an air ambulance was waiting nearby to the church.John Lamb, a local councilor, said Amess had not been taken to hospital more than two hours after the attack and the situation was “extremely serious.”Amess, 69, had been a member of Parliament for Southend West, which includes Leigh-on-Sea, since 1997, but has been a lawmaker since 1983. He was a well-liked member of Parliament, best known for his ceaseless campaign to have Southend declared a city.Politicians from across the political spectrum expressed shock at initial reports of the stabbing. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer tweeted that it was “Horrific and deeply shocking news. Thinking of David, his family and his staff.”Former Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, tweeted: “Very alarming and worrying news reports coming from Leigh-on-Sea. My thoughts and prayers are with Sir David Amess and his family.”Violence against British politicians is rare, but in June 2016 Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox was fatally stabbed and shot in her northern England constituency. A far-right extremist was convicted of her murder.Cox's widower, Brendan Cox, tweeted that “Attacking our elected representatives is an attack on democracy itself. There is no excuse, no justification. It is as cowardly as it gets.”British lawmakers are protected by armed police when they are inside Parliament, but have no such protection in their constituencies. Amess published the times and locations of his open meetings with constituents on his website.Two other British lawmakers have been attacked this century during their “surgeries,” regular meetings where constituents can present concerns and complaints.Labour legislator Stephen Timms was stabbed in the stomach and injured in May 2010 by a female student radicalized by online sermons from an al-Qaida-linked preacher.In 2000, Liberal Democrat lawmaker Nigel Jones and his aide Andrew Pennington were attacked by a man wielding a sword during such a meeting. Pennington was killed and Jones injured in the attack in Cheltenham, England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmaker-stabbed-during-meeting-with-constituents-reports-101634303748026.html
15-10-2021||World||US allows entry to fully vaccinated foreigners from November 8||The US will open its borders to vaccinated foreign travelers on Nov. 8, a White House official said, a move that will expand travel options for those who’ve gotten their shots and clamp down on those who haven’t.The measures are the biggest changes to US travel policy since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, and replace a system that flatly barred most foreign nationals coming directly from certain places, including Europe, India, Brazil and China.Instead, under the new system, vaccinated people who have had a negative test in the prior 72 hours will be able to board a flight to the US as long as they share contact tracing information. Unvaccinated foreigners will be generally barred from entry, while unvaccinated Americans will need a negative Covid-19 test.The move was first announced Sept. 20, but the Biden administration didn’t immediately say when the measures would kick in. Airlines, battered by the coronavirus crisis, have applauded the move. Transatlantic flights between the US and Europe -- filled with premium travelers -- had been the single most profitable part of the global aviation market. The Nov. 8 date applies to a change in air travel rules, as well as an opening along land borders with Canada and Mexico announced earlier this week.The US will consider people arriving by plane vaccinated if they received shots that are either authorized by the Food and Drug Administration or have an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization. The same will likely apply to those arriving by land, the official said.The decision to accept WHO-cleared shots not used in the US means millions of travelers who have received doses developed by AstraZeneca Plc, as well as China’s Sinopharm Group and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., will be allowed to enter.It’s not yet clear how the US will treat people who have mixed shots -- one dose of one vaccine followed by a dose of another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-vaccinated-foreigners-to-enter-from-november-8-101634303789989.html

The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and Brexit have led to a shortage of workers up to a point that thousands of animals had to be culled on farms.The government will also enable meat processors to store slaughtered pugs for up to six months in a bid to ease up pressure on farms, reported Bloomberg. The move will allow the industry to preserve the slaughtered meat for a longer period and process it later on. The UK’s National Pig Association (NPA) said that the industry continues to be in a “very difficult phase” but the latest measure shows the government has finally listened.”“The NPA believes that around 6,000 pigs have been culled so far on farms due to space pressures, which are continuing,” it said in a statement. “But this will help and it shows the Government, finally, has listened.”According to Bloomberg, about 120,000 pigs had nowhere to go at the start of October which could have resulted in massive “welfare” culls. Such measures are taken to ease pressure on farms but the animals are killed to use them as pet food instead of pork.NPA chief executive Zoe Davies said in a statement that the announcement aimed at reducing the significant pig backlog on farms has come as a huge relief."We are working with the processors to understand the impact of these new measures and to determine exactly what will happen now, and how quickly, so that we can give pig farmers some hope and stem the flow of healthy pigs currently having to be culled on farms," Davies said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-offers-visas-to-foreign-butchers-after-farms-forced-to-kill-6-000-pigs-101634294553174.html

Currently, Britain carries out about a million Covid-19 tests in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) confirmed that multiple testing sites across might have faced this problem.The UK health security agency (UKHSA) announced that the lab in Central England’s Wolverhampton has been suspended from carrying out RT-PCR tests after reports of false-negative test results. According to a report by the Guardian, the problem came to light after a probe was conducted into reports of people receiving negative RT-PCR test results after they had tested positive for Covid-19 on a lateral flow device (LFD).“Around 400,000 samples have been processed through the lab, the vast majority of which will have been negative results, but an estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative PCR test results mostly in southwest England,” the UKHSA said in a statement. These 43,000 people received false Covid-19 test results between September 8 and October 12.The health agency pointed out that it was an isolated incident which is attributed to one lab, adding, the National Health Service (NHS) will contact the affected people and urge them to take another test.Dr Will Welfare, the public health incident director at UKHSA, said that there is no proof of any faults with the PCR or LFD test kits and people should remain confident in using them and other lab services which are being provided at present, the Guardian report also said.Meanwhile, the West Berkshire Council, a local authority in England, instructed residents who were tested for Covid-19 at the government-run Newbury Showground site between October 3-12, to undergo fresh tests after they were given false-negative test results. Close contacts of such residents have also been told to take another test.The United Kingdom has so far reported 8,317,439 cases due to coronavirus disease which include 138,237 deaths, 6,802,672 recoveries and 1,376,530 active cases. On Thursday, the UK saw another high of 45,066 new cases while 157 patients died due to the viral disease.

India, Germany, Australia and the UK played a leading role in organising the two-day talks. The joint statement on cybersecurity said governments “recognise the need for urgent action, common priorities and complementary efforts to reduce the risk of ransomware”.The participating countries also said efforts will be made to improve network resilience; address the abuse of financial mechanisms to launder ransom payments or conduct other activities that make ransomware profitable; and to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem via law enforcement collaboration and diplomatic engagement.On the need to show resilience against ransomware attacks - the discussions on which were led by India at the summit on cybersecurity - the statement said efforts will be made to address it not just as a technical issue but as one that “requires effective policy frameworks, appropriate resources, clear governance structures, transparent incident response procedures, a ready workforce, partnership with the private sector, and consistently enforced legal and regulatory regimes”.On countering illicit finance - discussion on which were led by the UK - the statement said efforts focus on “enhanced international cooperation to inhibit, trace and interdict ransomware payment flows, consistent with national laws and regulations, which will drive down economic incentives for ransomware actors”.On disrupting the ransomware ecosystem through law enforcement - a subject was anchored by Australia - the participating countries said the focus will be on “timely and consistent collaboration across law enforcement, national security authorities, cybersecurity agencies and financial intelligence”.And on diplomacy - the cybersecurity discussions on which were led by Germany - the countries resolved to leverage “diplomacy through coordination of action in response to states whenever they do not address the activities of cybercriminals”.Other governments that participated in the cybersecurity initiative, apart from the EU bloc, are Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ushosted-india-led-summit-identifies-ransomware-as-major-cybersecurity-threat-101634292718249.html

But the local affiliate of ISIS, known as Islamic State Khorasan, have stepped up attacks after the Taliban's takeover.

15-10-2021||World||Biden administration plans to reinstate 'Remain in Mexico' policy in November||The Biden administration said it plans to reinstate a Trump-era border policy next month to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in US immigration court, complying with a judge's order.It hinges on approval of the Mexican government, which has raised concerns that US officials are working to address, the Justice Department said in a court filing late Thursday. Mexico wants cases to generally conclude within six months and ensure that asylum-seekers have timely and accurate information about hearing dates and times and better access to legal counsel.Mexico also wants exemptions for “particularly vulnerable populations” and better coordination on locations and times of day that asylum-seekers are returned to Mexico.About 70,000 asylum-seekers have been subject to the “Remain in Mexico” policy, known officially as “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which President Donald Trump introduced in January 2019 and Biden suspended on his first day in office. A federal judge sided with the states of Texas and Missouri by ordering the Biden administration in August to reinstate the policy “in good faith.” The court filing says it should be in effect around mid-November.US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas, a Trump appointee, left open the possibility that the administration could try again to end the policy, and officials say they will release a plan soon that they hope will survive legal scrutiny.US Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas ended the policy in June after an internal review, saying it achieved “mixed effectiveness.”Illegal border crossings fell sharply after Mexico, facing Trump's threat of higher tariffs, acquiesced in 2019 to the policy's rapid expansion. Asylum-seekers were victims of major violence while waiting in Mexico and faced a slew of legal obstacles, such as access to attorneys and case information.The administration will rebuild tent courts in Texas border cities of Laredo and Brownsville at a monthly cost of $24.6 million to operate, according to the court filing, and is working to ensure there is capacity in a system that is backlogged with 1.4 million cases.Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said Thursday that it has concerns about asylum-seekers getting fair treatment in court under the policy, having access to legal counsel and being safe.Mexico said it also has raised questions about another U.S. policy to expel migrants without a chance to seek asylum. Trump invoked those powers, known as Title 42 authority, in March 2020 on grounds of preventing spread of the coronavirus. The Biden administration has strongly defended the special powers.“Mexico will continue discussion with the US executive branch, with the aim of achieving a regional migration policy that is safe, orderly and regulated,” the Foreign Relations Department said.US officials say the renewed “Remain in Mexico” policy will be applied to people who don't qualify for Title 42 authority. The policy was last used largely on people from Spanish-speaking countries but officials say eligible nationalities have not been determined.Broad outlines of the reinstated policy come as the Biden administration has yet to develop the “humane” asylum system that the president promised during his campaign after quickly dismantling many Trump policies. Illegal border crossings have soared under Biden's watch, with record numbers of unaccompanied children and, in September, the arrival of about 15,000 mostly Haitian migrants at a camp in Del Rio, Texas.Homeland Security said in a statement that it “remains committed to building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system that upholds our laws and values.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-plans-to-reinstate-remain-in-mexico-policy-in-november-101634284739958.html

At least four people were killed during clashes at Hajiganj sub-district in Chandpur bordering Cumilla on Wednesday and dozens injured in clashes in multiple districts so far. The violence later spread to a number of Durga Puja venues in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.People familiar with the matter said the Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) was behind the violence in Durga Puja pandals in southern Bangladesh and that the attacks were perpetrated with the motive to embarrass the Sheikh Hasina government and stoke communal fires.Authorities in Bangladesh moved promptly and deployed paramilitary forces in several districts to stop the violence from spreading, a move acknowledged by India.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that anyone involved in the attacks on Hindu temples and Durga Puja venues in Cumilla will not be spared irrespective of which religion they belong to. "The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn't matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished," she said on Thursday, reported Dhaka Tribune.Hasina made the remarks as she exchanged greetings with people of the Hindu community during an event at Dhakeshwari National Temple in Dhaka on the occasion of Durga Puja. She said the vandalism of temples in Cumilla was” very unfortunate" and that those who are unable to earn the confidence and trust of the people and have no ideology can carry out such attacks."We are getting a large amount of information. We will definitely trace those who carried out the attacks... This is the age of technology," she added. "They must be found. We did so in the past and will do it in the future, too. They must face due punishment. Exemplary punishment will be given so that none can dare to engage in this type of incident in future," she said, according to the Dhaka Tribune.India has said it is in “very close contact” with Bangladesh over the attacks on Durga Puja gatherings and that the neighbouring country’s government “reacted promptly to ensure control of the situation, including the deployment of the law enforcement machinery”. “We also understand that the ongoing festive celebrations of Durga Puja continue in Bangladesh with the support of the government of Bangladesh agencies and, of course, a large majority of the public,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-on-edge-after-durga-puja-violence-security-tightened-101634276449027.html

(Petrobras), may be privatized, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday."I want to privatize Petrobras, yes, I do. I shall see together with the economic team what we can do," Bolsonaro told Novas de Paz radio.The president's comments have already led to a more than 1% increase in the state-owned company's share price, according to Brazilian news portal Suno.Brazil's largest energy company has been the subject of numerous corruption scandals. On October 4, Petrobras paid the Brazilian authorities, as well as the United States, a fine of $853 million as part of a 2018 agreement following an investigation into the Lava Jato corruption case.The anti-corruption investigation into Petrobras money-laundering began in 2014. The company's senior management was accused of receiving a 3% commission from a number of contracts. These funds were allegedly later used to bribe politicians and officials. According to the Brazilian authorities, through overpricing and bribes, the participants in the money-laundering scheme gained up to $3.8 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-president-bolsonaro-considers-privatization-of-petrobras-101634266603216.html

Violent attacks were also reported on pandals in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.Officials also said that the elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and armed police were also ordered to be on guard along with the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) in 22 of the 64 administrative districts and elsewhere to contain any violence.

State Premier Daniel Andrews has said some curbs will ease next week as Victoria's double-dose vaccination levels race towards the 70% mark from 63% now.Australia had stayed largely virus-free for most of this year until a third wave of infections fuelled by the fast-moving Delta variant spread across its southeast from late June, forcing a months-long lockdown in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.Canberra, the national capital, on Friday exited its more than two-month lockdown, allowing cafes, pubs and gyms to reopen with strict social distancing rules.Sydney lifted its stay-home orders earlier this week and the city's 5 million residents could enjoy more freedoms from Monday, as double-dose vaccination rates are expected to top 80% over the weekend - the level at which officials have promised to relax more restrictions.However, travel to regional areas from Greater Sydney will be delayed until Nov. 1 due to lower vaccination rates there versus Sydney, New South Wales Deputy Premier Paul Toole told radio station 2GB on Friday.Daily infections in New South Wales eased further to 399 from 406 on Thursday, well down from the state's pandemic high of 1,599 in early September.The federal government has been pressing states to reopen their borders but some virus-free states have said they may delay reopening plans amid concerns that a rapid reopening could overwhelm their health systems.The country's overall coronavirus numbers are still relatively low, with some 139,000 cases and 1,506 deaths.(Reporting by Renju Jose; editing by Richard Pullin)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-continues-to-report-high-number-of-covid-19-cases-101634259197881.html

The 193-member UN General Assembly elected all 18 candidates proposed by the world organisation’s five regional groups. Benin was the top vote-getter with 189 votes, followed by Gambia with 186, while the United States with 168 and Eritrea with 144 was at the bottom of the list.“The absence of competition in this year’s Human Rights Council vote makes a mockery of the word `election,’” said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director for Human Rights Watch. “Electing serious rights abusers like Cameroon, Eritrea, and the United Arab Emirates sends a terrible signal that UN member states aren’t serious about the council’s fundamental mission to protect human rights.”He said Cameroon’s government has suppressed the opposition, crushed dissent, and persecuted lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Eritrean troops have committed widespread atrocities in neighboring Ethiopia’s Tigray region and other serious rights violations, and the rights situation in the UAE “remains dire” with prominent Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor imprisoned without a mattress in near-total isolation, he said.The Geneva-based Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to replace a commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including one over the fact that rights abusers sought seats to protect themselves and their allies.Under the Human Rights Council’s rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation.The United States has criticised the selection of candidates with poor rights records on uncontested slates as well as the Human Rights Council’s excessive criticism of Israel. This culminated in the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the council in June 2018.When US secretary of state Antony Blinken announced in February that the Biden administration was re-engaging with the council, he said Trump’s withdrawal “did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but instead created a vacuum of US leadership, which countries with authoritarian agendas have used to their advantage.”In a statement Thursday thanking UN member states for allowing the US to serve on the 47-nation body, Blinken said the United States together with other countries “must push back against attempts to subvert the ideals upon which the Human Rights Council was founded.”He said the council has an important role in “documenting atrocities in order to hold wrongdoers accountable,” but added that “it also suffers from serious flaws, including disproportionate attention on Israel and the membership of several states with egregious human rights records.”State Department spokesman Ned Price said later that the Biden administration will “vigorously oppose the council’s disproportion attention on Israel, which includes the council’s only standing agenda item targeting a single country" and will work against the election of countries “with egregious human rights records.”The 18 countries elected for three-year terms starting January 1 were Benin, Gambia, Cameroon, Somalia, and Eritrea from the Africa group; India, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Qatar, and UAE from the Asia group; Lithuania and Montenegro from the East European group; Paraguay, Argentina, and Honduras from the Latin America and Caribbean group; and Finland, Luxembourg and the United States from the mainly Western nations group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-uncontested-election-us-wins-back-seat-at-un-human-rights-council-3-years-after-quitting-101634257570210.html

Shares in the company fell 13% in afterhours trading.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sept. 2 had barred Virgin Galactic from flying its SpaceShipTwo pending completion of a report into the flight of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane that carried British billionaire Richard Branson to the edge of space.Branson was among six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the July flight, soaring more than 50 miles (80 km) into space.The FAA on Sept. 29 closed its mishap investigation into the July 11 Virgin Galactic Unity 22 launch, which deviated from assigned airspace on descent, and lifted a grounding order it had imposed earlier.Virgin Galactic had said in September it was planning another SpaceShipTwo flight from New Mexico, Unity 23, pending technical checks and weather. The company said last month the earliest it expected "to open its flight window for Unity 23 is mid October."But Virgin Galactic on Thursday said it will now begin its planned enhancement program first and will conduct the Unity 23 test flight after this work is complete and before starting commercial service.The enhancement program is designed to improve vehicle performance and flight-rate capability.The company said on Thursday one recent laboratory-based test "flagged a possible reduction in the strength margins of certain materials used to modify specific joints."The company added the "new lab test data has had no impact on the vehicles, our test flight protocols have clearly defined strength margins, and further analysis will assess whether any additional work is required to keep them at or above established levels."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virgin-galactic-to-delay-commercial-space-travel-service-until-q4-2022-101634257406670.html

15-10-2021||World||Robert Durst sentenced to life for murdering his best friend Susan Berman||New York real estate heir Robert Durst was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without chance of parole for the murder of his best friend more that two decades ago.Durst, 78, was convicted in Los Angeles Superior Court last month of first-degree murder for shooting Susan Berman point-blank in the back of the head at her home in December 2000.Durst silenced Berman to prevent her from incriminating him in the reopened investigation of his wife’s 1982 disappearance in New York, prosecutors said.Berman provided a phony alibi for Durst when Kathie Durst vanished, prosecutors said.Durst testified that he didn’t kill either woman, but said on cross-examination that he would lie if he had.Prosecutors also presented evidence that he intentionally killed a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, in 2001, though he had been acquitted of murder in that case after testifying that he shot the man in self-defense.Durst is the grandson of Joseph Durst, who founded the Durst Organization, one of Manhattan’s largest commercial real estate firms. His father, Seymour, took the reins of the company and later handed control of it to a younger brother, Douglas.Robert Durst settled his share of the family fortune and was estimated by prosecutors to have $100 million.Durst's lawyer said they plan to appeal.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.LOS ANGELES (AP) — The bitterly fought murder trial of Robert Durst stretched over the better part of two years. His sentencing will be comparatively brief and could lack the fireworks that erupted between the lead prosecutor and defense lawyer.The eccentric New York real estate heir faces a mandatory term of life in prison without parole Thursday for the first-degree murder of his best friend, Susan Berman.“Now that the jury has found whodunnit, the punishment is quite clear,” Loyola Law School Professor Laurie Levenson said. “I'm not sure there’s a lot more left for (the prosecutor) to say."Durst, 78, was convicted last month in Los Angeles Superior Court of shooting Berman point-blank in the back of the head in her Los Angeles home just before Christmas 2000.Durst, who has numerous medical issues, on Thursday was rolled into the courtroom in a wheelchair wearing brown jail scrubs. His eyes were wide open and he had a catatonic stare.Several of the jurors returned to the courtroom to witness the sentencing and were seated in the jury box.The trial began in March 2020 and was adjourned for 14 months as the coronavirus pandemic swept the U.S. and courts were closed. It resumed in May with the jury that reached its verdict Sept. 17.Berman, the daughter of a Las Vegas mobster, was Durst’s longtime confidante who was preparing to tell police she provided a phony alibi for him after his wife vanished in New York in 1982.Kathie Durst has never been found. Robert Durst has never been charged with a crime related to her disappearance.But following his conviction in Berman's death, which relied on evidence that he killed his wife, a New York prosecutor is prepared now to seek charges against him in her death, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Durst testified in the LA case, denying he killed his wife or Berman, but he said he'd lie if he had done so.Kathie McCormack Durst's family had hoped to present statements to the court Thursday about their loss, but prosecutors denied the request, according to emails sent to their lawyer.Attorney Robert Abrams said the McCormack family was disappointed, and he was outraged. He said family members would not attend the sentencing.“The family is not going to go travel 3,000 miles to be a prop in some Hollywood production and sit there and not be able to make their victim impact statements," Abrams said. “This is not some movie where it’s gross spectacle. This is their lives, and they’ve suffered for 40 years.”A spokesman for the district attorney's office did not return a message seeking comment.Levenson said it was questionable whether Kathie Durst was a victim in the Los Angeles case because Robert Durst wasn't charged with her killing. Allowing her siblings to speak at sentencing would create another issue for an appeal.Defense lawyers argued in court papers that Durst deserved a new trial, saying there was insufficient evidence to prove the case and listing 15 ways the judge erred.Judge Mark Windham rejected the motion and said the prosecution had overwhelming evidence and proved Durst's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in at least five ways, including several admissions Durst made. He rejected all the arguments that he had ruled incorrectly."You said the court erred so many times it made me feel self-conscious,” Windham said.The motion was mainly to preserve issues for appeal and likely to fail, Levenson said, though some of their arguments could get a higher court's attention.The defense said Windham should have declared a mistrial when the jury was sent home and the case adjourned. They said the length of the delay was unprecedented.Many of the other issues revolve around admission of evidence, such as allowing prosecutors to present testimony that Durst killed a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, in 2001 and chopped up his body and tossed the parts out to sea. Durst was acquitted of murder after testifying that Morris Black pulled a gun on him and was killed in a struggle for the weapon.They also objected to testimony and exhibits that showed when Durst was arrested in New Orleans in 2015, he had a mask, fake identification, drugs, $40,000 and a loaded handgun in his hotel room.They also objected to showing jurors a feature film, “All Good Things" based on Durst's life and starring Ryan Gosling as him and Kirsten Dunst as Kathie Durst.They incorrectly said jurors were shown the six-part documentary, “The Jinx: The Life and Crimes of Robert Durst," though jurors were shown excerpts, including a portion that many took as a confession.In a moment off camera but with a live microphone, Durst muttered, “Killed them all, of course.”To limit the number of appellate issues, prosecutors may be more restrained in their sentencing presentation, Levenson said, particularly when the prison term is already set.Deputy District Attorney John Lewin was asked by a reporter after the conviction what he had to say to Durst.Lewin, who was aggressive and frequently scrapped with defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin over the six years it took from arrest to conviction, initially said he didn't have anything to say to the man he had pursued for years.Then he called Durst a “narcissistic psychopath” who “killed his wife and ... had to keep killing to cover it up.”“He’s 78 years old. He’s been walking around for a long time," Lewin said. "He had a lot more of a life, you know, Kathie didn’t make 30. On balance, considering what he’s done, he got a lot more of a life than he was entitled to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-durst-sentenced-to-life-for-murdering-his-best-friend-susan-berman-101634249644773.html
