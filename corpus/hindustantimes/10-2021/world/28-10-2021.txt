The protests demanding the release of Rizvi also blocked Lahore’s link to Rawalpindi“Police and Rangers are deployed on the route but unlike Wednesday, the law enforcers did not stop the TLP workers on the order from the top as some government functionaries have engaged its leadership in talks,” a government official from Pakistan’s Punjab province told news agency PTI.The move shows a change of strategy as four policemen and as many TLP protesters were killed in clashes along with 400 other people injured. The death toll due to the clashes rose to 19 as 11 TLP workers and eight policemen died following the clashes between the government and the TLP a week ago.The Imran Khan-led government made it clear to the group that its demand to shut down the French embassy cannot be met. The group began demanding the ouster of the French envoy and ban on French imports after French president Emmanuel Macron earlier this year defended the freedom of expression of artists who drew caricatures of Prophet Mohammed, an act considered blasphemy across the globe. The Pakistan government released 350 jailed TLP members to appease the outfit but the group refuses to back down.The Pakistan Railways also suspended railway services for the day between Lahore and Rawalpindi and Islamabad due to the protests. The Imran Khan-led government however announced that the protesters will not be allowed to reach Islamabad, where the group plans to hold a sit-in till the government accepts its demands.The Imran Khan government continued to stress that the police, Army and the Rangers will stop the TLP from entering Islamabad. “The cabinet has decided to treat TLP as a militant organisation and it will be crushed as other such groups have been eliminated. The Pakistani state has defeated major terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda,” Fawad Chaudhry said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radical-islamist-group-tlp-threatens-to-bring-islamabad-to-a-standstill-101635442732437.html
28-10-2021||World||US economy slowed to a 2% annual growth rate last quarter in face of Delta Covid-19 wave||Hampered by rising Covid-19 cases and persistent supply shortages, the US economy slowed sharply to a 2% annual growth rate in the July-September period, the weakest quarterly expansion since the recovery from the pandemic recession began last year.Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product — its total output of goods and services — declined from robust growth rates of 6.7% in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first quarter, gains that had been fueled by vast infusions of federal rescue aid.The 2% annual growth last quarter fell below expectations and would have been even weaker if not for an increase in restocking by businesses, which added whatever supplies they could obtain. Such inventory rebuilding added 2.1 percentage points to the quarter's modest expansion.By contrast, consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of overall economic activity, slowed to an annual growth rate of just 1.6% after having surged at a 12% rate in the previous quarter.Economists remain hopeful for a bounce-back in the current October-December period, with confirmed Covid cases declining, vaccination rates rising and more Americans venturing out to spend money. Many economists think GDP will rebound at a solid annual growth rate of at least 4% this quarter.“The key story right now is the improving health situation," said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. “People are feeling a lot more at ease about moving about.”Airlines have reported growing passenger traffic, businesses are investing more and wages are increasing as employers struggle to draw more people back into the job market. A resurgence of consumer spending could help energize the economy as the year nears a close.At the same time, though, rising prices, especially for gasoline, food, rent and other staples, are imposing a burden on American consumers and eroding the benefits of higher wages. Inflation has emerged as a threat to the economic recovery and a key concern for the Federal Reserve as it prepares to start withdrawing the emergency aid it provided to the economy after the recession struck last year.Thursday’s report from the government, the first of three estimates of last quarter’s GDP, showed widespread weakness. In consumer spending, purchases of durable goods, like autos and appliances, fell at a sizable 26.2% rate. Sales of clothing and other nondurable goods slowed to a modest annual gain of 2.6%. And purchases of services rose at a 7.9% rate, down from an 11.5% annual rise in the previous quarter.Businesses, too, held back. Corporate investment in equipment and plants slowed to a 1.8% rate of growth, after a 9.2% annual increase in the April-June quarter. Residential construction declined at a 7.7% rate after an even sharper 11.7% drop in the previous quarter.Last quarter, exports declined at a 2.5% annual rate while imports rose at a 6.1% rate — a surge that has contributed to clogged ports. The gap between exports and imports subtracted 1.1 percentage points from last quarter's annual growth.Opinion polls have shown that the public is growing increasingly concerned about inflation, a trend that has contributed to a decline in President Joe Biden’s approval ratings. Some economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have attributed higher inflation mainly to temporary factors, notably bottlenecked supply chains resulting from the speed of the economic recovery. Others say they worry that inflation pressures will prove more chronic.The inflation data tied to Thursday's GDP report showed consumer price increases at a still elevated 4.5% annual rate last quarter but down from 6.1% in the second quarter.Republicans have zeroed in on higher inflation this year to support their charges that Biden's economic policies aren't working.Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, called the new GDP report “awful” and “more proof that President Biden is bungling the recovery.”Biden and his Democratic allies have been trying to push through Congress two major spending bills — one to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure, the other a social safety net bill that involves climate change, health insurance and child tax credits, among other items. On Thursday, the White House unveiled a $1.75 trillion social safety net proposal, scaled down significantly from an initial $3.5 trillion plan that ran into resistance from Republicans and two key Democratic senators.The government’s estimate Thursday of GDP growth last quarter was even lower than economists’ forecasts for a significant slowdown. The effects of the delta variant, in keeping some people away from restaurants, retail shops and entertainment venues, was a key drag on growth.In September, America’s employers added just 194,000 jobs, a second straight sluggish monthly gain and evidence that the pandemic was keeping its grip on the economy, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs.“The delta wave of the pandemic did a lot of damage — it caused consumer to turn more cautious,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The virus surge scrambled global supply chains and disrupted production in a lot of industries and also created havoc in the job market.”But in recent weeks, viral cases have steadily fallen, and many economists say they think the economy is accelerating again. Zandi is predicting 6% annual growth for the current fourth quarter, and some economists foresee an even stronger rebound, depending on whether viral cases continue to fade and supply shortages begin to ease.For 2021 as a whole, economists generally expect growth to amount to around 5.5%. That would be the highest calendar-year expansion since the mid-1980s and a sharp improvement from the 3.4% plunge in GDP in the recession year of 2020. It would also easily exceed the sub-3% annual economic growth rates that prevailed in the years before the pandemic recession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-slowed-to-a-2-annual-growth-rate-last-quarter-in-face-of-delta-covid-19-wave-101635440627806.html
28-10-2021||World||India-China standoff: ‘New law will not alter China’s position on border issues’||China’s new land border law will not impact existing boundary treaties or change the country’s position on border-related questions, Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday.A ministry spokesperson added, without naming India, that countries should avoid speculating about a Chinese domestic law.Beijing’s response comes a day after New Delhi expressed concerns about the legislation.China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), passed the law last Saturday specifying how the military and local authorities will govern and guard the country’s 22,000km of land border shared with 14 countries including India. The new law, which will be implemented from January 1, has been promulgated amid a protracted military standoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border, in eastern Ladakh.The law, which says China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are “sacred and inviolable”, merges military defence of China’s land borders with improving social and economic development in border areas.When specifically asked about India’s concerns on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said: “We hope relevant countries can avoid making undue speculation about the normal legislation in China. This law has clear stipulations on China’s cooperation with its neighbouring countries and the handling of the land border issues. It will not affect China’s implementation of existing border treaties nor will it change existing practice in our cooperation with neighbouring countries.On Monday, India’s external affairs ministry had put out a statement voicing its concerns about the legislation. “China’s unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implications on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us,” the ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, however, said it will not change China’s position on border issues.“It (the new law) does not mean that there is a change in our position on the border development issue,” Wang said in his response to a question on the implication of the law.Explaining the law, Wang said the law identifies the leading mechanism and duties of the departments of military and localities in implementing the law. “It sets the rules for the demarcation procedures and also covers the areas of defence and management of borders as far as international cooperation (is concerned),” he said.“China has 22,000km of land borders. It has 14 land neighbours. The promulgation of the law is to coordinate and have unified standards for strengthening border management and advance relevant cooperation,” Wang said.“This is an important measure in advancing the rule of law. It is a normal domestic legislation that serves our realistic needs and also conforms to international practice,” he said. “This law has clear stipulations on China’s cooperation with its neighbouring countries and the handling of the land border issues.”Wang only made a passing reference to the Chinese military’s role in border management but the new law strengthens a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) policy to work closely with civilians staying in border areas.“Under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, relevant military organs shall organise, guide and coordinate the defence and control of land borders, maintain social stability, handle emergencies and cooperate in border defence and other related work,” Article 7 of the law says.India and China have been locked in a border row for 17 months, a standoff which has seen a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, 2020, when troops from both sides fought each other hand-to-hand and with rods and stones for hours.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975; four Chinese soldiers were also killed and one injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiachina-standoff-new-law-will-not-alter-china-s-position-on-border-issues-101635420046353.html
28-10-2021||World||UK lawmakers to grill Facebook, Google, Twitter, and TikTok over online safety||British lawmakers are set to grill Facebook and other tech giants Thursday over how they handle online safety as European efforts to regulate social media companies gain momentum.Representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, and TikTok will be questioned by members of a parliamentary committee scrutinising the British government's draft online safety legislation.Governments on both sides of the Atlantic want tougher rules aimed at protecting social media users, especially younger ones, but the United Kingdom's efforts are much further along. UK lawmakers are questioning researchers, journalists, tech executives, and other experts for a report to the government on how to improve the final version of the online safety bill.The hearing comes the same week YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were questioned by a US Senate panel. They provided little firm commitment for US legislation bolstering protection of children from online harm, which lawmakers say ranges from eating disorders, sexually explicit content, and material promoting addictive drugs.Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen appeared before the UK committee this week, telling members that the company’s systems make online hate worse and that it has little incentive to fix the problem. She said time is running out to regulate social media companies that use artificial intelligence systems to determine what content people see.Haugen was a Facebook data scientist who copied internal research documents and turned them over to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. They also were provided to a group of media outlets, including The Associated Press, which reported numerous stories about how Facebook prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public.The UK's online safety bill calls for a regulator to ensure tech companies comply with rules requiring them to remove dangerous or harmful content or face penalties worth up to 10% of annual global revenue. The European Union is working on similar digital rules.British lawmakers are still grappling with thorny issues such as ensuring privacy and free speech and defining legal but harmful content, including online bullying and advocacy of self-harm.They're also trying to get a handle on misinformation that flourishes on social media.Maria Ressa, a Filipino journalist who shared this year’s Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for freedom of expression under grave risks, acknowledged the challenge, telling the committee on Wednesday that a law to curb disinformation is needed.“Regulation is our last hope, Ressa said. “The problem is that you will be a model for everyone else around the world, so you must be a gold standard, that’s tough." At the same time, “doing nothing pushes the world closer to fascism," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmakers-to-grill-facebook-google-twitter-and-tiktok-over-online-safety-101635408738206.html
28-10-2021||World||Fluvoxamine may reduce risk of hospitalisation due to Covid-19 by 30%: Study||Fluvoxamine, a drug which is used to treat mental health conditions such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), may reduce by up to 30 per cent, hospitalisation in high-risk cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to a study published in The Lancet Global Health journal. The research, which arrived at the said conclusion, was conducted between January 15 and August 6 this year.For this exercise, researchers used fluvoxamine to treat 739 patients of Covid-19 from Brazil, while another 733 patients received a placebo (during clinical trials, one group of volunteers receives the drug that is being tested, while the other receives a fake drug, or placebo, which they think is real. This is done to compare the effect of the drug with that of the placebo). Further, every patient who was administered fluvoxamine was tracked for 28 days to check on their health, and to see if they still needed hospitalisation.The study found that in case of fluvoxamine, the number of hospital admissions came down by about 30 per cent as compared to the corresponding figures for the placebo. Also, among patients taking all their drugs, the reduction in hospitalisation was recorded at nearly 65 per cent.Speaking on the research, its co-author Angela Reiersen, an associate professor at the Washington University said, “Fluvoxamine may reduce the production of inflammatory molecules known as cytokines, that can be triggered by SARS-CoV-2, the Covid-19 causing virus.” Reiersen, however, also acknowledged some limitations in the study, including the drug’s absence, despite its wide availability, from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Essential Medicines List.Fluvoxamine, due to its anti-inflammatory properties, was selected for this exercise. During the early days of the pandemic, it was identified for its potential to reduce the cytokine storm among coronavirus patients. Cytokine storms, which are severe immune responses to Covid-19, can cause lethal damage to organs.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fluvoxamine-may-reduce-risk-of-hospitalisation-due-to-covid-19-by-30-study-101635406168836.html
28-10-2021||World||Those detained being systematically tortured in Myanmar: Report||The soldiers in rural Myanmar twisted the young man’s skin with pliers and kicked him in the chest until he couldn’t breathe. Then they taunted him about his family until his heart ached, too: “Your mom,” they jeered, “cannot save you anymore.”The young man and his friend, randomly arrested as they rode their bikes home, had been subjected to hours of agony inside a town hall transformed by the military into a torture center.“I’m going to die,” the young man told himself, stars exploding before his eyes. “I love you, mom.’”Since its takeover of the government in February, the Myanmar military has been torturing those it has detained in a methodical and systemic way across the country, The Associated Press has found in interviews with 28 people imprisoned and released in recent months. Based also on photographic evidence, sketches and letters, along with testimony from two military captains and an aide to a high-ranking commander, the AP investigation provides the most comprehensive look since the takeover into a secretive detention system that has held more than 9,000 people.While most of the torture has occurred inside military compounds, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, has also transformed public facilities such as community halls into interrogation centers, prisoners said. The AP identified a dozen interrogation centers in use across Myanmar, in addition to prisons and police lockups.The prisoners interviewed came from every corner of the country, and ranged from a 16-year-old girl to monks. Some were detained for protesting against the military, others for no discernible reason. Multiple military units and police were involved in the interrogations, their methods of torture similar across Myanmar.The Myanmar military has a long history of torture, particularly before the country began transitioning toward democracy in 2010. While torture in recent years was most often recorded in ethnic regions, its use has now returned across the country, AP’s investigation found. The vast majority of torture techniques described by prisoners were similar to those of the past, including electric shocks, near-drownings and relentless beatings.But this time, the torture is the worst it’s ever been in scale and severity, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors deaths and arrests. Since February, the group says, security forces have killed more than 1,200 people, including at least 131 detainees tortured to death.“The military tortures detainees, first for revenge, then for information,” says Ko Bo Kyi, AAPP’s joint secretary and a former political prisoner. “I think in many ways the military has become even more brutal.”The military has also taken steps to hide evidence that it has tortured prisoners, with several prisoners saying interrogators brutalized only the parts of their bodies that could be hidden by clothes. An aide to the highest-ranking army official in western Myanmar’s Chin state told the AP that soldiers covered up the deaths of two tortured prisoners, forcing a military doctor to falsify their autopsy reports.A former army captain who defected from the Tatmadaw in April confirmed to the AP that the military’s use of torture against detainees has been rampant since its takeover.“In our country, after being arrested unfairly, there is torture, violence and sexual assaults happening constantly,” says Lin Htet Aung, the former captain.After receiving detailed requests for comment, military officials responded with a one-line email that said: “We have no plans to answer these nonsense questions.”All but six of the prisoners interviewed by the AP were subjected to abuse, including women and children. Most of those who weren’t abused said their fellow detainees were.The AP also sent photographs of several torture victims’ injuries to a forensic pathologist with Physicians for Human Rights. The pathologist concluded wounds on three victims were consistent with beatings by sticks or rods.“You look at some of those injuries where they’re just black and blue from one end to the other,” says forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas. “This was not just a swat. This has the appearance of something that was very systematic and forceful.”Photographs taken inside several detention and interrogation facilities confirmed prisoners’ accounts of overcrowded, filthy conditions. Most inmates slept on concrete floors, packed like sardines.Some became sick from drinking dirty water only available from a shared toilet. Cockroaches swarmed their bodies at night. There was little to no medical treatment.Not even the young have been spared. One woman was imprisoned alongside a 2-year-old baby.The interrogation centers were worse than the prisons, with nights a cacophony of weeping and wails of agony.“It was terrifying, my room,” one man recalls. “There were blood stains and scratches on the wall.”Back inside the rural town hall, the young man and his friend survived the night amid a haze of pain. When dawn came, the interrogators sent them to prison.Their small cell was home to 33 people. They lay next to the lone squat toilet.Their fellow inmates shared water and biscuits, though the young man’s mouth was too torn apart to eat.After two days, the families of the young man and his friend paid officials to get them out of prison. Both men were forced to sign statements saying they had participated in a demonstration and were anti-police.For two months, his entire body ached. Even today, his right shoulder — stomped on by a soldier — won’t move properly.“After they caught us, I know their hearts and their minds were not like the people’s, not like us,” he says. “They are monsters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/those-detained-being-systematically-tortured-in-myanmar-report-101635400629828.html

Guterres urged countries to speak with one voice."We can only achieve more stability with a united approach. Together, let us act with determination - and without delay - to help the people of Afghanistan and to secure a better future for all."The UN chief outlined four areas for action, which he said are of regional and international concern, starting with humanitarian relief. He reported that the UN is undertaking a "massive" humanitarian operation in the country, despite enormous obstacles."We have been acting with the cooperation of the Taliban, who have progressively granted access to the areas requested and provided security when needed," he said.Moreover, Guterres thanked neighbouring nations for their assistance with moving aid workers and supplies. He also highlighted the need for continued collaboration on the issue of refugees, saying "international support to hosting countries must match the scale of needs."The UN chief stressed the need to work together to revive the Afghan economy which is on the brink of collapse. "Injecting liquidity into the Afghan economy can be done without violating international laws or compromising principles," he said.Afghanistan's people also need an inclusive and representative government, he added, one which respects international humanitarian law and upholds human rights and fundamental freedoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/act-with-determination-un-chief-calls-for-unity-to-revive-afghanistan-101635391739800.html
28-10-2021||World||‘Europe had most number of Covid cases, deaths last week’: WHO expresses concern||The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concerns over the worsening coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic situation in Europe. On Wednesday, the UN health body said that Europe had the maximum number of cases and deaths due to the viral disease over the last week, with a double-digit percentage surge in each.The United Nations (UN) health body also said that new infections in the European region, which stretches as far east as former Soviet republics in Central Asia, witnessed an 18% spike over the last week - a fourth consecutive weekly increase for the region.On the other hand, there was also a 14% surge in Covid-19 related deaths in Europe, the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological report, news agency the Associated Press reported.Britain, Russia, Ukraine among others worst hit by Covid-19According to the WHO’s weekly epidemiological report, the United States had the largest number of cases over the last week at 513,000, followed by Britain at 330,000 and Russia at nearly 250,000.Both Britain and Russia are seeing a surge in their daily Covid-19 cases. While Russia will go into a week-long paid holiday from October 30 till November 7 to curb the spread of Covid-19, the British government is not bringing back any restrictions at present.The WHO also pointed out that other European countries such as Ukraine, Bulgaria, Moldova and Romania among others had some of the highest Covid infection rates per 100,000 people in the previous week, the Associated Press further reported.What are the reasons for the Covid-19 surge in Europe?The WHO said on Wednesday that several factors are responsible for the increased spread of the coronavirus disease in Europe, including low vaccination rates in some countries in East Europe.Ukraine, which is a country in eastern Europe, has only inoculated seven million of its population of 41 million. Russia, on the other hand, has only 36% of its population vaccinated with one dose, according to a report by Al Jazeera last week.Meanwhile, the recent lifting of lockdown and other Covid restrictions, including travel restrictions by many countries in Europe to revive tourism, is also contributing to the surge in cases and deaths in the continent.Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergency director, told Al-Jazeera last week that “more social gathering indoors after lifting restrictions just as winter sets in is driving a rise in cases in many countries across Europe.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-had-most-number-of-covid-cases-deaths-last-week-who-expresses-concern-101635386771486.html
28-10-2021||World||Chinese hypersonic test like a 'Sputnik moment': Top US general||The Pentagon's top general said Wednesday that China's recent test of an earth-circling hypersonic missile was akin to the Soviet Union's stunning launch of the world's first satellite, Sputnik, in 1957, which sparked the superpowers' space race.Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed for the first time the Chinese test of a nuclear-capable missile that would be very difficult to defend against."What we saw was a very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system. And it is very concerning," Milley told Bloomberg TV."I don't know if it's quite a Sputnik moment, but I think it's very close to that," he said."It's a very significant technological event that occurred... and it has all of our attention."The US Department of Defense had previously declined to confirm the test, first reported by the Financial Times on October 16.The newspaper said the August test launch caught Washington by surprise.The missile circled the Earth at a low altitude and a velocity of more than five times the speed of sound, although it missed its target by more than 30 kilometers (19 miles), according to the Financial Times.China denied the report, saying it was a routine test of a reusable space vehicle.Hypersonics are the new frontier in missile technology, because they fly lower and so are harder to detect than ballistic missiles, can reach targets more quickly, and are maneuverable.That makes them more dangerous, particularly if mounted with nuclear warheads.The United States, Russia, China and North Korea have all tested hypersonics and several others are developing the technology.China in 2019 unveiled a hypersonic medium-range missile, the DF-17, which can travel around 2,000 kilometres and can carry nuclear warheads.The missile mentioned in the FT story is a different one, with a longer range. It can be launched into orbit before coming back into the atmosphere to hit its target.Asked Wednesday about China's test, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby again declined to confirm it.But he said that any major advancement in China's military capabilities does "very little to help decrease tensions in the region and beyond."Such advances, he said, are "paired with a foreign and defense policy approach that uses intimidation and coercion of neighboring nations to yield to China's interests."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-hypersonic-test-like-a-sputnik-moment-top-us-general-101635384543620.html
