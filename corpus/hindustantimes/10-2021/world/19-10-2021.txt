Moscow and Beijing have cultivated close military ties in recent years at a time when their relations with the West have soured.North Korea’s latest missile launch, meanwhile, saw the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command condemning it as destabilising. South Korean and US officials were investigating if the missile was a previously unseen version displayed last week at an exhibition in Pyongyang, a South Korean source told Reuters.They were studying if the missile was fired from North Korea’s experimental Gorae-class submarine, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-over-missile-test-navy-drills-near-japan-101634667989804.html

But while the rules have vanished, the coronavirus hasn’t. Many scientists are calling on the UK government to reimpose social restrictions and speed up booster vaccinations as coronavirus infection rates, already Europe’s highest, rise.The UK recorded 49,156 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the largest number since mid-July. New infections averaged 43,000 a day over the past week, a 15% increase on the week before. Last week, the Office for National Statistics estimated that one in 60 people in England had the virus.US coach, assistants fired over vaccine refusalThe head coach of Washington State’s college football team has been fired along with four assistants for refusing to take the Covid-19 vaccine. Nick Rolovich was axed from his $3.2mn a year post as a deadline requiring all Washington state employees to be vaccinated expired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-faces-calls-for-plan-b-with-covid19-101634667547557.html

But don’t call her an oldie.The 95-year-old queen has politely declined the honor of being named “Oldie of the Year” by a British magazine, saying she does not meet “the relevant criteria.”The Oldie magazine on Tuesday published the queen’s response to its suggestion that she follow in the footsteps of former recipients, including former Prime Minister John Major, actor Olivia de Havilland and artist David Hockney.“Her Majesty believes you are as old as you feel, as such The Queen does not believe she meets the relevant criteria to be able to accept, and hopes you will find a more worthy recipient,” said a letter from her assistant private secretary, Tom Laing-Baker. He ended the letter “with Her Majesty’s warmest best wishes.”The queen, who was widowed this year, still keeps a busy schedule of royal duties. On Tuesday she held audiences with diplomats and hosted a reception at Windsor Castle for global business leaders.The Oldie of the Year prize honors people of advanced age who have made a special contribution to public life. The queen’s husband Prince Philip, who died in April, received the accolade in 2011, when he was 90.After the queen declined, this year’s Oldie of the Year award went to movie royalty instead: French-American actress and dancer Leslie Caron, 90.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-you-find-worthy-recipient-queen-elizabeth-ii-rejects-oldie-award-101634664805432.html
19-10-2021||World||Zalmay Khalilzad, US special envoy to Afghanistan, steps down||Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for Afghanistan Reconciliation who negotiated the February 2020 accord that led to the withdrawal of US-led international forces, has resigned.He will be succeeded by his deputy Thomas West, who was part of the national security team of US President Joe Biden when he was vice-president.US secretary of state Antony Blinken announced Khalilzad’s departure in a statement on Monday, saying, “As he steps down from his role, I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people.”In his resignation letter to Blinken, Zalmay wrote, as reported by The Washington Post, “I decided that now is the right time… at a juncture when we are entering a new phase in our Afghanistan policy.”Zalmay Khalilzad was a familiar figure in New Delhi where he dropped by often to keep the Indian government in the loop on the Afghan peace process. But the US evidently did not tell the Indians all that was happening as external affairs minister S Jaishankar recently said that “we were not taken into confidence on various aspects” of the 2020 agreement.Khalilzad, an Afghan-American, was named special representative in 2018 by then secretary of state Mike Pompeo to lead negotiations for a settlement in Afghanistan that could pave the way for the withdrawal of US forces and end one of America’s endless wars.Zalmay Khalilzad failed to bring the Taliban and the elected government of then Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani to the table, but did succeed in getting a deal signed by the US with the Taliban in February 2020, which provided the basis for the withdrawal of US-led troops by Biden, completed in August.The controversial accord was widely slammed for giving away too much to the Taliban in return for very little. And Khalilzad, who negotiated the deal with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban co-founder and now a deputy prime minister, carried the burden of the criticism.“Khalilzad negotiated a bad deal with the Taliban, which triggered a debacle that he failed to anticipate or handle,” said Husain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US and South Asia expert at Hudson Institute, a leading US think tank. “He equated US withdrawal with peace, and bypassed and marginalised America’s Afghan allies. Khalilzad handed the keys to Kabul to the Taliban in return for promises everyone knew the Taliban would not keep. One can only hope Tom West does a better job of understanding who the Taliban are and what might be the limits of negotiating with them.”Biden has said that it was not an agreement that he would have signed, and he and his officials often said it tied their hands on Afghanistan. But instead of renegotiating it, he went ahead to honour America’s commitment to withdraw its forces, though the Taliban did not abide by most their commitments.“The Talibs committed to not allow terrorist groups, including Al-Qaida, [to] plan or carry out attacks against the security of the US and our allies,” Khalilzad wrote in his letter. “They further agreed not to allow terrorists to recruit, train or fundraise in the territories they controlled. They also agreed to negotiate directly with the existing Afghan government for a power-sharing agreement and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.”The Taliban remain thick with Al-Qaeda, which remains present in Afghanistan, according to assessment by several intelligence agencies and analysts. Zalmay Khalilzad was expected to leave office in May after Biden announced a timeline of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, shifting the Trump administration’s deadline from May 1 to September 11, and subsequently to August 31. He was asked to stay on, but his exit had been on the cards for a while. Speculation was rife when he missed the first post-withdrawal meeting between the US and the Taliban in Doha on October 9, in which West led the US team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zalmay-khalilzad-us-special-envoy-to-afghanistan-steps-down-101634665193327.html
19-10-2021||World||Taliban ‘interior minister’ Sirajuddin Haqqani lauds suicide bombers, hands out aid to kin||The Taliban’s “interior minister”, Sirajuddin Haqqani, a UN-designated terrorist for whom the US has offered a $10-million bounty, has praised suicide bombers and pledged support for the families of fighters killed in suicide attacks. Haqqani, a top leader of the Haqqani Network that has strong links with the Pakistani military, distributed 10,000 Afghanis (about $110) and clothes to the families of suicide attackers and promised them a plot of land during a meeting held at Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul on Monday. Photos posted on Twitter by pro-Taliban accounts showed the event was attended by hundreds of men. Haqqani was featured in several of the photos, though his face was blurred or he was photographed from the rear. The Haqqani Network was blamed by Indian and US officials for the July 2008 suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul that killed 58 people and injured nearly 150. Among the dead were the Indian defence attaché, Brig Ravi Datt Mehta, diplomat V Venkateswara Rao and two Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel.Saeed Khosty, the interior ministry spokesman, said on Twitter that Haqqani had “met the family members of martyred Fidayeen” at the hotel. “In his speech, the Interior Minister praised the jihad & sacrifices of Mujahideen & martyrs. He called them heroes of Islam & the country. [Haqqani] told everyone about the memories of the martyred (Fidayeen) their piety & deeds. He called them heroes of the believing nation,” Khosty tweeted. “Now you & I must refrain from betraying the aspirations of our martyrs,” Haqqani was quoted as saying by Khosty. Khosty also confirmed Haqqani had distributed 10,000 Afghanis and clothes to the families of the suicide bombers and “promised a plot for each (martyr’s) family”. Several photos showed Haqqani embracing relatives of the suicide bombers and praying at the meeting. The interior ministry also said in a statement that Haqqani paid tribute to the suicide bombers by describing them as “martyrdom seekers” and “holy warriors”. Ironically, the hotel in which the meeting was held had been targeted in January 2018 by Taliban fighters who killed 40 people, including 14 foreigners. The Taliban has carried out scores of suicide attacks across Afghanistan in recent years that killed thousands of Afghans and foreign troops. In a separate development, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Pakistan’s Bol TV news channel that the group’s army has several units of suicide bombers. “The time for carrying out more suicide attacks is over, but we still have groups of suicide bombers who will not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for the defence of the country,” he said, speaking in Pashto. “Some groups have special names while others are known as fidayeen units and these will all be part of our strong forces,” he added. Mujahid said only males are allowed to carry out suicide attacks, though women had participated in the jihad in the past. “Even in those times, women were not allowed to carry out suicide attacks. Males in suicide attack groups are given training so that they can defend the country when the time comes,” he said. Sirajuddin Haqqani is on the FBI’s most wanted list for terrorism and carries a bounty of $10 million on his head under the US Rewards For Justice programme. A listing on the “most wanted” section of the FBI website states: “Sirajuddin Haqqani is wanted for questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen. He is believed to have coordinated and participated in cross-border attacks against United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan.” Haqqani was also allegedly involved in planning an assassination attempt on former Afghan president Hamid Karzai in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-interior-minister-sirajuddin-haqqani-lauds-suicide-bombers-hands-out-aid-to-kin-101634664173066.html
19-10-2021||World||Haiti gang seeks $17M for kidnapped US missionaries: Report||A gang that kidnapped 17 members of a US-based missionary group has demanded a $17 million ransom for them, according to Haiti's justice minister, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.Justice minister Liszt Quitel said the gang was demanding $1 million per person. Quitel did not immediately return messages for comment, but he also confirmed the figure to the New York Times. The Journal said he identified the ages of the abducted children as 8 months and 3, 6, 14 and 15 years.A wave of kidnappings prompted a protest strike that shuttered businesses, schools and public transportation in a new blow to Haiti's anemic economy, and unions and other groups vowed to continue the shutdown Tuesday.FBI agents and other US officials are helping Haitian authorities hunt for the 12 adults and five children linked to the Christian Aid Ministries in Ohio who were kidnapped Saturday during a trip to visit an orphanage.It is the largest reported kidnapping of its kind in recent years, with Haitian gangs growing more brazen and abductions spiking as the country tries to recover from the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that struck southern Haiti on Aug. 14 and killed more than 2,200 people.“We are calling on authorities to take action,” said Jean-Louis Abaki, a moto taxi driver who joined the strike Monday to decry killings and kidnappings in the hemisphere's poorest nation.With the usually chaotic streets of Haiti’s capital quiet and largely empty Monday, Abaki said that if Prime Minister Ariel Henry and National Police Chief Léon Charles want to stay in power, “they have to give the population a chance at security.”Haitian police told The Associated Press that the abduction of the 16 Americans and one Canadian was carried out by the 400 Mawozo gang, a group with a long record of killings, kidnappings and extortion. In April, a man who claimed to be the gang's leader told a radio station that it was responsible for abducting five priests, two nuns and three relatives of one of the priests that month. They were later released.At least 328 kidnappings were reported to Haiti’s National Police in the first eight months of 2021, compared with a total of 234 for all of 2020, said a report last month by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.Gangs have been accused of kidnapping schoolchildren, doctors, police officers, bus passengers and others as they grow more powerful and demand ransoms ranging from a couple hundred dollars to millions of dollars.Ned Price, the US State Department's spokesman, said US officials have been in constant contact with Haiti's National Police, the missionary group and the victims' relatives.“This is something that we have treated with the utmost priority since Saturday,” he said, adding that officials are doing “all we can to seek a quick resolution to this.”UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the rise in gang violence has affected relief efforts in Haiti. He said the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator reported that “violence, looting, road blockades and the persistent presence of armed gangs all pose obstacles to humanitarian access. The situation is further complicated by very serious fuel shortages and the reduced supply of goods."Dujarric said that Haiti's government should redouble efforts to reform and strengthen the police department to address public safety and that all crimes must be investigated.Christian Aid Ministries said the kidnapped group included six women, six men and five children, including a 2-year-old. A sign on the door at the organization’s headquarters in Berlin, Ohio, said it was closed due to the kidnapping situation.Among those kidnapped were four children and one of their parents from a Michigan family, their pastor told The Detroit News. The youngest from the family is under 10, said minister Ron Marks, who declined to identify them. They arrived in Haiti earlier this month, he said.A pair of traveling Christians stopped by the organization’s headquarters Monday with two young children to drop off packages for impoverished nations. Tirtzah Rarick, originally of California, said she and a friend prayed on Sunday with those who had relatives among the abductees.“Even though it’s painful and it provokes us to tears that our friends and relatives, our dear brothers and sisters, are suffering right now in a very real physical, mental and emotional way, it is comforting to us that we can bring these heavy burdens to the God that we worship,” she said.News of the kidnappings spread swiftly in and around Holmes County, Ohio, hub of one of the nation’s largest populations of Amish and conservative Mennonites, said Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in nearby Millersburg, Ohio.Christian Aid Ministries is supported by conservative Mennonite, Amish and related groups in the Anabaptist tradition.The organization was founded in the early 1980s and began working in Haiti later that decade, said Steven Nolt, professor of history and Anabaptist studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. The group has year-round mission staff in Haiti and several countries, he said, and it ships religious, school and medical supplies throughout the world.Conservative Anabaptists, while disagreeing over technology and other issues, share traditions such as modest, plain clothing, separation from mainstream society, closely disciplined congregations and a belief in nonresistance to violence.The Amish and Mennonite communities in Holmes County have a close connection with missionary organisations serving Haiti.Every September at the Ohio Haiti Benefit Auction, handmade furniture, quilts, firewood and tools are sold, and barbecue chicken and Haitian beans and rice are dished up. The event typically brings in about $600,000 that is split between 18 missionary groups, said Aaron Miller, one of the organizers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-gang-seeks-17m-for-kidnapped-us-missionaries-report-101634653238138.html

The announcement was made by British health minister Sajid Javid who said that the national Covid-19 vaccine booking service would be opened up in order to ramp up the number of younger people receiving shots."I think it is important for anyone who is invited as eligible for the vaccine, including young people, that they do come forward and take up that offer," Javid told parliament, according to Reuters.Britain, as it relaxed restrictions and reopened activities this summer, has been reporting a daily jump in new Covid-19 cases recently—much higher than in other western European countries.Furthermore, coronavirus cases have fuelled among those aged 17 and younger nationally, causing concern among scientists that vaccines are being rolled out in schools too slowly.The Boris Johnson-led government has said that it is keeping a "very close eye" on rising levels of Covid-19 infections and has a plan in place to deal with the viral disease and deaths are broadly flat.The UK recorded 49,156 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, the highest spike since mid-July. The country has reported an average of 43,000 cases a day over the past week, 15 per cent higher compared to the week before. New infections have risen by more than 60 per cent in the last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-spike-uk-set-to-open-up-vaccine-bookings-for-children-aged-1215-101634644718422.html
19-10-2021||World||Africa's glaciers to disappear soon; 118mn may face droughts, floods: Report||Africa’s rare glaciers will disappear in the next two decades because of climate change, a new report warned Tuesday amid sweeping forecasts of pain for the continent that contributes least to global warming but will suffer from it most.The report from the World Meteorological Organization and other agencies, released ahead of the UN climate conference in Scotland that starts Oct. 31, is a grim reminder that Africa’s 1.3 billion people remain “extremely vulnerable” as the continent warms more, and at a faster rate, than the global average. And yet Africa’s 54 countries are responsible for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.The new report seizes on the shrinking glaciers of Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda as symbols of the rapid and widespread changes to come. “Their current retreat rates are higher than the global average. If this continues, it will lead to total deglaciation by the 2040s,” it says.Massive displacement, hunger and increasing climate shocks such droughts and flooding are in the future, and yet the lack of climate data in parts of Africa “is having a major impact” on disaster warnings for millions of people, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said at Tuesday’s launch.Estimates of the economic effects of climate change vary across the African continent, but “in sub-Saharan Africa, climate change could further lower gross domestic product by up to 3% by 2050,” Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko with the African Union Commission writes in the report. “Not only are physical conditions getting worse, but also the number of people being affected is increasing.”By 2030, up to 118 million extremely poor people, or those living on less than $1.90 a day, “will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa if adequate response measures are not put in place,” Sacko adds.Already, the UN has warned that the Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar is one where “famine-like conditions have been driven by climate change.” And it says parts of South Sudan are seeing the worst flooding in almost 60 years.Despite the threats ahead to the African continent, the voices of Africans have been less represented than richer regions at global climate meetings and among the authors of the crucial Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific assessments. African participation in IPCC reports has been “extremely low,” according to Future Climate for Africa, a multi-country research program.The costs ahead are huge. “Overall, Africa will need investments of over $3 trillion in mitigation and adaptation by 2030 to implement its (national climate plans), requiring significant, accessible and predictable inflows of conditional finance,” the WMO's Taalas said.“The cost of adapting to climate change in Africa will rise to $50 billion per year by 2050, even assuming the international efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africas-glaciers-to-disappear-soon-118mn-may-face-droughts-floods-report-101634637395665.html

The 57-year-old had opted out of contesting in recently held general elections to focus on winning the mayoral polls. A former city bus driver, Sohi served in the City Council before he ran for the Liberal Party from the riding of Edmonton Mill Woods in the 2015 national elections. After narrowly defeating then minister of state Tim Uppal of the Conservative Party, Sohi was appointed cabinet minister by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Over the next four years, he handled the portfolios of natural resources, and then infrastructure and communities.Sohi, who was born in what is now the Malerkotla district of Punjab, had lost to Uppal in 2019 and thereafter set his sights on the mayoral elections.He defeated his closest rival Mike Nickel on Monday night in mayoral polls that are traditionally not held along party lines.Outgoing mayor Don Iveson congratulated Sohi on his victory, saying, “I’ve had the pleasure of working with mayor-elect Sohi during his time as city councilor, and have always appreciated and been inspired by how hard he has worked for our community. I have no doubt Edmonton will thrive under his leadership.”Another mayor of Indian origin is completing his term leading the city of Calgary, also in Alberta. Naheed Nenshi, the first Muslim to be elected mayor of a major Canadian city when he achieved that feat in 2010, has chosen not to run again. The new mayor in the city also has roots in India as Jyoti Gondek was elected on Monday night. She was born in the UK to Punjabi parents, originally from India, and the family emigrated to Canada when she was aged four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-amarjeet-sohi-ex-cabinet-minister-elected-mayor-of-edmonton-101634630257857.html

19-10-2021||World||New Zealand's Covid-19 cases touch all-time high, govt pushes for vaccination||New Zealand counted its most new coronavirus cases of the pandemic Tuesday as an outbreak in its largest city grew and officials urged vaccinations as a way out of Auckland's two-month lockdown.Health officials found 94 new local infections, eclipsing the 89 that were reported twice during the early days of the pandemic 18 months ago. Most of the new cases were in Auckland, but seven were found in the nearby Waikato district.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said lockdown rule-breakers were contributing to the spread of infections and noted that many of the new cases had been detected among younger people.“I know the highs and lows of cases is incredibly hard on people, particularly those in Tamaki Makaurau," Ardern said, using the Indigenous Maori name for Auckland. “I just wanted to reinforce again that we're not powerless. We do have the ability to keep cases as low as we can.”New Zealand had successfully eliminated earlier outbreaks by imposing a strict lockdown and by aggressively contact-tracing and isolating those who were infectious. But the approach failed against the more transmissible delta variant. The government has since eased some of Auckland's lockdown rules, allowing more people to return to work.Ardern has also embarked on an all-out effort to get people vaccinated. That's included a televised “Vaxathon” festival on Saturday which saw a record 130,000 people getting shots, more than 2% of the New Zealand's population of 5 million.Ardern has promised to outline a path out of lockdown for Auckland based on vaccination numbers.The government has previously talked about the importance of getting 90% of people aged 12 and over fully vaccinated, including a high proportion of Maori, who have been particularly hard hit by the outbreak.But that goal remains some distance away, with 85% of eligible people having had at least one dose and 67% fully vaccinated. The numbers are lower among Maori.Professor Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, said he was concerned that contact tracers in Auckland would soon become overwhelmed. He said lawmakers needed to consider temporarily reimposing stricter lockdown rules as a circuit breaker.“There are burning embers all over city,” Baker said. “They have lifted the wet blanket of the strong lockdown, and people are getting lockdown fatigue."Baker said he thought it was possible for the government to continue eliminating the outbreak outside of Auckland, provided it kept in place strict border controls around the city.He said the most important goal in any reopening would be to ensure the health system was not overrun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-covid-19-cases-touch-all-time-high-govt-pushes-for-vaccination-101634627215625.html
19-10-2021||World||China’s ‘hypersonic missile’ raises concerns over weakness in US defences||China’s reported launch of a hypersonic missile into orbit has raised concerns that US rivals are quickly neutralising the Pentagon’s missile defenses even as it invests tens of billions of dollars in upgrades. In a test two months ago, the Chinese military sent a nuclear-capable missile into low-orbit space and around the globe before cruising down to its target, the Financial Times reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. Although the weapon missed its mark by about two dozen miles, the paper said, the technology, once perfected, could be used to send nuclear warheads over the South Pole and around American anti-missile systems in the northern hemisphere. China disputed the paper’s account, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian describing it as a “routine test of a space vehicle to verify technology for spacecraft reusability” and comparing it with systems being developed by private companies. “China will work with other countries in the world for the peaceful use of space for the benefit of mankind,” Zhao told a regular news briefing Monday. If the missile test is confirmed, it would suggest that Chinese President Xi Jinping may be exploring orbital strikes as a way to counter American advancements in shooting down ballistic missiles before they can threaten the US homeland. The Russians considered such “fractional orbital bombardment systems” during the Soviet era before abandoning them. But in 2018, Russia rolled out a series of new weapons that President Vladimir Putin said would render US missile defenses “ineffective.”The moves illustrate how the Pentagon’s push to develop and deploy more advanced anti-missile systems, ostensibly to protect against weapons from North Korea and Iran, may be accelerating a new nuclear arms race. Kim Jong Un over the past few years has unveiled a wide range of missiles -- testing what his regime described as a hypersonic glide vehicle last month -- designed to thwart American and allied defenses.Under Kim, North Korea has developed a series of solid-fuel ballistic missiles designed to fly too low to be intercepted by a U.S.-operated antimissile system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD. The missiles may also be too fast to be stopped by Patriot surface-to-air missiles that defend against low-altitude rockets, weapons experts said.Kim Jong Un’s ‘Son of Scud’ Poses New Threat to US TroopsLi Nan, a visiting senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute specializing in Chinese security and military policies at the National University of Singapore, described China sending a missile into orbit as “a game-changer.” “If China was able to deploy one, that would basically neutralize U.S. missile defense,” Li said. “It makes it very hard for the U.S. to deal with this new type of missile and will make it very costly to combat and build up new capabilities to counteract this technology.” After years of development, a U.S. Navy destroyer last year successfully intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile designed to simulate one developed by North Korea. The test, which the head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency described as an “incredible accomplishment and critical milestone,” would potentially allow ships in the U.S.’s Seventh Fleet to shoot down missiles in addition to 44 interceptors based in silos in California and Alaska. The MDA plans to spend $45 billion between fiscal year 2020 and FY24, the Government Accountability Office said in April, after spending about $163 billion over the previous two decades. The Biden administration has pressed ahead with plans to develop a new anti-missile warhead and expand defense systems in Alaska and Europe, despite cost overruns and delays.The U.S. and China have increasingly squared off in places like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait as part of what the Biden administration has characterized as “strategic competition” between the world’s two largest economies. The threat of a U.S. strike that wipes out Chinese missiles before they can hit an American target, has long been seen as a deterrent against more assertive military action by Beijing. The U.S., like Russia, holds more than 4,000 warheads, according to a June report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The PLA Rocket Force, by comparison, added about 30 warheads to its stockpile of about 320 bombs over the past year.Developing hypersonic glide vehicles are one way for countries such as China and North Korea to make the most of their smaller number of warheads, said Melissa Hanham, a non-proliferation expert and an affiliate with the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation. She said there wasn’t yet any public evidence that either country was considering an orbital bombardment strategy. ‘Extremely Risky’“However, weaponizing space in this way is extremely risky and destabilizing should any country pursue it,” Hanham said. “It raises the stakes of an unintended escalation which could lead to nuclear war.”  Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby declined to comment on the Financial Times report Monday, saying only that Beijing’s efforts to advance its military showed why the U.S. regarded China as its “No. 1 pacing challenge.” “We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue, capabilities that only increase tensions in the region and beyond,” Kirby said. The August test was one of several recent moves by Beijing that appeared intended to overcome U.S. advantages in both warhead stockpiles and missile shields and establish a more favorable balance of power. China is building at least 250 missile silos in at least three sites, according to independent analysis of satellite imagery, causing non-proliferation experts to speculate that the People’s Liberation Army might leave many empty to confuse and distract U.S. military planners. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, tweeted the Financial Times story Sunday, saying that Beijing would improve its nuclear deterrence to “ensure that the U.S. abandons the idea of nuclear blackmail against China.”Ankit Panda, the Stanton senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said China’s description of the test as a “space vehicle” likely can’t be taken at face value, since putting a hypersonic glide vehicle into orbit wouldn’t be routine. Although U.S. ship-based systems might be able to intercept such an attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, Panda said, ground-based systems in the north wouldn’t. “Existing U.S. counter-ICBM defenses all rely on intercepting the incoming warhead outside the atmosphere, which is partly why China has looked to gliders in the first place,” Panda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-hypersonic-missile-raises-concerns-over-weakness-in-us-defences-101634625550098.html

This First Nations band is close to Kamloops in British Columbia where 215 unmarked graves of indigenous children were discovered last summer, followed by several other similar findings.Referring to his decision to go on holiday on September 30, Justin Trudeau said, “It was a mistake and I understand that it made a very difficult day even harder.” The day was made a national holiday by the Trudeau government itself earlier this year. He faced flak from the indigenous community for choosing to go vacationing on the date that commemorated the tragedy faced by children of the erstwhile residential school system.As that day was observed at the end of last month, Justin Trudeau’s official schedule stated he was having private meetings in Ottawa. However, he had actually flown to the resort of Tofino, also in British Columbia, for a family holiday and filmed on a beach by the outlet Global News. His office later updated his itinerary with the holiday.His move drew criticism in Canada from various indigenous groups such as the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC). It issued a statement on Friday expressing “shock and dismay” over Trudeau holidaying in Tofino. NWAC CEO Lynne Groulx said the “decision to duck out entirely” on this particular day was “astounding for its sheer level of callousness”.On Monday, Casimir appeared to accept the apology even as she scolded Justin Trudeau over rejecting invitations from the indigenous community and choosing to holiday - even as he looked on. She said, “The shock, anger and sorrow and disbelief was palpable in our community.” However, she said, his appearance on Monday was “about making some positive steps forward and rectifying a mistake”.Emotions over the controversial treatment of Canada’s indigenous people have been high this year due to a series of discoveries of hundreds of unmarked graves of children at or close to the location of residential schools that were operated by the Catholic Church from the mid-19th century into the 1970s.Last summer in Canada, 182 such graves were found near the town of Cranbrook in British Columbia, 751 in Saskatchewan and 215 in Kamloops, also in British Columbia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-visits-indigenous-community-says-sorry-for-holidaying-on-sept-30-101634626117346.html

The request came from Pfizer-BioNTech on Monday, whose new vaccine candidate is meant for children in the age group of aged 5-11 years.As of now, Covid-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in Canada are for those aged 12 years and above.Pfizer’s jabs account for the majority of Covid-19 vaccines administered in Canada, at over 46 million doses. However, the doses for children below 12 cannot be drawn from existing stocks, and will have to be a different formulation and delivered in smaller doses.Health Canada said, “As with all Covid-19 vaccines, the department will prioritise the review of this submission [from Pfizer], while maintaining its high scientific standards for safety, efficacy and quality.”It said it will authorise use of the Pfizer vaccine’s pediatric version “if the independent and thorough scientific review of all the data included in the submission showed that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the potential risks in this age group”.So far, around 82% of the eligible population in Canada has been vaccinated against Covid-19.Health Canada said this was the first submission it has received that aims to vaccinate the 5-11 age group against Covid-19, and studies of the pediatric jab “are ongoing” in children below five years of age.Pfizer apart, other pharma companies are also learnt to be testing their Covid-19 vaccines for children of various age groups. Health Canada is expecting to receive more data for review in the coming months.According to a survey from the agency Angus Reid Institute, 51% of those people sampled in Canada say they will get their children, aged between 5 and 11 years, vaccinated against Covid-19 as soon as a jab is available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-canada-reviewing-pfizer-jab-for-children-aged-5-11-years-101634622877277.html

The figures come a day after figures showed the world's second-biggest economy grew slower than forecast in the same period owing to the regulatory tightening as well as an energy crunch.Real estate output shrank 1.6 per cent on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a report breaking down changes in gross domestic product. The reading marks the first contraction since the first three months of 2020 – when China's Covid-19 outbreak was at its height – and reverse from its 7.1 per cent growth in April-June.At the same time, output from construction slipped 1.8 per cent, the report said, also representing its first decline since the first quarter of last year. Before the pandemic, China's construction sector had never shrunk since at least 1992 when data started being collected, according to data cited by Bloomberg News.Property and construction are pillars of the Chinese economy, underpinning other important sectors such as commodities and furnishings.But they have taken a hit as Beijing wages a regulatory clampdown on the real estate sector, including by tightening rules on lending.The move comes against the backdrop of a $300 billion debt crisis at China Evergrande – one of the nation's biggest property developers – that has hammered investor sentiment and fuelled fears of a spillover into the wider economy.China's central bank has said the risk of contagion is "controllable" and Evergrande will be able to resume unfinished projects.Tuesday's report also showed growth in China's manufacturing output slowed to 4.6 per cent in the third quarter, down from 9.2 per cent in the previous three months, as production curbs at factories battling ongoing energy shortages began to bite.At a news briefing Monday, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said “current international environment uncertainties are mounting and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-real-estate-construction-sectors-shrink-for-first-time-since-covid-19-began-101634622362138.html
19-10-2021||World||China: CPC leader sanctioned for violations in Xinjiang takes charge of Tibet||A rising Chinese politician sanctioned by western countries for alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang has been appointed as the Communist Party of China (CPC) chief of Tibet, Chinese official media reported on Tuesday.Wang Junzheng, 58, was the deputy secretary of the CPC committee of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and political commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.Wang’s appointment for the Tibet role will come under the focus of global rights groups and will be closely tracked by New Delhi in the backdrop of the ongoing border tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The status of current Communist Party secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), 65-year-old Wu Yingjie, who had assumed office in 2016, was not immediately clear though it is likely that he has retired.Earlier this year, the US treasury department had sanctioned Wang, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, for alleged human rights abuses against the Muslim Uighur community.The two were targeted for their role in Xinjiang under the US Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, it said, adding that the move complemented actions taken by the EU, Britain and Canada.“The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its financial powers to promote accountability for the serious human rights abuses occurring in Xinjiang,” the US treasury department had said.Reacting to the sanctions, Wang had told Chinese official media that the move was based on “lies and false information; are a gross slander and an affront to the reputation and dignity of the Chinese people; a flagrant interference in China’s internal affairs; and a grave violation of China’s sovereignty and security interests”. Wang’s appointment for the Tibet role was announced by Zeng Yichun, vice-minister of the organisation department of the CPC’s Central Committee on Tuesday at a meeting of the leading party cadres of TAR in Lhasa.Zeng said the decision was made after thorough consideration and careful study in light of the “overall situation and actual situation of the leadership of the region”.For the Tibet Autonomous Region’s new party chief, Wang, the promotion is a critical one.In 2019, Wang, former party chief of Changchun city, had taken over as the head of the political and legal affairs commission - the top political body responsible for law and order in the region - in XUAR; and in 2020, he was again promoted as deputy CPC secretary of the autonomous region.Earlier this month, Yan Jinhai was appointed deputy chairperson and acting chairperson of TAR while former chairman, Qizhala, resigned, and is expected to take up a new role in Beijing.The reshuffle is likely part of the build-up to the five-yearly CPC Congress to be held next autumn when China’s President Xi Jinping is expected to start his third five-year term as party general secretary, the first Chinese leader to do so in decades.In July, Xi became the first top Chinese leader to visit Tibet since 1990. During his visit, Xi stressed both social stability and the importance of border security for the mountainous region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cpc-leader-sanctioned-for-violations-in-xinjiang-takes-charge-of-tibet-101634621076943.html

19-10-2021||World||Big blow for Nirav Modi, US court junks plea seeking dismissal of fraud charges||In a major blow to Nirav Modi, a bankruptcy court in the US has rejected a petition of the fugitive diamond merchant and two of his associates, seeking dismissal of fraud allegations against them by the trustee of three companies they previously owned indirectly.The allegations were made in a New York court by Richard Levin, the court appointed trustee of three US corporations--Firestar Diamond, Fantasy Inc and A Jaffe--indirectly owned by 50-year-old Modi previously.Levin had also sought a minimum compensation of USD 15 million for “harm” suffered by the debtors of Nirav Modi and his associates Mihir Bhansali and Ajay Gandhi.Southern District of New York Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean H Lane issued the order last Friday, in a major blow to the Indian fugitive and his accomplices.Nirav Modi, who is currently lodged in a jail in the UK, is challenging India's attempts to extradite him to face charges of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case.“SDNY Bankruptcy Court Judge Lane in a clear decision denied defendants Modi, Bansali and Gandhi’s motions to dismiss US Trustee Richard Levin’s amended complaint in the adversary proceeding arising out of Modi’s initial chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, RICO and related state law claims,” Indian American attorney Ravi Batra told PTI.Explaining the 60-page order, Batra said Modi ploughed his profits back into his own company as additional sales to falsely raise the stock price/company valuation by setting up a scheme to defraud Punjab National Bank (PNB) and other banks of over USD 1 billion by a “shell game,” where the ball gets bigger with each sleight of hand, and then issue Letters of Undertaking (sort of a guarantee) to PNB and get loans based upon the inflated ball’s value.“But to get the ill-gotten funds by bank fraud out of his companies, he engaged in a separate fraud to hide those withdrawals for personal benefit as if they were ordinary business transactions,” Batra said based on the court papers.According to the court order, Levin’s petition sought to recover damages for harm inflicted by Modi and his two accomplices on the debtors and their estates as a result of his six-year extensive international fraud, money laundering and embezzlement scheme.The scheme resulted in accrual of claims against the debtors of over USD 1 billion in favour of Punjab National Bank, the diversion of millions of dollars of the debtors’ assets for the benefit of the family of Modi and Bhansali, and the collapse of the debtors and the resulting loss of value of their businesses.“The court’s refusal to dismiss RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) count is legally satisfying, but there is a hole in this celebration by law abiding banks and people: once the appeals are taken, and Modi remains charged with the US Trustee’s amended complaint, in whole or in part, and the case goes to a jury and wins a judgment, it’s only the assets Modi and his cohorts then have can they be compelled to disgorge,” Batra said.“Here, as in every type of “pump and dump” cases, it’s not what was fraudulently taken from Banks' remains, but the size of the original ball’s value in the shell game, less high living expenses, waste, defence fees, etc. Today is a great day for the rule of law, thanks to Judge Lane, as now Modi’s US companies, run by the US Trustee, are going after Modi and his co-defendants so Punjab National Bank can get 10-25 cents on the dollar,” Batra told PTI in response to a question.According to the court ruling, from early 2011 to early 2018, Modi and his associates orchestrated and carried out a scheme to “obtain loans, credits, or other funds under false pretences and without collateral” from numerous banks, including the PNB.The bank fraud involved the use of letters of undertaking (LoUs), a financial instrument unique to India, designed to facilitate efficient import transactions.Modi and the co-conspirators sought to artificially inflate the import volumes of Modi’s India-based companies with sham transactions so as to obtain more LoU funding, it alleged.To carry out this scheme, Modi and his co-conspirators used a web of shell companies known as “shadow entities” based in Hong Kong and Dubai that posed as legitimate businesses to create fake import transactions and launder the proceeds, it said.The PNB and the other defrauded banks are reported to have lost in excess of USD 1 billion as a result of the fraud, the judge wrote in his order.In his petition, Levin listed examples of how Modi, Bhansali and Gandhi directly benefited from fraudulently issued LoUs and were involved in circular transactions until early 2013, when the debtors no longer directly participated in import and export transactions underlying LoU issuances and instead received proceeds indirectly through the “shadow entities”.Meanwhile, the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in August that it is reviewing the London High Court ruling to grant Modi permission to appeal against his extradition order with the Indian government for the next stage in the legal process.The CPS, which represents the Indian authorities in court, highlighted that the appeal can be heard at a full hearing on two grounds related to the mental health of the diamantaire, who is lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London as he fights his extradition to face charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon the PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-blow-for-nirav-modi-us-court-junks-plea-seeking-dismissal-of-fraud-charges-101634618878395.html

The officer will also look at other things, including State Department's special immigrant visa program and the processing of Afghans cleared for admission into the US as refugees, the Fox News report further said.The development was first reported by Politico, which quoted State Department and congressional officials. It also reported that Secretary of State Antony Blinken received an action memorandum on October 15, detailing the investigations into emergency evacuation of the US Embassy in Kabul "to include evacuation of US citizens and Afghan nationals" and other things.Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, notified Congress of her office's actions on Monday, Fox News reported. She also said in separate letter also informed the Congress that her office is launching "several oversight projects" related to the end of US mission in Afghanistan, according to Fox News.Other inspector generals from other department, like defence, are also likely to launch similar investigations.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan in August, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city of Kabul fell to the insurgents.The final days of the withdrawal of American troops turned chaotic, with thousands who had worked with the US and its allies, remaining in the war-torn country. President Joe Biden defended his handling of the withdrawal, calling the US airlift to extract more than 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies from Afghanistan to end a 20-year war an "extraordinary success".Biden has faced tough questions about the way the US went about leaving Afghanistan. He is under heavy criticism, particularly from Republicans, for his handling of the evacuation.Congressional committees, whose interest in the war waned over the years, held public hearings on what went wrong in the final months of the US withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-s-chaotic-afghan-withdrawal-to-be-probed-by-ig-report-101634612803237.html
19-10-2021||World||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Russians left unvaccinated. Here's why||Russia, one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, has a low vaccination figure, which is reportedly fueled by widespread mistrust of the treatment and lacklustre government measures. According to official figures, only 32 per cent of Russians are fully vaccinated, while the country continues hitting record statistics in terms of Covid-19 figures. As many as 34,325 new cases were recorded nationwide in Russia on Monday, a record in the daily tally for the fifth day running. The death toll, too, increased by 998, a number just short of the over 1,000 deaths recorded on Saturday.Also Read | Did Russia steal AstraZeneca Covid jab formula? This report suggests soReporting on the Covid-19 situation in Russia, the New York Times, citing pollsters and sociologists, pointed out that the country's low vaccination rate is a reflection of the “prevalent mistrust in Russian authorities” that has metastasised since the pandemic began last year. At 32 per cent, Russia's vaccination rate shows that only one-third of the entire country's population (42 million inhabitants, according to an estimate put forth by Russia's prime minister Mikhail Mushustin last week) has been vaccinated so far, despite free Covid-19 shots being made available on part of the government.Denis Volkov, the director of an independent polling operation, told NYT that an estimated 40 per cent of Russians have no trust in their government, and these people are an active constituent of the group most reluctant to take the Covid-19 vaccine. This same operation had estimated in one of its August polls that about 52 per cent of Russians are uninterested in getting the vaccines administered.According to the experts, skepticism regarding the Sputnik V vaccine may also be responsible for the low vaccination rate in Russia, considering the fact that Western vaccines, like those made by Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, are not available in the country. There was also an unusual speed and secretive process behind the development of Sputnik V in Russia, reported the Science magazine; its approval was met with criticism in mass media and discussions in the scientific community as to whether distributing the vaccine was justified “in the absence of robust scientific research confirming safety and efficacy.”Also Read | Indian hospitals cancel Russia's Sputnik V vaccine orders. Here's whyThe Vladimir Putin government in Moscow has ruled out the idea of a nationwide lockdown and is instead relying on measures like reintroducing the QR code system in some regions for access to public spaces. Russia's second-largest city - Saint Petersburg - has announced that from November 1, people will need to present a QR code to get into sports and cultural events, where more than 40 people are gathering. Only people who have been fully vaccinated or who have had a negative Covid-19 test in the past 72 hours will receive the QR code.Experts, meanwhile, say that the true Covid-19 death toll in Russia may be significantly higher than the official figure. The Rosstat statistics institute, which uses a broader definition of what constitutes a coronavirus death, has put the toll at more than 400,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-russians-left-unvaccinated-here-s-why-101634609988091.html
19-10-2021||World||'In 2008, warned Bill Gates against sending flirtatious email to employee': Microsoft||Microsoft executives in 2008 warned Bill Gates to stop sending flirtatious emails to a female employee but dropped the matter after he told them he would stop, the company revealed Monday.The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Brad Smith, then Microsoft's general counsel and now its president and vice chair, and another executive met with Gates after the company discovered inappropriate emails to a midlevel employee.The newspaper reported that Gates didn’t deny the exchanges, and members of the Microsoft board who were briefed on them declined to take further action because there wasn't any physical interaction between Gates and the employee.Microsoft declined comment Monday except to confirm the Journal's reporting. Smith didn't return a request for comment made through the company.Gates’ private office said in a written statement that “these claims are false, recycled rumors from sources who have no direct knowledge, and in some cases have significant conflicts of interest.” It declined further comment.The reported 2008 warning came more than a decade before similar alleged behavior led the tech giant to hire a law firm in 2019 to investigate a letter from an engineer who said she had a sexual relationship with Gates over several years.That investigation preceded Gates' departure from Microsoft's board last year, but didn't come to light publicly until after Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced in May they had decided to end their marriage of 27 years. The divorce was finalized in August. The former couple still jointly runs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Gates was Microsoft’s CEO until 2000 and since then has gradually scaled back his involvement in the company he started with Paul Allen in 1975. He transitioned out of a day-to-day role in Microsoft in 2008 and served as chairman of the board until 2014.Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw told the Journal that the 2008 warning from company executives happened shortly before Gates retired as a full-time employee. Shaw told the newspaper that Gates had suggested meeting the employee outside of work in emails that were flirtatious and inappropriate but “not overtly sexual.”The latest disclosure about Gates adds to concerns raised by a Microsoft investor asking fellow shareholders to support a proposal that would force the company to investigate its workplace harassment policies and release a report about them.“Reports of Bill Gates’ inappropriate relationships and sexual advances towards Microsoft employees have only exacerbated concerns, putting in question the culture set by top leadership, and the board’s role holding those culpable accountable,” says the proposal from Arjuna Capital on the agenda of Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting next month.Microsoft urged investors to reject the proposal in a note filed with regulators last week, arguing it is unnecessary because the company has already adopted plans to publicly report how it is implementing its policies on sexual harassment and gender discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-2008-warned-gates-against-sending-flirtatious-email-to-employee-microsoft-101634608979645.html
19-10-2021||World||US Afghan representative Zalmay Khalilzad quits; pays for pro-Taliban tilt||Thomas West has been appointed as the new US special representative to Afghanistan, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in a statement on Monday. This comes after Zalmay Khalilzad resigned from the post following chaotic withdrawal of the American forces from Afghanistan."West, who served on then-Vice President Biden's national security team and on the National Security Council staff, will lead diplomatic efforts, advise the Secretary and Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, and coordinate closely with the US Embassy Kabul presence in Doha on America's interests in Afghanistan," Blinken said in a statement.Blinken also thanked Khalilzad for his "decades of service"."As Special Representative for Afghan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad steps down from his role, I extend my gratitude for his decades of service to the American people," Blinken said in the statement.Khalilzad was the person who led talks with the Taliban in Qatar that resulted in the Doha agreement between the Islamic group and former US President Donald Trump to fully withdraw US troops by May 2021.But he has been criticised for not pressing the Taliban hard enough during peace talks.Current and former US officials told news agency Reuters that in the three years Khalilzad has been in the role, he became the face of one of the largest US diplomatic failures in recent memory.US officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the veteran American diplomat relinquished leverage to the militant group, continuously undermined the Afghan government, and had little interest in hearing different viewpoints within the American government.Some officials, lawmakers and foreign policy experts said that he is one of the few US diplomats to have relations with the Taliban and was simply following orders from both Trump and Joe Biden: Get all American troops out of Afghanistan.In 2019, then president Ashraf Ghani's national security adviser accused Khalilzad of "selling out" the Afghan government in talks while lending the Taliban a façade of credibility. Khalilzad was given a free hand by the Trump administration, but the peace deal he brokered went nowhere. In negotiations, officials said Khalilzad gave away too much early by making clear that Washington was looking to withdraw all of its troops.Khalilzad has so far declined to comment on the record.Born in Afghanistan, Khalilzad was a veteran of past Republican administrations who helped President George W Bush plan the overthrow of the Taliban in 2002.The United States, meanwhile, said on Monday that it will not join talks on Afghanistan announced for this Tuesday by Russia that will include two other key players, China and Pakistan. The state department blamed logistical issues but said it considered the Russian-led forum “constructive.”“We look forward to engaging in that forum going forward, but we're not in a position to take part this week,” state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-representative-zalmay-khalilzad-quits-pays-for-pro-taliban-tilt-101634609176654.html

Here's what we know||North Korea on Tuesday launched an unidentified projectile which was later termed a submarine-launched ballistic missile by the South Korean military, according to news agencies reporting on the development. The development comes in the wake of a series of missile tests conducted by Pyongyang in recent weeks apparently aimed at pressuring the United States and its ally, South Korea, amid stalled talks over nuclear diplomacy.Also Read | North Korea threatens top UN body against crticising its missile programThe North Korean ‘projectile’ was fired into the sea east of the Korean peninsula, reported the AFP news agency citing South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seoul, however, provided no further details immediately after the incident, the agency added.Meanwhile, the Reuters news agency independently reported, citing the Japan coast guard, that North Korea has fired a “possible missile”.Later, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, citing the country's Joint Chiefs of Staff, that North Korea fired a submarine launched ballistic missile in its latest missile test on Tuesday.The Associated Press said that Seoul has declined to immediately comment officially on the exact nature of the projectile that North Korea fired or how far it flew.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling US-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s denuclearisation steps.Also Read | Analysing North Korean missile test: What it means for the regionNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to strengthen his nuclear deterrent since his diplomatic fallout with former US president Donald Trump. However, Pyongyang has so far rejected the current Biden administration’s offers to restart dialogue without preconditions, saying that Washington must first abandon its “hostile policy,” a term the North mainly uses to refer to sanctions and US-South Korea military exercises.Meanwhile, ending a months-long lull, the country has been ramping up its weapons tests since September while making conditional peace offers to Seoul, reviving a pattern of pressuring South Korea to get what it wants from the United States. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-unidentified-projectile-could-possibly-be-a-missile-here-s-what-we-know-101634607088949.html

Here's why||The United States said it will not join talks on Afghanistan announced for this Tuesday by Russia that will include two other key players, China and Pakistan. The state department blamed logistical issues but said it considered the Russian-led forum “constructive.”“We look forward to engaging in that forum going forward, but we're not in a position to take part this week,” state department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Monday.Russian envoy Zamir Kabulov on Friday announced the four-nation talks in Moscow, saying they would aim to “work out a common position on the changing situation in Afghanistan.” Russia, China, and Pakistan have been among the most active nations in engaging the Taliban since the Islamists took over Afghanistan in August during the US pullout after 20 years of war.The United States has been encouraging nations not to recognise the Taliban government, hoping for leverage on key issues of concern including the rights of women and girls.Price declined to explain the logistical issues that prevented the United States from attending. The talks come amid an intensifying dispute over the number of diplomats the United States is allowed to accredit in Moscow, although Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at a June summit agreed to seek cooperation where possible on other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-won-t-join-afghanistan-talks-announced-by-russia-here-s-why-101634606434731.html
19-10-2021||World||Capitol Hill riots: Trump sues to stop release of Jan 6 White House records||Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to block the release of documents related to the January 6 Capitol insurrection to a congressional committee investigating the attack, challenging President Joe Biden's initial decision to waive executive privilege. In a federal lawsuit, Trump said the committee's request was “almost limitless in scope,” and sought records with no reasonable connection to that day. He called it a “vexatious, illegal fishing expedition” that was “untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,” according to the papers filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.Trump’s lawsuit was expected, as he had said he would challenge the investigation and at least one ally, Steve Bannon, has defied a subpoena. But the legal challenge went beyond the initial 125 pages of records that Biden recently cleared for release to the committee. The suit, which names the committee as well as the National Archives, seeks to invalidate the entirety of the congressional request, calling it overly broad, unduly burdensome, and a challenge to separation of powers. It requests a court injunction to bar the archivist from producing the documents.The Biden administration, in clearing the documents for release, said the violent siege of the Capitol was such an extraordinary circumstance that it merited waiving the privilege that usually protects White House communications.In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, the White House worked to undercut Bannon's argument before a scheduled committee vote on whether to recommend criminal contempt charges against him. Bannon is a one-time White House adviser who left the administration years before the insurrection.Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote that the president's decision on the documents applied to Bannon, too, and “at this point we are not aware of any basis for your client’s refusal to appear for a deposition.”“President Biden’s determination that an assertion of privilege is not justified with respect to these subjects applies to your client’s deposition testimony and to any documents your client may possess concerning either subject,” Su wrote to Bannon's lawyer.Bannon’s attorney said he had not yet seen the letter and could not comment on it. While Bannon has said he needs a court order before complying with his subpoena, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former White House and Pentagon aide Kashyap Patel are negotiating with the committee. It is unclear whether a fourth former White House aide, Dan Scavino, will comply.The committee has also subpoenaed more than a dozen people who helped plan Trump rallies ahead of the siege, and some of them have already said they would turn over documents and give testimony.Lawmakers want the documents as part of their investigation into how a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6 in a violent effort to halt the certification of Biden’s election win. The committee demanded a broad range of executive branch papers related to intelligence gathered before the attack, security preparations during and before the siege, the pro-Trump rallies held that day, and Trump’s false claims that he won the election, among other matters.Trump's lawsuit says the “boundless requests included over fifty individual requests for documents and information, and mentioned more than thirty individuals, including those working inside and outside government.”The files must be withheld, the lawsuit says, because they could include “conversations with (or about) foreign leaders, attorney work product, the most sensitive of national security secrets, along with any and all privileged communications among a pool of potentially hundreds of people.”The suit also challenges the legality of the Presidential Records Act, arguing that allowing an incumbent president to waive the executive privilege of a predecessor just months after they left office is inherently unconstitutional. Biden has said he would go through each request separately to determine whether that privilege should be waived.While not spelled out in the Constitution, executive privilege has developed to protect a president’s ability to obtain candid counsel from his advisers without fear of immediate public disclosure and to protect his confidential communications relating to official responsibilities.But that privilege has its limitations in extraordinary situations, as exemplified during the Watergate scandal, when the Supreme Court ruled it could not be used to shield the release of secret Oval Office tapes sought in a criminal inquiry, and following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Monday's lawsuit was filed by Jesse Binnall, an attorney based in Alexandria, Virginia, who represented Trump in an unsuccessful lawsuit late last year seeking to overturn Biden’s victory in Nevada. Trump and his allies have continued to make baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.Trump’s suit quotes from the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in a case by House committees seeking the then-sitting president’s tax returns and other financial records. But that case involved courts enforcing a congressional subpoena. The high court in that case directed lower courts to apply a balancing test to determine whether to turn over the records — it's still pending.Neither the White House nor the select committee had an immediate comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-hill-riots-trump-sues-to-stop-release-of-jan-6-white-house-records-101634603490946.html
19-10-2021||World||6 people, including an American, slain at ranch in Costa Rica||Six people, including a US man, were killed in what may have been a robbery at the American’s ranch in Costa Rica, the national detectives’ agency said Monday. The agency identified the American as Steve Sandusky but did not offer a US hometown for him. It said Sandusky was a resident of Costa Rica and owned the ranch in Puntarenas province south of San Jose, the capital. The ranch is about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from the nearest public road.The other five victims are believed to be Costa Rican nationals who Sandusky had asked to come to the ranch to repair agricultural machinery, authorities said. Their families lost contact with them Sunday and went to the ranch to look for them.The dead include a man, his wife, and their 20-year-old son. The bodies of Sandusky and one other victim had been burned; a third had been doused in fuel but not burned. All appeared to have been shot.Authorities said they are still investigating the killings, but that robbery appears to be a possible motive because Sandusky’s home was ransacked and a window was broken.The US embassy said it could not comment on the case because of privacy concerns.The brutality of the killings shocked Costa Rica, the most peaceful nation in Central America, with a homicide rate of about 11 killings per 100,000 people annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-people-including-an-american-slain-at-ranch-in-costa-rica-101634602068342.html

The UN health agency said it is expecting one additional piece of information from Covaxin manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, which has been submitting data to the WHO on a rolling basis.“We are aware many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners - before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective,” the WHO said in a series of tweets.The WHO’s nod for Covaxin’s emergency use authorisation is necessary for its widespread acceptability as a safe and effective vaccine. “The timeframe for the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure is dependent on how quickly a company producing the vaccine is able to provide the data required for WHO to evaluate the vaccine’s quality, safety, efficacy and its suitability for low- and middle-income countries,” the WHO tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/awaiting-more-information-on-covaxin-who-101634583372965.html

The report said the feat had “caught US intelligence by surprise”.Asked to share details about the testing, the Chinese foreign ministry on Monday denied it.“It was not a missile, it was a space vehicle,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing. “It’s understood that this was a routine test of a space vehicle to verify the technology of the spacecraft’s reusability,” Zhao said.He added that the test was essential to reduce the cost of spacecraft use, providing a convenient and inexpensive way for humans to use space for peaceful purposes.Many firms in the world have conducted similar experiments and the separating part of the spacecraft was its accessory part, and it would burn and break up in the atmosphere and the debris would fall into international waters, Zhao said.“China will work with other countries for the peaceful use of space for the benefit of mankind,” Zhao noted.The tabloid Global Times while questioning the veracity of the FT report said China was narrowing the military capability with the US.“It is meaningless to discuss the credibility of the FT report. But it is important to note the unstoppable trend that China is narrowing the gap with the US in some key military technologies as China is continuously developing its economic and technological strength,” the tabloid said in an opinion piece. “China doesn’t need to engage in an ‘arms race’ with the US - it is capable of weakening the US’s overall advantages over China by developing military power at its own pace,” it added.The US and Russia have tested hypersonic weapons in recent months, and North Korea said in September it had tested a newly developed hypersonic missile.Hypersonic missiles can fly at more than five times the speed of sound and like ballistic missiles can deliver a nuclear warhead.Meanwhile, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said on Monday that Washington was closely watching China’s development of advanced weapons systems but declined to comment on the FT report.Austin was speaking at a news conference during a visit to Georgia, a Reuters report from Tbilisi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trashes-ft-report-says-it-tested-spacecraft-not-hypersonic-missile-101634582192835.html
