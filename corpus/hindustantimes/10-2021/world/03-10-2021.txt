Girls are yet to continue education in the country, and women employees of the Kabul city government have been asked to “stay home.”In a latest report by AFP, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the group is “finalising things” and schools for girls will soon reopen. Furthermore, the women’s ministry in the previous Afghan cabinet has also been shut down, and replaced with “Ministries of Prayer and Guidance and the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,” which the AFP report noted, earned notoriety for implementing strict religious doctrines under the Taliban’s previous reign."These positions are considered important for the functioning of the Emirate," Mujahid said, according to AFP. Also Read | Afghanistan on brink of collapse, Taliban fighters surviving on donation: ReportBorrell has urged the international community to keep people on ground in Afghanistan as well as focus on humanitarian workers. He added that the question is no longer which member EU states agree to a “minimal EU presence” in the war-torn nation, but “when and how.” “We are working on possible options, taking into account the security situation,” he wrote in the blog post. The EU has so far beefed up the humanitarian aid from 57 million euros to 200 million euros since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, and along with other member states, it has pledged 677 million euros to assist the Afghans living in the country. (With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-situation-only-getting-worse-need-people-on-ground-eu-official-101633284192127.html
03-10-2021||World||70% of media outlets in Afghanistan stopped working since Taliban's takeover||At least 70 per cent of media outlets have stopped working in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control over the country due to financial problems, National Association of Journalists s.The national association of journalists in a press conference in Kabul on Sunday, said that they found the statistics after conducting an online survey in 28 provinces of Afghanistan, Khamma Press reported.They said that 1,500 Afghan journalists had taken part in the survey.As per the statistics of the organization, 67 per cent of the Afghan journalists have lost their jobs and 33 per cent of them are busy working under acute pressure and in tough situations.The Head of the national association of journalists said Masroor Lutfi said that most of the Afghan media that are active are confronting dire economic and financial situations."40 per cent of the Afghan journalists are worried about their safety in Afghanistan and rest of them are living a difficult life as they have lost their jobs." Said Lutfi.The re-emergence of the Taliban in Afghanistan raised the concerns among many that journalists in the country would be targeted to silence dissent.Recently, two Afghan journalists were beaten in police custody after covering a protest by women in Kabul.At the first Taliban news conference on August 17 after the group took Kabul, their spokesperson, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that media will remain "free and independent," provided they work according to "Islamic principles," and are fair and serve "national interests."The Human Rights Watch said that Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have imposed wide-ranging restrictions on media and free speech that are already stifling criticism and dissent.Taliban security forces have also arbitrarily detained journalists and beaten several. The head of a journalists' advocacy group told Human Rights Watch that the Taliban have taken at least 32 journalists into custody since they took power in Kabul on August 15, the Human Rights Watch said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-of-media-outlets-in-afghanistan-stopped-working-since-taliban-s-takeover-101633281707939.html

This is the lesson from 31 years of German unity."Merkel described her decision last year, on the 30th anniversary of Germany's reunification, to restrict civil liberties to curb the spread of the coronavirus as "one of the most difficult experiences" of her time as chancellor.Merkel took power in 2005 - when George W. Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair British prime minister. She plans to step down once a new government is formed following last Sunday's elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tolerate-your-differences-angela-merkel-nearly-in-tears-calls-to-end-east-west-divide-101633278967504.html

The bomb targeted the Eidgah Mosque, situated in the capital city of Kabul.The explosion occurred at a time when a memorial service was being held for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid."Our initial information shows two civilians were killed and three wounded in the blast," news agency AFP reported quoting interior ministry spokesman, Qari Sayed Khosti.So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the explosion. The area around the mosque has been cordoned off by the security officials.Mujahid, who is also the deputy minister of information and culture in the Taliban-led cabinet, also tweeted about the explosion. "An explosion happened in a crowded place at Eid Gah Mosque in Kabul on Sunday afternoon and has caused causalities," Mujahid wrote in Urdu.Ambulances are at the site and carrying injured to Kabul's Emergency Hospital, according to reports by the local media.On August 15, the Taliban group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States, took over the the capital city of Afghanistan in a military offensive. The group took advantage of the vacuum created in the aftermath of chaotic exit by the US forces.In August, a bomb explosion at the Hamid Karzai International Airport,  killed dozens of people including 12 US troops. The explosion targeted the crowd of people who were gathered at the airport waiting for evacuation flights. Later, the responsibility of the same was taken by the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-reported-outside-a-mosque-in-kabul-several-civilians-killed-101633262061246.html

Flights have already been stopped across Oman, which is located on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.According to the weather forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD), the cyclone would make landfall in Oman from the Arabian Sea around Sunday night. Along with it, the cyclone would pack wind gusts up to 110 kph (68 mph) on approaching Muscat, the sultanate’s capital.A public holiday was declared in Oman on Sunday and Monday, while the UAE went on high alert.Authorities have ordered people in the coastal areas to evacuate their homes. More than 2,700 people were put up in emergency shelters. Neighbouring United Arab Emirates (UAE) has also alerted residents on its eastern reaches to be prepared for the storm.“Authorities are on high alert to deal with the upcoming situation, and take all proactive and preventive measures to mitigate its impact,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg at a media briefing.However, the storm is expected to weaken sharply after landfall.Flights to and from the capital city of Muscat have been delayed or cancelled ahead of the landfall, which is expected to bring very high winds and heavy rainfall. Roads would remain open only to emergency vehicles and those on humanitarian journeys until the storm dies down, authorities said.Meanwhile, Oman’s national emergency committee said the power supply would be cut in al-Qurm, located east of Muscat, to avoid untoward incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-killed-as-cyclone-shaheen-approaches-oman-flights-rescheduled-101633256757215.html

He was travelling with his relatives in a sedan along a road in Police district 5 of Jalalabad city on Saturday evening when gunmen, who were in a rickshaw, opened fire on them.The source said that Saadat’s son and the driver of the sedan were injured in the shootout.No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday’s killings till now and the Taliban are probing the case, the source also told Xinhua.The incident comes weeks after a series of explosions that targeted Taliban vehicles in the Nangarhar province, killed three people and injured 20 others.Since the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban last month, violence against journalists has been on the rise in the war-ravaged country. In recent days, press freedom organisations raised concerns over the ferocity against media professionals.Last month, the Taliban on September 7 had briefly detained some journalists in the capital city of Kabul during the anti-Pakistan protests. Some media reports claimed that the equipment of the journalists was also confiscated by the Islamic Emirate.And on the very next day, two journalists- Nematullah Naqdi and Taqi Daryabi, who work for the Etilaat Roz (Information Daily), were picked by Taliban enforces on September 8 as they were covering a women’s protest in Kabul.The journalists said that they were accused of organising the protest and were then beaten with batons, whops and electrical cables. “One of the Taliban put his foot on my head, crushed my face against the concrete. They kicked me in the head... I thought they were going to kill me,” Nematullah Naqdi told the AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalist-2-others-killed-in-shootout-in-afghanistan-s-nangarhar-province-101633256749438.html

The country still offered conditional talks with South Korea, in what some experts call an attempt to pressure Seoul to persuade Washington to relax crippling economic sanctions on it.Under multiple UN Security Council resolutions, North Korea is banned from engaging in any ballistic missile activities as the country aims to mount nuclear weapons on its ballistic missiles. North Korea has argued its nuclear program is meant to cope with US military threats, though Washington has said it has no hostile intent toward Pyongyang.Despite its recent launches, North Korea maintains a 2018 self-imposed moratorium on a long-range missile directly threatening the American homeland, a sign that it still wants to keep alive chances for future diplomacy with the US.US officials have urged North Korea to return to talks without preconditions, but the North has argued it won’t do so unless the Americans drop their "hostile policy,” in an apparent reference to the sanctions and regular military drills between Washington and Seoul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-threatens-top-un-body-against-crticising-its-missile-program-101633252576566.html
03-10-2021||World||Over thousand people show up at victory rally outside Kabul to back Taliban rule||More than 1,500 Taliban supporters attended a rally on Sunday in a vast field to the north of Kabul, in a show of strength as they consolidate their rule of Afghanistan.The crowd, exclusively men and boys, heard speeches by leading Taliban officials and commanders at Kohdaman township in the hilly outskirts of the capital.The rally was the first of its kind in the capital since the Islamist group seized control of the country seven weeks ago following a lightning offensive.Flanked by white and black Taliban standards and fighters in combat gear carrying assault rifles, the speakers addressed an audience sat in rows of chairs under awnings.As the event went on, more and more supporters arrived, leaving several hundred sitting to watch from chairs in the midday sun.Mawlawi Muslim Haqqani, the deputy minister of Hajj and Religious Affairs, hailed the Islamist hardliners' takeover, saying Christians and Westerners had been defeated.A string of men also railed against the United States, and one told the crowd to "respect elders" because they were the "mujahids who fought against the Soviets" in the 1980s.A speaker introduced as Rahmatullah, from nearby Mir Bacha Kot, said the Taliban's victory was "the result of those youths who stood in queues to register for suicide attacks".To kick off proceedings, a procession of fighters carrying flags and weapons -- including rocket launchers -- paraded around the crowd.Some of the mainly unarmed supporters waved homemade posters, while others sported red or white Taliban headbands.Tribal elders watched on cross-legged from the side of the stage.As people arrived, music honouring the Taliban's victories echoed around the site as dozens of heavily armed fighters in military combat fatigues stood guard."America is defeated, impossible, impossible -- but possible!" one song said.Some chanted pro-Taliban slogans as they drove down the dusty road on pick-up trucks to the site, as others shouted "Allahu Akbar" (God is greatest) when they walked into the shaded area in front of the stage.Women's protestsAt the turn-off towards the township, about 10 armed fighters lined the road beneath a large banner honouring a deceased Taliban commander and professing the "support of the people of Kohdaman for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the action of liberating the country".Last Thursday, the Taliban had violently cracked down on a small women's rights demonstration in eastern Kabul, firing shots into the air to disperse protesters.Then, gunmen pushed back the women protesters as they tried to continue with the demonstration, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming.A Taliban fighter released a brief burst of gunfire into the air with his automatic weapon, AFP journalists saw.Isolated anti-Taliban rallies -- with women at the forefront -- were staged in cities around the country after the group seized power, including in the western city of Herat where two people were shot dead.But protests have dwindled since the government issued an order banning demonstrations that did not have prior authorisation, warning of "severe legal action" for violators.The handful that have gone ahead have been criticised as carefully orchestrated publicity stunts, including a rally at a Kabul university where hundreds of fully veiled women professed support for the new regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-thousand-people-show-up-at-victory-rally-outside-kabul-to-back-taliban-rule-101633250772868.html

According to the NK News site, Kim Jong Un appeared at events of the Korean People’s Army from July 24 to July 27 and was also seen in footage of a war veterans conference and related programmes from July 27 to July 29.The images from these events show Kim Jong Un without the bandage about the size of a few postage stamps and in some a dark greenish spot or bruise on his head could be seen, NK News site reported. "The cause or nature of the large, dark green spot or bruise on the rear right side of his head, which was covered with a bandage in some footage, is still unknown and is difficult to diagnose using only images," it said.Also read | Propaganda value, optics behind thinner Kim Jong Un, say analystsNK News also said that the mark on Kim Jong Un's head was not seen at a politburo meeting on June 29 as it reported that photos of the 37-year-old leader released from an appearance with musicians on July 11 did not show the back of his head.The Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday that South Korea’s National Intelligence Service believes there have been no unusual signs regarding Kim Jong Un’s health. It cited lawmakers briefed by the spy agency, which added the patch was removed after a few days and there was no scar.This is not the first time that Kim Jong Un's injuries or health issues, which have been carefully controlled by state media outlets, have come out in the public. The latest photos come after a state media outlet in June cited a citizen as saying that North Koreans broke down in tears after seeing a dramatically thinner Kim after being absent for most of the previous month.In July, South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee briefed by the National Intelligence Service said that Kim Jong Un lost between 10 and 20 kilogrammes but has no major health issues affecting his rule. “If there is an abnormality in his health, there should be signs that drugs are being imported to the clinic that’s in charge of Kim’s health, but that was not detected, adding that Kim Jong Un still hosts hours-long meetings and there’s nothing unusual about how he walks," the lawmaker said.Also read | Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the worldKim was absent from the public eye for six weeks in 2014 and reappeared walking with a cane, raising speculation he could be suffering from gout.A bandage was seen around his left wrist in November 2015 and a bandage around his finger in June 2019.

Women who have courageously come forward have felt betrayed.”The Canadian Press reported recently that the calls for his ouster from the ministry will be very difficult for Trudeau to ignore.The controversy started this year as then Chief of Defence Staff Jonathan Vance resigned in January amid allegations of impropriety of a sexual nature. Sajjan has come under severe criticism in this matter after the military ombudsman of the time revealed that the Defence Minister was informed about Vance’s alleged “improper conduct” with a subordinate in 2018. In May, an advisor to Trudeau testified before the House of Commons Defence Committee that she was aware of the allegations. There were accusations that Sajjan did not act against Vance due to their long relationship, as they had both served together in Afghanistan. Vance’s successor Admiral Art McDonald stepped aside less than a month-and-a-half into his term as he also faces an investigation by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service. More such incidents have come to light since.Also Read: US charges Canadian jihadist who narrated Islamic State videosSajjan was censured by the House of Commons in a vote in June this year.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeu is expected to announce his new cabinet team later this month.The country’s former Chief of Defence Staff, General Jonathan Vance, 57, resigned in January this year jut before allegations emerged that he allegedly had an inappropriate relationship.

03-10-2021||World||50 days after occupation, no recognition for brutal Taliban regime in Kabul||Fifty days after the Sunni Pashtun terrorist force militarily occupied Kabul, there are no international takers for the Taliban with India putting the onus on the secrecy of Doha deal makers to take the first step towards recognition of the medieval Islamic regime. The so-called Doha Peace Process was between US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, now Taliban deputy prime minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Qatari national security advisor Mohammed bin Ahmed Al Mesned, UK chief of defence staff Nick Carter and Pakistani army chief Qamar Jawed Bajwa. The details of the Doha process have not been shared with any other country. Behind the scenes, Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi supported the Taliban takeover of Kabul.Since Pakistani ISI backed Sirajuddin Haqqani captured Kabul on August 15, the Taliban have formed an exclusive government with no space for neither the minorities nor women. Women have been pushed back to the medieval ages with Sharia law in force and large scale atrocities have been mounted on anyone perceived to be an enemy of the Taliban. Even the motto of the Afghan National Army has been changed and now resembles that of the Pakistan army.According to a Kabul watcher, no country wants to take lead in recognising the Taliban regime after all the commitments made and publicly voiced by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar to the Doha process have been thrown out of the window. To add to this, the international community is now blaming the Doha deal makers for human rights abuses in Afghanistan as it was none other than UK CDS Carter who promoted the Taliban by calling them “country boys” and wanted the global community to give them space as the majority of the Taliban boys were born after the 9/11 attacks. “It may be that this Taliban is different Taliban from the one that people remember from the 1990s.”The tremendous miscalculation made by the Doha deal makers is evident from the fact that now even General Mark Milley, US chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, has changed his tune by calling the Taliban a terrorist group in bed with al Qaeda. The Taliban regime with ISI as mid-wife remain as medieval as in the past and have no qualms about undoing all that was done by the US-led coalition forces in the past 20 years. There is infighting within the Kabul regime with Taliban headed by Mullah Yaqoob on one side and Sirajuddin Haqqani on the other with Baradar having nowhere to go.While Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan praised the Taliban for breaking the shackles of (US) slavery on August 15, Islamabad is no longer happy with the situation with no country wanting to recognise the regime and the UN passing a stringent 2593 resolution on Afghanistan under the presidentship of India on August 30. Even Islamabad’s hope that the Taliban regime would force the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan to come to the table has failed as the latter terror group is simply not interested and has started to engage Rawalpindi again. To add to Islamabad’s misery is the fact that India heads the 1267 committee, responsible for designating and revoking terrorist labels and ensuing sanctions, in the UN by end of 2022.“It is for countries that are privy to the Doha accord which should recognize the Taliban regime first as no one is aware of the details of the agreement. After what has Taliban done to Afghanistan, these Doha countries have no right to question any other country on human rights abuses,” said a former foreign secretary.With no governance in Kabul, food and fuel supplies running short in Afghanistan, the Taliban terror regime is rapidly taking the already failed country to disaster. And the Doha peacemakers must share this burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/50-days-after-occupation-no-recognition-for-brutal-taliban-regime-in-kabul-101633248103232.html

The site features hundreds of pavilions and other facilities on a showground twice the size of Monaco.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who visited Expo on Saturday, said France was "not part of" the European Parliament's resolution."Our relation with the UAE is a strategic one, it's very close, and we can say things in all transparency and if we need to say something to the UAE government, well we do so but behind closed doors," he told reporters.The event has drawn widespread criticism from human rights activists over poor treatment of the low-paid migrant laborers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who keep the UAE's economy booming.(with inputs from AFP, AP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-dead-70-injured-at-dubai-s-expo-2020-construction-site-report-101633238351319.html

Before that, the health pass was already required in museums, theatres, movies and all public events attended by over fifty people.Starting August 9, the pass became mandatory in restaurants, bars, shopping centres, airplanes and long-distance trains.The move caused widespread discontent among the French, and protests against the measure have been held every weekend since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-why-thousands-are-protesting-across-france-101633234200921.html
03-10-2021||World||Philippines' Duterte says daughter will run for president in 2022 elections: Report||Philippine President Rodrigo's daughter would run for president in next year's election and her father's long-time aide, who filed his vice presidential candidacy, would be her running mate, broadcasting firm ABS-CBN news reported late on Saturday.Sara Duterte-Carpio is currently mayor of Davao, the Philippines' third-largest city, and filed on Saturday to run for mayor again. She has previously said she would not run for national office next year.ABS-CBN news based its report on an interview that Duterte had with a broadcast journalist right after he announced that he was retiring from politics while accompanying his closest loyalist, Senator Christopher "Bong" Go, who filed his vice presidential candidacy.He was asked: "So is it clear, Sara-Go?""It is Sara-Go," Duterte said in response.Duterte-Carpio, her spokesperson and Go did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.ABS-CBN news said it obtained permission from the broadcast journalist to use the video https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/02/21/duterte-sara-to-run-for-president-with-go-as-her-vp showing Duterte outside a hotel in Manila where the registration of candidates was taking place, and that a transcript was also provided.In the same clip, Duterte was asked when his daughter would file her candidacy for president, he said: "I really do not know. I do not have any idea at all".Asked if he had given his daughter permission to run for president, he said: "Ah, no, actually we don't talk about politics, ever since we never talk about politics. I would say that it is for the better," Duterte was quoted as saying.ABS-CBN said Duterte-Carpio's spokesperson, Mayor Christina Garcia Frasco responded "no comment" when asked about Duterte said.Duterte, 76, said on Saturday he was retiring from politics , a surprise move that fuelled speculation he was clearing the way for a presidential run by his daughter.He had been expected to run for the No. 2 job, a plan most Filipinos oppose as violating the spirit of the constitution which sets a one-term limit for the president to stop power being abused.Duterte-Carpio's mayorial re-election filing, did little to douse speculation she has her eye on the presidency.Political analysts were sceptical, noting that last-minute changes were still possible, as in 2015 when Duterte entered the presidential election race at the eleventh hour and won by a huge margin, and Duterte-Carpio, they said, could do the same.Candidates have until Oct. 8 to register, but withdrawals and substitutions are allowed until Nov. 15, leaving scope for last-minute changes of heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-duterte-says-daughter-will-run-for-president-in-2022-elections-report-101633224125539.html
03-10-2021||World||World Habitat Day 2021: Know its history, significance and theme||World Habitat Day is observed on the first Monday of October every year. This year, it is being observed on October 4 across the world. The day is recognised by the United Nations and observed to reflect on the state or condition of towns and cities and promote the basic right to adequate shelter or housing for all.According to the UN, cities are responsible for around 70 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions with transport, buildings, energy and waste management accounting for the large bulk of urban greenhouse gas emissions. This day will amplify the global race to zero campaign and UN-Habitat’s ClimateAction4Cities and motivate local governments to develop actionable zero-carbon plans in the run-up to the international climate change summit COP26 in November this year.History of World Habitat DayIt was in 1985 that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) decided to observe World Habitat Day as an annual event and designated the first Monday of October to be celebrated as World Habitat Day every year. World Habitat Day was first observed in 1986 with its theme as ‘Shelter is my right’. It was hosted by Nairobi, Kenya that year.Significance of World Habitat DayAccording to the United Nations, around 1.8 billion people were already living in slums and informal settlements, inadequate housing or in homelessness in cities across the world before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Amid the pandemic, the need of having a home has grown remarkably in order to make a safe environment for living, working and learning.World Habitat Day is observed in many nations across the globe to address the problems of rapid urbanisation and its impact on the environment and human poverty. The day also intends to remind the world of its collective responsibility for the future of the human habitat.Theme of World Habitat DayThe theme of this year’s World Habitat Day is accelerating urban action for a carbon-free world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-habitat-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101633218203291.html
03-10-2021||World||US charges Canadian jihadist who narrated Islamic State videos||A Canadian jihadist who fought for the Islamic State group and narrated violent propaganda videos has been taken into custody by the United States and charged, the Justice Department said Saturday.Mohammed Khalifa, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was captured during a firefight in January 2019 by Kurdish-dominated Syrian forces allied with the United States.The 38-year-old was handed over "recently" to US authorities and charged in Virginia with conspiring to provide material support to IS resulting in death, says a Justice Department statement.Khalifa left Canada in 2013 to join the Islamic State group in Syria, and by the next year had become a key member of its propaganda team because of his fluent English and Arabic, according to the statement.He allegedly served as a lead translator in Islamic State propaganda production and as the English-speaking narrator on two violent recruitment videos.The cell was behind videos showing the beheadings of foreigners including the US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who died in 2014.He faces a possible life sentence in the United States. Canada additionally hopes to charge him, according to media there.The Canadian government said it was in contact with local authorities on the matter and that its federal police were aware "that he will be facing charges" in the United States.In an exchange of emails cited in the charge sheet, Khalifa defended the IS killings he was associated with."Mohammed Khalifa not only fought for ISIS on the battlefield in Syria, but he was also the voice behind the violence," said Acting US Attorney Raj Parekh for the Eastern District of Virginia, using another acronym for the Islamic State group.According to the indictment, Khalifa's "primary focus" was "enticing ISIS supporters to travel to ISIS-controlled areas to join ISIS or to conduct attacks in the West, including in the United States."The jihadist group, classified as a terrorist organization by US authorities, is responsible for a wave of deadly attacks in Western countries.Its emergence prompted intervention by a US-led international military coalition, which succeeded in defeating the self-proclaimed "caliphate" even though IS is still present in many additional countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, and continues to pose a threat according to US and European intelligence services.- 'Glorified' murders, cruelty -In a 2019 interview with Canada's CBC from his Syrian prison, Khalifa showed no regret for his actions. He said he wanted to return to Canada with his wife and their three children, but on the condition that he would not be tried there."Through his alleged leading role in translating, narrating, and advancing ISIS's online propaganda, Khalifa promoted the terrorist group, furthered its worldwide recruitment efforts, and expanded the reach of videos that glorified the horrific murders and indiscriminate cruelty of ISIS," Parekh said.This is the first known indictment of a foreign IS fighter in America since President Joe Biden took power in January.Two members of the notorious Islamic State kidnapping cell dubbed the "Beatles," Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are currently in the hands of US authorities after being transferred to the United States from Iraq nearly a year ago.The pair are accused of involvement in the murders of Foley and Sotloff, as well as those of relief workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.Kotey, a former British national who was stripped of his citizenship, pleaded guilty in early September to charges of conspiring to murder the four American hostages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-canadian-jihadist-who-narrated-islamic-state-videos-101633217837480.html
03-10-2021||World||Thousands in Brazil protest against President Bolsonaro, seek his impeachment||With Brazil’s presidential election one year away, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and dozens of other cities around the country to protest President Jair Bolsonaro and call for his impeachment over his government’s handling of the pandemic.The protests, smaller than those in support of Bolsonaro last Sept. 7, were promoted by leftist parties and some union movements linked to the former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s Worker´s Party. Da Silva is widely expected to run against Bolsonaro in Brazil's Oct. 2, 2022 presidential election.Saturday’s protest targeted the president for his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Bolsonaro, who is not vaccinated and doesn’t usually wear a mask, has underestimated the severity of the virus and promoted crowds during the pandemic. Some 597,000 have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, a country of 212 million people. Demonstrators also protested surging inflation in mainstays like food and electricity.“It is very painful to see that health and education are being destroyed, and there are many starving people in the country,” Marilena Magnano, a 75-year-old retiree, told The Associated Press. “We need Bolsonaro out of the government, his time has passed”.The president’s approval ratings have steadily declined throughout the year, but he remains far more popular than prior presidents who were impeached - most recently Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party in 2016.Over 130 impeachment requests have been filed since the start of Bolsonaro’s administration, but the lower house’s speaker, Arthur Lira, and his predecessor have declined to open proceedings. Division among the opposition is the key reason analysts consider it unlikely there will be enough pressure on Lira to open impeachment process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-brazil-protest-against-president-bolsonaro-seek-his-impeachment-101633215185060.html
