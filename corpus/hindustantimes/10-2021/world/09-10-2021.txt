Nothing should be done to weaken the existing government in Afghanistan which can lead to problems for the people," he said, in a recorded statement translated by AFP.Muttaqi's remarks came on the first of two days of talks with a US team led by the State Department's Deputy Special Representative Tom West and top USAID humanitarian official Sarah Charles.He said the US would also help vaccinate Afghans against Covid-19.No immediate comment on the talks was available from the US side."The delegation from US decided that they will cooperate with us in vaccination and will provide human cooperation," Muttaqi said.He added: "It is being promised that states will have good relations with one another and have patience while Afghanistan is passing through a very tough time, so Afghanistan will come out of this condition with more strength."The hardline Taliban regained power in August as the United States ended its two-decade occupation with a withdrawal that included a chaotic airlift of foreign residents and Afghans.Mosque attackTheir efforts to consolidate their rule have been undermined by a series of attacks by the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), who claimed a bombing of a Shiite mosque that left more than 60 people dead on Friday.Afghanistan's economy is also teetering on the brink of collapse, with international aid cut off, food prices rising and unemployment spiking.Muttaqi said the Taliban wanted to hold meetings with other countries as well as the US to discuss Afghanistan's difficulties."We are trying to have such meetings and gatherings with the US and other countries of the world and to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan, listen to one another's opinions," Muttaqi said."The issues that people of Afghanistan are facing in terms of economy or any other issues should be resolved. The existing government of Afghanistan is committed to having good relations with other states and cooperate with others, to facilitate its people and provide them services."This is what we want and we are trying to discuss these areas with other countries."Before the talks, a US State Department official said its priorities were securing safe passage for US and other citizens who want to leave Afghanistan, and making sure the Taliban does not allow "terrorists" to operate on Afghan soil."This meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-warns-us-not-to-destabilise-regime-in-face-to-face-talks-101633800821097.html

Facebook denies any wrongdoing.Sought for comment on Ressa's remarks, a Facebook spokesperson said the social media giant continues to invest heavily to remove and reduce the visibility of harmful content."We believe in press freedom and support news organisations and journalists around the world as they continue their important work," the spokesperson added.Ressa shared the Nobel with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov on Friday, for what the committee called braving the wrath of the leaders of the Philippines and Russia to expose corruption and misrule, in an endorsement of free speech under fire worldwide.Facebook has become the world's largest distributor of news and "yet it is biased against facts, it is biased against journalism," Ressa said."If you have no facts, you can't have truths, you can't' have trust. If you don't have any of these, you don't have a democracy," she said. "Beyond that, if you don't have facts, you don't' have a shared reality, so you can't solve the existential problems of climate, coronavirus."Ressa has been the target of intense social-media hatred campaigns from President Rodrigo Duterte's supporters, which she said were aimed at destroying her and Rappler's credibility.ELECTION 'A BATTLE FOR FACTS'"These online attacks on social media have a purpose, they are targeted, they are used like a weapon," said the former CNN journalist.Rappler's reporting has included close scrutiny of Duterte's deadly war on drugs and a series of investigative reports into what it says is his government's strategy to "weaponise" the internet, using bloggers on its payroll to stir up anger among online supporters who threaten and discredit Duterte's critics.Duterte has not commented on Ressa's award. The presidential palace, Duterte's spokesperson, his chief legal counsel, and communications office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Facebook in March 2019 removed an online network in the Philippines for "coordinated inauthentic behaviour", and linked it to a businessman who has previously said he helped manage the president's social media election campaign in 2016.Filipinos top the world in time spent on social media, according to 2021 studies by social media management firms.Platforms like Facebook have become political battlegrounds and have helped strengthen Duterte's support base, having been instrumental in his election victory in 2016 and a rout by his allies in mid-term polls last year.The Philippines will hold an election in May to choose a successor to Duterte, who under the constitution is not allowed to seek another term.That campaign "will be a battle for facts," Ressa said. "We are going to keep making sure our public sees the facts, understands it. We are not going to be harassed or intimidated into silence."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biased-against-facts-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-maria-ressa-criticises-facebook-101633792191835.html

The power outage is expected to continue for a few days or at least till next Monday, the official further told the news agency. According to the report, the country has plunged into "complete darkness"."The Lebanese power network completely stopped working at noon today, and it is unlikely that it will work until next Monday, or for several days," the official said.The official further stated that the Lebanese government has plans to use the army's fuel oil reserve to operate the power plants temporarily but, he added, that would not happen anytime soon.The thermoelectric plant stopped at Zahrani power station after the Deir Ammar plant stopped on Friday amid a fuel shortage.Many Lebanese normally rely on private generators run on diesel, although that is in short supply.Lebanon has been paralysed by an economic crisis, which has deepened as supplies of imported fuel have dried up. The Lebanese currency has sunk by 90% since 2019.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-electricity-in-lebanon-amid-fuel-shortage-power-outage-likely-to-continue-for-few-days-101633782436187.html

He was 88.Among a sea of black-robed Shiite clerics, Banisadr stood out for his Western-style suits and a background so French that it was in philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre that he confided his belief he'd be Iran’s first president some 15 years before it happened.Those differences only isolated him as the nationalist sought to implement a socialist style economy in Iran underpinned by a deep Shiite faith instilled in him by his cleric father.Banisadr would never consolidate his grip on the government he supposedly led as events far beyond his control — including the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis and the invasion of Iran by Iraq — only added to the tumult that followed the revolution.True power remained firmly wielded by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whom Banisadr worked with in exile in France and followed back to Tehran amid the revolution. But Khomeini would cast Banisadr aside after only 16 months in office, sending him fleeing back to Paris, where he would remain for decades.“I was like a child watching my father slowly turn into an alcoholic," Banisadr later said of Khomeini. "The drug this time was power.”Banisadr's family said in a statement online Saturday that he died in a hospital in Paris after a long illness. Iranian state television followed with their own bulletin on his death. Neither elaborated on the illness Banisadr faced.Earlier exiled to Iraq by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini ended up having to leave for France in 1978 under renewed pressure from the Iranian monarch. Arriving in Paris and speaking no French, it was Banisadr who initially gave the cleric a place to live after moving his own family out of their apartment to accommodate him.Khomeini would end up in Neauphle-Le-Chateau, a village outside the French capital. There, as Banisadr once told The Associated Press, he and a group of friends fashioned or vetted the messages Khomeini delivered — based on what they were told Iranians wanted to hear.Tape recordings of Khomeini’s statements were sold in Europe and delivered to Iran. Other messages went out by telephone, read to supporters in various Iranian towns. Those messages laid the groundwork for Khomeini’s return after the shah, fatally ill, fled Iran in early 1979, though the cleric remained unsure he had the support, Banisadr once said.“For me, it was absolutely sure, but not for Khomeini and not for lots of others inside Iran,” Banisadr told the AP in 2019.That return saw Khomeini and his Islamic Revolution sweep the country. Banisadr became a member of the cleric’s Revolutionary Council and became the head of the country’s Foreign Ministry just days after the Nov. 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by hard-line students.In an echo of what was to come, Banisadr served only 18 days in that role after seeking a negotiated end to the hostage crisis, pushed aside by Khomeini for a hard-liner.The hostage-takers were “dictators who have created a government within a government,” Banisadr would later complain.But he remained in Khomeini’s council and would push through the nationalization of major industries and former private business holdings of the shah. And in early 1980, after Khomeini earlier decreed that a cleric should not hold Iran’s newly created presidency, it was Banisadr who won three quarters of the vote and took the office.“Our revolutionary will not win unless it is exported,” he said in his inaugural address. “We are going to create a new order in which deprived people will not always be deprived.”Amid purges of Iran’s armed forces, Iraq would invade the country, starting what would be a bloody eight-year conflict between the two nations. Banisadr served as the country’s commander-in-chief under a decree from Khomeini. But battlefield failures and complaints from Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard became a political liability for the president, who himself would survive two helicopter crashes near the front.A parliament controlled by hard-line clerics under Khomeini’s sway impeached Banisadr in June 1981 for his opposition to having clerics in the country’s political system, part of a long-running feud between them. A month later, Banisadr boarded an Iranian Air Force Boeing 707 and escaped to France with Massoud Rajavi, the leader of the leftist militant group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq.He emerged from the flight with his trademark mustache shaven off. Iranian media alleged he escaped dressed as a woman.Khomeini “bears heavy responsibility for the appalling disaster that has befallen the country,” Banisadr said after his escape. “To a large extent, he has imposed this course upon our people.”Born March 22, 1933 in Hamadan, Iran, Banisadr grew up in a religious family. His father Nasrollah Banisadr was an ayatollah, a high-ranking Shiite cleric, who opposed the policies of the shah’s father, Reza Shah.“Even in the womb, I was a revolutionary,” Banisadr once boasted.As a youth, he protested the shah and was imprisoned twice. He supported Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, who nationalized Iran’s oil industry and later was ousted during a 1953 CIA-backed coup. During unrest in 1963, Banisadr suffered a wound and fled to France.Banisadr studied economics and finance at Sorbonne University in Paris and later taught there. He authored books and tracts on socialism and Islam, ideas that would guide him later after entering Khomeini’s inner circle.After leaving Iran, Banisadr and Rajavi formed the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Banisadr would withdraw from the council in 1984 after the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq partnered with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein as his war against Iran continued.He would remain outside of Paris for the rest of his life, under police guard after being targeted by suspected Iranian assassins.Banisadr again gained notoriety after alleging without evidence in a book that Ronald Reagan’s campaign colluded with Iranian leaders to hold up the hostage release, thereby scuttling the re-election of then-President Jimmy Carter. That gave birth to the idea of the “October Surprise” in American politics — an event deliberately timed and so powerful as to affect an election.U.S. Senate investigators later would say in 1992 that “the great weight of the evidence is that there was no such deal.” However, after Reagan’s 1981 inauguration, U.S. arms began flowing to Iran through Israel in what would become known as the Iran-Contra scandal.“The clergy used you as a tool to get rid of democratic forces,” Banisadr told a former hostage in 1991 while on a U.S. tour. “On the night you were taken hostage, I went to Khomeini and told him he had acted against Islam, against democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abolhassan-banisadr-iran-s-first-president-after-1979-revolution-dies-101633774332204.html

H-1B visa allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in speciality occupations, and a majority of them are from India and China.The current US immigration system imposes a seven per cent quota on Green Card allotment per country, making Indian professionals on H-1B visas wait for years to receive the coveted Permanent Resident Card. Biden had promised an overhaul of the US immigration system for giving a pathway to citizenship for undocumented as well as legal migrants.If the Biden administration addresses the delays in the processing system of Green Card, it could help thousands of Indians waiting to receive the Green Card.During a media briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the wastage of some 80,000 unused employment-based Green Card numbers on October 1 as the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) failed to allocate them. Indian IT professionals had been urging the Biden administration and the US Congress for a legislative amendment that would not let the Green Card slots expire when several million people are waiting in line for the lawful permanent resident (LPR) status.“The President absolutely wants to address the delays in the green card processing system as well,” Psaki responded.Earlier this week, Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks introduced legislation that would USCIS preserve unused employment-based visas for use in Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021.“Ensuring that our immigration system is fair and orderly is one of my top priorities in Congress. These visas are already authorized by Congress and would have been used if not for the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Miller-Meeks after introducing the Preserving Employment Visas Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-wants-to-address-delays-in-green-card-processing-system-says-white-house-after-slots-wasted-101633773150676.html

The country's prime minister seems to think so||Mali has accused France of “training terrorists” inside the country, according to a report by Al Jazeera citing the Russian media, even as French president Emmanuel Macron maintains that France has no intention to retain its military presence there for much longer. In an interview with Russian network RIA Novosti, Mali's prime minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga claimed that French officers, feigning to be on counter-terror operations, have instead been training terrorist outfits in northern Mali's Kidal region.The report published by Russian state-controlled television network RT said that Mali even has evidence that France is training terrorists inside its territory. “They have militant groups there, who have been trained by French officers,” the report quoted Mali president Choguel Kokalla Maiga as saying. “We have evidence of that.”According to the allegations reportedly raised by the Mali prime minister, French troops now control an entire enclave in Kidal, a northern desert town, to the point that Malian authorities have even been ‘banned’ from entering their own territory. There, the French are allegedly coordinating with an al Qaeda-linked “terrorist group” known as Ansar-al-Din and other outfits which “came from Libya”.Notably, France intervened in Mali in 2013 after armed rebels took control of the northern region of the West African country a year prior. Since then, Paris has deployed thousands of troops in the semi-Arid Sahel region of Africa with a stated aim to combat the armed uprising. France has been conducting Operation Barkhane against terrorist groups in the Sahel region—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger—since August 1, 2014.But Mali's prime minister said that the “terrorists” arriving from Libya are a result of France's 2011 military intervention in the north African nation along with its Nato allies. He claimed that although Mali initially wanted to cooperate with France to combat the terror outfits with “intelligence data and air support”, Paris rapidly increased its military presence in the region, which was uncalled for.According to Maiga, about two-thirds of Mali is now occupied by terrorists, a significant deterioration in the situation from eight years ago, when militants were only present in pockets.Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron said, “We have no intention to remain [in Mali], that is why we are closing the bases. Our work in Tessalit or Kidal [northern Mali] is not aimed at retaining bases.” Speaking on the sidelines of the Africa-France summit in Montpellier on late Friday, Macron added that Paris wanted to leave the bases in Mali as soon as possible but that required a strong state in Mali and significant investment projects in this country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-france-training-terrorists-in-mali-the-country-s-prime-minister-seems-to-think-so-101633758611398.html

The area is heavily populated by migrants and asylum-seekers.The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said the raids last week had left at least one person dead and several others injured. It added the agency was "extremely concerned" about reports of killing and "excessive use of force against migrants" in the area.Doctors Without Border (MSF) said that at least 5,000 migrants had been "detained during violent mass arrests across the city since October 1."“We are seeing security forces take extreme measures to arbitrarily detain more vulnerable people in inhumane conditions in severely overcrowded facilities,” Ellen van der Velden, MSF’s operations manager for Libya, said in a statement.Velden added that entire families had been captured and transported to various detention centers and the process had split families and hurt several members.Libyan authorities have refuted claims of excessive force, saying the wave of detentions was part of anti-drug raids on houses and makeshift shelters in Gargaresh.There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in Libya, some seeking to travel onwards to Europe and others looking for work in the major oil-producing country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-migrants-shot-dead-at-detention-center-101633767424188.html

Stewart was reprimanded by the Speaker of the House of Commons Anthony Rota in June this year for refusing to hand over documents relating to the reasons behind the firing of two Chinese-origin scientists from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg in January last year.Xiangguo Qiu, and her husband, Keding Cheng, were earlier escorted out of the laboratory in the spring of 2019, with reports swirling she supervised shipment of Ebola and Henipah viruses to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is now synonymous with the Covid-19 pandemic.As that matter is still being investigated and is even before Canadian courts, it will continue to pose a significant challenge to Kochhar as will the possibility of a winter wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senior-indo-canadian-bureaucrat-harpeet-kochhar-appointed-chief-of-canada-s-public-health-agency-101633765654159.html
09-10-2021||World||‘Complete reunification of China will and can be realised’: President Xi Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday said China can and will be reunified, sending out a word of warning to the so-called Taiwan secessionists who “betray the motherland” but holding off on the threat to use force. Xi was speaking at a meeting to mark the 110th anniversary of the Revolution of 1911.Xi’s call on reunifying Taiwan comes in the backdrop of a week of heightened military tension with the democratically-run island that Beijing claims as a breakaway region.The Chinese PLA deployed more than 150 fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Straits, which violated the island’s air space last week prompting Taipei to call it the worst tensions with China in 40 years.The tension has also sparked international concern.“The complete reunification of China will be and can be realised,” Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state media, adding the Taiwan question, which is purely an internal matter for China, arose out of the weakness and chaos of the Chinese nation and will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality.“It has never ended well for those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, or split the country,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Saturday.“They will definitely be scorned by the people and judged by history,” he said.“National reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including compatriots in Taiwan,” he noted.“Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should stand on the right side of history and join hands to achieve China’s complete reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi said.The Xinhai Revolution started on October 10, 1911, and led to the end of a 2000-year-old monarchy in China.The revolution established the Republic of China by the Kuomintang who later fled to Taiwan in the late 1940s after being defeated by the triumphant Communist Party of China – who then established “New China” in 1949.Xi’s Saturday speech seemingly struck a softer note than the one he delivered on July 1 to mark the CPC’s 100 years in which he vowed to “smash” any attempts at formal independence.In 2019, he directly threatened to use force to bring the island under Beijing’s control.The presidential office in Taipei criticised Xi’s speech, saying Taiwan was a sovereign independent country, not part of the People’s Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China’s offer of “one country, two systems” to rule the island.“The nation’s future rests in the hands of Taiwan’s people,” the presidential office was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.Asked on Friday about news reports on the presence of US troops in Taiwan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Washington should cease military ties and arms sales to Taiwan to avoid damaging bilateral relations.“The US side should fully recognise the great sensitivity of the Taiwan issue,” he told a regular daily briefing.“China will take all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/complete-reunification-of-china-will-and-can-be-realised-president-xi-jinping-101633764453927.html
09-10-2021||World||‘Taiwan question’ will be resolved, no external interference needed: China||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday made a strong pitch for the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland amidst heightened tensions with the estranged island, saying the “Taiwan question” will be resolved and it brooks “no external interference”.Xi's comments came after China sent a record number of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four days in a row, in a public show of force.Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state - but China views the self-ruled island as a breakaway province. Beijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.Speaking in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the revolution that ended the country's last imperial dynasty, Xi said the biggest obstacle to the reunification of China was the "Taiwan independence" force.The Taiwan question arose out of the weakness and chaos of the Chinese nation and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality, Xi, also the General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), said."This is determined by the general trend of Chinese history, but more importantly, it is the common will of all Chinese people," Xi said.The 1911 Revolution led by nationalists headed by Dr Sun Yat-sen ended 2,132 years of imperial rule and 276 years of Manchu rule and heralded the beginning of China's republican era followed by the formation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.Taiwan separated from the PRC in 1949 while fighting a civil war with the CPC headed by Mao Zedong.Since he took over power in 2012, President Xi, 68, has made the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and realisation of the Chinese Dream, and integration of Taiwan with mainland China his main goals.Last week, tensions flared up after a Chinese military plane made a record 150 flights into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), prompting the US to express serious concern over the escalation.The intensity of China’s air raids prompted US President Joe Biden to remind Xi that they have agreed to abide by the “Taiwan agreement” during their talks over the telephone last month."I've spoken with Xi about Taiwan. We agree… we'll abide by the Taiwan agreement. We made it clear that I don't think he should be doing anything other than abiding by the agreement,” Biden said.Xi, in his address, asserted that the Taiwan question is purely an internal matter for China, one which brooks no external interference."The complete reunification of our country will be and can be realised," he stressed.In a hard-hitting speech, President Xi said that national reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including compatriots in Taiwan."Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan strait should stand on the right side of history and join hands to achieve China's complete reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," he said.Those who forget their heritage, betray their motherland, and seek to split the country will come to no good end, Xi said, hitting out at pro-Taiwan independence advocates.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is a strong advocate of Taiwan’s independence.Such forces will be disdained by the people and condemned by history, Xi said.He also highlighted the role and the importance of the CPC headed by him which this year celebrated its centenary.What the past 110 years have shown to the Chinese people since the Revolution of 1911 is that China needs strong force, he said."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, the Chinese people must have a strong force to lead us forward, and that force is the Communist Party of China," he said.Xi, regarded as the most powerful leader after Mao heading the CPC, the military, and the Presidency, is due to complete his second term next year and is expected to continue in power possibly for life in view of the 2018 constitutional amendments, which removed the two-term limit for the President.So far, all his predecessors retired after two terms.Stressing the importance of strong leadership, Xi said that without the CPC, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation.Efforts should be made to ensure that the CPC always firmly stands as the most reliable backbone of the Chinese nation and people."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, the path we take is of fundamental importance. Socialism with Chinese characteristics has proven to be the only correct path."We will ensure coordinated implementation of the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy, deepen reform and opening up across the board, modernise China's system and capacity for governance, and work tirelessly to fulfill the people's aspirations for a better life and realise common prosperity for all," he said.The past 110 years have shown that to realise national rejuvenation, the Chinese people must rely on their own heroic efforts, Xi said."Through courage and skill, we will overcome all major risks and challenges that may impede our path to national rejuvenation and resolutely safeguard our national sovereignty, security, and development interests," he said."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, the Chinese people and nation must stick together through good times and bad, and rely on our strong unity to overcome all risks and challenges on the road ahead."On the journey ahead, we must fully promote patriotism, foster a strong sense of national dignity and confidence among our people, and strengthen the Chinese nation's sense of community,” he said, calling for the formation of the “broadest possible patriotic united front."The past 110 years have shown us that to realise national rejuvenation, China needs not only a stable and united domestic environment but also a peaceful and stable international environment, the Chinese President said."Aggression and hegemony are not in the blood of the Chinese people. Our people hope to successfully realise national development, but they also hope to see all peoples of the world, leading happy and peaceful lives," he said.On the journey ahead, China will always fly the flag of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, strive to promote the building of a human community with a shared future and endeavour to improve the global governance system, Xi noted."We will promote the shared human values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, work to strengthen solidarity with the peoples of all other countries, and engage in common efforts to oppose hegemony and power politics."China will remain a champion of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order, and we will do our very best to make even greater contributions to humanity," Xi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-question-will-be-resolved-no-external-interference-needed-china-101633758120217.html

09-10-2021||World||IMF to decide 'very soon' if managing director keeps her job||The International Monetary Fund said Friday it will decide "very soon" whether its embattled managing director Kristalina Georgieva keeps her job.An investigation by a law firm has concluded that she manipulated data in favor of China while in a senior role at the World Bank.The IMF Executive Board said after a meeting Friday that it has made "significant progress" in its assessment of the case but agreed "to request more clarifying details with a view to very soon concluding its consideration of the matter."On Thursday Georgieva, 68, said she hoped for an "expeditious resolution" of the case.The IMF Executive Board is reviewing last month's investigation by the law firm WilmerHale that found that during her time as World Bank CEO, Georgieva was among top officials who pressured staff into changing data to China's benefit in the 2018 edition of its closely watched Doing Business report.Georgieva spoke to the IMF board this week.She has repeatedly denied the report's conclusions, and on Thursday released a letter from her attorney to the board objecting to WilmerHale's findings, as well as her 12-page testimony to the 24 board members.The law firm found that Georgieva along with her associate Simeon Djankov, a former Bulgarian finance minister who created the report, and Jim Yong Kim, then-president of the bank, pressured staff to change the calculation of China's ranking to avoid angering Beijing.The push came while bank leadership was engaged in sensitive negotiations with Beijing over increasing the bank's lending capital.The Executive Board could meet again Saturday, a source close to the matter said on condition of anonymity.This source added that Georgieva has won the support of France and other European countries.The United States, a key member of the IMF, has not yet stated its position on this controversy, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation.Time is of the essence because the IMF and the World Bank begin their fall meetings on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-to-decide-very-soon-if-managing-director-keeps-her-job-101633748539293.html
09-10-2021||World||World Post Day: History, significance and all you need to know about this day||World Post Day is observed every year on October 9 to mark the establishment of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and the creation of the revolutionary mode of communication with letters in the everyday lives of the people. Before the age of e-mails, letters used to be handwritten and delivered by post across the world. Even today, postal services hold a significant role in the delivery of parcels globally.“On World Post Day, we recognize the invaluable contributions of postal workers to our societies and economies. The vast postal network – involving millions of workers moving billions of pieces of mail through hundreds of thousands of post offices – is woven into our societies, connecting communities the world over,” a message from the United Nations secretary general António Guterres read.History and significance of World Post DayWorld Post Day is celebrated in remembrance of the foundation of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in 1874 in Bern, Switzerland. Celebrated across 151 countries, it was first declared as the World Post Day by the UPU Congress held in Tokyo, Japan, in 1969. In India, too, the day acknowledges the beginning of National Postal week, celebrated from October 9 to October 15.Member nations around the globe use this day to launch new postal initiatives and hold special exhibitions to raise awareness about the importance of postal services in everyday lives and its contribution to the social and economic development of countries.Theme of World Post Day 2021The theme for this year’s World Post Day is “Innovate to Recover” to highlight the plight of postal systems in the changing times of a digital revolution and how it is adapting to new realities and redefining itself, taking on new roles founded on digitalisation, e-commerce and financial services."Together, let us learn the lessons arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and understand that innovation is not an accessory; it is the driving force behind recovery, and what makes this sector crucial to billions of people," the UPU director said.Interestingly, amid the coronavirus pandemic, postal services have also been used to deliver vaccines in many parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-post-day-history-significance-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-day-101633749529833.html
09-10-2021||World||Texas wins bid to reinstate abortion law challenged by Biden administration||A US appeals court on Friday temporarily reinstated Texas's near-total ban on abortion, dealing a setback to abortion rights advocates and the Biden administration.The U Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, an intermediate appeals court, said it was putting on hold a lower court ruling from Oct. 6 that blocked the abortion law.The administrative stay from the Fifth Circuit, a conservative-leaning appeals court, came in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department on Sept. 9. The purpose of the administrative stay is to give the court time to determine whether to issue a more permanent ruling.The Texas abortion law, which took effect on Sept. 1, bans abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy.The law makes no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. It also lets ordinary citizens enforce the ban, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide abortion after the fetal cardiac activity is detected. Critics of the law have said this provision enables people to act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.US district judge Robert Pitman in Austin on Wednesday temporarily blocked the abortion ban while litigation over its legality continues.The Justice Department has argued that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy that was recognized in the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. The department also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-wins-bid-to-reinstate-abortion-law-challenged-by-biden-administration-101633746216210.html
09-10-2021||World||California losing tech grip? Tesla's move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks major blow||California Governor Gavin Newsom frequently touts that his state is the leader in cutting-edge manufacturing and green technology. Now one of the most recognizable companies in those fields is taking its headquarters elsewhere.Tesla Inc.’s move from Silicon Valley to Texas marks the latest blow for California, the electric-car maker’s home since its founding 18 years ago. It joins companies including Oracle Corp., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., and Charles Schwab Corp. in relocating their corporate hubs to the cheaper and more tax-friendly Lone Star state in the past two years.They all are keeping a large presence in California, underscoring the importance of the world’s fifth-largest economy. But the shifts of companies born and bred in the state show how many of its intractable issues, from the nation’s most expensive housing costs to high taxes and climate catastrophes, pose a threat to continued economic growth if corporate departures multiply. And losing Tesla -- a long-shot, clean-energy startup that upended the auto industry and embodies much of the state’s economy -- delivers a particularly symbolic hit.“Tesla as a brand represents not just Motor City USA, it represents Silicon Valley and Hollywood,” said David McCuan, chairman of Sonoma State University’s political science department. “Tesla is really a California-centric thing. But Elon Musk represents something larger than life, and that’s really Texas.”Musk, Tesla’s co-founder and chief executive officer, pointed to some of California’s issues when he announced the move from Palo Alto to Austin. The company’s Fremont factory is jammed with workers and equipment, with little space to build around it. The billionaire clashed with local public officials over lockdown policies during the pandemic. He defied local orders by restarting production at the plant. Musk said that Tesla isn’t leaving California and will continue to expand there –  but he made clear that he saw more opportunity for growth in Texas.“It’s tough for people to afford houses and a lot of people have to come in from far away,” said Musk, who last year said he was moving to Texas himself. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area.”That region, in particular, has long been seen by companies as a difficult place to do business. Employers have had to offer ever more generous compensation so that workers can keep up with sky-high housing costs. Many workers have simply been priced out of living near their work, forcing them into long commutes before the pandemic.  California’s Association of Realtors forecast this week that the state’s median single-family home price will jump to a record $834,000 next year, more than twice the national level. The median sale price of homes in Santa Clara County -- the heart of Silicon Valley – was $1.66 million in August, an almost 11% jump from a year earlier, according to the industry group.Newsom – a Democrat who last month beat back a recall effort that was in part driven by anger about the state’s cost of living, crime, and homelessness -- on Friday emphasized that the state has created more than 750,000 jobs since January. He said California’s policies encouraging innovation and investment in electric vehicles contributed to Tesla and Musk’s success.“Our regulatory environment helped create that company and grow that company,” Newsom said at a press briefing. “I have reverence and deep respect for that individual. But I also have deep reverence and respect for this state, and what we’ve done.”Strong EconomyTesla’s move is more a symbolic blow than an economic one. While the tech industry is a significant part of the state’s economy, California reaps the rewards of other lucrative sectors, such as trade and entertainment. The state has notched a $75.7 billion surplus and revenue is again running ahead of projections -- by about 18% -- for the fiscal year that began in July. Its credit ratings are at their highest in about two decades.Silicon Valley also remains a magnet for tech investment. In the third quarter, there was a record $27.1 billion worth of venture deals struck in the region, a 17% increase from the previous three months, according to a recent report on venture capital from CBInsight. “The tech sector is so big that Texas can grow and we can grow,” said Stephen Levy, director, and senior economist of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. But “the exoduses do have a real concern if they’re based on the high housing prices and lack of housing.”The state has few answers for how to fix its most pressing problems. Construction remains way below Newsom’s goals for addressing the housing shortage. Taxes are unlikely to go down. Climate change has contributed not only to record-setting wildfires but drought, power outages, and smoke-filled air.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whose Silicon Valley roots go back to the founding of Hewlett-Packard Co. in a Palo Alto garage eight decades ago, said last year that cutting real estate costs were a major factor in its decision to relocate to Houston, already its largest US employment hub. The company, which has maintained much of its tech and innovation workforce in the Bay Area, also said the pandemic and the changing nature of work contributed to the move.In many ways, Covid proved to companies that they could effectively operate elsewhere, or at least with a smaller footprint. Silicon Valley’s office vacancy rate has continued to climb, reaching 15 per cent in the third quarter, as more employers looked to offload space they’d previously leased, according to real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.The region still remains key for the tech industry, with its depth of talent and access to renowned universities, said Robert Sammons, senior director of research at Cushman in San Francisco.“Certainly, the business climate has room for improvement,” Sammons said, citing regulations and the high cost of living. “Those are all difficulties that California has and has had for years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-losing-tech-grip-tesla-s-move-from-silicon-valley-to-texas-marks-major-blow-101633741044376.html

The US, however, stressed that the meeting on Saturday and Sunday did not indicate that it was recognising the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. "We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions," the spokesperson said.The Associated Press cited an official as saying that the weekend talks will focus on holding Taliban leaders to commitments that they would allow Americans and other foreign nationals to leave Afghanistan, along with Afghans who once worked for the US military or government and other Afghan allies during the two-decade military operation.Also read | ‘Afghans know who were better friends’: Jaishankar slams Pak for aiding terrorThe United States also wants to press the Taliban to observe the rights of women and girls, many of whom have been barred from returning to jobs and schools, and of Afghans at large, the state department spokesperson said. "We will press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and girls, and to form an inclusive government with broad support," the spokesperson was quoted as saying by AFP on Friday. "As Afghanistan faces the prospect of a severe economic contraction and possible humanitarian crisis, we will also press the Taliban to allow humanitarian agencies free access to areas of need," the spokesperson added.Also read | Not Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar could be the first to recognise Taliban cabinetAFP reported that the spokesperson did not specify who would represent the two sides.

09-10-2021||World||Brazil tops 600,000 Covid-19 deaths amid doubts about delta variant||Bars in Brazil’s biggest metropolis, Sao Paulo, are full again for Friday happy hours and lawmakers in the capital have nearly done away with video sessions via Zoom. Rio de Janeiro’s beaches are packed and calls for strict social distancing seem but a memory.These developments are part of Brazil’s bid to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, even as its death toll tops 600,000, according to official data on Friday from the health ministry. Relief in both Covid-19 cases and deaths have been particularly welcome given experts’ warnings that the delta variant would produce another wave of destruction in the country with the second-most victims. So far, that hasn’t materialized.The country’s average daily death toll has hovered around 500 for a month, down sharply from more than 3,000 in April. Almost 45% of the population is fully vaccinated, and a booster shot is being administered to the elderly. A greater percentage of Brazilians are at least partially vaccinated compared to Americans or Germans, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.Improvement has encouraged mayors and governors to admit fans into soccer matches, and let bars and restaurants stay open until the wee hours. Some are even contemplating the end of mask mandates, which people often ignore already. And Rio’s mayor has announced plans to bring back the city’s massive New Year’s Eve party on Copacabana beach.Gonzalo Vecina, a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo, told The Associated Press in July that delta, which is more contagious, would cause “a new explosion” of cases within weeks. He was hardly alone among experts sounding the alarm.Now, Vecina believes the high number of Brazilians infected earlier this year with the gamma variant -- first identified in the Amazonian city Manaus -- may have slowed delta’s advance.“That isn’t a conclusion from a study; it is a possibility we are raising in the face of what we are seeing,” Vecina said. “We are seeing delta rise in countries that reopened just as much as Brazil, and our number of cases is still going down, with few very particular exceptions.”Some analysts remain worried about delta’s potential to spread. Among them is Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. He believes authorities are taking considerable risk by reopening too much and announcing celebrations, and that Brazil may soon see more hospital admissions.“The pandemic has waned, but 500 deaths per day is far from good. And we don’t even have half the population fully vaccinated,” Lago said. “We just don’t know enough and we have this horrific milestone to contemplate now.”Friday morning, on Copacabana where Rio’s New Year’s party will take place in less than three months, activist group Rio da Paz held a memorial on its sands to mourn the 600,000 dead, with hundreds of white kerchiefs strung on lines.Across town, at a support group for family members of the virus’ victims, Bruna Chaves mourned the loss of her mother and step-father.“It’s not just 600,000 people who are gone; it’s a lot of people who die with them, emotionally,” Chaves said in an interview. “It’s absurd that people treat it like it’s a small number. It’s a big number.”Many in Brazil continue to downplay the pandemic’s severity, chief among them President Jair Bolsonaro, whose popularity has sagged largely due to his government’s chaotic pandemic response. But he hasn’t veered from his positions, including staunch support for drugs proven ineffective against the virus, like hydroxychloroquine.He also continues to criticize restrictions on activity adopted by mayors and governors, saying Brazil needed to keep the economy humming to avoid inflicting worse hardship on the poor. On Thursday night, during a live broadcast on Facebook, he showed a series of newspaper articles reporting economic turmoil in Europe and the U.S. last year in an attempt to prove he was right all along.Months after its New Year’s bash, Rio will also host Carnival, according to Mayor Eduardo Paes. And he said social distancing is out of the question.“That would be ridiculous, asking people to keep one meter away. If that were the case, I would be the first to disrespect that,” he told residents in a middle-class neighborhood on Monday. “Science has advanced, it won, it is allowing us to open.”Brazil’s long history with vaccination campaigns has played a significant role in slowing the virus’ spread, with broad uptake. Nearly three-quarters of Brazilians have received at least one dose so far -- despite the fact Bolsonaro spent months sowing doubt about their efficacy and remains unvaccinated himself. Even most of his supporters rolled up their sleeves.As Brazil surpasses 600,000 deaths, a Senate inquiry on the government’s handling of the pandemic is nearing its end. Sen. Renan Calheiros, who will write the investigation’s final report, told journalists Wednesday that it will include the recommendation for at least 40 people to face charges, including Bolsonaro, his former health minister Gen. Eduardo Pazuello and several allies.Luiz Davidovich, president of The Brazilian Academy of Sciences, said scientists performed their role in alerting Brazilians about the pandemic’s dangers, but their advice should have been better heeded.“What remains now is the memory of this tragedy that marks the history of the country and our lives, involved in collective grief, permeated by sadness and indignation,” Davidovich said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-tops-600-000-covid-19-deaths-amid-doubts-about-delta-variant-101633738240562.html
09-10-2021||World||Islamic State group claims Afghanistan mosque bombing, says suicide bomber targeted Shiites||The Islamic State of Khorasan (ISIS-K) claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing attack on a mosque in Afghanistan's Kunduz on Friday that left at least 55 people dead and dozens of others severely injured. In a statement released on its Telegram channels, the jihadist group – an associate of the Islamic State (ISIS) – said that its suicide bomber specifically targeted a crowd of Shiite worshippers who gathered inside a mosque and it was there that the attacker “detonated an explosive vest”.Also Read | Afghanistan: Multiple causalities after explosion hits mosque in Kunduz city#BREAKING Islamic State group claims Afghanistan mosque attack: statement pic.twitter.com/FFx1wQ7vIrThe Islamic State group, moments after taking out the first statement, released another in which it elaborated on the suicide bombing attack in northern Afghanistan. The terror outfit said in its second statement, seen by AFP, that the “perpetrator of the attack was an Uyghur Muslim”, a minority that the Taliban – the new rulers of Afghanistan – “vowed to expel”. The statement was later carried by the IS-linked Aamaq news agency.The development hints at aggravating sectarian violence in the war-ravaged nation as the extremist Islamic State group, bitter rivals of the Taliban, has time and again targeted the Shiite population to stir up unrest in the Sunni-majority Afghanistan. The outfit bombed a Shiite mosque in the west of Kabul in a similar suicide attack in October 2017, killing at least 56 people and wounding 55 others, including women and children who gathered for the evening prayers. Islamic State terrorists have also targeted Taliban positions and attempted to recruit members from their ranks.Also Read | Taliban destroy Islamic State cell in Kabul after deadly mosque attackIn the past, the Taliban were not shaken by the Islamic State due to the presence of the United States military on the ground, which ensured the terrorists stayed limited to certain pockets. However, with the withdrawal of the American forces in August, it remains unclear whether the Taliban can now suppress what appears to be a growing ISIS footprint. The terrorists, once confined to the east, have penetrated the capital of Kabul and other provinces with new attacks.The development comes at a critical moment, as the Taliban attempt to consolidate power and transform their guerrilla fighters into a structured police and security force. But while the group attempts to project an air of authority through reports of raids and arrests of IS members, it remains unclear if it even has the capability to protect soft targets, including religious institutions.According to news agencies, Shiites make up roughly 20 per cent of the population of Afghanistan. Many of them are Hazaras, an ethnic group that has been heavily persecuted in the land for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-group-claims-afghanistan-mosque-bombing-says-suicide-bomber-targeted-shiites-101633736406087.html

DownDetector, which tracks outages, showed spikes in reports of problems accessing or using Facebook, photo-sharing app Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. "Sincere apologies to anyone who wasn't able to access our products in the last couple of hours. We fixed the issue, and everything should be back to normal now," the company said.Some users were unable to load their Instagram feeds during the latest outage and others were not able to send messages on Facebook Messenger. People swiftly took to Twitter to share memes and jokes about the second service disruption this week. "Looks like Facebook went to a 3-day work week. Monday and Friday shutdowns?" a Twitter user said. "What's up with Instagram?" A user tweeted along with a picture of cartoon character Bart Simpson sitting in a corner in apparent punishment.Also read | Facebook grapples with another global outage"It's not even 4 days and it's already down again." "Problems with Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp AGAIN!" said another on a DownDetector chat forum.Instagram thanked users for their patience and "for all the memes this week" and according to Facebook, the outage on Friday was not related to the one earlier in the week.Also read | Facebook outage shows why we need our own social networks: RussiaOn Monday, billions of users reported that they were unable to access the services WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook for nearly six hours before services were restored.  The social media giant blamed a "faulty configuration change" for the nearly six-hour outage that prevented the company's 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services.According to cyber experts, the problem was related to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)—the system the internet uses to pick the quickest route to move packets of information around. Data centre company Telehouse’s Sami Slim compared BGP to "the internet equivalent of air traffic control" which changes the schedules of flights. “Facebook did an update of these routes," Slim said, according to AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sincere-apologies-facebook-after-second-outage-in-a-week-101633736789614.html
09-10-2021||World||Facebook grapples with another global outage||Facebook on Friday said users around the world again had problems accessing its services for hours due to a tweak of its system, just days after a massive outage caused in a similar fashion."Sincere apologies to anyone who wasn't able to access our products in the last couple of hours," a Facebook spokesperson told AFP about 21:30 GMT."We fixed the issue, and everything should be back to normal now."Website trouble tracker DownDetector showed spikes in reports of problems accessing or using Facebook and its photo-centric Instagram network as well as Messenger and WhatsApp starting about three hours earlier.Facebook attributed the trouble to a configuration change at its computing platform and said that it affected users of the social network and Instagram, Messenger and Workplace globally.People flocked to Twitter to voice frustration."What's up with Instagram?" read a tweet that included a picture of cartoon character Bart Simpson sitting in a corner in apparent punishment."It's not even 4 days and it's already down again.""Problems with Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp AGAIN!" read a lament in a DownDetector chat forum.Hundreds of millions of people were unable to access Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp for more than six hours on Monday, underscoring the world's reliance on platforms owned by the Silicon Valley giant.In an apologetic blog post, Santosh Janardhan, Facebook's vice president of infrastructure, said that day's outage was caused by "configuration changes" on routers that coordinate network traffic between data centers.Cyber experts think that problem boiled down to something called BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol -- the system the internet uses to pick the quickest route to move packets of information around.Sami Slim of data center company Telehouse compared BGP to "the internet equivalent of air traffic control."In the same way that air traffic controllers sometimes make changes to flight schedules, "Facebook did an update of these routes," Slim said.But this update contained a crucial error.It's not yet clear how or why, but Facebook's routers essentially sent a message to the internet announcing that the company's servers no longer existed.The outage on Friday was not related to the one earlier in the week, according to Facebook.Experts say Facebook's technical infrastructure is unusually reliant on its own systems.Social media outages are not uncommon: Instagram alone has experienced more than 80 in the past year in the United States, according to website builder ToolTester.Facebook's services are crucial for many businesses around the world, and Facebook accounts are also commonly used to log in to other websites.Facebook's apps are used my billions of people monthly, meaning outages can touch a large portion of the world's population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-grapples-with-another-global-outage-101633734808981.html
