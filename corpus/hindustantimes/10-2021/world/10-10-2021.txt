The Food and Drug Administration plans a meeting in late October to consider Pfizer’s request for emergency use authorization of its vaccine for children ages 5 to 11.Nationwide, there are about 95,000 new Covid-19 cases a day. Fauci called the downward trend “good news” but cautioned against declaring a premature victory since cases have bounced back in the past.He said he’d like to see cases drop to less than 10,000 a day before dropping Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, such as shedding masks indoors in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-united-states-fauci-says-fine-to-trick-or-treat-this-year-101633887434836.html
10-10-2021||World||Iraq’s elderly vote, the young boycott||Issam Shukr, 70, voted Sunday at Al-Amal School in Baghdad. It means “hope” in Arabic, but there is little of that among the country’s overwhelmingly youthful population. For them the parliamentary election didn’t generate much enthusiasm. Leaning on his cane but looking good for his age, Shukr said he was “proud” of having cast his ballot. With many of the country’s eligible voters boycotting, Shukr was among a minority who voted.Sixty percent of Iraq’s population is under 25. For them, the ballot is about the same old faces who are unable to fix a country rich in oil but replete with problems, including a youth unemployment rate of around 40 percent.The streets of Baghdad, adorned with election banners, were deserted, a reflection of the low turnout expected among Iraqis fed up with the country’s political class.Virtually the only people visible were soldiers and police, deployed to safeguard the democratic process in a war-scarred country where cells of the Islamic State (IS) group jihadists are still active.Authorities also feared there could be anti-government protests. Overhead, two warplanes patrolled in a sunny sky.TORN POSTERSBack on the ground Shukr aimed, as he does every election, to be the first to cast a ballot. These are the fifth elections since the dictator Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003 and Shukr hoped for “improvement of the situation” in his country gripped by a political, social and economic crisis.The election is being held early in a rare concession to the unprecedented youth-led protest movement that broke out two years ago. Tens of thousands took to the streets to vent their rage at corruption, unemployment and other problems. Hundreds lost their lives in protest-related violence.Like Shukr, Jassem Mohammed Sultan, 53, was among members of the relatively older population who said voting is a means to improving things in the country. “We should all participate to choose the most suitable” to govern, the day labourer said in Mosul, Iraq’s second city which IS occupied from 2014 to 2017.In a symbol of the disinterest among many younger Iraqis, election posters of various candidates had been torn down and lay on a Baghdad lawn near police armoured vehicles. “I am not going there. I am not voting for anyone,” said a teacher, 30, who lives in Baghdad and belongs to Iraq’s Christian minority. “Why vote? We don’t trust any candidate, Christian or not,” she said.GOVERNMENT BRINGS ‘NOTHING’Taleb Mohammed, 28, was similarly disenchanted in Arbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq. “The government brings us nothing, at this time when there are no permanent jobs,” said the teacher who works on contract.In Nasiriyah, the city at the heart of the 2019 revolt, Imane al-Amine, 54, was also staying home because the elections “have nothing democratic”. “We live in a state controlled by firearms which circulate completely out of control and which kill people who think differently,” said Amine, an agricultural engineer.Polling stations visited by AFP throughout the day saw only a very limited flow of voters. Election workers with an air of weariness sat at worn-out wooden desks near gleaming electronic voting machines.A poll worker at one Baghdad centre said that of 413 registered voters only 43 had shown up, a few hours before the polls closed. “There were a limited number of youth. Most were seniors,” the worker said under cover of anonymity, as an elderly woman entered with a walker.Voters around Iraq held up their fingers to show the ink stains which confirmed they had cast their ballots.But those fingers were generally not the fingers of youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqs-elderly-vote-the-young-boycott-101633885080017.html

China has already overtaken theUS in the AI fight, he said, adding that he could not stand to watch China overtake America.“We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it’s already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion,” the 37-year-old first chief software office for the US Air Force said.Beijing is heading for global dominance because of its advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and cyber capabilities, he said. Compared to China's advancement, US cyber defences in some government departments were at the kindergarten level.Chaillan blamed the reluctance of Goggle to work with the US defence department on AI. Chinese companies, on the other hand, are obliged to work with Beijing, and were making “massive investment” into AI without regard to ethics, he said to Financial Times.Though the US spends at least three times more than China on defence, this is not being translated into any result as theUS is spending in the wrong areas and "bureaucracy and overregulation" stand in the way of change that the Pentagon needs.In his resignation announcement, too, he did not reveal his disappointment with the way Pentagon functions. "Please stop putting a Major or Lt Col. (despite their devotion, exceptional attitude, and culture) in charge of ICAM, Zero Trust or Cloud for 1 to 4 million users when they have no previous experience in that field – we are setting up critical infrastructure to fail. We would not put a pilot in the cockpit without extensive flight training; why would we expect someone with no IT experience to be close to successful? They do not know what to execute on or what to prioritize which leads to endless risk reduction efforts and diluted focus," he had written.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-already-lost-to-china-in-ai-fight-says-ex-pentagon-software-chief-101633870759285.html
10-10-2021||World||World Mental Health Day: How nature-based activities improve mood, reduces anxiety||Outdoor activities, which involve nature, such as gardening and exercise, have been found to improve mental health in adults – including those with pre-existing mental health problems, a new study has revealed.The research for the study was led by the University of York, Great Britain, and its findings were published in the journal SSM-Population Health. It showed that these nature-based, outdoor activities resulted in improved mood, less anxiety and also positive emotions.What did the study find?According to the study, activities lasting for 20 to 90 minutes, and continued over the course of eight to 12 weeks, have the most positive result for bettering mood and mitigating anxiety.It was also found that engaging in conservation activities was also revealed to make people feel better, similar to the effects of forest bathing – stopping in a forest to absorb the atmosphere.To sum up, the study findings showed that these nature-based interventions (NBIs) support people to get involved with ecology in a structured way to enhance mental health.How was the research conducted?For the study, researchers screened 14,321 NBI records and analysed 50 studies. Peter Coventry from the department of health sciences, who is the lead author of the study, said that it is not a novelty that “being in nature is good for health and wellbeing,” but the findings “reinforce the growing evidence” regarding the association of activities in nature with large gains in mental health.“While doing these activities on your own is effective, among the studies we reviewed it seems that doing them in groups led to greater gains in mental health,” Coventry noted.What new avenues do the study open up?The research, albeit found less evidence about outdoor activities contributing to better physical health, has recommended that there must be more apt ways to measure the short and longer-term impact of nature.The study emphasised that to address the demand for mental health support following the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a requirement for substantial, and sustained investment in the community and place-based solutions – such as nature-based interventions.“One of the key ideas that might explain why nature-based activities are good for us is that they help to connect us with nature in meaningful ways that go beyond passively viewing nature,” Coventry added.Who is behind the research?Along with Coventry, the research has been co-authored by Piran White (also from University of York), and forms part of the new 'Environment and Health' research theme, supported by the York Environmental Sustainability Institute (YESI). The duo is now working with partners at the University of Central Lancashire to understand the health benefits of green social prescribing.The study has also been contributed by the academics from the department of health sciences, department of environment and geography, YESI, Hull York Medical School and Stockholm Environment Institute at York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-outdoor-activities-involving-nature-improve-mood-and-reduces-anxiety-101633869668869.html

Check details||In a milestone, Malaysia has fully vaccinated 90 per cent of its adult population, enabling the government to lift interstate and international travel restrictions that have been in place for months.In a televised interview, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said that fully vaccinated Malaysians will be allowed to cross state borders from October 11. Not only that, the requirement to apply for the MyTravelPass scheme to travel overseas has also been dropped for fully-vaccinated citizens, he added.Even as he announced the lifting of the curbs, Ismail Sabri advised people to continue following Covid-19 protocols such as mask-wearing to keep the virus in check.“Despite all the concessions that have been announced, the fact is that we have to live with the virus,” Bloomberg quoted Ismail as saying.“The situation demands that people continue to adhere to SOPs. I’d like to remind people not to be complacent about the relaxations," he added.To fight its worst Covid-19 wave in recent months, Malaysians had been prohibited from travelling between the country's different states since January. Even international travel was allowed for those who got special permission by applying through an official system.It must be noted that even as the new travel rules will come into effect from Monday, returning travellers will still need to undergo quarantine.The country has registered over 2.3 million virus cases and 27,000 deaths so far. Malaysia could keep the virus in check last year by closing its borders and imposing strict restrictions, it was, however, hard hit by the Delta strain this year with the country logging over 20,000 cases every day in August.With fast vaccine rollouts, the country has now managed to bend the curve. The country is aiming to reopen all economic and social sectors by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-eases-travel-curbs-as-90-adults-fully-jabbed-check-details-101633857968067.html

Seven people were pulled alive from the wreckage, officials said. The remaining sixteen are "without signs of life," a representative of the emergency services told the RIA Novosti news agency.The Emergencies Ministry said that the plane had 23 people onboard, including a group of parachute jumpers, according to the TASS news agency. The local health ministry was quoted by RIA as saying that one of the seven survivors who are in hospital is in "very serious condition".The aircraft was Let L-410 Turbolet, a twin-engine short-range transport aircraft. Accidents involving ageing planes are common in far-flung regions in Russia, even as its aviation safety standards have improved over the years.Last month, an Antonov An-26 transport plane crashed in the Russian far east killing six people. Two other L-410 aircraft also suffered fatal accidents in Russia earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-feared-dead-as-plane-carrying-parachutists-crashes-in-russia-101633852660436.html

10-10-2021||World||US will see a drop in Covid-19 deaths this winter: Anthony Fauci||US top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci expects the number of coronavirus fatalities to go down during the cold season. “I strongly suspect that you're going to start seeing the deaths go down similar to the hospitalizations; how quickly they go down and how thoroughly they go down is going to depend a lot on a number of circumstances, which will be influenced by things like the colder weather, people doing things indoors, how well they go by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines,” Fauci said in an interview with Greta Van Susteren, as quoted by The Hill.Fauci, who is the chief medical advisor to the US president, advised people to wear masks during outside gatherings regardless of whether an individual is vaccinated or not since there are communities with a high Covid-19 prevalence.“Fortunately, right now, over the last few weeks, we've seen a turnaround in the slope is going down in both cases and hospitalisations. Deaths are still up, but it's really flattening, so it's a lagging indicator,” Fauci said in the interview to be aired on Sunday. In September, the infectious disease expert warned that the Delta variant remains of primary concern in the US, having increased the share of new cases in the United States to over 98 per cent, from 13.5 per cent in June.The United States has the largest total number of confirmed coronavirus cases and the greatest Covid-19 death toll of all the countries in the world. According to the latest data from John Hopkins University, the US has registered over 44.3 million cases since the start of the pandemic and the number of fatalities has surpassed 712,000.At the start of this month, when the total Covid-19 death toll in the United States surpassed 700,000, US president Joe Biden said that the fact that the US death toll from the coronavirus infection is increasing means that more people need to get vaccinated in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-see-a-drop-in-covid-19-deaths-this-winter-anthony-fauci-101633847309288.html

10-10-2021||World||Tesla allows a sneak peek of its Gigafactory in Germany||It was showtime on Saturday on the site of Tesla's first European Gigafactory. With roughly 9,000 tickets issued to local residents, it required a good deal of organizational talent to deal with the crowd amid strict pandemic precautions. Although long lines formed in front of the entrance gate, Tesla's crew and security services were extremely efficient. In all, a 15-minute wait was more than acceptable, considering what visitors were able to see.In guided tours lasting an hour and a half each, local residents were able to watch the whole production process involved in making a Tesla electric car such as the Model Y.People took their time to see what was going on in the stamping and casting units and later in the paint shop and assembly and quality control sections of the huge plant. Wherever questions arose, Tesla employees were on hand to answer them.The 'wow' effect"I'm deeply impressed by what I'm seeing," a young woman said. "The degree of automation is unbelievable with all these robots around — I hear over 10,000 jobs will be created here, but, looking at the robots, you don't really understand where human beings will be needed at all."A man standing next to the woman was phoning home to his wife and kids, who didn't get tickets. "You should have seen this," he enthused. "It's awesome what Tesla has built here in such a short time. It just tells me how much we Germans have fallen behind."Information boards all along the guided tour track pointed to the Gigafactory's significance for the region, but also beyond it."We can produce as many cars here annually as were sold in the EU last year," Tesla told visitors, with half a million vehicles eventually expected to leave the Grünheide assembly line per year. Visitors were told that 80% of the workforce will be from Germany and 20% from 50 other countries. Also of some interest: 80% of all parts used in the Grünheide plant will come from European suppliers."I came all the way from Portugal, together with my friends," a member of a Tesla fan club said. "Of course I'm interested in electric cars, but it's also a more general interest in seeing Tesla helping pave the way towards a sustainable future — and I want to see the man," he added, referring to CEO Elon Musk, who was scheduled to make an appearance at the county fair later on.After visiting the plant, people could also go for a fun ride in a Tesla car on a high-speed test track or simply enjoy some free drinks and food. The US company's resolve to pull out all the stops on Saturday is likely to win over at least some of the plant's opponents in the region.Formality of permitsAccording to the online portal Business Insider, the Grünheide Gigafactory — including its battery cell production plant — will get a final permit from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment (LfU) later this year.Originally planning to open its Gigafactory in July, Tesla has been forced to move the date closer to the end of the year, blaming what it called German bureaucratic hurdles. Though many in the area have welcomed the prospect of thousands of new jobs, others have expressed mainly environmental concerns that Tesla is still dealing with.When the company announced its plan to add a battery cell plant to the Grünheide premises earlier this year, more than 800 objections from local residents and environmental groups were filed. They are currently being dealt with in a virtual hearing via email. Critics and Tesla have until mid-October to present their arguments.The US company will again be responding to concerns about the Gigafactory's water consumption. So far, it has stuck to its argument that the plant will not harm the drinking water supply in the area, following fresh contracts with a water management firm to secure just that.The carmaker promised that it would also meet German requirements for a viable incident concept to protect employees in the event of an accident, including the handling of hazardous substances.The German government is expected to decide before the end of the year just how much state aid Tesla will receive for its battery cell unit. The company is investing about €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in the plant. The German daily Tagesspiegel reports that this unusually high investment "means that the US car manufacturer can count on German state subsidies of €1.14 billion."The subsidies would dovetail with a plan approved by the European Union to assist major players in the production of electric vehicle batteries with a view to reducing the bloc's reliance on imports from China and other overseas industry leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-allows-a-sneak-peek-of-its-gigafactory-in-germany-101633838999106.html
10-10-2021||World||Austria's Kurz resigns over corruption allegations to save coalition||Austria's conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz resigned on Saturday to end a government crisis after his coalition partner said he was unfit to lead the country because he has been placed under investigation on suspicion of corruption.The move by Kurz, who denies wrongdoing, satisfied the demand by his junior coalition partner, the Greens, that he go even though he plans to stay on as his party's leader and become its top lawmaker in parliament, positions from which he can continue to influence government policy."I would therefore like to make way in order to end the stalemate, to prevent chaos and to ensure stability," Kurz said in a statement to the media.He added that he was proposing to President Alexander Van der Bellen that Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, a career diplomat backed by Kurz's party, that he take over as chancellor.Greens leader and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler indicated he was satisfied, meaning Kurz had succeeded in pulling their coalition back from the brink."I believe this is the right step for future government work," Greens leader and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said in a statement, adding that he had had a "very constructive" working relationship with Schallenberg.A star among Europe's conservatives and known for his hard line on immigration, Kurz, 35, became one of the continent's youngest leaders when he took over as chancellor in 2017 at the head of a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party.Prosecutors said on Wednesday they had placed Kurz and nine others under investigation on suspicion of breach of trust, corruption and bribery with various levels of involvement.Starting in 2016 when Kurz was seeking to take over as party leader, prosecutors suspect the conservative-led Finance Ministry paid for advertisements in a newspaper in exchange for manipulated polling and coverage favourable to Kurz.Kurz has pledged to defend himself against what he says are false allegations. He had said he was willing to keep governing with the Greens. But the left-wing party said the investigation made Kurz unfit to serve as chancellor and called on his party to name a successor who was "beyond reproach".No Confidence VotesThe Greens began talks on Friday with Austria's three opposition parties, which have all demanded that Kurz resign and had planned to submit one or more no-confidence motions against him at a special session of parliament on Tuesday.Austrian media reports before Kurz's announcement had said he would step down only temporarily. While Kurz did not say that he did say he would mount a legal defence: "Above all ... I will of course use the opportunity to refute and disprove the accusations that have been made against me.""Is it enough?" the leader of the liberal Neos party, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, told a news conference soon after Kurz's statement, referring to the seriousness of the accusations against Kurz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austrias-kurz-resigns-over-corruption-allegations-to-save-coalition-101633837663126.html
10-10-2021||World||With little hope for change, Iraq heads to vote in early election||Iraq on Sunday is set to hold an early election billed as a concession to anti-government protests, but expected to be boycotted by many voters who distrust official promises of reform.Polls were due to open at 7:00 am (0400 GMT) and close at 6:00 pm. Dozens of election observers deployed by the European Union and the United Nations were set to monitor the vote.Security was tight, with all airports closed from Saturday evening to dawn on Monday across Iraq, where despite the government's declaration of victory over the Islamic State group in late 2017, jihadist sleeper cells continue to mount attacks.Dozens of anti-government activists have been killed, kidnapped or intimidated in recent months, with accusations that pro-Iran armed groups, many of which are represented in parliament, have been behind the violence."Iraqis should have the confidence to vote as they please, in an environment free of pressure, intimidation and threats," the UN mission in Iraq said ahead of the polls, which are being held a year early in a rare concession to the youth-led protest movement.The protests that swept through Baghdad and the south in October 2019 rocked the Shiite factions that have dominated Iraq since the aftermath of the US-led invasion of 2003.Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to express their anger at corruption, unemployment and crumbling public services, and hundreds lost their lives in protest-related violence.The protests have largely fizzled out as anger has given way to disillusion, and analysts predicted a potentially record low turnout for Sunday's vote."Nothing will change. This election will be won by the same factions that people protested against," bemoaned Baghdad day labourer Mohammed Kassem, vowing not to vote."We have no power, no transport, no public services, and a wretched health service, even though Iraq is the richest country in the region," the 45-year-old said.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi's political future hangs in the balance, with few observers willing to predict who will come out on top after the lengthy backroom haggling that usually follows Iraqi elections.In a speech on Friday, Kadhemi sounded a reformist note, saying voters had a "historic opportunity" to elect "competent individuals... who are not tarnished by corruption" and are capable of launching "comprehensive reform at every level".'Musical chairs'A new single-member constituency system for electing Iraq's 329 lawmakers is supposed to weaken the power of the traditional blocs largely based on religious, ethnic and clan affiliations.But most analysts believe it will make the political process even more opaque.The electoral commission said it expects to publish preliminary results within 24 hours of the close of polls.But it will likely take longer for the balance of power to emerge as the leading factions compete for the support of a larger number of independents.The Fatah Alliance, the bloc representing many Iran-backed Shiite militias, is expected to retain its share of seats.The list of populist cleric Moqtada Sadr, already the largest in the outgoing parliament, is expected to make gains but not enough to dominate the Shiite camp."The election will likely result in another fragmented parliament, followed by opaque, corrupt horse-trading among factions to form the next government," said researchers Bilal Wahab and Calvin Wilder in an analysis published by the Washington Institute."Few expect this election to amount to more than a game of musical chairs, and the (October 2019 protest) movement's core demands -- curbing systemic corruption, creating jobs and holding armed groups accountable -- are unlikely to be met."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-little-hope-for-change-iraq-heads-to-vote-in-early-election-101633830448469.html
10-10-2021||World||Italy extends Covid-19 ‘green pass’ rule, spurs massive anti-government protests in Rome||Thousands of protesters including members of far-right groups demonstrated in central Rome on Saturday against the extension of the Covid-19 health pass system to all workplaces. There were scuffles with police as the demonstrators took aim at the health pass, which has been a requirement to enter museums, sporting events, and restaurants since August.Although the march was authorised, several hundred people broke off from the main column and tried to march on parliament. Police used water cannon and tear gas to stop them, arresting several protesters during clashes, the AGI news agency reported.A separate protest took place in the capital and others in the northern city of Milan and in Cesena, central Italy.Three weeks ago the government of prime minister Mario Draghi announced that the scheme would be extended to all places of work from October 15 and any employees refusing to comply faced suspension without pay. The health pass system is already in place for all medical workers. It requires people to provide a certificate of vaccination, proof of recovery from Covid-19, or a recent negative test result.Retiree Maria Ballarin denounced "criminal and cowardly blackmail" by the Italian state.By not making vaccinations compulsory but forcing workers to have them "it absolves itself of any responsibility for fatal or serious consequences, but indirectly obliges people to be vaccinated in order to be able to go to work", she said."We were both suspended two months ago," Cosimo, one of the protesters, told AFP. He and his wife Morena are both nurses.The couple says they have immunity and allergy problems and were exempted from the vaccination requirement by their family doctor. But both were suspended without pay.Stefano, who came from Como in the north to join Saturday's protest, said he would take the test. "I have to pay to work, it's absurd," he said. Nearly 80 per cent of the over-12s in Italy have been fully vaccinated, according to government statistics. The first European country to feel the full force of the pandemic, Italy has so suffered more than 130,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-extends-covid-19-green-pass-rule-spurs-massive-anti-government-protests-in-rome-101633829181213.html

The celebrations for the day, which is immensely significant in the history of the East Asian nation, are likely to not be received well by China, which celebrated its own national day earlier this month by violating Taiwan's airspace with a slew of fighter aircraft in a major display of military supremacy and strategic pressure. Beijing claims the democratic island as its own territory and Chinese president Xi Jinping even said on Saturday that Taiwan's independence was a “grave lurking threat to national rejuvenation”.Also Read | Taiwan says China could launch ‘full scale’ invasion by 2025, tensions aggravateThe Taiwan National Day—also known as the ‘Double Ten’ or the ‘Double Tenth Day’— is a public holiday that remembers the 1911 Wuchang Uprising which ultimately led to the creation of the Republic of China. However, after the Chinese civil war, the Republic of China was forced to cede control to the communists and the erstwhile officials fled to Taiwan in 1949. Each year, the presidential square in Taipei—the capital of the island nation—is lit up on this day while large parades and rallies, displays of martial arts, folk dancing, and other cultural activities are conducted.Also Read | ‘Complete reunification of China will be realised’: President JinpingHowever, the threat of Beijing's increasingly hostile advances seems closer than ever this year, according to reports. Although a ‘full scale’ Chinese invasion seems unlikely at least until 2025, Taiwan's defence minister said at the country's parliament on Wednesday that tensions with Beijing are now at their worst in more than 40 years. He noted that there was an added risk of “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait and that while China may already have the required arsenal to take Taiwan by force, the cost of a “full scale” war for Beijing might be at its lowest by 2025, when a potential invasion seems likely.Notably, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed more than 150 fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Straits, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, declared on Saturday that "the complete reunification of China can and will be realised,” and said that the ‘Taiwan question’ brooks no international interference from third parties. Although Xi promised that Beijing will concentrate its efforts on a peaceful “reunification” with Taiwan, he stopped short of mentioning anything on the use of force. Taiwan responded shortly after by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan’s people could decide their future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-marks-national-day-today-under-looming-shadow-of-china-101633825045069.html

Our thoughts are with the 10 wounded civilians, who were doing no more than seeking to travel or make a living," US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a tweet.A spokesperson of the coalition Brigadier-General Turki Al-Malki said that the attack was through a projectile that fell on the airport, Xinhua news agency reported citing Saudi media.The attack against the King Abdullah airport in Jizan was carried out Friday night by an explosives-laden drone, resulting in injuries to 10 passengers and workers, Gulf News quoting the alliance spokesman Turki Al Maliki reported.On Wednesday, four employees at another Saudi airport were injured after Saudi defences intercepted an explosive drone launched by Al Houthis, Gulf News reported.In recent months, Al Houthis have ramped up drone and missile attacks into the Saudi territory. The rebels have plunged Yemen into a devastating war after they unseated the internationally recognised government and seized some parts of the impoverished country including the capital Sana'a in late 2014, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-department-condemns-attack-on-saudi-arabia-s-king-abdullah-airport-101633825740235.html
10-10-2021||World||China, US reps hold ‘candid’ meeting on trade issues||China and US held their first trade talks under the Biden administration with a “candid exchange” in a virtual meeting of US trade representative Katherine Tai and China’s vice premier Liu He on Friday.The two officials “reviewed implementation of the US-China Economic and Trade Agreement and agreed that the two sides would consult on certain outstanding issues”, according to a readout of their meeting issued by the office of the US trade representative (USTR).Tai signalled the resumption of trade talks with China last week saying she plans to have ‘frank conversations” with her Chinese counterpart about “shortfalls” in deliverables China had committed itself to under a 2020 trade deal popularly known as the Phase 1 agreement.At the meeting, Tai emphasised US concerns relating to China’s “state-led, non-market policies and practices that harm American workers, farmers and businesses”, the USTR said.US trade officials have indicated they do not foresee a Phase 2 of the trade deal with China, and are focussed on ensuring the implementation of the 2020 deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-reps-hold-candid-meeting-on-trade-issues-101633806574565.html
10-10-2021||World||‘Complete reunification of China will be realised’: President Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday to realise peaceful “reunification” with Taiwan, though did not directly mention the use of force after a week of tensions with the Chinese-claimed island that sparked international concern.Taiwan responded shortly after by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan’s people could decide their future.Xi’s call on reunifying Taiwan comes in the backdrop of a week of heightened military tension with the democratically-run island that Beijing claims as a breakaway region.The Chinese PLA deployed more than 150 fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Straits, which violated the island’s air space last week prompting Taipei to call it the worst tensions with China in 40 years. The tension has also sparked international concern.“The complete reunification of China will be and can be realised,” Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state media, adding the Taiwan question, which is purely an internal matter for China, arose out of the weakness and chaos of the Chinese nation and will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality.“It has never ended well for those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, or split the country,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Saturday, the anniversary of the revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911.“They will definitely be scorned by the people and judged by history,” he said.“National reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including compatriots in Taiwan,” he noted.“Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should stand on the right side of history and join hands to achieve China’s complete reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi said.Xi’s Saturday speech seemingly struck a softer note than the one he delivered on July 1 to mark the Chinese Communist Party’s 100 years in which he vowed to “smash” any attempts at formal independence.The presidential office in Taipei criticised Xi’s speech, saying Taiwan was a sovereign independent country, not part of the People’s Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China’s offer of “one country, two systems” to rule the island.“The nation’s future rests in the hands of Taiwan’s people,” the presidential office said was quoted as saying by Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/complete-reunification-of-china-will-be-realised-president-jinping-101633805168891.html
