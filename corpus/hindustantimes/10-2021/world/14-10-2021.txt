The FDA typically follows the advice of its experts but is not bound to do so.Moderna is seeking approval of a booster shot that includes 50 micrograms of vaccine, half of strength of its regular dose but still higher than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, which contains 30 micrograms of vaccine.Dr. Ofer Levy, a panel member, said it is important to remember that the United States and Israel are different populations and that the vaccine Israel used is different, but he added that as both use similar mRNA technology the Israel findings are relevant.The panel will vote on whether Moderna boosters should be given six months after the second dose to individuals aged 65 and over, those at high-risk of severe Covid-19 and to people ages 18 to 64 who are at risk of frequently exposed to coronavirus infections due to their jobs.If the FDA signs off on Moderna's booster, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make specific recommendations on who should get the shots."What we're seeing is a break in the epidemic curve in Israel," said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, director of public health services at the Ministry of Health in Israel.She said the booster vaccination program, which now includes 50% of the population among all age groups, is starting to reduce infections even among the unvaccinated populations in Israel.Israel, which has been closely monitoring vaccines in its population, said in a slide presentation that administering a booster dose led to greater protection against confirmed infection in those aged 16 and above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-advisers-weigh-case-for-booster-shots-of-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-101634231065928.html

WHO report links it to Covid-19 pandemic||Deaths due to tuberculosis have increased for the first time in over a decade reversing years of global progress, the World Health Organization said on Thursday citing the 2021 Global TB report. The UN health agency said in its annual report that progress towards TB milestones has been hit hard by the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Not only the number of people dying of tuberculosis increased last year, but also far fewer people were diagnosed and treated for infectious bacterial disease.According to the report, tuberculosis was second only to Covid-19 as a leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. The impact of disruptions caused by the pandemic on new TB cases and related deaths could be “much worse” in 2021 and 2022, suggest modelling projections.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement that the Global TB report confirms “our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis.”“This is alarming news that must serve as a global wake-up call to the urgent need for investments and innovation to close the gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for the millions of people affected by this ancient but preventable and treatable disease,” Tedros added.The UN health agency estimates that about 4.1 million people currently suffering from TB have either went undiagnosed or have not officially reported to national authorities, up by 1.2 million from 2019. India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and China have contributed the most to the global reductions in TB notifications between 2019 and 2020.Despite some success stories from some countries and regions, global TB targets are "mostly off-track", according to the report.“The immediate priority is to restore access to and provision of essential TB services such that levels of TB case detection and treatment can recover to at least 2019 levels,” the report concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tb-deaths-rise-for-first-time-in-over-a-decade-who-report-links-it-to-covid-19-pandemic-101634230097849.html

The treasury department had also slapped sanctions on him at that time.There is an additional reward of $1 million for information that could lead to financially disrupting Khan’s racket.The 40-year-old Pakistani national is alleged to have “organised, led, and worked” with accomplices to have facilitated the travel of undocumented individuals to the United States between January 2015 and December 2020 in exchange for unspecified payments.“Abid Ali Khan allegedly operates a Pakistani-based smuggling network that facilitates the travel of undocumented individuals into the United States from the Middle East and southwest Asia in exchange for payment,” the US state department said while announcing the reward. It added that in addition to planning and coordinating international travel from Pakistan through multiple countries, Ali Khan also allegedly offered or provided false documents to foreign nationals to help them travel overseas.Smuggling organisations such as Abid Ali Khan’s use routes that go through Central America and involve days of going through perilous conditions, sometimes without food and water. The end result is often not worth all the risk or the money paid to the smugglers - those caught are sent right back.Indians are also known to have used these networks to reach United States, though it’s not clear if they were organised or led by Abid Ali Khan. Many of them seek asylum when caught, claiming persecution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-reward-for-alleged-pakistani-smuggler-abid-ali-khan-101634227609925.html

Beijing, however, added that it will support the probe.The coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, triggering the worst pandemic in a century.The WHO on Wednesday announced a new probe to trace the origin of the virus and released a proposed list of 25 experts to advise it on next steps.Chinese scientist Yungui Yang of Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences is a leading Chinese scientist included in the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO).Beijing has dismissed accusations that it withheld critical data during an earlier WHO probe into the origin of Covid-19 in February, saying that the investigation was politicised by the US and that the scope of the search should be widened to other countries.Asked to comment on the new probe, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said it should be carried out in the “spirit of science” and shouldn’t be used as a political tool.“China will continue to support and participate in international coronavirus origins -tracing, yet opposes any form of political manipulation on the issue,” Zhao said on Thursday.“China has always maintained that the tracing of virus origins is a serious and complex scientific issue, and that research should be conducted by scientists in cooperation,” Zhao said.He added that the result of the previous study on the matter should be respected. In August, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu had said China opposes “political tracing… and abandoning the joint report” issued after a WHO expert team visited Wuhan in January.“We support scientific tracing,” Ma had said.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in June that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the Covid-19 pandemic and a laboratory leak, adding that he had asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origin of the coronavirus.National health commission (NHC) vice minister Zeng Yixin had also told reporters in June that the WHO’s second planned probe had listed the hypothesis that China had violated lab regulations and leaked the virus as one of the major research objectives, and he was “very shocked” after reading the proposal.Zeng said China cannot accept the current version of the WHO plan because it has been compromised by political manipulation and disrespects scientific facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-warns-against-manipulation-of-new-who-virus-origin-probe-101634225449046.html

US statement department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the smuggling network, run by Abid Ali Khan, facilitates the travel of undocumented individuals from the Middle East and southwest Asia to the US in exchange for money.“In addition to planning and coordinating the international travel from Pakistan through multiple countries, Ali Khan allegedly offered or provided false documents for foreign nationals to use for travel,” the state department said.The United States is offering up to $1 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Ali Khan, and $1 million for information leading to the financial disruption of the Pakistan-based human smuggling network. Khan was indicted by a federal grand jury in April for allegedly running a scheme to smuggle undocumented individuals into the US from Pakistan and Afghanistan.Also Read | US sanctions Pakistan-based transnational human smuggling networkCiting court documents, the US justice department had said that the Pakistani national allegedly “encouraged, induced, and brought” undocumented individuals to the US for “commercial advantage and financial gain.” The US treasury department followed the indictment with sanctions on Pakistan-based transnational human smuggling organization, designating it as a significant ‘Transnational Criminal Organization.’Illegal entry to the United States is often facilitated by smuggling organisations that take advantage of the vulnerable population but also put their lives at risk as it can involve walking for days through difficult terrain with little food or water.

The comments came after Union home minister Amit Shah referred to surgical strike in his speech in Goa. Remembering former Goa chief minister and India's former defence minister Manohar Parrikar, Amit Shah on Thursday said the surgical strike was a new chapter in India's defence."Surgical strike under PM Modi and former defence minister Manohar Parrikar was an important step. We sent out a message that no one can disturb India's borders. There was a time for talks, But now is the time to reciprocate," Amit Shah said.India now gives befitting reply: Amit Shah warns Pakistan, refers to surgical strikeCriticising the defence policy of the UPA government, Amit Shah said there used to be talks when India's border got attacked. But now is the time to reciprocate. "When the terrorists attacked Poonch, India gave a befitting reply in the form of surgical strike. That was the beginning of a new chapter when India conveyed the message that it will give a reply in the same language," Amit Shah said.Pakistan said Amit Shah's statement, which has been interpreted as a veiled warning for more surgical strikes, is irresponsible and provocative. "His delusional statement only goes to further demonstrate the BJP-RSS combine’s propensity to stoke regional tensions for both ideological reasons and political expediency, based on enmity towards Pakistan," Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs said in the statement. “While Pakistan is a peace-loving country, we will spare no effort in resolutely thwarting any aggressive designs," it said. "Pakistan’s swift response to India’s Balakot misadventure in 2019, including the downing of Indian combat aircraft and capture of Indian Air Force pilot, fully demonstrated the will, capacity and preparedness of our armed forces to deter Indian aggression," it said.Union minister Amit Shah's statement and Pakistan's reaction come in the backdrop of increased incidents of civilians' killing in J&K. Amit Shah will visit J&K between October 23 and October 25, his first visit after the scrapping of Article 370 in August 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-condemns-amit-shah-s-surgical-strike-comment-says-it-s-peaceloving-101634221957233.html
14-10-2021||World||Norway's bow-and-arrow attack possibly an 'act of terror', says police||The killing of five people in Norway in a bow-and-arrow attack appears to be an "act of terror," the Norwegian security service said Thursday, with the suspect, a Danish Muslim convert, already on their radar over fears he had been radicalised.Four women and a man died and two others were injured on Wednesday in the south-eastern town of Kongsberg in Norway's deadliest attack in a decade."The events in Kongsberg currently appear to be an act of terror, but the investigation... will determine in closer detail what the acts were motivated by," Norway's intelligence service PST said in a statement."We're talking about a convert to Islam," police official Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters on Thursday, adding: "There were fears linked to radicalisation previously."Saeverud said the 37-year-old suspect had confessed to the facts of the matter during questioning. Those who were killed during the attack were all aged between 50 and 70."We are investigating among other things to determine whether this was an act of terror," Saeverud added.Reports that linked him to radicalisation pre-dated this year, Saeverud said, and police had followed up at the time. "We haven't had any reports about him in 2021, but earlier," he said."We're relatively sure that he acted alone."PST also confirmed that the suspect was known to them but added the couldn't give "further details about him."It aslo said they didn't believe the threat level in the country had changed, describing it as "moderate"."Our evaluation is that what happened in Kongsberg Wednesday October 13 does not change the national threat assessment," PST said.Murder in Norway is rare.It was the deadliest attack since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011.Since then, Norway has seen one other far-right attack, carried out by a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who opened fire into a mosque.'Like Kabul'On Thursday it was largely quiet in Kongsberg, a picturesque town of 25,000 people with wooden facades and the foliage changing colour for the autumn.Streets were almost empty with only a light police presence.A few police officers stood outside a store where part of the attack took place. A glass door there was chipped by a shot.Two candles flickered outside the town's church.The suspect was due to appear before a judge on Friday for a custody hearing.He was undergoing a psychiatric examination on Thursday, the prosecutor said.The victims have not yet been named publicly, but one of the wounded was an off-duty police officer who had been in a store.Norwegian media questioned why it took police more than a half-hour to arrest the suspect after the first reports of the attack.Police were informed of the attack at 6:13 pm (1613 GMT) and the suspect was arrested at 6:47 pm. He fired arrows at police, who responded with warning shots, Saeverud said.Thomas Nilsen was at home when he heard the screams and said images of war came to mind."I thought it was Kabul," he told AFP."I heard children screaming, barking and then the sound of a helicopter circling around my house," Terje Kristiansen, another witness, said."I didn't sleep much," he added.Arrow stuck in wallImages in the media showed a black arrow sticking out of a wall and what looked like competition-grade arrows lying on the ground.Police said Thursday the suspect had also used other weapons, but provided no details."These events shake us," said Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who stepped down Thursday, replaced by Jonas Gahr Store, whose Labour Party won recent parliamentary elections.Store lamented the "horrible acts", while Norway's King Harald said he was "appalled by the tragic events".Norwegian police are not normally armed, but after the attack, the National Police Directorate ordered that officers be armed nationwide.Norway rarely experiences such violence, but 10 years ago Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in the country's worst massacre since World War II.Breivik first set off a bomb in Oslo next to the building that housed the office of the prime minister, then went on a shooting spree at a summer camp for left-wing youth on the island of Utoya.Several planned jihadist attacks have also been foiled by security services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norways-bow-and-arrow-attack-possibly-an-act-of-terror-says-police-101634214648756.html
14-10-2021||World||China warns against 'manipulation' as WHO renews virus origin probe||China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday warned against what it called possible “political manipulation” of a renewed probe by the World Health Organization into the origins of the coronavirus, while saying it would support the international body's efforts.The WHO on Wednesday released a proposed list of 25 experts to advise it on next steps in the search for the virus' origins after its earlier efforts were attacked for going too easy on China, where the first human cases were detected in late 2019.Beijing was accused of withholding raw data on early cases during a visit by a WHO team in February and has since resisted calls for further investigation, saying the U.S. and others were politicizing the matter.Foreign Ministry spoksperson Zhao Lijian said China would “continue to support and participate in global scientific tracing and firmly oppose any forms of political manipulation.”“We hope that all parties concerned, including the WHO secretariat and the advisory group, will effectively uphold an objective and responsible scientific attitude," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.The experts proposed by the U.N. health agency include some who were on the original team that went to the central Chinese city of Wuhan to investigate the origins of COVID-19.The findings of the original WHO-led team were inconclusive, and the experts released a report concluding it was “extremely unlikely” that the coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan lab, prompting criticism from outside scientists that the theory had not been properly vetted. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later acknowledged it had been “premature” to dismiss the lab theory.Beijing has repeatedly questioned whether the virus did indeed originate in China, and has called for investigations into U.S. military laboratories without providing any solid evidence.China has largely stamped out cases of local transmission of COVID-19 infections through mask wearing, quarantining and electronic case tracing, along with sometimes draconian measures including lockdowns and mandatory mass testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-against-manipulation-as-who-renews-virus-origin-probe-101634209986055.html
14-10-2021||World||Pakistan airline suspends flights from Kabul citing Taliban's ‘heavy-handed’ interference||Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Thursday announced the suspension of flights from Kabul, accusing the Taliban of “heavy-handed” interference, according to news agencies. The Taliban government had ordered Pakistan’s national flag carrier to cut prices to the levels when it was operating during the Western-backed Afghan government. PIA accused the Sunni Pashtun group, which announced an interim government last month, of arbitrary rule changes and intimidation of staff."We are suspending our flight operations to Kabul from today because of the heavy-handedness of the authorities," news agency Reuters quoted PIA spokesperson as saying.Reports suggest that Taliban officials used derogatory language towards the airline staff and also manhandled a staff member. PIA spokesperson has said the flights to and from Kabul will remain suspended until “the situation becomes conducive”, reported AFP.The Pakistani carrier has been facing criticism for charging an exorbitant amount, as much as $1,200 for a one-way flight from Kabul to Islamabad. The airline has defended the ticket prices saying the operation was "not very lucrative financially" and it was only operating flights on "humanitarian grounds".PIA was the only international commercial airline operating on a regular basis out of Kabul. The airline had initially said that it would only operate chartered flights following requests from some international institutions and missions."Honestly, there will be some way for the evacuees to fly back before regular flights are resumed. At best, ours would be charter operations, operating on behest of certain customers demands who want to get their people out of Kabul," ANI had quoted PIA spokesperson Abdullah Khan as saying.Days after PIA's denial of resuming commercial flights to Kabul, the airline landed the first commercial international flight at Hamid Karzai International Airport since the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-airline-suspends-flights-from-kabul-citing-taliban-s-interference-101634209039596.html

There are more than 3,000 pandals in Bangladesh observing Durga Puja at present.As the news spread like wildfire through digital media, there were violent attacks on pandals in Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, areas around Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram. However, there were no disturbances in Dhaka, Brahmanbaria, Jashore and other major cities.Initially, the police were slow to react but after the high commissioner of India spoke to the administration, there was heavy deployment of armed police and local enforcement agencies. Three people, including two desecration protestors, were killed in Chandpur and dozens were injured by rubber bullets in Cumilla.While Dhaka has ensured that heavy police deployment will continue till Friday, it is quite evident that communal flames were being fanned by the opposition JEI, which has had an injection of confidence after the Sunni terrorist force Taliban occupied Afghanistan. The JEI coined the slogan “ Bangladesh Banega Afghanistan” in a bid to radicalise the youth towards ultra-conservative Islam to achieve political objectives.“The basic idea behind October 13 incident was to embarrass Bangladesh’s government credentials and force a reaction from India,” said a diplomat based in Dhaka. The Jamaat thrives on radicalised youth to oppose the Sheikh Hasina government and is networked with other pro-Taliban regimes in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jamaateislami-behind-the-pandal-violence-in-bangladesh-say-officials-101634205996205.html
14-10-2021||World||6 killed in Lebanon amid clashes over Beirut blast probe||Armed clashes erupted on Thursday in Beirut during a protest organised by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and its allies against the lead judge probing last year's blast in the city's port.At least six people were killed and dozens were wounded in the most protracted and violent street fighting in the city in years, authorities said.The exchanges of fire along a former front line from the 1975-90 civil war involved pistols, automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, and were reminiscent of that conflict.Gunfire echoed in the Lebanese capital for several hours and ambulances, sirens wailing, rushed to pick up casualties. Snipers shot from buildings. Bullets penetrated apartment windows in the area.It was not immediately clear what triggered Thursday's violence. Both sides said their protesters came under fire from snipers on rooftops.Tensions had been running high after the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its Shiite allies from the Amal Movement demanded the removal of Tarek Bitar, the judge leading the investigation into last year's massive port explosion.The two parties called for a protest near the Justice Palace, located along the former front line between Muslim Shiite and Christian areas.The violence unfolded while US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland was in town, meeting with Lebanese officials. Her schedule was slightly thrown off by the action on the streets.Nuland later told an airport news conference that an impartial judiciary is the guarantor of all rights, in apparent criticism of Hezbollah.“The Lebanese people deserve no less and the victims and the families of those lost in the port blast deserve no less,” she said. “Today's unacceptable violence makes clear what the stakes are.”The demands for Bitar's removal and calls for protests upset many who considered it blatant intervention in the work of the judiciary.The right wing Christian Lebanese Forces mobilised supporters Wednesday evening after Hezbollah and Amal called for the protest at the Justice Palace, located in a Christian area.Videos circulating on social media showed supporters of the Christian Lebanese Forces marching in the streets, carrying large crosses.As the clashes erupted, a journalist with The Associated Press saw a man open fire with a pistol and gunmen shooting in the direction of protesters from the balcony of a building.Several men fell immediately from the gunfire and bled on the street. The army deployed heavily and sent patrols to the area to search for the gunmen, following the exchanges of gunfire between the Muslim and Christian sides of the capital.Lebanese authorities said at least six people were killed and 30 wounded. A staffer at the emergency room at al-Sahel hospital said they received three bodies and 15 people who were wounded. One of the dead, a woman, had received a bullet to her head. Two of the injured were in critical condition.Four projectiles fell near a private French school, Freres of Furn el Chebbak, causing panic, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.The students huddled in the central corridors with the windows open to avoid major impact, in scenes reminiscent of the civil war. Smoke covered the neighborhood where intense gunfire was relentless.A car caught fire, while a blaze was reported in a lower floor where residents were stuck and called for help.Sporadic shooting continued even after army troops deployed to the area Thursday. Residents and civilians in the area were ducking to avoid the shooting. Someone screamed: “Some martyrs on the ground!” People pulled one man who was apparently shot and down, away from the line of fire. Others pulled another body away.In some videos circulating online, some men were chanting: “Shiite Shiite” on the streets, as residents were running from the gunfire.In a statement, Prime Minister Najib Mikati appealed for calm and urged people “not to be dragged into civil strife.”The court probe centers on hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrates that had been improperly stored at a port warehouse that detonated on August 4, 2020, killing at least 215 people, injuring thousands and destroying parts of nearby neighbourhoods.It was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history and has further devastated the country already roiled by political divisions and unprecedented economic and financial meltdown.Bitar is the second judge to lead the complicated investigation - his predecessor was removed following legal challenges.Now Bitar has come up against formidable opposition from the powerful Hezbollah group and its allies who accuse him of singling out politicians for questioning, most of them allied with Hezbollah.None of Hezbollah's officials have so far been charged in the 14-month-old investigation.The tensions over the port blast add to Lebanon's enormous multiple troubles, including an unprecedented economic and financial meltdown, an energy crisis leading to extended electricity blackouts, hyperinflation and soaring poverty.Beirut resident Haneen Chemaly, who heads a local NGOs that provides social services, accused Lebanon's leaders of steering the country into civil war, saying it's “the last card they have to use.”“They have (driven) us into bankruptcy, devastation and now they are scaring us with the specter of civil war,” she said.Nuland, who said she was visiting to express support for Mikati's new government. At a press conference held at Beirut airport, she urged for “strong action” by the government that would demonstrate a will to enact reforms.The armed clash, however, could derail Mikati's month-old government even before it begins tackling Lebanon's economic meltdown.A Cabinet meeting was cancelled Wednesday after Hezbollah demanded urgent government action against the judge. One Hezbollah-allied minister said he and other Shiite Cabinet members would stage a walkout if Bitar isn't removed, further complicating Mikati's mission||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-killed-in-lebanon-amid-clashes-over-beirut-blast-probe-101634206547657.html

The attack took place in different parts of the Norwegian town of Kongsberg, 68 km southwest of the capital, Oslo, in which an off-duty police officer also got injured.“There earlier had been worries of the man having been radicalised,” regional police chief Ole B. Saeverud told a news conference, adding that they are yet to determine whether it was a terrorist attack.Four women and a man, aged between 50 and 70, were killed in Norway’s deadliest attack in a decade. Reports suggest that police were informed of the attack at 6:13 pm (local time) (4.13pm GMT) and the suspect was arrested at 6:47 pm (local time). While bow-and-arrow was mainly used for the attack, some other weapons were also used by the suspect.The regional police chief said the 37-year-old suspect, a Danish citizen, had confessed during questioning. The reports linking the suspect to radicalisation were before 2021 and police had followed up at the time, Saeverud added.Murders, let alone mass killings, in Norway are rare and the previous deadliest attack was in 2011 when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people.This time, the police said they are "talking about a convert to Islam" but are “relatively sure” that the suspect acted alone.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bowandarrow-attack-norway-suspect-known-to-police-had-coverted-to-islam-101634204223426.html

The list of ‘Dangerous Individuals and Organizations’ that Facebook doesn't allow on its platform was leaked by The Intercept on Tuesday.Hindutva group Sanatan Sanstha, banned Communist Party of India(Maoist) and Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) are among the 10 groups from India on that Facebook list, according to The Intercept. So are the All Tripura Tiger Force, Kangleipak Communist Party, Khalistan Tiger Force, People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak. Several Islamic extremists and terror groups, including the Indian Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed’s Afzal Guru Squad and various local or sub-groups of global organisations like the Islamic State and the Taliban, that have operated in India or across multiple countries are also on the list.Also read | US senator asks Mark Zuckerberg to retain all records on whistleblower testimonyMore than half of the list consists of alleged foreign terrorists that are predominately Middle Eastern, South Asian and Muslim.

Terrorist groups, hate groups and criminal organisations are part of the most restrictive level, Tier 1, and the least restrictive level, Tier 3, includes militarised social movements, which The Intercept said: "is mostly right-wing American anti-government militias, which are virtually entirely white."

In Taiwan, official confirmation of a death can only be made in the hospital.Li said the death toll could surpass 40, as firefighters conducted search and rescue efforts into the afternoon.Video shown on Taiwanese television showed orange flames and smoke billowing out of the lower floors of the building as firefighters sprayed water at it from the street. After daybreak, they could be seen spraying water into the middle floors of the still smoldering building from elevated platforms.The cause of the fire was unclear, but firefighters noted the flames burned most intensely where a lot of clutter had been piled up, the fire department statement said.Eyewitnesses told Taiwan media that they heard an explosion around 3 a.m.The building is about 40 years old with shops on the lower levels and apartments above. The lower floors were completely blackened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/46-dead-dozens-injured-after-fire-breaks-out-in-a-building-in-southern-taiwan-101634201754667.html

The International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) said 99 per cent of Palau's population over 12 has had both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine as it praised what it said was the country’s "remarkable" pace of vaccination.The Red Cross cited Palau government figures which show that 16,152 people out of its population of about 18,000 have been given the Covid-19 jab. "It is important to celebrate the success of reaching high vaccination rates in many Pacific countries, including Palau, Fiji and the Cook Islands," Katie Greenwood, the head of the IFRC's Pacific office, said. However, Greenwood added it was "critical that we try to get everyone vaccinated ahead of the cyclone season, which threatens to damage homes and infrastructure, stretching resources and services needed to contain Covid-19".Also read | WHO forms 'last chance' to find Covid-19 origins, urges China to provide dataAccording to New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, there could be up to 12 tropical cyclones in the Southwest Pacific between November and next April.The body said in a statement that Palau, an archipelago of 500 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, is in the "top spot" and ahead of countries like Portugal, which was named one of the world's most vaccinated countries when 80 per cent of its 10 million people were fully immunised in September.Also read | Canada's Quebec postpones Covid-19 vaccine mandates, fearing healthcare crisisThe Red Cross also said that other Pacific nations are leading the world in vaccination rates, on a per capita basis. The Cook Islands with a population of 17,000 had 96 per cent of its eligible population fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and Fiji, which has 896,000 people, has given one dose to 96 per cent of the country’s eligible people, it said.However, other small countries in the region—the Solomon Islands with a population of 650,000 and Kiribati with a population of 119,000—have inoculated less than 10 per cent of their people against Covid-19. It also cited Our World in Data figures to add that Papua New Guinea has less than 1 per cent of its population fully vaccinated.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-country-has-beaten-the-world-with-99-covid-vaccination-101634195584905.html

14-10-2021||World||Japan PM dissolves parliament, paves way for election||Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is seeking a mandate for his policies in the October 31 parliamentary election. Meanwhile, the opposition has vowed to close Japan's income gap.Japan's new prime minister Fumio Kishida dissolved the lower house of parliament on Thursday, setting the stage for national elections later this month.Kishida, who formally took over the reins from Yoshihide Suga 11 days ago, will be seeking to maintain a lower house majority for his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).The prime minister also enjoys reasonable public support , according to opinion polls.Voters in Japan will head to the polls on October 31 to choose a new parliament, and indirectly elect the country's next government.Kishida to lead LDP into pollsThe last lower house election was held in 2017 under Shinzo Abe, who pulled the long-ruling LDP further to the right while serving as Japan's longest-serving prime minister.This time, Kishida will lead the party, along with its coalition partner the Komeito party, into the election."I want to use the election to tell the people what we're trying to do and what we're aiming for," he told reporters at his office.Talking about his time in office so far, Kishida said: "I've had a very busy schedule but strangely, I'm not feeling tired — I'm feeling fulfilled."Opposition calls for ‘wealth distribution first’The country's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), announced its plan to focus on closing Japan's income gap with wealth redistribution if it were to win the election.A similar position has been announced by Kishida, blurring the policy differences between the LDP and CDPJ ahead of the election.“Wage hikes and distribution once growth is achieved.' This is what [former prime minister] Abe was saying. But there was no growth over the past eight, nine years, and no wage hikes,” CDPJ chief Yukio Edano told reporters.“If we don't distribute wealth first, no growth is achieved. This is a rather clear difference [between the two parties,” Edano said.The CDPJ has also highlighted its support for issues such as same-sex marriage and different surnames for couples.On the other hand, the LDP remains socially conservative, and Kishida has said he was not in favor of same-sex marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-dissolves-parliament-paves-way-for-election-101634194851693.html

Iran is accused of violating the deal by enriching uranium.The United States and Israel said Wednesday they were looking at further possible ways of dealing with Iran if Tehran does not come back in good faith to negotiations to rescue a landmark nuclear deal.Speaking after three-way talks with the foreign ministers of Israel and the United Arab Emirates, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said "other options" were on the table if Iran were to reject an offer to comply again with the agreement in the event that the US rejoins it."We will look at every option to deal with the challenge posed by Iran," he said. "And we continue to believe that diplomacy is the most effective way to do that. But it takes two to engage in diplomacy, and we have not seen from Iran a willingness to do that at this point."Israel threatens actionPossible non-diplomatic options could include military force, but also a further tightening of sanctions or covert actions against Iran.Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid was more forthright in his warnings to Tehran."There are moments when nations must use force to protect the world from evil,'' he said. "If a terror regime is going to acquire a nuclear weapon we must act," he said."Israel reserves the right to act at any given moment in any way. That is not only our right, it is also our responsibility,'' he added.What is the nuclear deal?Under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, including the US and Germany, Iran agreed to discontinue certain elements of its nuclear program that the West fears could lead to the development of nuclear weapons.In return for that and for allowing comprehensive international inspections of its nuclear facilities, the country was to receive billions of dollars' worth of sanctions relief.The deal has been in jeopardy since former US President Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018, with Iran violating a number of the agreements it had made.Israel was not a party to the deal, which was negotiated by the administration of former US President Barack Obama.Iran has indicated that it might be ready to come back to indirect negotiations on the deal with the US but has not set a definite date.Tehran has always denied it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, claiming its atomic research is for civilian purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-of-other-options-on-iran-s-nuclear-program-if-diplomacy-fails-101634190707261.html
14-10-2021||World||Canada: Quebec postpones Covid-19 vaccine mandates, fearing healthcare crisis||Quebec, the first province in Canada scheduled to enforce a Covid-19 vaccine mandate from Friday, has postponed its enforcement by a month due to concerns that it may trigger a healthcare crisis caused by depleted staffing.Quebec’s decision to pause the move came as public sector unions continue to oppose mandatory Covid-19 vaccine requirements for central and provincial government employees.The prospect of depleted staffing amid a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic eventually compelled Quebec to postpone the mandate deadline to November 15. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses who were not fully vaccinated by the original October 15 deadline faced the prospect of being suspended.The “risk” to the healthcare system in Quebec is considered to be “too high” if the mid-October vaccine mandate sparks a crisis, fears provincial health minister Christian Dubé. According to CBC News, in remarks in French on Wednesday, he said, “We want to apply mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers, but not at the expense of our ability to treat citizens.”While over 90% of healthcare workers in Quebec are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, around 22,000 who have taken only one dose or none are liable for suspension under new vaccine mandates.Unions representing healthcare workers have been opposing the measure, as has been the case at the federal level, where the deadline for enforcement is on October 30. The federal vaccine mandates, championed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, are piecemeal and do not cover all employees such as the Canadian Armed Forces, which is exempted from compulsory jabs against Covid-19. However, a face-off is still looming as the date of enforcement nears.The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), which represents 215,000 central government employees, has contested the expected implementation and said it will “continue to represent unvaccinated members who have punitive action taken against them as a result of their vaccination status”. Similarly, the National Police Federation, which represents Royal Canadian Mounted Police personnel, had asserted it will “continue to support members’ access to [Covid-19] vaccines, and their choice to be vaccinated or not”.NO COVID-19 CASES ON DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM INDIA In another development, over a fortnight following the lifting of a five-month-long ban on direct passenger flights from India to Canada, no Covid-19 cases have been reported among those who have flown in since, according to data from Public Health Agency of Canada.The ban, first imposed in April, was originally aimed at curbing the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Canada when a devastating second wave was at its peak in India. However, it was then renewed several times and testing requirements for those flying in to Canada via other countries were put in place. Those measures were kept in place even as Canada opened up for all fully vaccinated travellers before finally lifting the ban on September 27.Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, tracking incidence of infections on international flights, shows that no cases have been reported so far from direct flights originating from India, either operated by Air Canada or Air India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-quebec-postpones-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-fearing-healthcare-crisis-101634190404458.html

Also known as ‘World Eye Day’ or ‘World Vision Day’, the occasion is an international day of awareness to focus attention on and encouraging everyone to think about the importance of their own eye health.World Sight Day: HistoryWorld Sight Day (WSD) is coordinated by the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB). The day began to be officially observed as an IAPB event in the year 2000 and has been marked in several different ways in nations across the world each year since then. The Queen of the United Kingdom joined the awareness campaign for World Sight Day in the year 2020, marking a milestone in recognition.World Sight Day: SignificanceEye health impacts education, employment, quality of life, poverty and so many other sustainable development goals. “This WSD we want organisations and the public to come together to encourage governments, corporations, institutions and individuals to actively support universal access to eye health and ensure that everyone counts,” the IAPB wrote in an official post.World Sight Day is supported by over 150 IAPB member organisations, including every major eye care NGO in the world, apex professional bodies for ophthalmology and optometry, teaching hospitals and corporations, united in working together to eliminate avoidable blindness and visual impairment.World Sight Day: EventsEvery year, hundreds of activities are planned and executed on World Sight Day. This year, for World Sight Day 2021, the IAPB pledged to work with members and partners to deliver some “high-impact events of our own” with the World Sight Day Global Challenge.On World Sight Day 2021, the IAPB has taken out a ‘social media toolkit’ to address issues of eye health around the world. “We want to tell everyone to #LoveYourEyes, and get 1 million people to have a sight test or care for their eyes,” the toolkit explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-sight-day-2021-history-significance-and-how-to-raise-awareness-101634187152209.html
14-10-2021||World||37-year-old Danish man suspected to be behind bow and arrow attack in Norway||A 37-year-old Danish citizen is suspected of killing five people in a bow-and-arrow attack in the Norwegian town of Kongsberg in a rare incident of mass killing in Norway, police said on Thursday.Two people, including an off-duty police officer, were wounded in the Wednesday evening attacks, which took place in different locations in the town, 68 km (42 miles) southwest of the capital, Oslo."This very serious situation is of course making a deep impression on Kongsberg and those who live here," district police chief Oeyvind Aas said in a statement.The suspect, who was apprehended, was believed to have been acting alone, police said. They said nothing about a possible motive.Several of the attacks were committed with a bow and arrow, Aas said late on Wednesday, though police were also investigating whether other weapons were used.The death toll was the worst of any attack in Norway since 2011 when far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people, most of them teenagers at a youth camp.The police said they were giving information on the man's nationality after rumours swirled on social media about people not linked to the attacks.Norway's incoming prime minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, who is due to take power on Thursday after winning a general election last month, said he had been kept informed by the outgoing government."What we've learned from Kongsberg bears witness of a gruesome and brutal act," Stoere said in a statement to news agency NTB.The attacks went on for more than half an hour over a "large area" of Kongsberg, including at a Coop Extra grocery store, the Aftenposten newspaper cited police as saying.A woman living near the store said she had heard alarms as she was walking home."I saw a group of police officers, including one who held several arrows in his hand," the woman, Marit Hoefle, told the newspaper.Investigators are considering whether the attacks amounted to an act of terrorism and said they would give more details of the incident later on Thursday.Police were interrogating the suspect and he was cooperating, his defence lawyer said."He is cooperating and is giving detailed statements regarding this event," lawyer Fredrik Neumann told public broadcaster NRK.Images from one of the crime scenes showed an arrow that appeared to be stuck in the wall of a wood-paneled building.About 28,000 people live in the Kongsberg municipality.Following the attacks, the police directorate said it had ordered officers nationwide to carry firearms. Norwegian police are normally unarmed but officers have access to guns when needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/37yearold-danish-man-suspected-to-be-behind-bow-and-arrow-attack-in-norway-101634188138699.html

As the Covid-19 pandemic prompted school closings and disrupted classrooms last year, 415 children from elementary to high school age were recorded as having taken their own lives, according to the education ministry's survey.The number is up by nearly 100 from last year, the highest since record-keeping began in 1974, the Asahi newspaper reported on Thursday.Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding perceived shame or dishonour, and its suicide rate has long topped the Group of Seven nations, but a national effort brought numbers down by roughly 40 percent over 15 years, including 10 straight years of decline from 2009.Amid the pandemic, suicides increased in 2020 after a decade of declines, with the number of women committing suicide surging amid the emotional and financial stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic, although fewer men took their own lives.The education ministry said a record high of more than 196,127 school children were absent for 30 days or more, media reported.The results showed that changes in school and household environments due to the pandemic have had a huge impact on children's behaviour, NHK quoted an education ministry official as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-japan-battles-covid-19-child-suicide-rate-highest-in-over-40-years-report-101634181525575.html

Notably, the development comes days after the Afghan capital had in a similar fashion plunged into darkness amid reports that the country's new Taliban rulers have not yet paid Central Asian electricity suppliers or reinstituted the framework to collect money from consumers.The technical issues emerged in the northern Afghan province of Baghlan, Sputnik reported citing DABS. “The technical staff is working to resolve this issue as soon as possible,” the statement read.Why is electricity supply dwindling in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan?The newly anointed Taliban rulers, according to reports, are struggling with the non-payment of electricity dues to Central Asian electricity suppliers.Almost 80 per cent of the supply of Afghanistan's entire power consumption is imported from neighbouring countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. When the Taliban launched a lightning-fast offensive and seized Kabul from the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government, the outfit took over the state energy utility, also inheriting all its debts in the process. The new rulers, however, have failed to pay off the creditors due to a lack of funds and a framework to collect money from consumers.How does the Taliban plan to pay off the debt?Afghanistan's electricity body, now under Taliban control, is reportedly intending to sell off the estates of its debtors in a bid to pay the nearly $62 million worth of power bills to the central Asian countries. Safiullah Ahamdzai, the acting head of DABAS, told news agencies that the plan will be implemented, all debts will be paid off to prevent electricity exporting countries from cutting off the supply, and only then will Afghanistan enjoy uninterrupted power connection.However, a former head of DABS, Daud Noorzai, said earlier this month that in case the Taliban fail to implement the ‘plan’ and do not pay off the bills to the Central Asian energy suppliers, electricity supply to the Afghan capital province of Kabul could be cut off by winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blackout-in-kabul-did-taliban-fail-to-pay-electricity-suppliers-101634177392155.html

Both countries share a border with Afghanistan.Tajikistan's national security chief, Saimumin Yatimov, for his part told the video conference that he had registered an "intensification" of attempts to "smuggle drugs, weapons, ammunition" from Afghanistan into his country.Afghanistan has long been the world's largest producer of opium and heroin, with profits from the illicit trade helping fund the Taliban.Earlier Wednesday French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Tajikistan's leader Emomali Rakhmon in Paris, vowing to help the Central Asian state maintain stability.While the Taliban has said it does not pose a threat to Central Asian countries, the ex-Soviet republics in the region have previously been targeted by attacks attributed to allies of Afghan Islamists.Last week the Kremlin's envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said Russia will invite the Taliban to Moscow for international talks on Afghanistan scheduled for October 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-syria-militants-actively-entering-afghanistan-russia-s-putin-101634172176085.html

I'm looking at new studies, I already have the highest immunization, why would I get vaccinated?" the 66-year-old said late Tuesday night in an interview with Jovem Pan radio."It would be the same as betting 10 reais on the lottery to win two. It doesn't make sense."A coronavirus skeptic, Bolsonaro previously claimed the Pfizer vaccine could turn people into crocodiles due to secondary effects.Since contracting Covid-19 in July 2020, Bolsonaro has repeatedly claimed that tests have shown he has a large number of antibodies to fight the virus and thus does not need to be vaccinated, something experts dispute.Bolsonaro is also strongly opposed to the health passes, given to those that are vaccinated, required by some large Brazilian cities in order to access certain public spaces."For me, freedom comes before everything else. If a citizen doesn't want to get vaccinated, that's his right and that's the end of it," Bolsonaro told Jovem Pan.Almost 100 million of Brazil's 213 million population are entirely vaccinated against Covid-19, while another 50 million have had one dose.Last week, the country surpassed 600,000 deaths from Covid-19, the second-worst death toll in the world after the United States.Bolsonaro's refusal to get vaccinated has also solicited criticism from abroad, notably in September when he traveled to New York for the UN General Assembly.While there, he was photographed standing in a street eating pizza, something Brazilian press attributed to his being unable to enter restaurants due to being unvaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doesnt-make-sense-brazil-s-bolsonaro-decides-not-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid19-101634171899863.html

Eleven new deaths were recorded.Most new cases were detected in Melbourne, with the city now clearly at the centre of the country's Delta outbreak.Sydney, where the first case was detected in mid-June, continued a downward trend in new cases. Daily infections in New South Wales eased further to 406 on Thursday, the majority in Sydney, well down from the state's pandemic high of 1,599 hit in early September.Sydney could enjoy more freedoms from Monday, beating forecasts by a week, as the proportion of fully vaccinated people above 16 is expected to top 80% this weekend. The city came out of a lockdown of more than 100 days earlier this week.As Sydney and Melbourne aim to begin to live with COVID-19, some virus-free states have flagged they may delay their reopening plans even after higher vaccinations amid fears outbreaks could overwhelm hospitals.Officials are bracing for a spike in infections in Australia's two largest cities once tough restrictions end, but they hope higher vaccination rates will limit hospitalisations.Higher inoculation coverage among the most vulnerable populations has helped Australia to keep its death rate from the Delta flare-up lower than last year's outbreaks. Still, Delta has accounted for about 77% of the country's 136,000 cases. Total deaths stand at 1,495 since the pandemic began.Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday said Australia's medical regulator has allowed Pfizer to submit an application to allow five-to 11-year-olds to be vaccinated with its COVID-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-sees-record-daily-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101634168054966.html
