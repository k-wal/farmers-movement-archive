"Unquestionably it is making hate worse," she said.With a focus on the United States, the company was wilfully blind to its impact in many markets where a lack of local-language staff meant it often failed to understand the toxic or dangerous nature of messages on its platform, she said.The world's biggest social network has rejected the charges, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying earlier this month that it was deeply illogical to argue that Facebook deliberately pushed content that made people angry.Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has been accused by U.S. lawmakers of chasing higher profits while being cavalier about user safety.Britain is bringing forward laws that could fine social media companies up to 10% of their turnover if they fail to remove or limit the spread of illegal content."The events we're seeing around the world, things like Myanmar and Ethiopia, those are the opening chapters because engagement-based ranking does two things: one, it prioritises and amplifies divisive and polarising extreme content and two it concentrates it," Haugen said.Facebook, which operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users, declined to provide immediate comment in response to Haugen's committee appearance.Haugen in October told a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing that Facebook had devised ways to keep users scrolling even if it was detrimental to their wellbeing.She also said she provided the documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teenage girls. She compared the platform to addictive substances such as tobacco and opioids.British interior minister seeks tougher lawsBefore Monday's hearing, Haugen met the country's interior minister, Priti Patel, who advocates tougher legislation for tech platforms that fail to keep users safe.She is scheduled to speak at a major tech conference, the Web Summit, next week and in Brussels to European policymakers."Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety, and that's not acceptable," she said on Monday, singling out Instagram's impact on the mental health of some young users.Reuters, along with other news organisations, viewed documents released to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Haugen.They showed Facebook had known that it hadn't hired enough workers who possessed both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-will-fuel-further-unrest-whistleblower-tells-uk-parliament-101635181244043.html
25-10-2021||World||Two months on, EU mulls reopening diplomatic office in Afghanistan||More than two months after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, leading to the shutting down of the most diplomatic offices in the capital city Kabul, the European Union (EU) is planning to resume operations in the war-torn country.According to a report by UK newspaper Financial Times (FT), the 27-member bloc is likely to return to Kabul as the EU resumes engagement with the interim government of the Islamist militant group.A representative of the EU told FT that the bloc is adopting a “calibrated approach” to the Taliban wherein it is coordinating with the militant group without recognising their interim government in Afghanistan.The plan to reopen the diplomatic mission in Kabul stems from the EU’s belief that it needs to have a presence in Afghanistan to lobby for human rights’ protection, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and also to ensure the Taliban live up to their pledge of not letting the country once again become a safe haven for terrorists.According to the FT report, the diplomatic and security arm of the EU are planning to reopen a representative office in Kabul that would house its officials and can also be used by member states.A final decision on the reopening of the mission “has not been taken yet,” EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali said. “We can confirm that we are working on establishing a minimal presence on the ground. For security reasons, we cannot enter into the details,” she was quoted as saying by FT.She added that “available options” are currently being explored regarding who will guarantee the security of the EU staff in Afghanistan.The FT report further said the EU had sent an exploratory mission to Afghanistan last month to gauge the feasibility of sending diplomats back to the country.Earlier this month, the EU pledged 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in aid for Afghanistan in the bloc’s first in-person meeting with the Islamist militant group in Qatar. However, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the funds were meant for “direct support” for the Afghans and not the interim Taliban government. “We have been clear about our conditions for any engagement with the Afghan authorities, including on the respect of human rights,” she added.The Taliban have constantly been seeking recognition from the global community, even saying that non-acceptance of their government in Afghanistan is benefitting the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), which has carried out many attacks in the country since the withdrawal of the US and other foreign forces.The latest in the series of attacks was a suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Kandahar province that resulted in the death of more than 40 people and left 70 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-months-on-eu-mulls-reopening-diplomatic-office-in-afghanistan-101635177199503.html

The American biotechnology company said it plans to submit these data to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators in the coming days.Moderna is yet to receive emergency authorisation from the FDA for administering its Covid-19 vaccine in teens but has moved ahead to study lower doses in children while it waits for the nod. The randomised, observer-blind, and placebo-controlled study was conducted in 4,753 participants aged 6 to 12 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two 50 µg doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in children.“We are encouraged by the immunogenicity and safety profile of mRNA-1273 in children aged 6 to under 12 years and are pleased that the study met its primary immunogenicity endpoints,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.According to Moderna, the vaccine was “generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent” with the results of the Phase 3 trial in adolescents and adults. The company has reported mild or moderate severity in the majority of adverse events. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever, and injection site pain.The study has not been published in a peer-reviewed publication and the findings continue to be monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. In order to assess long-term protection and safety, the participants will be monitored for 12 months after their second dose.Meanwhile, the enrolment for the Phase 2/3 study in children aged 6 months to under 6 years of age continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-reports-robust-response-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-in-kids-aged-6-to-12-101635173965917.html

The violence against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh broke out on October 13 during the Durga Puja festivities after an alleged blasphemous post on social media. The mayhem continued for a few days and spread to other parts of the country.Also Read | Anatomy of planned desecration in BangladeshDuring one such incident, around 70 Hindu homes were torched in Rangpur, in Pirganj sub-district, on October 17, police said. The two accused men - Shaikat Mandal and his accomplice Rabiul Islam - were accused fanning communal hatred on social media and instigating the violence in Rangpur. They confessed to their crime in a pre-trial hearing on Monday.“Shaikat Mandal and his accomplice Rabiul Isam have admitted their role before a senior judicial magistrate Delwar Hossain in (north-western) Rangpur,” an official of the court told mediapersons.They were among the 693 people arrested by the Bangladesh Police in connection with the violence. Both the men were picked up from Gazipur on Friday in a police raid and booked under the Digital Security Act.Mandal was a philosophy department student of Rangpur's Carmichael College. He was expelled from the ruling Awami League's student wing Chhatra League after his arrest. Thirty-six-year-old Islam, meanwhile, is a cleric.A Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) official told bdnews24.com that Mandal uploaded objectionable content on Facebook to boost his follower count, while Islam instigated Muslims in the village through announcements on the loudspeaker.At least seven people have confessed to their crime under the pre-trial legal proceedings so far. More than 70 cases have been being filed against 24,000 suspects, most of whom were anonymous.The police said last week that they have identified the man who placed the Quran in one of the Durga Puja pandals in Comilla on October 13, which triggered violence and led to the killing of three people. He has been identified as 35-year-old Iqbal Hossain from Sujanagar area of the city and is under police custody.Dhaka watchers said there is a strong possibility that rabid Islamists belonging to Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, who are supporters of the Taliban, would be behind this orchestration of communal violence. The Sheikh Hasina government is trying to unearth the conspiracy and piece together the evidence, they added.The attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh have been widely condemned by the United Nations.Hindus constitute around 10 per cent of the Muslim-majority Bangladesh's 169 million population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-men-confess-to-inciting-bangladesh-violence-through-facebook-post-loudspeaker-101635173762131.html

The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a press conference that the programme will be rolled out in major Afghan towns and cities, with an aim to employ 40,000 men in Kabul alone, reported Dawn. The report suggests that the unemployed labourers who are most at risk of starvation will be offered wheat instead of money.“This is an important step for fighting unemployment,” Dawn quoted Zabihullah Mujahid as saying, adding that the labourers must “work hard”.A new UN report showed that nearly 19 million people in Afghanistan experienced high levels of acute food insecurity during the two months of the post-harvest season, a nearly 30% rise from the same period last year. The report also predicted that more than half the population of Afghanistan will face acute food insecurity from November 2021 to March 2022. Also Read | Taliban welcome Vladimir Putin's plan to remove them from terrorists' listThe collapse of public services, a severe economic crisis and increasing food prices were among the major reason for the food insecurity.”We cannot allow Afghanistan to be a collective failure – the international community must prevent the crisis from becoming a catastrophe,” the World Food Programme said in a statement.”Things were already desperate, and now continuing drought, escalating displacement, the collapse of public services, and a deepening economic crisis have driven the entire country to the precipice,” it added.Referring to the report, David Beasley, WFP executive director, highlighted that Afghanistan is now among the world’s worst humanitarian crises and food security has all but collapsed. He warned that millions of Afghans will be forced to choose between migration and starvation unless the UN agencies step up life-saving assistance and the economy is resuscitated.“We are on a countdown to catastrophe and if we don’t act now, we will have a total disaster on our hands,” Beasley added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-offers-wheat-in-exchange-for-labour-as-un-agency-warns-of-acute-food-crisis-101635166129779.html
25-10-2021||World||Ahead of resuming international flights, US to outline travel, vaccination rules. Details here||The Biden administration plans to unveil on Monday its detailed rules requiring nearly all foreign air visitors to be vaccinated against COVID-19 starting Nov. 8, sources told Reuters.The White House first disclosed on Sept. 20 it would remove restrictions in early November for fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries.The extraordinary U.S. travel restrictions were first imposed in early 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19. The rules bar most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen countries in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.The White House plans to outline the legal framework requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for most foreign air travelers replacing the current restrictions, as well as rules for exemptions from the requirements.The Biden administration will also detail requirements airlines must follow to confirm foreign travelers have been vaccinated before boarding U.S.-bound flights.The White House announced on Oct. 15 that the new vaccine rules would take effect on Nov. 8.One concern among U.S. officials and airlines is making sure foreign travelers are aware of the new vaccine rules that will take effect in just two weeks.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to issue new contact tracing rules requiring airlines to collect information from international air passengers. The White House said earlier airlines will provide the information "upon request to follow up with travelers who have been exposed to COVID-19 variants or other pathogens."The CDC said this month it would accept any vaccine authorized for use by U.S. regulators or the World Health Organization from travelers.The new rules are expected to exempt minor children from the vaccine requirements, the sources said.The Biden administration has also been discussing initially exempting citizens of a small number of countries with extremely low vaccination rates because of a lack of access to COVID-19 vaccines, the sources said, saying that would include enhanced testing requirements.Foreign air travelers will need to provide vaccination documentation from an "official source" and airlines must confirm the last dose was at least two weeks earlier than the travel date.International air travelers will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure. The White House said in September unvaccinated Americans will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 24 hours of departing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-resuming-international-flights-us-to-outline-travel-vaccination-rules-details-here-101635160072422.html
25-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Beijing cancels marathon, restricts entry-exit||China on Monday indefinitely postponed the annual Beijing marathon scheduled to be held later this month as it fights a country-wide surge in Covid-19 cases including in the capital.Beijing authorities also restricted entry to the city on Monday, and sent out directives asking citizens not to leave unless necessary.“The epidemic situation is severe and complex, and the epidemic risk and prevention pressure faced by the capital continue to increase,” a Beijing official said on Monday.Organisers of Beijing’s marathon said in a statement on Sunday that the run would be postponed until further notice “…in order to prevent the risk of the epidemic spreading (and) effectively protect the health and safety of the majority of runners, staff and residents.”More than 30,000 people were expected to take part in the event on October 31.A marathon in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the first Covid-19 cases were detected in 2019-end, was cancelled on Sunday.The China-Mongolia border city of Ejin Banner, a region hit hard in the latest coronavirus flare-up, told all residents and tourists on Monday that they must stay indoors to prevent the spread of the outbreak.The Chinese mainland on Sunday reported 35 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the national health commission said in its daily report on Monday, taking the total number of cases over 160 in the new outbreak, which has now spread to 11 provinces.All of them are said to be the highly transmissible Delta variant.The latest outbreak, said to have been triggered by tour groups travelling out of the northern autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, comes as the country’s top health official warned of more cases.Authorities have suspended inter-provincial tour groups in five areas where cases have been detected, including Beijing.There is increasing risk that the outbreak might spread further, helped by “seasonal factors”, Mi Feng, spokesman at the National Health Commission, said on Sunday.It’s likely to have raised concerns over China’s ability to maintain its zero-tolerance approach to the virus, especially leading up to the 2022 Winter Olympics, slated to begin on February 4, to be held in and around Beijing.Despite the small numbers reported in the recent outbreaks, China has stuck to a zero-Covid strategy by implementing lockdowns, mass testing of populations, at times more than once, and mass vaccination drives, the largest in the world.Health authorities said on Sunday that about 75.6% of China’s 1.4bn population had received complete vaccine doses as of October 23, or some 1.068bn.Mainland China has reported more than 96,700 cases until Sunday and the number of deaths is at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-beijing-cancels-marathon-restricts-entryexit-101635160206764.html
25-10-2021||World||Sudan Prime Minister Hamdok held in apparent coup; general declares emergency||Sudan’s leading general declared a state of emergency Monday, hours after his forces arrested the acting prime minister and disrupted the internet in an apparent coup as the country was nearing a planned transition to a civilian leadership.In a televised address, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan announced that he was dissolving the country’s ruling Sovereign Council, as well as the government led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. He said quarrels among political factions prompted the military to intervene but he pledged to complete the country's democratic transition, saying a new technocrat government would lead Sudan to elections.In response to the moves, thousands flooded the streets of the capital, Khartoum, and its twin city of Omdurman to protest the apparent military takeover. Footage shared online appeared to show protesters blocking streets and setting fire to tires as security forces used tear gas to disperse them.Protesters could be heard chanting, “The people are stronger, stronger” and “Retreat is not an option!” as plumes of smoke filled the air. Videos on social media showed large crowds crossing bridges over the Nile to the center of the capital.At least 12 protesters were wounded in demonstrations, according to the Sudanese Doctors Committee, without giving details.A takeover by the military would be a major setback for Sudan, which has grappled with a stop-and-go transition to democracy since long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled by mass protests two years ago.The moves come less than a month before Burhan was expected to hand the leadership of the ruling transitional council to a civilian. The Sovereign Council, which has run the country since shortly after al-Bashir’s ouster, includes both military and civilian members, who have frequently disagreed over Sudan’s course and the pace of the transition to democracy.The United States and the European Union expressed concern over Monday’s developments.Jeffrey Feltman, the U.S. special envoy to the Horn of Africa, said Washington was “deeply alarmed” by the reports. Feltman met with Sudanese officials over the weekend in an effort to resolve the growing dispute between civilian and military leaders. EU foreign affairs chief Joseph Borrell tweeted that he’s following events with the “utmost concern.”The first reports about a possible military takeover began trickling out of Sudan before dawn Monday. By mid-morning, the Information Ministry confirmed that the prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, had been arrested and taken to an undisclosed location. Several senior government figures were also detained, the ministry said in a Facebook post. It said their whereabouts were unknown.Hamdok’s office said in a statement on Facebook that he and his wife were detained early Monday as part of what it described as a “complete coup.”In other hallmarks of a takeover, internet access was widely disrupted and the country’s state news channel played patriotic traditional music. At one point, military forces stormed the offices of Sudan’s state-run television in Omdurman and detained a number of workers, the Information Ministry said.Monday’s apparent takeover came after weeks of rising tensions between Sudan’s civilian and military leaders. A failed coup attempt in September fractured the country along old lines, pitting more conservative Islamists who want a military government against those who toppled al-Bashir in protests. In recent days, both camps have taken to the street in demonstrations.After the September coup attempt, the generals lashed out at civilian members of the transitional power structure and called for the dissolution of Hamdok’s government. The Sovereign Council is the ultimate decision maker, though the Hamdok government is tasked with running Sudan’s day-to-day affairs.Burhan, who leads the council, warned in televised comments last month that the military would hand over power only to a government elected by the Sudanese people. His comments suggested he might not stick to the previously agreed timetable, which called for the council to be led by a military figure for 21 months, followed by a civilian for the following 18 months. Under that plan, the handover was to take place sometime in November, with the new civilian leader to be chosen by an alliance of unions and political parties that led the uprising against al-Bashir.Since al-Bashir was forced from power, Sudan had slowly emerged from years of international pariah status. The country was removed from the United States’ state supporter of terror list in 2020, opening the door for badly needed foreign loans and investment. But the country’s economy has struggled with the shock of a number economic reforms called for by international lending institutions.Sudan has suffered other coups since it gained its independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956. Al-Bashir came to power in 1989 in one such takeover, which removed the country’s last elected government.Among those detained Monday were five senior government figures, according to two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share information with the media.They include Industry Minister Ibrahim al-Sheikh, Information Minister Hamza Baloul, and Mohammed al-Fiky Suliman, a member of the Sovereign Council, as well as Faisal Mohammed Saleh, a media adviser to Hamdok. Ayman Khalid, governor of the state containing the capital, was also arrested, according to the official Facebook page of his office.After news of the arrests spread, the country’s main pro-democracy group and two political parties issued appeals to the Sudanese to take to the streets.One of the factions, the Communist Party called on workers to go on strike in an act of mass civil disobedience after what it described as a “full military coup” orchestrated by Burhan.The African Union has called for the release of all Sudanese political leaders including Hamdok. “Dialogue and consensus is the only relevant path to save the country and its democratic transition,” said Moussa Faki, the head of the AU commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-prime-minister-hamdok-held-in-apparent-coup-general-declares-emergency-101635158632443.html
25-10-2021||World||German IS bride sentenced to 10 years over Yazidi girl murder||A Munich court on Monday sentenced a German woman who joined the Islamic State group to 10 years in prison over the war crime of letting a five-year-old Yazidi "slave" girl die of thirst in the sun.Presiding judge Reinhold Baier of the superior regional court in the southern German city handed down the verdict to Jennifer Wenisch, 30, in one of the first convictions anywhere in the world related to the Islamic State group's persecution of the Yazidi community.Wenisch was found guilty of "two crimes against humanity in the form of enslavement", as well as aiding and abetting the girl's killing by failing to offer help and membership of a terrorist organisation.Wenisch and her IS husband "purchased" a Yazidi woman and child as household "slaves", whom they held captive while living in then IS-occupied Mosul, Iraq, in 2015, the court found."After the girl fell ill and wet her mattress, the husband of the accused chained her up outside as punishment and let the child die an agonising death of thirst in the scorching heat," prosecutors said during the trial."The accused allowed her husband to do so and did nothing to save the girl."Wenisch's husband, Taha al-Jumailly, is also facing trial in separate proceedings in Frankfurt, where the verdict is due in late November.Identified only by her first name Nora, the Yazidi girl's mother has repeatedly testified in both Munich and Frankfurt about the torment allegedly visited on her child.- Morality police -The defence had claimed the mother's testimony is untrustworthy and said there was no proof that the girl, who was taken to hospital after the incident, actually died.Wenisch's lawyers had called for her to receive just a two-year suspended sentence for supporting a terrorist organisation.When asked during the trial about her failure to save the girl, Wenisch said she was "afraid" that her husband would "push her or lock her up".At the close of the trial, according to the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, she claimed she was being "made an example of for everything that has happened under IS".According to other media reports, Wenisch converted to Islam in 2013 and travelled the following year via Turkey and Syria to Iraq where she joined IS.Recruited in mid-2015 to the group's self-styled hisbah morality police, she patrolled city parks in IS-occupied Fallujah and Mosul.Armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, a pistol and an explosives vest, her task was to ensure strict IS rules on dress code, public behaviour and bans on alcohol and tobacco.In January 2016, she visited the German embassy in Ankara to apply for new identity papers. When she left the mission, she was arrested and extradited days later to Germany.Wenisch's trial, which began in April 2019, is one of the first examples of court proceedings over the Islamic State group's brutal treatment of Yazidis.- Universal jurisdiction -A Kurdish-speaking group hailing from northern Iraq, the Yazidis were specifically targeted and oppressed by the jihadists beginning in 2015.Prominent London-based human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who has been involved in a campaign for IS crimes against the Yazidi to be recognised as a "genocide", was part of the team representing the Yazidi girl's mother.Germany has charged several German and foreign nationals with war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out abroad, using the legal principle of universal jurisdiction which allows crimes to be prosecuted even if they were committed in a foreign country.A handful of female suspects are among those who have appeared in the dock.In November 2020, a German woman named as Nurten J. was charged with crimes against humanity allegedly committed while she was living in Syria as a member of Islamic State.In October 2020, another German court sentenced the German-Tunisian wife of a rapper-turned-jihadist to three-and-a-half years in prison for having taken part in the enslavement of a Yazidi girl in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-is-bride-sentenced-to-10-years-over-yazidi-girl-murder-101635153294747.html

25-10-2021||World||Saudi dissident claims MBS talked about using 'poison ring' to kill King||A Saudia Arabian dissident has claimed that crown prince Mohammed bin Salman once boasted about killing the kingdom's former monarch. Saad al-Jabri made the claim on CBS News' "60 Minutes" programme, which aired on Sunday.Al-Jabri did not provide evidence on the news programme, but this is among the several unproven allegations he has made against the Saudi crown prince. Speaking to CBS News later, Saudi authorities described him as "a discredited former government official".Al-Jabri now resides in Canada. He claimed that in 2014 meeting with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was head of intelligence as interior minister at the time, MBS (as the crown prince is popularly known) boasted that he could kill King Abdullah. At the time, Prince Mohammed held no senior role in government but was serving as gatekeeper to the royal court of his father, at the time still heir to the throne."He told him 'I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hand(s) with him and he will be done'," Al-Jabri said, claiming that Saudi intelligence took the threat seriously. The issue was handled within the royal family, al-Jabri said.A video recording of that meeting still exists, he claimed.King Salman ascended to the throne in January 2015 after his half-brother, King Abdullah, died of a lung infection at a hospital. It was later declared that the death was due to natural causes.Al-Jabri has in the past accused MBS of plotting to kill him weeks after the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. An assessment by the US officials claimed that Khashoggi was killed in an operation approved by the Saudi crown prince.A short, silent clip was shown to "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley. The video, al-Jabri said, could be released if he's killed. He described Prince Mohammed as "a psychopath, killer."The killing of KhashoggiSaudi critic Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Turkey in October 2018.After recordings from inside the consulate were leaked by Turkish authorities, the Saudis claimed it had been an effort meant to forcibly bring Khashoggi back to the country, and that it went awry.The crown prince denied any knowledge of the operation, despite a US intelligence assessment to the contrary.This is al-Jabri's first on-record interview since his son Omar al-Jabri, 23, and daughter Sarah al-Jabri, 21, were detained in March 2020 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Human Rights Watch says the arrest of family members is an apparent effort to coerce al-Jabri to return to Saudi Arabia.A Saudi court sentenced his son and daughter to nine and six-and-a-half years in prison, respectively, for money laundering and unlawfully attempting to flee Saudi Arabia, according to the rights group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-dissident-claims-mbs-talked-about-using-poison-ring-to-kill-king-101635146194728.html

He had abused his power to seek benefits for others and received a huge amount of gifts and money in return, it said.Yin had violated the party’s disciplinary standards on politics, organisation, clean governance and life, and is suspected of taking bribes, the statement said.He did not show “signs of restraint” even after the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012 when President Xi Jinping replaced Hu Jintao as CPC general secretary.“Born in 1956, he (Yin) was the deputy general manager of China South Industries Group Co in 2002, and later served as the deputy general manager of Norinco in 2010, then as the chairman from 2013. Yin Jiaxu retired in 2018,” a state media report said.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which tracks the global defence industry, said in its December report that Norinco was the ninth-largest arms company in the world and third-largest in China, after Aviation Industry Corporation of China and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation.President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign has netted several senior officials including those in the defence industry since it was launched during his first term in 2013.In January, it was announced that the former chief of China’s multi-billion aircraft carrier programme and head of one of the largest shipping companies, Hu Wenming, would be arrested on charges of corruption.Hu Wenming was expelled from the CPC in 2020 for severely violating party discipline and being suspected of taking bribes and misfeasance.Xi’s long-running anti-graft crackdown has targeted millions of officials including hundreds of senior officials, who are often referred to as “tigers” while the relatively minor ones are called “flies”.There has been speculation that the campaign has been used to target Xi Jinping’s political opponents and critics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchief-of-china-s-arms-giant-norinco-group-arrested-for-graft-101635139865082.html

Sudanese state TV broadcast as normal.A Reuters witness saw joint forces from the military and from the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces stationed in the streets in Khartoum.Sudan has been on edge since a failed coup plot last month unleashed bitter recriminations between military and civilian groups meant to be sharing power following the 2019 ouster of former leader Omar al-Bashir.Bashir was toppled and jailed after months of street protests. A political transition agreed after his ouster has seen Sudan emerge from its isolation under three decades of rule by Bashir and was meant to lead to elections by the end of 2023..The Reuters witness said military and paramilitary forces deployed across the capital, Khartoum, restricting civilians' movements, as protesters carrying the national flag burnt tires in different parts of the city.The information ministry said on its Facebook page that a number of ministers and civilian members of the ruling Sovereign Council were arrested.Khartoum airport was shut and international flights were suspended, according to Dubai-based al-Arabiya TV channel.Citing unidentified sources, Saudi-owned, Dubai-based Al Hadath said Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok had been placed under house arrest, and that unidentified military forces arrested four cabinet ministers, one civilian member of the Sovereign Council, and several state governors and party leaders.Family sources told Reuters that military forces had stormed the house of Hamdok's media adviser and arrested him.Reuters witnesses said internet services appeared to be down in Khartoum.The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a main activist coalition in the uprising against Bashir, called on supporters to mobilise after what it called the arrest of cabinet members."We urge the masses to go out on the streets and occupy them, close all roads with barricades, stage a general labour strike, and not to cooperate with the putschists and use civil disobedience to confront them," the group said in a statement on Facebook.As tensions built this month, a coalition of rebel groups and political parties aligned themselves with the military and called on it to dissolve the civilian government, staging a sit-in outside the presidential palace.Last week, several cabinet ministers took part in big protests in several parts of Khartoum and other cities against the prospect of military rule.The military head of the Sovereign Council has previously asserted his commitment to the transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-cabinet-members-pro-govt-party-leaders-arrested-in-apparent-coup-report-101635138777989.html

Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed announced on Sunday that the cases against the TLP protesters will be dropped by Wednesday.Ahmed's announcement came after hundreds of TLP workers took to the streets across the country to exert pressure on the government for the release of Rizvi. The minister said the ban on TLP will also be reviewed in the days to come. ARY News reported that the announcement was made after an eight-hour-long meeting between Rizvi and the Imran Khan government.Rizvi was detained by the Punjab government on April 12 for “maintenance of public order (MPO)”. He was initially detained for three months and then again under the anti-terrorist Act on July 10.According to the Dawn newspaper, the interior minister addressed a press conference after leading a government team in negotiations with the TLP's representatives, including its detained chief, in Islamabad. “We have released 350 TLP workers up to now and we are still waiting to open both sides of road of Muridke as per the decision with the TLP,” Rashid tweeted later.

It is in our hands. We have all the tools we need: effective public health tools and effective medical tools. But the world has not used those tools well. With almost 50,000 deaths a week, the pandemic is far from over," Tedros said in his address to the World Health Summit in Berlin on Sunday, according to news agency ANI.The world body chief also urged G20 countries having vaccinated 40 per cent of their population to actively engage in the Covax mechanism and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT). Covax and ACT aim to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines for every country in the world, according to the WHO website.Ghebreyesus appeal came after UN secretary general Antonio Guterres also called on the G20 countries to help collect $8 billion to ensure a fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines around the world.Addressing the World Health Summit, Gutteres said that he joined the WHO chief earlier to launch a global strategy for Covid-19 vaccination, which suggests a credible and cost-effective plan to deliver vaccines to 40 per cent of people in all countries by the end of this year and 70 per cent by mid-2022.According to data published by the Worldmeters website on Monday, as many as 244,427,410 Covid-19 cases have been registered across the world so far. It also showed that at least 4,963,752 people have lost their lives to the viral disease and the number of recoveries stands at 221,451,949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-far-from-over-will-end-when-who-chief-s-word-of-caution-101635130596293.html
25-10-2021||World||China locks down county with over 35k residents amid Covid delta outbreak||China locked down a county that has seen the most Covid-19 cases in the country’s latest delta outbreak, as an initial flareup in the northwest quickly spirals into a nationwide surge.Ejin, a county in northwestern China’s Inner Mongolia, has asked its 35,700 residents to stay home from Monday and warned of civil and criminal liabilities should anyone disobey the order, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing a local government statement. The small county bordering Mongolia is the current outbreak’s hotspot, home to nearly one-third of the more than 150 infections found over the past week in the mainland.The lockdown came a day after a warning from National Health Commission officials that the outbreak would continue to worsen after spreading to 11 provinces in about a week. China reported 38 Covid infections on Monday, half of which were found in Inner Mongolia.The capital Beijing -- which has seen a dozen new cases traced back to the northwest -- has all but banned entry by people arriving from anyplace in the country that’s reported having local Covid cases. People who have to visit Beijing from such areas must provide a Covid test conducted no longer than two days earlier, and undergo two weeks of unspecified health monitoring.Meanwhile, provinces with a handful of cases -- including Beijing; Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Ningxia in the northwest; and Guizhou, in the southwest, have been banned from conducting cross-country travel tours. All train services around China related to tourism have also been halted, as the current outbreak has seen the virus spread quickly among tour groups. The escalating curbs underscore the challenge even China’s formidable Covid restrictions face in controlling the highly-contagious delta variant. The country is the only nation in the world still seeking to eliminate local transmission of the virus at a time when other so-called Covid-Zero stalwarts -- from Singapore to Australia -- have pivoted to treating it as endemic.China has managed to quash a slew of flareups since delta first breached its tight border controls in May. One in July and August eventually spread to half of China, forcing authorities to cut transport from hotspots and test local populations multiple times to bring infections back to zero -- only to see new flares emerge.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-locks-down-county-with-over-35k-residents-amid-covid-delta-outbreak-101635128749635.html
25-10-2021||World||As Covid cases surge in Germany, questions on extension of state of emergency||Germany is currently facing an increased spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), prompting calls to extend the nationwide state of emergency, which will end next month.Germany recorded the highest single-day spike since mid-May on Saturday after 15,145 people were detected as Covid-19 positive.On Sunday, 11,411 new cases were reported, pushing the caseload to 4,476,078, according to worldometers.com. The total cases include 95,794 deaths, 4,206,400 recoveries and 173,884 active cases.According to a report by the New York Times, infections in Germany have increased by 57 per cent in the last two weeks, while deaths have increased by 11 per cent.Will the state of emergency extend?Amid the worsening pandemic situation in Germany, leaders of the country’s 16 states are discussing how to proceed after the state of emergency ends on November 25. According to news agency Reuters, restrictions will automatically expire after this date unless they are extended by a parliamentary vote.In general, all 16 states have made the wearing of masks compulsory in stores and while travelling on public transport. Since August, visitors to Germany have to present proof of vaccination, recovery from Covid-19 or a recent negative test for entry to indoor public spaces such as restaurants, salons and gyms, the New York Times report also said. The same rules are applicable to all citizens.German health minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday that it will be possible to lift the state of emergency while upholding the above rules till next spring. Health minister Spahn also said that Germany can deal with a higher number of Covid-19 cases because of the higher number of vaccinations.“We can obviously deal with higher incidences, higher numbers of infections better, much better without overburdening the health system because so many are already vaccinated,” Spahn said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.As many as 66 per cent of the German population is fully vaccinated against the viral disease. However, states such as Saxony and Thuringia have a lower vaccination rate and hospitals are being overburdened with a rising number of cases, the health minister also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-cases-surge-in-germany-questions-on-extension-of-state-of-emergency-101635124113183.html
25-10-2021||World||China expects new Covid-19 outbreak to worsen in coming days||China’s new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the epidemic may continue to expand, a health official said.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant from overseas, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing Sunday. The wave of infections spread to 11 provinces in the week from Oct. 17, Mi Feng, spokesman for the commission, said at the briefing. Most of the people infected have cross-region travel histories, Mi said. He urged areas that have been affected by the pandemic to adopt “emergency mode.” Some cities in the provinces of Gansu -- including its capital Lanzhou -- and Inner Mongolia have halted bus and taxi services because of the virus, according to Zhou Min, an official at the transport ministry. Ejina, a county in the western part of Inner Mongolia, asked all residents and travelers to stay indoors starting Monday to contain the spread of coronavirus, the local government said in a statement.China reported 26 new local confirmed Covid-19 infections on Saturday, including seven in Inner Mongolia, six in Gansu, six in Ningxia, four in Beijing, one in Hebei, one in Hunan and one in Shaanxi, according to the National Health Commission. Another four local asymptomatic cases were reported in Hunan and Yunnan.The spread of the delta variant in Asia is slowing efforts by governments to re-open their economies. Singapore announced Saturday that only employees who are fully vaccinated, or have recovered from Covid-19 in the past 270 days, can return to the workplace from Jan. 1. The government last week extended other virus restrictions for another month because cases continue to rise even with more than 84% of the population fully vaccinated.Beijing Restricts Tourism; Singapore Work Access: Virus UpdateIn China’s capital city of Beijing, the epidemic has expanded to three districts including Haidian, a scientific hub, Pang Xinghuo, vice head of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said at a briefing Sunday. Five new confirmed local Covid cases and an asymptomatic one were reported between Saturday midday to Sunday 3 p.m., Pang said.Beijing will cancel a marathon originally scheduled for Oct. 31 due to the virus, the Beijing Daily reported. People in cities where infections have been found are banned from visiting or returning to the capital at present, the newspaper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expects-new-covid-19-outbreak-to-worsen-in-coming-days-101635122106269.html

25-10-2021||World||UK announces £6 bn health spending ahead of key budget||The British government will provide an extra £6 billion to its National Health Service to tackle backlogs built up during the pandemic, finance minister Rishi Sunak will announce in this week's budget.All eyes will be on Sunak Wednesday as he outlines the government's tax and spending plans for the next year.He is grappling with a range of problems thrown up by the pandemic and lockdowns, with many anticipating tax hikes to deal with record borrowing.Sunak told the BBC on Sunday that the country would have to wait until Wednesday to find out his tax plans. But his office released details of the £6 billion ($8.25 billion, seven billion euros) health fund for patients waiting for diagnostic tests and non-emergency operations. Part of the funding will go towards creating 100 "one-stop-shop" diagnostic centres across England to catch life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Sunak called it a "game-changing investment... to make sure we have the right buildings, equipment and systems to get patients the help they need."The minister will also announce a £5 billion fund for innovative health-related projects, according to his office.Health Minister Sajid Javid said the investment would add to coronavirus treatments and vaccines developed in the UK to battle the pandemic. "The new investment will build on this success by accelerating the discovery of ground-breaking medicines and technologies," he said.But the big-spending plans have raised questions about where the debt-wracked government is going to find the money, with free-marketers within Sunak's Conservative Party concerned that it will come from tax rises.The country is also suffering from high inflation and supply shortages, blamed on the pandemic and Brexit.Sunak on Sunday told Sky News that high employment levels were a sign that the government's "plan for jobs is working". But he conceded supply shortages and high energy prices were squeezing household budgets.Labour's Rachel Reeves, the shadow finance minister, took aim at her counterpart for not doing enough to ease the burden."Our priority would be easing the cost-of-living price crisis, helping businesses who have had a torrid 18 months," she told Sky News.jwp/jv||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-6-bn-health-spending-ahead-of-key-budget-101635111695542.html

She died shortly after the incident Thursday in New Mexico.Director Joel Souza, 48, who was crouching behind her as they lined up a shot, was wounded and hospitalized, then released.Police are still investigating the shooting, which sparked intense speculation on social media about how such an accident could have occurred despite detailed and long-established gun safety protocols for film sets.A petition on the website change.org calling for a ban on live firearms on film sets and better working conditions for crews had gathered more than 18,000 signatures by Sunday afternoon. "There is no excuse for something like this to happen in the 21st century," says the text of the petition launched by Bandar Albuliwi, a screenwriter and director. Dave Cortese, a Democrat elected to the California Senate, put out a statement on Saturday saying, "There is an urgent need to address alarming work abuses and safety violations occurring on the set of theatrical productions, including unnecessary high-risk conditions such as the use of live firearms."He said he intends to push a bill banning live ammunition on movie sets in California.The hit Los Angeles police drama "The Rookie" decided the day after the shooting to ban all live ammunition from its set, effective immediately, according to industry publication The Hollywood Reporter. But some industry professionals said the use of weapons on film was not the problem.Movie armorer SL Huang, writing on Twitter, said she had worked on hundreds of film sets without incident, thanks to the stringent safety protocols and the built-in redundancies."A tragedy happening in *this particular* way defies everything I know about how we treat guns on film sets," she wrote."My colleagues and I have been trying to figure out how this could happen when following our basic safety procedures and we keep ending at a loss. "Which implies... that very basic, very standard safety procedures may not have been followed. And that nobody shut the production down when they weren't."Baldwin, who has spoken of his heartbreak after the killing, is cooperating with the police investigation.The probe has focused on the specialist in charge of the weapon and the assistant director who handed it to Baldwin, according to an affidavit seen by AFP. rle/seb/st/sw/hg/bfm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calls-to-ban-guns-on-movie-sets-grow-after-alec-baldwin-shooting-101635111758788.html
25-10-2021||World||Archaeologists in Iraq find ancient wine press, carvings||Archaeologists in Iraq revealed Sunday their discovery of a large-scale wine factory from the rule of the Assyrian kings 2,700 years ago, along with stunning monumental rock-carved royal reliefs.The stone bas-reliefs, showing kings praying to the gods, were cut into the walls of a nearly nine-kilometre-long (5.5-mile) irrigation canal at Faida in northern Iraq, the joint team of archaeologists from the Department of Antiquities in Dohuk and colleagues from Italy said.The carvings, 12 panels measuring five metres (16 feet) wide and two metres tall, show gods, kings and sacred animals. They date from the reigns of Sargon II (721-705 BC) and his son Sennacherib."There are other places with rock reliefs in Iraq, especially in Kurdistan, but none are so huge and monumental as this one," said Italian archaeologist Daniele Morandi Bonacossi."The scenes represent the Assyrian king praying in front the Assyrian gods," he said, noting that the seven key gods are all seen, including Ishtar, the goddess of love and war, who is depicted on top of a lion.Ancient 'propaganda scene'The irrigation canal was cut into limestone to carry water from the hills to the fields of farmers, and the carvings were made to remind people of the king who ordered its construction."It was not only a religious scene of prayer, it was also political, a sort of propaganda scene," Morandi Bonacossi added."The king, in this way, wanted to show to the people living in the area that he was the one who has created these massive irrigation systems, so... the people should remember this and remain loyal."At Khinis, also near Dohuk, the team unearthed giant stone basins cut into white rock that were used in commercial wine-making during the reign of Sennacherib, in the late 8th or early 7th century BC."It was a sort of industrial wine factory," said Morandi Bonacossi, professor of Near Eastern archaeology at Italy's University of Udine, adding this was the first such discovery in Iraq."We have found 14 installations, that were used to press the grapes and extract the juice, which was then processed into wine."Some of the most famous carvings that have survived from the Assyrian period are the mythical winged bulls, with examples of the monumental reliefs seen in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, as well as the Louvre in Paris and the British Museum in London.Iraq was the birthplace of some of the world's earliest cities. As well as Assyrians it was once home to Sumerians and Babylonians, and to among humankind's first examples of writing.But it is also now a location for smugglers of ancient artifacts.Looters decimated the country's ancient past, including after the 2003 US-led invasion.Then, from 2014 and 2017, the Islamic State group demolished dozens of pre-Islamic treasures with bulldozers, pickaxes and explosives. They also used smuggling to finance their operations.However, some countries are slowly returning stolen items.Earlier this year, the United States returned about 17,000 artifacts to Iraq, pieces that mostly dated from the Sumerian period around 4,000 years ago.Last month, a 3,500-year-old tablet recounting the epic of Gilgamesh was returned to Iraq after being stolen three decades ago and illegally imported to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/archaeologists-in-iraq-find-ancient-wine-press-carvings-101635111909017.html
25-10-2021||World||Thousands of migrants continue to walk through southern Mexico||A group of about 2,000 mainly Central American migrants continued their mass trek from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula on Sunday, reaching a town about 16 miles (26 kilometers) away.Migrants started out before dawn to avoid the burning heat. Mostly from Honduras and El Salvador, many were accompanied by small children. By midday on the second day of their march, they reached the town of Huehuetan, in southern Chiapas state.Unlike previous marches, the one that started Saturday from Tapachula did not include as many Haitian migrants, thousands of whom reached the US border around Del Rio, Texas, in September.Tens of thousands of migrants from Honduras, El Salvador and Haiti have been waiting in Tapachula, near the Guatemalan border, for refugee or asylum papers that might allow them to travel, but have grown tired of delays in the process.Mexico requires migrants applying for humanitarian visas or asylum to remain in the border state of Chiapas, next to Guatemala, for their cases to be processed.Anthony Beltrandez, a Cuban who left his country in 2018 to go to Uruguay, had been waiting for 1 1/2 months in Tapachula for papers that would allow him to reach the US border.“But they took a long time,” said Beltrandez, a furniture restorer. So he decided to join the group of migrants who left Tapachula on Saturday.“There has been a lot of heat, a lot of sun,” Beltrandez said of the walk.On the first day of the march, the migrants pushed past a line of state police who were trying to stop them. There were minor scuffles and a small child suffered a slight head wound, but the migrants continued on their way.They made it only a few miles (kilometers) to the nearby village of Alvaro Obregon on Saturday before stopping to rest for the night at a baseball field.“We don't want problems with anyone,” Beltrandez said as the group reached Huehuetan on Sunday. “We want to do everything peacefully.”Police, immigration agents and National Guard have broken up smaller attempts at similar breakouts earlier this year. In August, National Guard troops in riot gear blocked several hundred Haitians, Cubans and Central Americans who set out walking on a highway from Tapachula.In January, a larger caravan of migrants tried to leave Honduras but was blocked from crossing Guatemala.José Antonio, a Honduran in the latest group who did not want to give his last name because he feared it could affect his case, said he had been waiting in Tapachula for two months for an answer on his request for some sort of visa.“They told me I had to wait because the appointments were full,” the construction worker said. “There is no work there (in Tapachula), so out of necessity I joined this group.”The marches are reminiscent, but nowhere near as large, as the huge migrant caravans that crossed Mexico in 2018 and 2019 heading toward the US border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-migrants-continue-to-walk-through-southern-mexico-101635112369806.html
25-10-2021||World||US didn’t put enough pressure on Ghani, laments Khalilzad||The United States did not put enough pressure on former Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani to share power with the Taliban, Zalmay Khalilzad, who recently resigned as US special envoy to Afghanistan, told CBS in an interview broadcast on Sunday.The Afghan-born Khalilzad, speaking for the first time since his resignation on October 18, expressed reservations about the US decision to lift conditions on the withdrawal deal he had negotiated with the Taliban during the Trump years.The agreement signed on February 29, 2020 between Washington and the Taliban - which excluded Ghani’s government in Kabul - paved the way for the US to end its longest war. But it was “a conditions-based package” that included negotiations between the insurgents and Kabul, as well as a permanent ceasefire, Khalilzad said.But once in the White House, US President Joe Biden decided “to do a calendar-based withdrawal” without regard to those conditions, he said.Washington feared the Taliban would resume attacks on US forces if they stayed in the country longer - a situation Khalilzad acknowledged.Khalilzad placed most of the blame on Ghani, who he said never agreed to share power with the Taliban. “They preferred the status quo to a political settlement,” he said of Ghani’s government.“They (Ghani’s government) were not serious about the political settlement. It’s my judgement that we didn’t press him (Ghani) hard enough. We were gentle with President Ghani. We used diplomacy. We encouraged him.”Iran to host meeting on Af, Taliban not invitedIran will host a regional meeting on Afghanistan on Wednesday - but without the participation of the Taliban regime, which hasn’t been invited to the talks, reported Tolo News.“We are aware that the meeting will be held.

But with the rise in cases, organisers of the Wuhan Marathon said they would postpone Sunday’s event in the central Chinese city “to prevent the risk of epidemic spread”.The event was expected to have 26,000 participants, taking part in races including a full marathon and half marathon.Gansu, China’s northwest province, announced the suspension of all tourism activities after a surge in cases in the region, local media reported.In Russia, restaurants, cafes and non-essential shops will be closed in St Petersburg from October 30 until November 7 due to a steady spike in cases.US doctor refuses mask, told to leave meetingFlorida’s top health official, state surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, was asked to leave a meeting after reportedly refusing to wear a mask at the office of a state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition.The incident apparently took place at the office of Senator Tina Polsky.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-halts-marathon-as-china-s-cases-surge-101635110315790.html
25-10-2021||World||Facebook has different standards for misinformation in India: Reports||US social media giant Facebook has invested way less proportionately on preventing hate-speech and misinformation on its platform for users in India, developing and also in some non-English speaking nations compared to the United States, according to US media reports based on internal documents made public on Saturday.The United States accounts for less than 10% of Facebook’s daily users but it corners 84% of the company’s global budget, The Washington Post reported based in a 2020 company document. Only 16% went for the same purpose in the “Rest of World,” included India, France and Italy.One Facebook document viewed and cited by The Washington Post showed that the company had not developed algorithms for Hindi and Bengali, the world’s fifth and seventh most widely used language. The report cited company spokesperson saying hate-speech classifiers for Hindi and Bengal were introduced in 2018 and 2019 and systems for detecting violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali were added as recently as 2021.Facebook was acutely aware at all times of its loose systems for monitoring and taking down hate-speech and misinformation in India. In February 2019, the company’s India staff did an integrity test of the network through a dummy user, whose profile identified her as a 21-year-old woman in north India. The user’s newsfeed was hit at first by soft-porn posts. However, in the aftermath of the Pulwama terrorist attack and resulting escalation in India-Pakistan tensions and the retaliatory airstrike by India, it resulted in unsolicited pro-Indian government propaganda and anti-Muslim hate speech.The dummy test was called an “integrity nightmare” by the Facebook in an internal document.Documents cited by Washington Post in this report included copies of internal papers, memo and reports that whistleblower Frances Haugen has provided to the US stock market regulator Securities and Exchange Commission, with redacted versions to US Congress. Some of these papers formed the basis for initial reports by The Wall Street Journal that the social media giant prioritised profit over public safety. The reports led to one of them damaging Congressional hearings yet for Facebook.Facebook spokesperson Dani Lever told The Washington Post that the company had made “progress” and had “dedicated teams working to stop abuse on our platform in countries where there is heightened risk of conflict and violence. We also have global teams with native speakers reviewing content in over 70 languages along with experts in humanitarian and human rights issues”.In India, Lever said, the “hypothetical test account inspired deeper, more rigorous analysis of our recommendation systems”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-has-different-standards-for-misinformation-in-india-report-101635100261819.html
