Whether that’s tomorrow or the next day, I don’t know.”Hillary Clinton has been with her husband at the hospital southeast of Los Angeles. Chelsea Clinton was with her mother around 8 a.m. Saturday in an SUV accompanied by secret service agents.Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to Covid-19, his spokesman said.An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña had said Friday that Clinton would remain hospitalized overnight to receive further intravenous antibiotics.“All health indicators are trending in the right direction, including his white blood count, which has decreased significantly,” Ureña said in a statement.“President Clinton continues to be in excellent spirits, and is deeply grateful for the outstanding care he is receiving and the well wishes that people have sent from across America and around the world,” the statement said.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn't receiving ICU care.Clinton was reading books and watching TV coverage about his hospitalization, the aide said.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-clinton-doing-fine-and-will-be-out-of-hospital-soon-says-joe-biden-101634405681066.html

The developed countries had committed to raise that money by 2020 and then by 2025.In 2009 at COP 15 in Copenhagen, developed countries decided to commit to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. Member countries decided then that this funding would come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance, and that new multilateral funding for adaptation would be delivered through effective and efficient fund arrangements, with a governance structure providing for equal representation of developed and developing countries, according to a background note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirmala-sitharaman-raises-climate-financing-issue-in-united-states-101634390105518.html

I have been searching for this medicine for the last three days but couldn't find it. The important medicines don't exist," said Shukrullah, a Kabul resident.Even medicine factories' owners have said that due to a shortage of medicine elements, some factories have stopped operating.Abdul Karim Khosti, the chief inspector of medical factories, said: "The flights are suspended and the customs stopped many trucks with medical products and now many factories lack access to medical materials to produce medicine."Expressing concerns over the issue, pharmacy owners have also raised their voices saying that the stopped-flow of medical supplies at the border is affecting their business.Abdullah, a pharmacy owner, said: "The increasing rate of the dollar and closure of ground borders and suspension of flights caused us to face a shortage of drugs."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-pharmacy-union-warns-of-medicine-shortage-as-supplies-stopped-at-borders-report-101634389260979.html

The findings of the study, published in The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine, suggest that symptomatic parturients in the third trimester had higher rates of gestational diabetes and lower white blood cell counts.The researchers assessed 2,471 women in the third trimester of their pregnancy, of which 2,299 were Covid-19 negative while 172 women had confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 during the study period. Among the 172 Covid-19 patients, 116 were asymptomatic while 56 were either diagnosed after arrival in hospital with symptoms or arrived after having been recently diagnosed.The study, however, also showed that there was no significant increase in cesarean delivery in those who were Covid-19 positive. The incidence of preterm deliveries was not significantly different among the three groups, according to the authors.Of the 172 women with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 who were monitored at the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Israel, only one parturient needed mechanical ventilation, while there were no maternal deaths in this group.Though they were at increased risk of adverse outcomes, none of the cases resulted in severe neonatal asphyxia or neonatal death. Overall maternal adverse outcomes were “not significantly different between the three groups.”Dr Elior Eliasi, the lead author of the study, said the results show that Covid-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy "has clinical implications, albeit at lower rates than expected once asymptomatic patients are taken into account.""However, There were significant differences between the Covid-19-positive and healthy controls included higher rates of GDM (gestational diabetes), low lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) which were significantly lower, postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding during birth), and neonatal respiratory complications," Dr Eliasi said, stressing the importance of vaccinating all pregnant women.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-3rd-trimester-of-pregnancy-a-look-at-adverse-complications-101634385263882.html

The Chinese foreign ministry released a brief statement on the MoU without sharing details.“China and Bhutan are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, and the traditional friendship between the two has a long history,” the ministry statement quoted Wu as saying. “It is expected that the MoU will make a significant contribution to speed up the negotiation on demarcation and promote the process of establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries,” the statement added.“China will follow Xi Jinping Thought on diplomacy, follow the neighbourhood diplomacy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and be a good neighbor, friend and partner of Bhutan on the principles of equality and peaceful coexistence,” Wu said. China is a good neighbour, friend and partner of Bhutan, and the two countries should treat each other as equals, co-exist peacefully and seek mutual benefits and win-win results, said Wu.The Chinese statement quoted Bhutanese foreign minister Dorji as saying that Bhutan will work with China to implement the MoU, unswervingly push forward the negotiation on demarcation and be committed to strengthening bilateral relations.“The MoU is of historic significance and is the result of years of joint efforts and sincere cooperation between the two sides,” the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times, said in a report on the deal.Chinese experts told state media that the meeting shows Bhutan’s willingness to manage border affairs independently, rebutting India’s claims of the “China threat”, and reducing the risk on its eastern China-India border. “They noted that the territorial disputes between China and Bhutan are not significant but have not been resolved because India stands in the way as it has a special influence on Bhutan’s culture, defense and diplomacy,” the Global Times report said.“At a time when India is pursuing hegemony by coercion over its neighbors, the MoU is a victory for the region. It demonstrates that respectable, bilateral diplomacy has triumphed over New Delhi’s attempts to dominate, control and bully its neighbors, showing India has little ability to regionally isolate China,” national broadcaster CGTN’s English website said in a commentary.“The biggest lesson of the MoU for New Delhi ought to be that initiatives such as the Quad and anti-China metrics cannot reverse India’s growing isolation in South Asia,” it added.China’s official stand on the border dispute with Bhutan is that the boundary between the two countries is yet to be demarcated and the middle, eastern and western sections of the border are disputed.In June, 2020, Beijing stalled a request from Bhutan to develop the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in the eastern sector’s Trashigang district during a virtual meeting of the US-based Global Environment Facility (GEF).And, in July, 2020, China said it has a border dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, adding that Beijing and Thimphu were in communication on the issue. Beijing’s claim was seen as significant as the area in question borders Arunachal Pradesh, which also China claims as part of south Tibet.In a statement to the Hindustan Times the same month, the Chinese foreign ministry had said “a third party should not point fingers” in the China-Bhutan border issue – an apparent reference to India.“As far as I know, the China-Bhutan boundary issue was almost resolved 20 years ago. The two sides have a common understanding on how to sign the final agreement. But for Bhutan, it is difficult because of the India factor. That is the same reason why China and Bhutan have not signed the agreement,” Lin Minwang, assistant dean at the Institute of International Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University, had told HT at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hails-mou-with-bhutan-blames-india-for-souring-ties-with-thimphu-101634382546284.html

She is expected to become the first Chinese woman to conduct a spacewalk.The three will stay inside the space station for six months – the longest-ever mission involving crew in China’s rapidly developing space programme.After Shenzhou-13 successfully completed a fast automated rendezvous and docking with the space station complex, which is composed of the core module Tianhe and the cargo crafts Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3, the Shenzhou-13 crew entered the orbital capsule from the return capsule of the spaceship.“After a series of preparations, (astronaut) Zhai Zhigang opened the hatch of the Tianhe core module. At 9:58 a.m. (Beijing Time), Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu entered the core module one by one,” the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement on Saturday.The trio is the second batch of crew in China’s space station.In September, three other Chinese astronauts successfully completed a three-month stay on board the future station.They conducted two spacewalks to install equipment and worked on the station’s core module during their stay inside the space station.The assignments for the new crew include operating mechanical arms, performing extravehicular activities, and having module transfer tests.“They will also continue to verify key technologies concerning astronauts’ long-term stay in orbit, as well as recycle and life support,” the CMSA said.China began constructing the space station in April with the launch of Tianhe - the first and largest of the station’s three modules.Slightly bigger than a city bus, Tianhe will be the living quarters of the completed space station, a Reuters report said.Shenzhou-13 is the second of four crewed missions needed to complete the space station by the end of 2022.On May 30, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies including food and equipment docked with China’s first space station’s key module Tianhe as part of the preparation for the station to host three astronauts this month.The unmanned Tianzhou-2, or “Heavenly Vessel” in Chinese, docked with Tianhe (the key module).Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first spacewalk ever on the 2008 Shenzhou mission.In recent months, China has returned rock and soil samples to earth from the surface of the moon and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars; it also landed a craft on the far side of the moon in 2019.Once built, China’s space station will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency reported.The ISS – from which China is excluded -- comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-chinese-astronauts-including-first-woman-enter-space-station-101634379304813.html
16-10-2021||World||Stabbing of British MP David Amess a terrorist incident: UK Police||The fatal stabbing of British lawmaker David Amess was a terrorist incident, police said Saturday, as MPs pressed for tougher security in the wake of the second killing of a UK politician while meeting constituents in just over five years.Veteran Conservative MP David Amess, 69, was talking with voters at a church in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea east of London when he was stabbed to death on Friday.Police said they arrested a 25-year-old suspect and were investigating "a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism".Police have said the investigation is in the "very early stages", though multiple UK media outlets, citing sources, reported that the suspect was believed to be a British national with Somali heritage.Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the scene to pay his respects on Saturday, laying floral wreaths outside the church with the leader of the opposition, Labour leader Keir Starmer in a rare show of unity, along with the Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle and Home Secretary Priti Patel.Members of the public also came to lay bouquets next to the police tape surrounding the crime scene.Britain's politicians were stunned by the highly public attack, which recalled the murder of a pro-EU lawmaker ahead of the Brexit referendum.In June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, prompting demands for action against what lawmakers said was "a rising tide" of public abuse and threats against elected representatives.Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, who became an MP in the same constituency this year, said Amess' death had left her "scared and frightened"."This is the risk we are all taking and so many MPs will be scared by this," she added.Home Secretary Patel on Friday ordered police across the country to review security arrangements for all 650 MPs.House of Commons Speaker Hoyle promised no "knee-jerk reactions" but told Sky News: "We will take further measures if we need to".Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP who tried to save a stabbed police officer during a 2017 terror attack near the Houses of Parliament, on Twitter urged "a temporary pause in face to face meetings" until the security review is complete.Increasing threatsMPs and their staff have been attacked before, although it is rare.But their safety was thrown into sharp focus by Brexit, which stoked deep political divisions and has led to often angry, partisan rhetoric.Cox's killer repeatedly shouted "Britain first" before shooting and stabbing the 41-year-old MP outside her constituency meeting near Leeds, northern England.A specialist police unit set up to investigate threats against MPs in the aftermath said 678 crimes against lawmakers were reported between 2016 and 2020.Most (582) were for malicious communications, although other crimes included harassment (46), terrorism (nine), threats (seven), and common assault (three).Separate figures indicated a sharp rise in reports since 2018, including three threats to kill.Ex-MP Anna Soubry, who quit the Conservative party because of her opposition to Brexit, has spoken of being sent bullets during an intimidation campaign that also targeted her family."I do get frightened," she said at the time.Amess himself wrote about public harassment and online abuse in his book "Ayes & Ears: A Survivor's Guide to Westminster", published last year."These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians," he said.MPs have had to install security cameras and only meet constituents by appointment, he added.MPs' staff have also spoken of bearing the brunt of abuse."I would get in and all I would do is go on Facebook and report death threats and delete them," said Jade Botterill, who worked for senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper from 2013 to 2019."I reckon I reported over 1,000 death threats," she said, adding it caused her sleepless nights and fears she would be attacked.Brexit had been a turning point for staff working in constituency offices while an MP was in parliament were often on the frontline of daily public anger, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stabbing-of-british-mp-david-amess-a-terrorist-incident-uk-police-101634376746616.html

The latest spate of violence occurred in the southern town of Begumganj as more than 200 protesters attacked a temple when Hindu devotees were performing the last rituals on the final day of Durga Puja, reported news agency AFP citing police.According to the report, local police station chief Shah Imran said that the attackers on Friday stabbed an executive member of the temple committee to death. The next day, the police found the body of another Hindu man near a pond located next to the temple."Two men have died since yesterday's attack. We are working to find the culprits," AFP quoted district police chief Shahidul Islam as saying.The attacks against Hindus in the Muslim-majority nation started over the alleged desecration of the Quran, the central religious text of Islam. After footage of a Quran placed on the knee of goddess Durga’s idol at a puja pandal in Cumilla emerged, protesters attacked pandals and temples across the country.Reports suggest that anti-Hindu violence spread to more than a dozen districts across Bangladesh, including, Noakhali, Chandpur, Cox’s Bazaar, Chattogram, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Moulvibazara and Kurigram.Also Read | Those attacking Durga Puja pandals will be hunted down, punished: Sheikh HasinaBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised stern action to the Hindu community leaders and warned those involved in the attacks on Hindu temples and Durga Puja pandals."The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn't matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished," she assured while speaking to the Hindu community during an event at Dhakeshwari National Temple in Dhaka.India said it was in close contact with Bangladesh authorities over the anti-Hindu violence, noting that the celebrations were continuing with the support of the government.“Our high commission in Dhaka, as well as our consulates in Bangladesh, are obviously in very close contact with the authorities in Dhaka and at local levels,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing Thursday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-hindu-men-killed-in-bangladesh-in-fresh-attack-on-a-temple-report-101634376814983.html

The rebuke, a rare reaction from the group, came as concerns about the commitment of the military junta in Myanmar to defuse the ongoing bloody crisis in that country, news agencies reported.Discussions to exclude Myanmar from the summit have been ongoing within Asean and the foreign ministers of the member states met on Friday regarding the issue. However, on Saturday, Brunei, which is the current chair of Asean, issued a statement confirming the exclusion of Min Aung Hlain, Myanmar’s military chief.Rather, the group has decided “to invite a non-political representative from Myanmar,” after some member nations called for giving “space to Myanmar to restore its internal affairs and return to normalcy,” news agency AFP reported, quoting Asean’s statement.Also read | UN says estimated 100,000 people internally displaced in Myanmar’s Kayah StateThe rebuke came after the group had insisted that Myanmar was showing an “insufficient progress” regarding the implementation of the five-point consensus agreed between the two parties in April this year. Also, the tensions increased after Myanmar’s junta refused firmly, the group’s request to allow a regional special envoy to meet all parties concerned to defuse the situation in the country, which would also include ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.This was not the first time Asean had expressed displeasure and concerns over Myanmar’s commitment to the agreement. Previously on several other occasions Asean had pushed for the military regime to enhance cooperation in addressing the crisis in that country.Earlier in February this year, the military ousted the democratically elected government in Myanmar citing voter frauds in the country’s general elections last year. Following the coup, Suu Kyi has since then been detained along with several other leaders of the party.Several protests erupted in the country following the military takeover, to which the regime has allegedly reacted with violence. Killings and internal displacement of people increased due to the violence that ensued, according to several organisations including the United Nations. Meanwhile, the UN and the international community, including countries like the US, have stated in the past that ASEAN should deal with the unfolding political crisis in Myanmar due to its proximity.Previously the UN has repeatedly expressed concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country due to the political events and also aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-decides-to-exclude-myanmar-military-chief-from-key-summit-on-october-26-reports-101634374260349.html

In a statement posted late Friday on social media, IS said two of the group's members shot and killed security guards manning the entrance of the Fatimiya mosque in Kandahar province. One detonated his explosives at the entrance of the mosque and the other inside.IS news agency Amaq in a statement gave the names of the attackers as Anas al-Khurasani and Abu Ali al-Baluchi, both Afghan nationals.The attack came a week after a bombing claimed by the local Islamic State affiliate killed 46 people at a Shiite mosque in northern Afghanistan, raising fears that IS — an enemy of both the Taliban and the West — is expanding its foothold in Afghanistan.Friday's attack was the deadliest to strike Afghanistan since the dramatic US exit from the country, which allowed the Taliban to seize control of the Afghan capital. It was also the first major attack by the group in the country's south.IS carries out frequent attacks in its eastern stronghold, but recently has shown signs of expansion, with attacks in the north and Kabul. The attacks have brought into question the Taliban's ability to counter the growing IS threat.The Taliban have pledged to restore peace and security after decades of war and have also given the US assurances that they will not allow the country to be used as a base for launching extremist attacks on other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-islamic-state-group-claims-deadly-mosque-bombing-in-kandahar-101634372118592.html
16-10-2021||World||New Zealand administers record number of Covid vaccines at 'Vaxathon'||New Zealand health care workers administered a record number of vaccine jabs Saturday as the nation held a festival aimed at getting more people inoculated against the coronavirus.Musicians, sports stars and celebrities pitched in for the “Vaxathon” event which was broadcast on television and online for eight hours straight. By late afternoon, more than 120,000 people had gotten shots, eclipsing the daily record of 93,000 set in August. The event stretched into the evening.A throwback to TV fundraising “telethon” events that were popular from the 1970s through the 1990s, it comes as New Zealand faces its biggest threat since the pandemic began, with an outbreak of the delta variant spreading through the largest city of Auckland and beyond.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who chatted with motorists at a drive-through vaccination center in Wellington, initially set a target of 100,000 jabs for the day but upped that to 150,000 after the first target was met.She also set a target of 25,000 shots for Indigenous Maori, whose vaccination numbers have been lagging and who have been hit hard by the latest outbreak.National carrier Air New Zealand converted a Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane into a vaccination clinic for the day, issuing people boarding passes on “Flight NZVAX.”Singer Lorde beamed in from abroad, saying she couldn't wait to come back home to play a concert and have everyone get sweaty and dance.“I am the first person to admit that I find getting injections really icky, but ever since I was a kid, I have treated myself by going to the bakery after an injection, normally for a custard tart," she said. "So you could do that.”New Zealand has so far used only the Pfizer vaccine.For much of the pandemic, New Zealanders have lived completely free from the virus after the government successfully eliminated each outbreak through strict lockdowns and contact tracing.That zero-tolerance strategy failed for the first time after the outbreak of the more contagious delta variant began in August. Until then, New Zealand was slow to immunize its population. It since has been making up for lost ground.Before the Vaxathon, about 72% of New Zealanders had received at least one dose and 54% were fully vaccinated. Among those aged 12 and over, the proportion was about 83% and 62% respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-dispenses-administers-record-number-of-covid-vaccines-at-vaxathon-101634369926614.html

The 69-year-old Conservative leader was talking with voters at a church in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea east of London when the incident took place.Amess died on the spot, The Sun further reported.The Sun also said in its report that the attacker - a 25-year-old British national of Somali origin - calmly sat down and waited for cops to arrive. "We know he stabbed David and waited for the police. It was completely premeditated. He knew he was going to do it," it quoted Councillor Daniel Nelson as saying.The police are investigating it as a terrorist incident, and the MPs are pressing for tougher security in the wake of the second killing of a UK politician while meeting constituents in just over five years.Police have said the investigation is in the "very early stages".Britain's politicians were stunned by the highly public attack, which recalled the murder of a pro-EU lawmaker ahead of the Brexit referendum.In June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, prompting demands for action against what lawmakers said was "a rising tide" of public abuse and threats against elected representatives.Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, who became an MP in the same constituency this year, said Amess' death had left her "scared and frightened".Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday ordered police across the country to review security arrangements for all 650 MPs.Amess, who leaves a wife and five children, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 for his service, becoming Sir David.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mp-david-amess-was-stabbed-17-times-attack-was-planned-says-report-101634366303886.html

Ten members of the family, including seven children, were killed. News agency AFP reported that US intelligence officials had tracked Ahmadi’s car for eight hours before the missile was fired.The US military, which admitted its mistake, previously described the strike target as an Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) leader who was driving an explosives-laden car to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.However, multiple media reports stated that Ezmarai Ahmadi was an aid worker and had nothing to do with the Islamic State.During Thursday’s meeting, Steven Kwon told Dr Colin Kahl that Ahmadi had worked with the aid group NEI for many years, providing care and lifesaving assistance for people facing high mortality rates in Afghanistan.“Dr Kahl noted that the strike was a tragic mistake and that Mr Ahmadi and others who were killed were innocent victims who bore no blame and were not affiliated with ISIS-K or threats to US forces,” Pentagon spokesperson Kirby said in the statement and refused to comment on how much compensation will be offered to the relatives.Even though defence secretary Lloyd Austin has apologised for the August attack, the relatives said that it is not enough. “They must come here and apologise to us face-to-face,” Farshad Haidari, the nephew of Ezmarai Ahmadi told AFP. In September, Haidari, whose brother and cousins were also killed in the strike, claimed that the United States made no direct contact with the family.(With AFP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-offers-to-pay-relatives-of-afghans-killed-in-kabul-drone-strike-in-august-101634363869566.html
16-10-2021||World||Seven Hong Kong pro-democracy activists jailed over unauthorised protest in 2020||Seven Hong Kong democracy campaigners, including former lawmakers, were sentenced on Saturday to up to 12 months in jail for their role in a protest last year against a sweeping national security law imposed by China.The seven had pleaded guilty to charges that included organising the unauthorised assembly on July 1, 2020, when thousands of protesters took to the streets. Police, who had banned the demonstration citinbg coronavirus restrictions, fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse them.The activists included Figo Chan, a former convenor of the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF); Tsang Kin-shing and Tang Sai-lai of the League of Social Democrats; former district councillor Andy Chui; and former legislators Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu and Leung Kwok-hung.Chan was jailed for 12 months, while the others were given sentences from six to ten months."The nature of incitement was serious," said the judge, Douglas Yau, noting that it created the risk of violence.Beijing imposed a national security law on June 30 last year as a response to widespread anti-government protests in 2019 that roiled the city. The law, drawn up by China, sets out to punish subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.The protest took place the next day - the first full day under the new law, though civil society groups had held deminstrations on July 1 for years to champion various issues, including democratic rights.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise its wide-ranging freedoms and high degree of autonomy would be preserved. Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly denied curbing human rights and freedoms."We could only choose civil disobedience… a peaceful, rational and non-violent way to express our demand against the national security law," Figo Chan said in mitigation."In order to uphold the belief of civil disobedience, I decided to plead guilty, admitting that I violated the "evil public order law"."At least 370 people were arrested that day for illegal assembly and other offences, with ten involving violations of the security law, according to police.Tong Ying-kit, the first person convicted under the national security law, was sentenced in July to nine years in prison for terrorist activities and inciting secession.He was accused of driving his motorcycle that day into riot police while carrying a flag with the now-banned protest slogan "Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our times".According to the Security Bureau, more than 150 people have been arrested under the national security law. Among them, 100 people have been formally charged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists-jailed-over-unauthorised-protest-in-2020-101634358859985.html

16-10-2021||World||Taliban to announce secondary school for girls, says UN official||A senior UN official said Friday the Taliban told him they will announce “very soon” that all Afghan girls will be allowed to attend secondary schools.UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Omar Abdi, who visited Kabul last week, told reporters at UN headquarters that five of Afghanistan's 34 provinces -- Balkh, Jawzjan and Samangan in the northwest, Kunduz in the northeast and Urozgan in the southwest -- are already allowing girls to attend secondary school.He said the Taliban’s education minister told him they are working on “a framework” to allow all girls to continue their schooling beyond the sixth grade, which should be published “between a month and two.”“As I speak to you today, millions of girls of secondary school age are missing out on education for the 27th consecutive day,” Abdi said. “We are urging them not to wait. Any day that we wait -- it’s a day lost for those girls that are out of school.”During the Taliban's previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996-2001, they denied girls and women the right to education and barred them from working and public life. Since their Aug. 15 takeover of Afghanistan as US and NATO forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country after 20 years, the Taliban have come under increasing international pressure to ensure women’s rights to education and work.Abdi said that in every meeting he pressed the Taliban “to let girls resume their learning,” calling it “critical for the girls themselves and for the country as a whole.”When the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harboring Osama bin Laden who masterminded the 9/11 attacks on the United States, only one million Afghan children were in school at all levels, he said.Over the past 20 years, that figure rose to almost 10 million children at all levels, including 4 million girls, Abdi said, and in the last decade the number of schools tripled from 6,000 to 18,000.“Education gains of the past two decades must be strengthened and not rolled back,” he said.But the deputy chief of the United Nations Children’s Fund said despite this progress, 4.2 million Afghan children are out of school including 2.6 million girls.If all girls are allowed to attend secondary school, Abdi said, efforts must still be made to overcome resistance from conservatives to allowing them to get a secondary education.“The authorities that I’ve met said that when they put in place the framework that they are working on, it will convince more parents to send their girls to school” because it will address concerns in conservative societies about separating girls and boys and female teachers, he said.“So, that has to be seen,” Abdi said.While in Kabul, the UNICEF deputy chief said he also visited a children’s hospital “and was shocked to see how packed it was with malnourished children, some of them babies.”Abdi said the health system and social services are on the verge of collapse, medical supplies are running dangerously low, outbreaks of measles and watery diarrhea are increasing, and polio and Covid-19 remain serious concerns.“Even before the Taliban takeover, at least 10 million children across the country were in need of humanitarian assistance to survive,” he said, “and at least one million of these children are at risk of dying due to severe acute malnutrition if they are not treated immediately.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the world to prevent the Afghan economy from collapsing and help the Afghan people, an appeal echoed by Abdi who said “the situation is critical and it will only get worse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-announce-secondary-school-for-girls-says-un-official-101634356787951.html
16-10-2021||World||Former Boeing pilot involved in Max testing indicted||A former Boeing pilot was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on charges of deceiving safety regulators about the 737 Max jetliner, which was later involved in two deadly crashes.The indictment charges Mark A. Forkner with giving the Federal Aviation Administration false and incomplete information about an automated flight-control system that played a role in the crashes, which killed 346 people.Prosecutors said that because of Forkner's alleged deception, the system was not mentioned in pilot manuals or training materials.An attorney for Forkner did not immediately respond for comment. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment.Forkner, 49, was charged with two counts of fraud involving aircraft parts in interstate commerce and four counts of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors said he is expected to make his first appearance in court on Friday in Fort Worth, Texas. If convicted on all counts, he could face a sentence of up to 100 years in prison.The indictment charges that he hid information about a flight-control system that activated erroneously and pushed down the noses of Max jets that crashed in 2018 in Indonesia, and 2019 in Ethiopia. The pilots tried unsuccessfully to regain control, but both planes went into nosedives minutes after taking off.Forkner was Boeing's chief technical pilot on the Max program. Prosecutors said that Forkner learned about an important change to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System flight-control system in 2016, but withheld the information from the FAA. That led the agency to delete reference to MCAS from a technical report and, in turn, it didn't appear in pilot manuals. Most pilots didn't know about MCAS until after the first crash.Prosecutors suggested that Forkner downplayed the power of the system to avoid a requirement that pilots undergo extensive and expensive retraining, which would increase training costs for airlines. Congressional investigators suggested additional training would have added $1 million to the price of each plane.“In an attempt to save Boeing money, Forkner allegedly withheld critical information from regulators,” said Chad Meacham, acting U.S. attorney for the northern district of Texas. “His callous choice to mislead the FAA hampered the agency's ability to protect the flying public and left pilots in the lurch, lacking information about certain 737 MAX flight controls."Forkner told another Boeing employee in 2016 that MCAS was “egregious” and “running rampant” when he tested it in a flight simulator, but he didn't tell that to the FAA.“So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly),” Forkner wrote in a message that became public in 2019.Forkner, who lives in a Fort Worth suburb, joined Southwest Airlines after leaving Boeing, but left the airline about a year ago.Chicago-based Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement to end a Justice Department investigation into the company's actions. The government agreed to drop a criminal charge of conspiracy against Boeing after three years if the company carries out terms of the January 2020 settlement. The settlement included a $243.6 million fine, nearly $1.8 billion for airlines that bought the plane and $500 million for a fund to compensate families of the passengers who were killed.Dozens of families of passengers are suing Boeing in federal court in Chicago.Crash investigations highlighted the role of MCAS but also pointed to mistakes by the airlines and pilots. Max jets were grounded worldwide for more than a year and a half. The FAA approved the plane for flying again late last year after Boeing made changes to MCAS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-boeing-pilot-involved-in-max-testing-indicted-101634354079052.html

16-10-2021||World||Joe Biden recalls single parenthood struggle in child care pitch||President Joe Biden made a deeply personal appeal Friday for a transformation of America's lagging child care services, saying that the crash that killed his wife and daughter demonstrated the importance of helping parents struggling with work and raising families.Biden, who became a single parent juggling a political career and two young boys after the accident in 1972, said during a speech in Connecticut that he "could not afford the child care" on a senator's salary, forcing him to commute daily between Washington and Delaware."It made me realize how difficult it is for the vast majority of people who need help," Biden said at child care center in the state capital Hartford.Part of a national tour to drum up support for his proposals, Biden's second presidential visit to the Constitution State came during a crucial phase for his historic but controversial spending plans, which face opposition from his own side as well as from Republicans.It is far from the first time he has spoken publicly about the crash that killed his wife Neilia and their one-year-old daughter Naomi.But the president reframed the horrific episode as a learning moment that made him realize most Americans don't have the help of an extended family that he benefited from when they are struggling to raise families."I've been conscious of the concern in a lack of access, and a lack of financial ability to have child care, for a long time," he said.Child care is being held up as critical to the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic -- but the administration argues that the United States invests far less in children than comparable economies.- 'Game changer' - The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says the nation invests less in early childhood education and care relative to the size of the economy than all but two of the world's 37 leading developed countries.The cost of child care for the average family in Connecticut is $16,000, according to Hartford's Democratic mayor Luke Bronin, who called the Biden child care agenda "a game changer.""How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, can't be part of the workforce because they can't afford the cost of childcare?" Biden said.Parents' difficulties in hanging on to jobs also contributes to a wide gender gap in workforce participation between mothers, who still take on the greater burden of care, and fathers.Biden is proposing to bridge the gap with federal subsidies for low and middle-income Americans that would cap families' child care expenses at seven percent of their income.He wants to offer large subsidies to child care centers, raise wages for those who work in the industry and increase child credit from $2,000 to $3,000 a year for children aged over six."It's never a good bet to bet against the American people. It's time for us to invest in ourselves, show the world that American democracy works," Biden said."We've always led the world not by the example of our physical power, but by the power of our example. That's why the world has followed."- 'Lift up families' - Republicans vehemently oppose White House proposals for a multi-trillion-dollar social spending package that calls for Biden's child care provisions.The Democrats in Congress have enough lawmakers without Republican help to pass the historic blueprint -- which includes improved benefits for college students and seniors, cash for health care coverage and provisions to help rescue a warming planet.But House of Representatives liberals balk at cutting the $3.5 trillion top line to $1.5 trillion over 10 years, which a small group of moderates favor.Biden has told progressives that the end goal should be around $2 trillion as he tries to wrangle sufficient Democratic votes.This means confronting grueling choices between funding fewer programs for longer periods of time or more programs for shorter stints, in hopes they will be renewed by future Congresses.Polling shows that as little as one in 10 Americans known specifics about the contents of the plan but Bronin said broad improvements in child care were overwhelmingly popular among Americans."It would lift up families across this country, open up pathways to opportunity, make sure that we keep our middle class strong," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-recalls-single-parenthood-struggle-in-child-care-pitch-101634349115776.html
16-10-2021||World||US health advisers endorse booster shot for J&J Covid-19 vaccine||US health advisers endorsed a booster of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine Friday, citing concern that Americans who got the single-dose shot aren’t as protected as those given two-dose brands.J&J told the Food and Drug Administration that an extra dose adds important protection as early as two months after initial vaccination — but that it might work better if people wait until six months later. Unable to settle the best timing, the FDA's advisory panel voted unanimously that the booster should be offered at least two months after people got their earlier shot.“I think this frankly was always a two-dose vaccine,” said FDA adviser Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It would be hard to recommend this as a single-dose vaccine at this point.”The FDA isn't bound by the recommendation as it makes a final decision — and adding to the debate's complexity, new research also suggests that J&J recipients might have a stronger immune response if their booster dose is from a competing brand.Preliminary results from an ongoing study of different ways to “mix and match” different shots showed that a booster of any sort revved up people's levels of virus-fighting antibodies — at least for a few weeks. And the most dramatic jump came from giving a Pfizer or Moderna shot after the single-dose J&J vaccination.FDA's advisers didn't vote on whether that should be recommended but told the government to allow flexibility with boosters, saying there were no safety red flags even if it's not yet clear just how much difference, if any, mixing and matching may make in long-term protection.“In the real world all these kind of combinations are already happening so I think it’s a matter of some urgency for the FDA to help sort out what is admittedly a complicated and challenging scenario,” said Dr. Ofer Levy of Boston Children's Hospital.The government says all three US vaccines continue to offer strong protection against hospitalization and death from Covid-19, and that the priority is getting first shots to the 66 million eligible but unvaccinated Americans who are most at risk. But with the spread of the extra-contagious delta variant and signs of waning immunity against milder infections, the nation is moving toward a broader booster campaign.Last month Pfizer boosters started being offered to seniors and younger adults at high risk from Covid-19 because of poor health, jobs or living conditions — at least six months after their initial vaccination. Thursday, the FDA advisory panel recommended the same approach for half-dose Moderna boosters.But J&J's vaccine has consistently shown lower effectiveness levels across a series of studies — and the FDA panel ultimately settled on another shot for any recipient 18 or older at least two months after their first vaccination."This is really -- with the second dose -- bringing it, I think, on par with those other vaccines in terms of effectiveness,” said Dr. Archana Chatterjee of Rosalind Franklin University.The FDA will use its advisers’ recommendations to decide whether to authorize boosters for both J&J and Moderna. Next, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would rule on who should roll up their sleeves.The vast majority of the 188 million Americans who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have received the Pfizer or Moderna options, while J&J recipients account for only about 15 million.J&J’s vaccine is made with a different technology and on Friday, the company pitched its booster as a way to strengthen a robust vaccine that they said has retained its protective power over eight months. But FDA scientists pointedly challenged that assertion.“There are data that suggest the effectiveness of this vaccine is actually less robust than the company’s presentation here," said Dr. Peter Marks, FDA's top vaccines official. “And that is a finding of concern particularly because that’s been seen in minority communities potentially and others.”As for its booster, J&J presented results from a large study that found giving a second dose just two months after the first bumped protection against symptomatic Covid-19 to 94 per cent from 70 per cent in US recipients. Giving that booster six months later instead prompted an even bigger jump in virus-fighting antibodies.But in their own review, FDA scientists noted only a tiny portion of cases involved the delta variant, by far the dominant strain in the U.S. And while FDA's reviewers found no new safety concerns about a second J&J dose, they noted other shortcomings. J&J followed booster recipients for little more than a month, making it hard to draw conclusions about the durability of protection. Also, FDA scientists stressed they hadn't had time to independently confirm J&J's data, which were submitted shortly before the meeting. That's highly unusual and drew serious concern from the advisory panel.The J&J vaccine was highly anticipated for its one-and-done formulation. But its rollout earlier this year was hurt by a series of troubles including manufacturing problems and some rare but serious side effects including a blood clot disorder and a neurological reaction called Guillain-Barre syndrome. In both cases, regulators decided the shot’s benefits outweighed those risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-advisers-endorse-booster-shot-for-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-101634347043212.html

The acts, the Taliban are talking about here, would constitute clear gross abuses of human rights, and we stand firm with the international community to hold perpetrators of any such abuses accountable," Price had said.In September, multiple media reports had emerged that the Taliban's official in charge of prisons and former justice minister of Afghanistan, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, said punishments such as executions and amputations will resume in the country.After announcing the government in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime has failed to get recognition. Aside from China, Pakistan and a handful of other countries, the rest of the world is taking a wait and watch policy while keeping an eye on the conduct of the outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ask-officials-not-to-carry-out-public-executions-unless-directed-by-top-court-report-101634345577622.html

It is an initiative by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. This global event marks a day calling for worldwide awareness and collective action to combat the issue of hunger and ensure healthy diets for all.This year, the World Food Day commemorations will be jointly led by the FAO, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the World Food Programme (WFP). Events will be organised in 150 countries across the globe with multiple partners and governments, according to the United Nations.The theme this year is “Our actions are our future. Better production, better nutrition, better environment and a better life”.History of World Food DayWorld Food Day was established in November 1979, as suggested by former Hungarian minister of agriculture and food Dr Pal Romany. It gradually became a way to raise awareness about hunger, malnutrition, sustainability and food production.Significance of World Food DayWorld Food Day is celebrated to mark the anniversary of the founding of the FAO of the United Nations, every year. This day aims at tackling global hunger and striving to eradicate hunger across the world.Focus area of World Food Day 2021The FAO said that today’s agri-food systems are exposing profound inequalities and injustices. At least two billion people don't have regular access to sufficient amounts of safe, nutritious food, while three billion cannot afford healthy diets and obesity continues to increase worldwide.It further said that vast quantities of food are lost even when millions of people go hungry every day. The food is either spoiled during production or transport or thrown into the waste bins of households, retailers or restaurants. Further area of concern is generation of greenhouse gas like methane by food waste which is filling up the world's landfills.FAO said that to fix this, collective action is needed so that everyone has enough safe and nutritious food to eat, and the entire food supply chain is more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.For this shift to happen, everyone must play their part, said the FAO, listing action plans for countries, farmers, private sectors and the civil society.This World Food Day is the second to be marked during Covid-19, which has had devastating repercussions for food security worldwide. The FAO said that the Covid-19 pandemic has induced an economic recession that could add up to 100 million or more to the 690 million people already suffering from hunger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101634341723308.html

She told Reuters she denies leaking.Parrish said she deleted apps that contained details of her finances and other personal information before handing her devices in to Apple as part of the probe.Parrish said she believes she was fired for her activism in the workplace."To me, this seems clearly retaliatory for the fact that I was speaking out about abuses that have happened at my employer, pay equity and, generally, about our workplace conditions," she said.Apple said Friday it does not discuss specific employee matters.Apple has recently experienced other examples of employee unrest. Last month, two Apple employees told Reuters they had filed charges investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02 against the company with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers accused Apple of retaliation and halting discussion of pay among employees, among other allegations.Apple has said that it is "deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace" and that it takes "all concerns" from employees seriously.U.S. law protects the right of employees to openly discuss certain topics, including working conditions, discrimination and equal pay.Over the summer, current and former Apple employees began detailing on social media what they said were experiences of harassment and discrimination. Parrish and some colleagues began publishing the stories on social media and a publishing platform in a weekly digest titled '#AppleToo.'Parrish said she was careful to respect company rules and never shared information that she believed to be confidential. She said she continued to publish the '#AppleToo' digest after coming under investigation at the end of September."If anything, it's made the importance of that work clearer than ever, when Apple's response to criticism is to start internal investigations into those that it wants to see gone," she said. "It's easier for them to terminate people than it is for them to actually listen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-worker-says-she-was-fired-after-leading-movement-against-harassment-101634341433678.html

16-10-2021||World||UK police says murder of MP Amess was a terrorist incident||The fatal stabbing of British MP David Amess was a terrorist incident, police said Saturday, at they investigated the second killing of a UK politician while meeting voters since 2016.The Metropolitan Police said its preliminary findings had revealed "a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism".Amess, a 69-year-old pro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker, was stabbed to death inside a church on Friday while holding a fortnightly consultation with his constituents in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, east of London.Police arrested a 25-year-old man at the scene on suspicion of murder and recovered a knife.Essex police said officers had responded "within minutes" to reports of the stabbing shortly after 12:05 pm (1105 GMT) and arrived to find Amess had "suffered multiple injuries"."This was a difficult incident, but our officers and paramedics from the East of England Ambulance Service worked extremely hard to save Sir David," Harrington said."Tragically he died at the scene."A father-of-five who was first elected to parliament in 1983, Amess was memorialised with an impromptu evening mass while tributes poured in from across the political spectrum and around the world.Multiple UK media outlets, citing sources, reported that the suspect was believed to be a British national with Somali heritage."The investigation is in its very early stages and is being led by officers from the specialist counter-terrorism command," Ben-Julian Harrington, Essex police's chief constable, told reporters."We made it clear at the time of the incident that we did not believe there was any immediate further threat to anyone else in the area," Harrington said.'Much-loved'The killing has sent shockwaves around Britain.Flags were lowered to half-mast in Westminster as tributes were paid to Amess, whose death came five years after the murder of Labour party MP Jo Cox by a far-right extremist.In a book last year called "Ayes & Ears: A Survivor's Guide to Westminster", Amess noted that Cox's death had prompted new security guidance to lawmakers that threatened to limit their access to constituents."This sort of thing just was not supposed to happen in the UK," he wrote about Cox's killing."These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians."Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Amess was "a much-loved friend and colleague" and "a fine public servant"."The reason I think people are so shocked and saddened is above all he was one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics."Dozens of local community members honoured their elected representative in a mass held at another Leigh-on-Sea church near the crime scene on Friday evening."He died doing the thing he loved -- meeting his constituents," said Jeff Woolnough, a priest who led the liturgy.'Attack on democracy'All Britain's living former prime ministers also paid tribute to Amess, including Theresa May, who called it "a tragic day for our democracy".Prince William and his wife Kate said the couple were "shocked and saddened" and noted Amess had "dedicated 40 years of his life to serving his community".Condolences also came from the United States, Canada and Spain."An attack on elected officials is an attack on democracy," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted.Britain's House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said Amess had "built a reputation for kindness and generosity" during his long parliamentary career."In the coming days, we will need to discuss and examine MPs' security and any measures to be taken, but for now, our thoughts and prayers are with David's family, friends and colleagues," Hoyle added.Interior Minister Priti Patel's spokesman said she had chaired a meeting of police, security and intelligence agencies and "asked all police forces to review security arrangements for MPs with immediate effect".'Cowardly as it gets'Amess was first elected during Margaret Thatcher's tenure and was known for his advocacy of animal welfare and pro-life issues.He had advertised Friday's "surgery" -- an open meeting for constituents -- at the Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea.While public attacks on British MPs are not common, lawmakers have been the victims of stabbings in the past.In January 2000, Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones was wounded and his assistant killed by a man wielding a ceremonial sword at a surgery.Pro-EU MP Cox was killed in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, while another Labour MP, Stephen Timms, was stabbed multiple times during an event in 2010 but recovered and is still a lawmaker.Timms said he was "appalled" at this latest attack.Cox's widower Brendan said it was "as cowardly as it gets".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-says-murder-of-mp-amess-was-a-terrorist-incident-101634340153854.html
16-10-2021||World||Brazil Covid probe could lead to Bolsonaro facing 11 criminal charges: Report||A Brazilian Senate probe into the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic will recommend in its final report due next week that President Jair Bolsonaro face 11 criminal charges, the senator leading the inquiry said on Friday, though it remains highly unlikely that he will face a trial on any such charges.Renan Calheiros said during a radio interview that the investigation launched in April has collected evidence to show that Bolsonaro should be formally charged with genocide against the country's indigenous population, malfeasance, irregular use of public funds, violation of sanitary measures, incitement to crime and forgery of private documents, among other crimes.The far-right president, who himself was infected with the coronavirus in July 2020, has railed against lockdown measures, pushed unproven cures, sowed vaccine doubts and downplayed the severity of Covid-19.The report is scheduled to be released by the Senate investigative panel next Tuesday. The panel's members the following day are set to vote on approving the text before sending it on the attorney general's office on Thursday to decide if Bolsonaro and others should be charged.The attorney general's office can charge the president, but the Supreme Court, which would try him, must request authorization from the lower house to proceed. Experts say the lower house is highly unlikely to sign off on such a request.The president's office did not immediately respond to request for comment.Bolsonaro's approval ratings have fallen in public opinion polls over his handling of the public health crisis. More than 600,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Brazil, second only to the United States.The report is also likely to recommend that some of Bolsonaro's sons and his former Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello also be charged with crimes, Calheiros said. Calheiros did not identify which sons may face charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-covid-probe-could-lead-to-bolsonaro-facing-11-criminal-charges-report-101634339934504.html
16-10-2021||World||Bill Clinton recovering from urological infection, to stay in hospital overnight||Bill Clinton will remain hospitalized overnight as he recovers from a urological infection. But a spokesman said Friday that he was doing better and was in good spirits.“All health indicators are trending in the right direction, including his white blood count which has decreased significantly," spokesman Angel Ureña said in a statement.Clinton, 75, will remain at the University of California Irvine Medical Center overnight so that he can receive further intravenous antibiotics, Ureña said.“President Clinton continues to be in excellent spirits, and is deeply grateful for the outstanding care he is receiving and the well wishes that people have sent from across America and around the world," the statement said.An aide to the former president said that Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital, though not receiving ICU care.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, did not elaborate on the reason Clinton was in the ICU. He said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.Clinton was in good spirits and juggling books and watching TV coverage about his hospitalization, the aide said. Hillary Clinton was with him in the hospital, though not his daughter, Chelsea Clinton. There was no immediate word on any timeline for his release.President Joe Biden said Friday during remarks at the University of Connecticut that he had spoken to Clinton and the former president “sends his best.”"We’re all thinking about President Clinton today," he said. "He’s always been the comeback kid.”Later, Biden told reporters that Clinton is “not in any serious condition" and is “getting out shortly.”Clinton was hospitalized on Tuesday evening for what Ureña only described as a non-COVID-19-related infection.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.He repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, mostly notably his wife, Hillary, during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation said the former president was in the Los Angeles area for private events related to his charitable organization. The UCI Medical Center is in Orange County, about 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Los Angeles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-clinton-recovering-from-urological-infection-to-stay-in-hospital-overnight-101634339253658.html

"While CDC has not recommended mixing types of vaccine in a primary series, we recognize that this is increasingly common in other countries so should be accepted for the interpretation of vaccine records," a CDC spokeswoman said.The White House said Friday the new vaccine requirements for foreign nationals traveling to the United States will begin Nov. 8 for visitors crossing at land borders as well as international air travelers.Representative Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat representing a district along the Canadian border, had on Friday asked the CDC if it would accept the mixed vaccine doses noting "nearly four million Canadians, equivalent to 10% of their fully vaccinated population, have received mixed doses of the available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines – this includes the AstraZeneca vaccine."The CDC said the vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use, as well as those authorized by the WHO, will be accepted for entry into the United States, including the AstraZeneca vaccine.The CDC said "individuals who have any combination of two doses of an FDA approved/authorized or WHO emergency use listed COVID-19 two-dose series are considered fully vaccinated."The CDC plans to answer other questions and release a contact tracing order for international air visitors by Oct. 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-accept-mixed-doses-of-vaccines-from-international-travelers-says-cdc-101634338337192.html
