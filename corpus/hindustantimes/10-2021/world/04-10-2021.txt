However, the error message on Facebook's webpage suggested a Domain Name System (DNS) error.DNS allows web addresses to take users to their destinations. A similar outage at cloud company Akamai Technologies Inc took down multiple websites in July."We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products," the social media giant's official Twitter handle said on Monday."We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience." The official handles of WhatsApp and Instagram also took to Twitter to confirm the outage.Facebook shares fell 5.5% in afternoon trading on Monday, inching towards its worst day in nearly a year.Downdetector, which only tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform, showed there were more than 50,000 incidents of people reporting issues with Facebook and Instagram. The outage might be affecting a larger number of users.Meanwhile, the social-media giant's instant messaging platform WhatsApp was also down for over 35,000 users, while Messenger was down for nearly 9,800 users.Facebook has experienced similar widespread outages with its suite of apps this year in March and July.Several users using their Facebook credentials to log in to third-party apps such as Pokemon Go and Match Masters were also facing issues."If your game isn't running as usual please note that there's been an issue with Facebook login servers and the moment this gets fixed all will be back to normal," puzzle game app Match Masters said on its Twitter account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-faces-global-outage-shares-fall-55-101633368702438.html
04-10-2021||World||Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram face worldwide outage||Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms were down in parts of the world on Monday. The company said it was “aware that some people are having trouble accessing Facebook app” and it was working on restoring access. The company did not say what might be causing the outage, which began around 11:45 ET. It is normal for websites and apps to suffer outages, though one on a global scale is rare. Users reported being unable to access Facebook in California, New York and Europe. Facebook is going through a major crisis after the whistleblower who was the source of The Wall Street Journal's series of stories exposing the company's awareness of internal research into the negative effects of its products and decisions went public on “60 Minutes" on Sunday. Frances Haugen was identified in a “60 Minutes” interview Sunday as the woman who anonymously filed complaints with federal law enforcement that the company’s own research shows how it magnifies hate and misinformation, leads to increased polarization and that Instagram, specifically, can harm teenage girls' mental health. The Journal's stories, called “The Facebook Files,” painted a picture of a company focused on growth and its own interests instead of the public good. Facebook has tried to play down the research. Nick Clegg, Clegg, the company’s vice president of policy and public affairs, wrote to Facebook employees in a memo Friday that “social media has had a big impact on society in recent years, and Facebook is often a place where much of this debate plays out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-face-worldwide-outage-101633369058568.html

Social media users took to Twitter to report that they were unable to access the services of the aforementioned sites.Downdetector.com, a website that tracks issues related to traffic on major websites, also saw a spike in number of reports which confirmed that a large number of people are unable to access WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.  More than 20,000 people have reported that the WhatsApp is not working for them.

We're working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.”The WhatsApp messaging app is unable to send or receive messages while Instagram and Facebook's messaging platforms are also facing an outage. News agencies Reuters and AFP have confirmed that the outage is faced by users worldwide. The outage has impacted potentially tens of millions of users. Candid Wüest, Acronis's VP of Cyber Protection Research, said the outage may have happened due to issues with the BGP or DNS protocol.“While there’s no confirmation on what caused the incident from Facebook Inc, it’s possible that the issue lies with the BGP or DNS protocol – which happen to be popular targets among cyber criminals…. Depending on what service is attacked – for example, if it’s a central authentication server shared between multiple brands, like in this case, then such a single outage can lead to multiple brands going offline. To be fair, we must note that most commonly such outages are caused by non-malicious actions – suspect it to be the case here too," Wüest said in an email statement. Netizens react with hilarious memes as as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp faceThe website downdetector.com also showed that at least 87,000 people, till the time of writing this reported that they could not access Facebook.

04-10-2021||World||In a first after 2 years, Iran allows female fans to enter stadium for match||Iran has permitted its women nationals to enter a stadium for the first time in two years to watch the national football team take on South Korea in a World Cup 2022 qualifier. “The presence of women has been authorized for the match between the national football teams of Iran and South Korea,” AFP reported on Monday, citing the state-TV-linked Young Journalists Club. The match will be held at Azadi stadium on October 12.The last time Iranian women were allowed to attend a football match was in 2019 when Iran won a match against Cambodia with a score of 14-0. As many as 3,500 women were able to watch the match in 2019 in the 80,000-seat Azadi stadium.There has been a year-long prohibition on supporters’ attendance at stadiums regardless of gender due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19). However, female audiences have always been capped by the country’s government, AFP reported.In 2019 when Iranian women took to the Azadi stadium as supporters, it was a scene of exuberance with visuals showing elated fans cheering for their national team.The ban on women supporters was imposed in 1979 after Iran’s Islamic revolution wherein Muslim clerics stated that women must be protected from masculine environment, inappropriate male behaviour and images of semi-robed men. However, it is not written into law or regulations, according to FP.On the road to the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar – the first time the event is being held in an Arab nation, FIFA has reportedly come down heavily on Iran for its hardline conservative views. This was presumably the reason behind the country allowing female fans to attend the Iran versus Cambodia match in 2019, although the Iran government dismissed the report. The government had instead stated that the decision was triggered due to “internal social demands and government’s support of those demands,” AFP had reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-after-2-years-iran-allows-female-fans-to-enter-stadium-for-match-101633361098115.html
04-10-2021||World||Taliban face shift from war to policing streets||One fighter after another, the Taliban are trading in their characteristic long flowing garb for stiff military uniforms.It is a symbol of the moment of transition they find themselves in: Once warriors embedded in Afghanistan's rugged mountains, now they are an urban police force.But change is always an adjustment.In the Afghan capital of Kabul, crime was rampant under the previous government of Ashraf Ghani. Robberies and kidnappings were a near daily occurrence and the judicial process time-consuming and expensive.By winning the country after two decades of war with the Aug. 15 seizure of Kabul, the Taliban also inherited a city marked by lawlessness.Immediately they set to work, making their presence known in daily street patrols. Some have done away with the typical AK-47 rifles, for US-made M16s left behind by Afghan forces.They halt street fights, summon suspected criminals to police stations and chase those who do not heed their call.In Kabul's police district 8, there is a long queue leading to two rooms. In one, there are criminal cases. In another, civilian disputes. Victims of stabbings, robbery and other misdeeds sit in the same room as alleged perpetrators, staring into the distance until it's their turn to plead their case.For lesser crimes, Taliban police offer the accused three days to show up to the station. After that, they go after them.The court system is a work in progress, officials said. Meetings are still underway between Taliban officials — used to tribal justice prevalent in rural Afghanistan — to work out the process in a sprawling city with an active judiciary.Even those who fear them in the embattled city welcome the peace their arrival has wrought.The Taliban have empowered local elders to pass judgement based on Shariah, or Islamic law, for minor criminal cases. In the Sheikh Zayed City residential area of Kabul, a committee of elders ordered the father of a man accused of stabbing a neighbor to pay 35,000 Afghanis, around $400.The father counts the banknotes in a rapid shuffle and hands it to the imam, who offers it to the family of the victim. They embrace. Justice served.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-face-shift-from-war-to-policing-streets-101633354528351.html

Abdul Rahaman, a resident in the capital city who is working with the government stated that special forces of the Islamic Emirate attacked at least three residences in his neighbourhood, adding, the fighting went on for hours.At least five casualties were reported and 11 were wounded in Sunday’s bomb blast in Kabul. People inside the Eid Gah mosque were holding a ceremony in the memory of Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid’s mother, who died the previous week. Citing initial inputs, Mujahid said on Monday that those responsible for the blast right outside the mosque might have been Daesh-linked groups.A government cultural commission official, on the condition of anonymity, told AFP that three people were arrested in connection with the blast. The explosive planted at the entrance of the mosque detonated as people were leaving the premises after offering condolences to Mujahid and his family, the official added.Meanwhile, a witness at the mosque told the news agency the attack was carried out by a single suicide bomber. A group of Taliban members, who were inside the mosque grounds came under fire after the explosion and took two casualties, the witness said.He also added that two units of the Taliban by mistake opened fire on each other because of the confusion after the explosion. However, interior ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti denied the reports of any gunfire.(With AFP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hours-after-kabul-mosque-blast-taliban-destroy-is-cell-in-afghan-capital-101633341646413.html

Over 5,000 people had attended the event that was originally scheduled for October 4, to align with the fest day of Saint Francis of Assisi.In 1931, World Animal Day became global during a world protection organisation conference in Florence, Italy. In 2002, the Finnish Association of Animal Protection Associations celebrated the day and even involved school children in its events.Significance of World Animal DayThe day focuses on creating awareness about the effects of individuals, businesses and other human behaviours on animals. It is also known as ‘Animal Lovers Day’ as it encourages love, care, affection and protection of animals through the involvement of individuals and organisations who work for the rights of animals.Aim of World Animal DayAccording to the website of World Animal Day, the main aim is to raise the status of animals and help improve welfare standards across the globe.

04-10-2021||World||Blast hits Kabul after Taliban hold rally||Taliban supporters and senior figures held their first mass rally near Kabul on Sunday, but the show of strength was overshadowed by a bomb blast targeting mourners inside the Afghan capital.In a sign that the Taliban victory has not brought an end to violence after Afghanistan’s 20-year conflict, an explosion killed several people outside Kabul’s Eid Gah mosque.A Taliban soldier who said he saw the explosion said two people were killed and eight wounded. He said there appeared to have been two bombers and added that one of these was killed and the other caught trying to escape.Local media quoted the ministry of the interior as saying eight people had been killed and 20 wounded but one Taliban official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the final total would be higher.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had said on Saturday that a prayer ceremony would be held at the mosque for his mother following her recent death. He made no reference to this on Sunday as he tweeted that the blast had killed several civilians in the area. A cultural commission official, who asked not to be named, told AFP that “three people in connection with the blast”, he said.According to the official, the device was placed at the entrance to the mosque and detonated as mourners were leaving after offering condolences to Mujahid and his family.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August, attacks by Islamic State group militants against them have increased.IS maintains a strong presence in the eastern province of Nangarhar and considers the Taliban an enemy. It has claimed several attacks against them, including several killings in the provincial capital of Jalalabad.Haqqani addresses rallyThe blast, which could be heard across the centre of the capital, came shortly after the new Taliban “interim government” staged a rally just outside the capital, from which they were driven out in 2001 in a US-led operation launched after the 9/11 attacks.Sunday’s pro-Taliban rally in Kohdaman township in the hilly outskirts of Kabul was attended by 1,500 men and boys.“This is the day we waited for,” said Khalil Haqqani, the new minister for refugees who in 2011 was labelled a terrorist by the United States with a $5 million bounty on his head. He is a prominent leader of the Haqqani militant network founded by his brother Jalaluddin.“We have achieved our goal, but it requires protection,” he told the gathering, with his rifle leaning against the lectern.“My advice to the world is that they leave Afghanistan to Afghanistan.”Classes to be segregatedAn official with Afghanistan’s ministry of higher education said men and women will be segregated when university classes resume on October 9, after the Taliban and Kabul University disputed reports that female students will be temporarily barred.“They’ll resume their education in separate classes as planned,” Mohammad Edris, assistant secretary to the minister of higher education, said by phone from Kabul on Saturday.Separately, Pakistan’s interior minister Sheikh Rashid defended the government’s move to hold talks with banned terror group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for “reconciliation”, saying the negotiations are for “good Taliban”.Defending the government’s move, the minister said the offer was not for militants who were responsible for bloodshed in the country, including the December 2014 massacre in the Army Public School in Peshawar which left over 150 people dead, Dawn newspaper reported.“We know very well who’s good and who’s bad. Anyone who thinks we are not aware of that, he’s mistaken, he doesn’t have sense,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-hits-kabul-after-taliban-hold-rally-101633303690932.html
04-10-2021||World||Millions hidden offshore by rich, powerful: Probe||More than a dozen heads of state and governments, including the King of Jordan and the Czech prime minister, as well as other high-profile individuals, have amassed millions in secret offshore assets, according to an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The so-called Pandora Papers investigation - involving some 600 journalists from dozens of media including The Washington Post and The Guardian - is based on the leak of some 11.9 million documents from 14 financial services companies around the world.Key members of Pak PM’s inner circle namedOver 700 Pakistanis, including some ministers and key members of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s inner circle, were listed among the individuals whose names were linked with the Pandora Papers.Finance minister Shaukat Tarin, minister for water resources Moonis Elahi, Senator Faisal Vawda, the family of minister for industries and production Khusro Bakhtiar, among others, had links with offshore companies, Geo News reported.Some retired army officials, businessmen - including Axact’s CEO Shoaib Sheikh - and media company owners, have also been named in the leaks.According to the report, leaked documents revealed that “key members” of Prime Minister Khan’s inner circle, including cabinet ministers, their families and major financial backers “have secretly owned an array of companies and trusts holding millions of dollars of hidden wealth”.Hours before the leak, in a government letter released by local media, Panama’s government said it fears that the publication of a new expose about financial secrecy in global tax havens could again taint its reputation, which was seriously damaged by the “Panama Papers” scandal.“The damage could be insurmountable,” the Panamanian government said in the letter, sent through a law firm to ICIJ.The letter warns that “any publication” reinforcing “a false perception” of the country as a possible tax haven “will have devastating consequences for Panama and its people”.The letter also references some of the reforms that the Central American country has made in recent years, although it remains on the EU list of tax havens. The government fears that Panama will again be the epicentre of a new global tax havens scandal like the one that followed the ICIJ’s disclosure of the Panama Papers in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-hidden-offshore-by-rich-powerful-probe-101633303428181.html
