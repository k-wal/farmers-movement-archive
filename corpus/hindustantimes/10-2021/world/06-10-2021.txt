The report claims that the cable has provided the specific number of informants who were executed by adversarial intelligence agencies in the last few years, highlighting the struggle they are facing in recruiting spies around the world.“In recent years, adversarial intelligence services in countries such as Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan have been hunting down the C.I.A.’s sources and in some cases turning them into double agents,” the NYT said in a report Tuesday.In the last two decades, the Central Intelligence Agency has heavily invested in countries like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan in its war against terrorism. They have also been reportedly focusing on improving intelligence collection in China and Russia and US policymakers demand more insight on adversarial powers. While the loss of informants isn’t a new problem for American intelligence agencies, the cable underscores the gravity of the situation, the report suggests.The use of artificial intelligence, facial recognition, and other sophisticated tools have made it easier for foreign governments to track US intelligence officers operating in their country, according to the report. The monitoring of the intelligence officers could easily lead them to the agents working for the CIA.In 2009, a CIA operation in Afghanistan went wrong when a Jordianian doctor blew himself up at a US military base in Khost, killing seven CIA officers and one Jordanian officer. The triple agent, Humam Khalil al Balawi, had tricked the CIA officers into believing that he would spy for them. The problem of placing “mission over security” by not paying enough attention to the potential counterintelligence risk has been highlighted in the cable, according to the NYT report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-admits-china-pakistan-intelligence-services-hunting-down-informants-report-101633541995519.html

He was accompanied by deputy PM Chrystia Freeland as they addressed the media in Ottawa.Justin Trudeau said 80% of Canadians who had been vaccinated “don’t deserve to be slowed down in their desire to travel” as his government implements the vaccine passport system beginning on October 30. That will apply to all those planning to travel by plans and boarding will only be permitted with proof of Covid vaccination, and similar measures will be in place for those seeking to travel by trains and on ships for recreational purposes.These new rules will be in place for all those above 12 years of age since only those above that bracket are eligible to be jabbed. There will be some relaxation for those opting to get their vaccinations now and they will have to furnish a negative Covid-19 result but that leeway will expire by the end of November.Justin Trudeau said, “For the vast, vast majority of people, the rules are very simple - to travel, you’ve got to be vaccinated,” and added there will be only “a few extremely narrow exceptions, like a valid medical condition”.At the same time, the core public administration of the federal government, as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), will also be subject to the mandatory vaccine policy, covering 267,000 workers. They will have to provide their Covid vaccination status by the end of October and if they remain unvaccinated by mid-November, could face disciplinary action that could ultimately lead to termination.The Covid vaccine mandate was a major plank for the Liberals during the elections campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-enforce-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-public-staff-from-oct-30-justin-trudeau-101633539835550.html

Over the years, we‘ve invested significantly in technology that proactively detects hate speech, even before people report it to us,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a statement shared with HT.According to internal documents submitted with Haugen’s complaint, it is believed that only 0.2% of the reported hate speech is taken down by automated checks which are in place to monitor content on the social media platform.Also Read: Facebook knows it is in trouble as Mark Zuckerberg picks his battlesThe latest clarification follows a lengthy statement by Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Executive Officer of Facebook, earlier in the day. In this, Zuckerberg asserted that the claim that the company put profits over safety is “just not true.”The whistle-blower’s complaints also raised the issue of language classifiers, which should be able to check for translations as well.Classifiers are automated systems and algorithms that are designed to detect hate speech in content in social media posts on Facebook. The complaint said Facebook’s internal records show how this problem of lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers meant much of the reported content, particularly the anti-Muslim narrative, was never dealt with or flagged by the systems either. Yet, Facebook insists that Bengali and Hindi are among the 40 languages globally which are compatible as classifiers with systems and algorithms that detect content that violates content guidelines. “We now use this technology to proactively detect violating content in Hindi and Bengali, alongside over 40 languages globally. As a result, we’ve reduced the prevalence of hate speech globally – meaning the amount of the content people actually see - on Facebook by almost 50% in the last three quarters and it’s now down to 0.05% of all content viewed,” said the Facebook spokesperson. The company also said they have a team of content reviewers covering 20 Indian languages, who manually monitor content on Facebook. In the complaint filed with the US SEC, the whistleblower also said: “RSS (Indian nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamswvak Sangh) Users, Groups, and Pages promote fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives targeted pro-Hindu populations with V&I (violence and inciting) intent….”. Facebook denied any laxity in enforcing guidelines to protect any religion or marginalised groups against hate speech.“As hate speech against marginalized groups, including Muslims, continues to be on the rise globally, we continue to make progress on enforcement and are committed to updating our policies as hate speech evolves online,” said Facebook.HT has reached out to the BJP and RSS for their comments. The copy will be updated once they respond.The social media network, however, has not clarified its stance on the whistle-blower complaints about Facebook’s handling of the issue of duplicate accounts. This is internally known as Suma, or Single User Multiple Accounts.Facebook has also not touched upon the revelations that highlight the categorization India gets alongside the US presidential elections as well as the elections in Brazil. In 2020, the “Top 3 Policy Priorities” for Facebook are referenced as, “Tier O includes Brazil, India, United States” while Tier 1 includes Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Italy. It is not clear what the prioritization to Tier 0 means in terms of Facebook’s investment in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whistleblower-fallout-facebook-spotlights-tools-that-detect-hate-speech-101633538816010.html
06-10-2021||World||‘Not the way forward’: US diplomat Wendy Sherman ticks off China from India||Wendy Sherman, one of top US diplomats, on Wednesday sent China an unequivocal message while on a visit to New Delhi: “economic coercion” is not the way forward.It was a vital message conveyed by the diplomat from the region as China has been using predatory lending practices to build and bolster its influence in Sri Lanka and Maldives, threatening their sovereignty. Pakistan is a victim as well, but is going along in the interest of strategic ties with Beijing.“We don’t ask countries to choose between the United States and the PRC (the People’s Republic of China), but we do ask for a level-playing field. We do ask that countries understand that economic coercion is not the way forward to build a strong international economy and a global prosperity and peace and security,” Wendy Sherman said, joining the annual summit of the US-India Business Council, virtually from Delhi.Sherman’s remarks on China came in response to a question about US relationship with India and US relationship with China in the Indo-Pacific.With Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla also on the stage, Wendy Sherman said “democratic values are the bedrock of the US-India relationship”, which enjoys wide bipartisan support in both countries. The relationship is built on an international ruled-based order, as is America’s strong network of Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships. “Our partnership is essential to upholding that as we have a shared interest and we are major defence partners.”About the relationship with China, Wendy Sherman said that the US is “ready to compete and compete vigorously but we want a level-playing field … we’ll compete vigorously with China where we should and will cooperate with China where it’s in our interest to do so. We will challenge China where we must, where it undermines our interests, the interests of our partners and allies or threatens the rules-based international order.”She added: “I think we and India are like minded in that regard.”Wendy Sherman is the senior-most official of the Biden administration to visit China so far. India, on the other hand, has had two visits from top Biden cabinet officials - secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defence Lloyd Austin - and special presidential envoy on climate John Kerry and now Sherman.Shringla said India considers relations with the United States “of paramount importance” and not only for the sake of the two countries but also “in ensuring a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, and a peaceful and prosperous world”.Shringla spoke at length about the ongoing cooperation between the two sides on a whole range of issues and he pointed specifically to recent high-level engagements such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first in-person meeting with President Joe Biden for their first bilateral and then as part of the Quad. The prime minister also met US Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is of Indian descent.Harsh Vardhan Shringla also spoke on cooperation by the two sides on battling the Covid-19 pandemic - vaccine initiative launched by the Quad - and on climate change, stressing India’s determination to abide by its commitments under the Paris Accord and its ambitious agenda of creating 450 gigawatts of renewable sources of energy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-diplomat-wendy-sherman-ticks-off-china-from-india-101633537315547.html
06-10-2021||World||‘Historic day’: WHO recommends broad use of world's first malaria vaccine for children||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday recommended broad use of the world's first malaria vaccine for children, touting it as a breakthrough for “science, child health and malaria control.” The recommendation of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine is based on results from an ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, which began in 2019.Addressing a press briefing on malaria vaccine recommendations, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that tens of thousands of young lives could be saved every year by using the vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria.“This is a powerful new tool, but like Covid-19 vaccines, it’s not the only tool. Vaccination against malaria does not replace or reduce the need for other measures, including bednets, or seeking care for fever,” the WHO chief told the media briefing.Recalling his early career as a malaria researcher, Tedros said that he longed for the day that the world would have an effective vaccine against this "ancient and terrible disease.”"Today is that day; an historic day," he added.Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquito-borne disease causes fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Without prompt treatment, patients may develop severe complications and die. According to the UN health agency, children under the age of 5 are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria.Tedros noted that the world has made an "incredible progress" in the fight against the mosquito-borne disease in the past two decades but globally, the progress has stalled at an “unacceptably high level”, with over 200 million cases and 400,000 deaths every year.“Two-thirds of those deaths are children under five in Africa,” he said.According to a WHO estimate, nearly half of the world's population were at risk of the mosquito-borne disease in 2019, with most of the cases and deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-recommends-broad-use-of-world-s-first-malaria-vaccine-101633535951011.html

Anjum will head the spy agency which was earlier headed by lieutenant general Faiz Hameed. Hameed, who held the ISI chief post since 2019, was appointed as commander of the Peshawar Corps. Recently, his visit to Kabul raised questions over Pakistan's role in the Taliban cabinet.The ISI chief’s post is among the most influential and important posts in the Pakistan army, which is known to be calling the shots regarding the nation’s foreign and defence policies.Anjum belongs to the Punjab regiment of the Pakistan army, also served as commander of the Karachi corps as well as the commandant of the Command and Staff College Quetta.Anjum led several campaigns against elements which were threatening Pakistan in the Balochistan region and is considered a ‘battle-hardened soldier’. He served as the inspector general of the Frontier Corps Balochistan.His subordinates call him a “man with glacier brain but sharp reflexes”, news agency PTI reported. Anjum is known to be a good listener who speaks concisely. According to a news report by Pakistani news media Tribune, Anjum also held command postings in the eastern border of Pakistan i.e. the Line of Control. He graduated from the Royal College of Defense Studies in the UK and also holds a degree from the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies, Honolulu.Outgoing Hameed’s transfer to the Peshawar Corps is being seen as a crucial move following the Taliban takeover of the Afghanistan government. Hameed, before taking on the role of the spy chief, also served ISI as its head of internal security.Hameed was also among the first to conduct an official visit to Afghanistan following its fall to the Taliban. He met the Taliban leaders ahead of them announcing the government and also assured the world that ‘everything will be alright’ in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-lieutenant-general-nadeem-anjum-replacing-faiz-hameed-as-new-isi-chief-101633532138670.html
06-10-2021||World||Tensions flare as Chinese flights near Taiwan intensify||With record numbers of military flights near Taiwan over the last week, China has been showing a new intensity and military sophistication as it steps up its harassment of the island it claims as its own and asserts its territorial ambitions in the region.China's People's Liberation Army flew 56 planes off the southwest coast of Taiwan on Monday, setting a new record and capping four days of sustained pressure involving 149 flights — all in international airspace but prompting Taiwanese defense forces to scramble in response and raising fears that any misstep could provoke an unintended escalation.The sorties came as China, with growing diplomatic and military power, faces greater pushback from countries in the region and an increasing naval presence from the United States and other Western democracies in the Indo-Pacific as Taiwan pleads for more global support and recognition.The US called China's latest actions “risky” and “destabilizing,” while China responded that the US selling weapons to Taiwan and its ships navigating the Taiwan Strait were provocative.At the same time as the flights, the U.S. stepped up naval maneuvers in the Indo-Pacific with its allies, challenging Beijing's territorial claims in critical waterways.Taiwanese Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told legislators Wednesday that the situation “is the most severe in the 40 years since I’ve enlisted.”While most agree that war is not imminent, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen warned that more is at stake if Beijing makes good on past threats to seize the island by force if necessary.“If Taiwan were to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace and the democratic alliance system,” she wrote in an impassioned op-ed in Foreign Affairs magazine published Tuesday. “It would signal that in today’s global contest of values, authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy.”China regularly flies military aircraft into Taiwan's “air defense identification zone,” international airspace that Taiwan counts as a buffer in its defense strategy, although previous flights have usually involved a handful of planes at most.Perhaps more significant than the number of planes was the constitution of the group, with fighters, bombers and airborne early warning aircraft, said Euan Graham, a defense analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore.“That's the level of sophistication — it looks like a strike package, and that's part of the step up in pressure,” he said. “This is not a couple of fighters coming close and then going straight back after putting one wing across the median; this is a much more purposeful maneuver.”Controlling Taiwan and its airspace is key to China's military strategy, with the area where the most recent sorties took place also leading to the west Pacific and the South China Sea.The latest maneuvers bring the total number of flights to more than 815 as of Monday since the Taiwanese government started publicly releasing the numbers a little more than a year ago.China has been rapidly improving and strengthening its military, and the most recent flights demonstrate a greater level of technical expertise and power, said Chen-Yi Tu, a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan.It's a marked contrast from 20, 30 years ago, when Chinese forces couldn't refuel in the air, or fly across the water, said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University and non-resident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.“I think China is trying to remind the U.S. and Taiwan that this is not then, that they have options,” she said. “They can do what they want, that they won’t be deterred.”At the same time, many democracies have been increasingly vocal in their support of Taiwan and have stepped up naval operations in the area.As China was conducting its most recent flights, 17 ships from six navies — the U.S., Britain, Japan, Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand — including three aircraft carriers and a Japanese helicopter carrier — carried out joint maneuvers off the Japanese island of Okinawa, northeast of Taiwan, meant to show their commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”A few days earlier, the British frigate HMS Richmond transited through the Taiwan Strait, announcing its presence on Twitter and angering China, which condemned the move as a “meaningless display of presence with an insidious intention.”The international actions are an attempt to counter China's frequent claim that its own actions are in response to American moves, and demonstrate that democracies intend to defend established maritime laws and norms, Graham said.“When the U.K. sends a ship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time since 2008 and it sailed down the median line, the point that it's making is that they know China knows where that line is,” he said. “In order for the status quo to be meaningful, it has to be upheld and the most emphatic way to do that is to physically demonstrate with a government asset like a warship.”Australia, which also spoke out against China's recent flights, last month announced a deal with the U.S. and Britain to obtain nuclear-powered submarines, which was seen as a strong statement it planned to play a greater role.And Japan, which has long been cautious with its relations with China, a key trading partner, now considers the country a security threat amid Beijing’s increasingly assertive activity in the regional seas and around the Taiwan Strait. New Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said dialogue with China is important but Japan should also team up with like-minded democracies and step up its security alliance with the U.S. and other partners while Tokyo also strengthens its defense capabilities.“We are seeing a slow emergence of some sort of coalition of democracies in the region that are trying to come together to build some sort of mechanism to respond to Chinese behavior in the region,” said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, D.C.Under longstanding policy, the United States provides political and military support for Taiwan, but does not explicitly promise to defend it from a Chinese attack.Still, as the U.S. increases its military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese response has been to increase its own, said Yue Gang, a retired Chinese army colonel and Beijing-based military commentator.“The Biden administration has been increasing military deterrence against China, not only by dispatching many warships and warplanes, but also showcasing its allies,” he said. “One of the possibilities is that the mainland hopes to send a signal it will not be misjudged as weak.”The Chinese flights into the Taiwanese defense buffer zone have forced Taiwan to scramble its own aircraft and anti-aircraft missile batteries, wearing down their readiness and reducing their capabilities, Yue said.“Every time a warplane takes off, the engine life is reduced to some extent,” he said.In addition to keeping Taiwan on edge, the sorties also help the Chinese pilots keep their edge, and could eventually help give them an element of surprise “if the scenario is to eventually use hard power to resolve their unification claim over Taiwan,” Graham said.“It's hard to know if exercise 39 or exercise 57 is the one that isn't an exercise,” he said.For the moment, however, most agree that is not the immediate goal.“It’s more signaling and psychological warfare and a warning to the U.S. to not be so close to Taiwan,” Mastro said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-as-chinese-flights-near-taiwan-intensify-101633524793053.html

The firm’s Henley Passport Index has ranked all passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa. The index, however, doesn’t take into account the temporary travel restrictions imposed by the countries due to Covid-19.Japan and Singapore are at the top of the Henley Passport Index with both countries having a visa-free score of 192, which means holders of passports of these two countries can travel to 192 countries without a prior visa. Passports of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Yemen are among the least powerful. Indian passports are ranked 90, along with Burkina Faso and Tajikistan, as the passport holders of these three countries can access 58 countries without a prior visa.Here’s the top 10 ranking of world’s most powerful passports:1. Japan, Singapore (visa-free score - 192)2. Germany, South Korea (visa-free score - 190)3. Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain (visa-free score - 189)4. Austria, Denmark (visa-free score - 188)5.

06-10-2021||World||EU alarmed as soaring energy prices threaten recovery||The European Union sounded the alarm on the potential of soaring energy prices to undermine the bloc’s economy, and pledged new guidance for member states struggling to contain the crisis.The EU didn’t respond directly to respond to nations’ demands for action, and instead vowed to set out recommendations for member states next week on the measures they can take without undermining EU rules. They will include compensation for the most vulnerable households, tax cuts and state aid for companies, EU energy chief Kadri Simson said Wednesday. “This price shock cannot be underestimated,” Simson told members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg during a debate on the crisis. “It is hurting our citizens and in particular the most vulnerable households, weakening competitiveness and adding to inflationary pressure. If left unchecked, it risks compromising Europe’s recovery as it takes hold.”To boost its resilience to market shocks in the longer term, the EU plans to strengthen rules on gas storage and energy supply security. Gas and power prices are soaring to all-time highs across the 27-nation bloc as rebounding demand coincides with limited gas imports from Russia and Norway. Analysts expect energy costs to keep rising in the coming months as Europe moves into the heating season.The surge in prices comes as the EU started enacting sweeping reform to reduce emissions. Under the Green Deal, the bloc wants to clean up every sector, boosting the price on carbon, banning new combustion-engine cars from 2035 and putting its farming on a more sustainable path. The overarching goal is to reach climate neutrality by 2050.With the crisis raising electricity bills across Europe, the challenge for politicians is to ensure that citizens don’t turn their backs on the green transformation, which carries its own costs. The EU’s planned shift away from dirty fossil fuels to renewables is the only lasting solution to the region’s energy challenge, Simson told lawmakers, adding that soaring prices have little to do with climate policies.Divisions among leaders over how to tackle the energy crunch were on display as they gathered for the second day of a summit on the wooded Brdo estate in Slovenia. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban seized the opportunity of his arrival to express his frustration and slam the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. Orban blamed spiking prices on the EU’s ambitious climate plan, saying it was “indirect taxation” on car and home owners. His Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte said last night that the high energy prices had only a “limited” connection to the energy transition.Coordinated ResponseTo alleviate the impact of the crisis, the EU must respond with coordinated action, leveraging the strength of its single market and boosting future resilience, according to the bloc’s energy chief.  “Providing targeted support to consumers, direct payments to those most at risk of energy poverty, cutting energy taxes, shifting charges to general taxation, are all measures that can be taken very swiftly, under EU rules,” Simson said. “Business and in particular SMEs can be given relief through state aid, or by facilitating longer-term power purchase agreements.”Europe also needs to ensure that its energy markets work in a fair and transparent manner, she told lawmakers, flagging the role of competition authorities and national regulations in surveillance and preventing abuse. Some lawmakers and national governments have called on the Commission to investigate the role of Russian exporter Gazprom PJSC in the price spike, suspecting market manipulation. “We have to make sure that no state or non-state actor, be it Russian Federation, Gazprom, or anyone else manipulates or influences European energy prices,” said Siegfried Muresan, a lawmaker representing the European People’s Party, the biggest political group in the EU Parliament. “If this occurs then we have to take measures, then sanctions are obviously unavoidable against such entities, be it private companies or not.”The crisis was caused by a mix of ingredients, including increased demand, lower supply and weaker renewable energy production in some regions due to less wind, according to the commissioner. Russian Supply“While long-term contracts from Russia are respected, no extra capacity was booked, despite the rising prices, exacerbating the tight balance,” she said.By the end of this year, Simson wants to propose a reform of the gas market, reviewing rules on storage and security of supply. The commission is also analyzing a proposal by member states including Spain and France to create a joint platform for purchasing emergency gas reserves. The underground gas storage level is currently above 75% across Europe, lower than 10-year average but adequate to cover the winter season requirements, according to Simson. The evolution during the cold months will be a key variable to watch closely, she said. “This price shock is an unexpected crisis, at a critical juncture,” she told the lawmakers. “We must respond together and stay the course towards a cleaner, more secure and more affordable energy future.”(Updates with comments from EU leaders in seventh paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-alarmed-as-soaring-energy-prices-threaten-recovery-101633526352266.html
06-10-2021||World||Final call on sanctions on S-400 deal to be taken by Prez Biden, Blinken: US dy secretary of state||NEW DELHI: A top American diplomat on Wednesday described the Russian-made S-400 air defence system as “dangerous” but said the US is hopeful of resolving problems with India on the issue through discussions. US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman told a small group of reporters after her meetings with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval that a final decision on possible sanctions on the S-400 deal will be made by President Joe Biden and secretary of state Antony Blinken. “We’ve been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest,” she said. “That said, we have a strong partnership with India. We want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems and I hope we will be able to in this instance as well,” Sherman added. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the US side raised the S-400 deal during the discussions on Wednesday and there was a feeling on both sides that there was a need for further talks on the issue to reach some sort of common ground. Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev had said last month that his country is expected to deliver the first batch of S-400 air defence systems under a $5.4-billion deal by October. There were no issues with the timeline for delivery of the systems, he had said. Indian Air Force chief, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhry, also told reporters on Tuesday that the first batch of S-400 systems is expected to arrive within this year.Sherman’s remarks about resolving differences over the S-400 deal reflected a softening of the US position. The previous Trump administration had threatened to slap sanctions on the deal under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The US has already imposed secondary sanctions under CAATSA on China and Turkey for military deals with Russia. The Indian side has said it is determined to go ahead with the S-400 deal in view of its national security interests and plans to create an air defence shield for key cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/final-call-on-sanctions-on-s-400-deal-to-be-taken-by-prez-biden-blinken-us-dy-secretary-of-state-101633527353878.html

The fatalities were roughly similar to the weekly death toll in the previous week.The WHO also noted that all the regions across the world reported a decline in cases except Europe, where the numbers of cases this week were almost similar to the corresponding previous week.According to the data, the largest decline in cases was in the African region, where the infection fell by about 43%. Middle East and Southeast Asia logged a dip in their Covid-19 cases by about 20%.In the Americas and the Western Pacific there was nearly decline of 12% in the cases of infections.Countries around the world reported a surge in daily Covid-19 cases earlier this year. During the surge, daily cases soared above record levels as the surge was mainly led by the Delta variant of Covid-19, a highly contagious mutation of the virus.In India as well, the infection rate had risen exponentially, bringing the healthcare system to its knees.

He had previously served in the ISI as the head of internal security.He is considered as close to Army chief General Qamar Bajwa and was appointed as ISI head at a crucial time due to several external and internal security challenges.He oversaw the crucial changes in Afghanistan where the Taliban took control in August.In September, he visited Kabul and told the media in a brief chat that "everything will be ok" in Afghanistan, when there were rumours about differences among Taliban ranks due to delay in the announcement of the government.The Army, in an official statement, also announced two more senior-level postings.Lt Gen Mohammad Amir was posted as Gujranwala corps commander, while Lt Gen Asim Munir was appointed as the Quarter Master General (QMG) of the Army, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-replaces-isi-chief-hameed-appointed-commander-of-peshawar-corps-101633519478012.html

Last year, the prize went to Emmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer A. Doudna of the United States for developing a gene-editing tool that has revolutionized science by providing a way to alter DNA.The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1.14 million). The prize money comes from a bequest left by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895.On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize in physiology or medicine to Americans David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries into how the human body perceives temperature and touch.The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded Tuesday to three scientists whose work found order in seeming disorder, helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature, including expanding our understanding of climate change.Over the coming days prizes will also be awarded for outstanding work in the fields of literature, peace and economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-for-chemistry-2021-benjamin-list-david-macmillan-declared-winners-101633514097815.html

Haqqani, younger brother of Taliban's new Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani of the infamous 'Haqqani Network', glorified Ghaznavi calling him "a renowned Muslim warrior"."Today, we visited the shrine of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, a renowned Muslim warrior & Mujahid of the 10th century. Ghaznavi (May the mercy of Allah be upon him) established a strong Muslim rule in the region from Ghazni & smashed the idol of Somnath," Anas Haqqani wrote about the visit on Twitter. He also posted pictures of the tomb.Today, we visited the shrine of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, a renowned Muslim warrior & Mujahid of the 10th century. Ghaznavi (May the mercy of Allah be upon him) established a strong Muslim rule in the region from Ghazni & smashed the idol of Somnath. pic.twitter.com/Ja92gYjX5jGhaznavi was the first independent ruler of the Turkic dynasty of Ghaznavids, who ruled from 998 to 1030 AD.According to history, Mahmud Ghaznavi finally ransacked the Somnath temple in 1026 AD. The chief deity of the temple is Lord Shiva. Ghaznavi specifically targeted Hindu temples, since they were the centres of wealth, economy and ideology for the Hindus.Anas Haqqani was a member of the Taliban's negotiation team in its political office in Doha.The Haqqani Network and the Taliban came closer during the 1990s, and this time too, the dreaded terror group is part of the government led by Taliban. In fact, Sirajuddin Haqqani - a global terrorist - heads Afghanistan's interior ministry.It is widely believed that Mullah Omar, the one-eyed founder of the Taliban, was radicalised in Darul Uloom Haqqania in Pakistan's Khyber-Paktunkhwa province, from which the Haqqani network derives its name.The Haqqani network is a jihad group incorporated in Pakistan with two of its members, Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of Taliban, and Khalil Haqqani, the Taliban emissary, carrying USD 15 million in reward on their head. The group is linked to some of the most brazen attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leader-anas-haqqani-praises-ghaznavi-who-attacked-somnath-temple-101633502816224.html

The Taliban leader was forced to issue an audio statement on September 13 to dispel reports about his death at the hands of Haqqani rivals. Baradar is said to have brought his own security and refused to take official security from the Interior Ministry despite the latter insisting that it was their job to provide personal security to the deputy PM.While Baradar is now understood to be living in Kabul Palace, his backer and defence minister Mullah Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, is still in Kandahar. Sirajuddin Haqqani still stays in shadows and remains off and on in Kabul with his relatives, Anas and Khalil Haqqani, wielding the Haqqani network’s gun power in the regime.According to Kabul watchers, with the arrival of Baradar, co-founder of Taliban, there will be escalation of tension within the government as the Yaqoob faction is a power rival to the ISI backed Haqqani faction with each Taliban leader on a solo political ambition. The same is the case with Afghan opposition to the Taliban with each leader ploughing a lone furrow and not willing to work together.Given the level of mistrust between the Taliban leaders, there is hardly any one for governance in the Sunni Pashtun Islamist set-up. With even pro-Taliban countries like China, Qatar, Pakistan, and Turkey still to recognize the terror regime with umbilical links with al Qaida, the Islamist regime has gone back to its brutal medieval ways by hanging so-called criminals from earth diggers and heavy-duty cranes in Herat province. These practices are like their brutal and repressive tactics during 1996-2001 period when Taliban under Mullah Omar held Kabul to AK-47 with medieval Islamic floggings the rule of the day.While Pakistan is trying to extract its pound of flesh by getting the Taliban to bring its cousin, Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan, on the negotiating table for a ceasefire, the west is embarrassed at its poor assessment of a so called moderate Taliban.India, on its part, is waiting for those involved in the Doha peace process to make the first move or else be held responsible for the frightening human rights situation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mullah-baradar-returns-to-kabul-refuses-official-security-from-haqqani-101633497107195.html

Defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said the situation was “the most serious” in more than 40 years since he joined the military, adding there was a risk of a “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait.“For me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,” Reuters quoted him telling a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.The committee is reviewing a special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for home-made weapons including missiles and warships, Reuters reported.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying blamed the US for the heightened tension, lashing out at US state department spokesperson Ned Price’s statement in which he said that the US was very concerned by China’s provocative military activity near Taiwan.“Taiwan belongs to China and the US is in no position to make irresponsible remarks. The relevant remarks by the US side seriously violate the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiqués and send an extremely wrong and irresponsible signal,” Hua said.“For quite some time, the US has been making negative moves by selling arms to Taiwan and strengthening official and military ties with Taiwan, including the launch of a $750 million arms sale plan to Taiwan, the landing of US military aircraft in Taiwan and frequent sailing of US warships across the Taiwan Strait,” she said.“These provocative moves undermine China-US relations and regional peace and stability. China is firmly opposed to them and has taken necessary countermeasures,” Hua Chunying added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-us-diplomats-to-meet-amid-heightened-tension-over-taiwan-101633496135938.html

The images were carried by The Sun, which said in a report that the men were accused of indulging in kidnapping.The tabloid quoted deputy governor Mawlawi Shir Ahmad Muhajir to report that the three men were killed after entering a man's home to rob him.The Sun report also said in its report that locals were seen clicking photos of the bodies hanging by their necks in Obe district of Herat in full public view.In the past week, the Taliban have arrested 85 alleged criminals, some accused of petty crimes, and others of murder, kidnapping and robbery, said Noor Ahmad Rabbani of the group's anti-crime department.On at least two occasions in Kabul, petty thieves were paraded around the streets to shame them, handcuffed, with their faces painted or with stale bread stuffed in their mouths.Since the Taliban takeover, many Afghans fear harsh punishments to return, in accordance with the hardline ideology the group practices. During their last time in power in the late 1990s, the Taliban imposed their harsh interpretation of Islamic law.That included punishments like the hand amputations, executions of murderers with a single bullet to the head, most often by a relative of the murder victim and all carried out in public. Religious police beat men for trimming their beards or for not attending prayers.Gun-toting Taliban have taken up positions at checkpoints across Kabul and gradually some have been made to wear uniforms - the beginnings of a new national security force, reported news agency AP, quoting officials.For many Kabul residents the sight of the fighters is frightening as they roam the streets freely, with their signature long hair, traditional dress and Kalashnikov rifles hanging by their sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-taliban-controlled-afghanistan-bodies-of-criminals-hanged-from-excavators-101633493926824.html

None of the 38 new appointments announced by chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid included women. They were comprised of members drawn entirely from the Taliban with little representation of minority groups. Also included were postings to humanitarian organisations.The appointments are the latest indication the Taliban government has no intention of heeding conditions from the international community that formal recognition of their rule would depend on their treatment of women and minority groups.Still, the Taliban seek international support as they grapple with the daunting challenges of an economy on the brink of collapse, drought, and a growing security threat from the Islamic State group.Among the new appointments was a political deputy for the prime minister, deputy ministers, and deputy head of the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Most of the positions consisted of army and defense ministry commanders and deputies across Afghanistan's provinces including Kabul, Helmand, Herat, and Kandahar.Since the militant group took control of Afghanistan in a blitz campaign in mid-August, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have paused disbursements to Kabul. The US froze billions of dollars in assets held in US accounts by the Afghan Central Bank.Foreign aid previously accounted for nearly 75 per cent of Afghanistan's public expenditure, according to a World Bank report. Without those funds, the Taliban are unable to pay public sector salaries, precipitating a spiraling economic crisis.The Taliban have described their appointments as part of an interim government but have not elaborated on whether there will be elections. In late September, Mujahid had held out the possibility of adding women to the Cabinet at a later time but provided no more details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-deputies-to-commanders-who-are-the-new-additions-in-taliban-cabinet-101633491295519.html

Taiwan's defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng, faced with a lawmaker's question in the country's parliament on Wednesday, said military tensions with China are at their worst in more than 40 years – certainly the “most serious” since he joined the military. He noted that there was an added risk of “misfire” across the sensitive Taiwan Strait; and that while China already has the required arsenal to take Taiwan by force, the cost of a “full scale” war for Beijing might be at its lowest by 2025, when a potential invasion seems likely.Also Read | Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-Pacific“For me as a military man, the urgency is right in front of me,” news agency Reuters quoted the Taiwan defence minister as saying at parliament. “By 2025, China will bring the cost and attrition to its lowest. It has the capacity now, but it will not start a war easily, having to take many other things into consideration.”Chiu Kuo-cheng, the defence minister, was answering a Taiwanese parliamentary committee reviewing special military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) for homemade weapons including missiles and warships.Taiwan's special military spending over the next five years will go mostly toward naval weapons including anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems. Taiwan is especially concerned by the recent advances made by China over the past several days when record numbers of Chinese military aircraft repeatedly flew over Taiwan's air defence identification zone.Over a four day period beginning last Friday, Taiwan reported close to 150 Chinese air force aircraft entered its air defence zone, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing's continued harassment of the island.Also Read | Taiwan warns against Chinese provocationsChina claims the democratic island of Taiwan as its own territory and says it should be taken by force if necessary.

A former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen, 37, revealed her identity as she testified before US lawmakers saying that the social media giant fuels division, harms children and needs to be regulated. Zuckerberg’s statement comes a day after the company faced a more than six-hour-long blackout across platforms due to a “faulty configuration change”. Services on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were affected in one of the longest outages the company ever faced."The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical," Zuckerberg posted a note to Facebook employees on his account."I don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. The moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction,” he added.Haugen appeared on “60 Minutes” Sunday night where she described how Facebook routinely made “disastrous” choices that put their business interests ahead of children, public safety, privacy and even democracy.“I used to work at Facebook. I joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us. But I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy,” Frances Haugen said in her testimony at the hearing of the subcommittee on consumer protection, product safety, and data security.“Facebook over and over again chose to optimise for its own interests like making more money,” she told “60 Minutes”, as quoted by Bloomberg.“When it comes to young people’s health or well-being, every negative experience matters. We have worked for years on industry-leading efforts to help people in these moments and I’m proud of the work we’ve done,” Zuckerberg contested.Last month, Wall Street Journal published internal Facebook research, provided by Haugen, that claimed Instagram made some mental health issues worse for teenagers on the platform. The company, which was developing a version of Instagram for children, has put that project on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-not-true-zuckerberg-denies-claims-of-facebook-prioritising-profit-over-safety-101633487954105.html
06-10-2021||World||US reveals nuclear bomb numbers for 1st time in 4 years after Trump blackout||The US State Department published on Tuesday the number of nuclear warheads the country stockpiles for the first time in four years, after former president Donald Trump placed a blackout on the data.As of September 30, 2020, the US military maintained 3,750 active and inactive nuclear warheads, down by 55 from a year earlier and by 72 from the same date in 2017.The figure was also the lowest level since the US nuclear stockpile peaked at the height of the Cold War with Russia in 1967, when the total was 31,255 warheads.The numbers were released Tuesday amid an effort by the administration of President Joe Biden to restart arms controls talks with Russia after they stalled under Trump."Increasing the transparency of states' nuclear stockpiles is important to nonproliferation and disarmament efforts," the State Department said in a statement.Trump, who pulled the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia, also left another crucial pact, the New Start Treaty on the rocks last year before its scheduled expiration on February 5.New Start caps the number of nuclear warheads held by Washington and Moscow, and letting it expire could have sparked a reversal of warhead reductions on both sides.Trump said he wanted a new deal that includes China, which only has a fraction of the warheads that the United States and Russia have.Biden, who came in to office on January 20, immediately proposed a five-year extension to New Start, which Russian President Vladimir Putin quickly agreed to.The deal caps at 1,550 the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed by Moscow and Washington.Last week Russian and US diplomats held talks behind closed doors in Geneva to begin discussions on a successor to New Start and also controls on conventional weapons.A US official called the talks "productive," but both sides said the mere fact of holding the talks was positive.According to a January 2021 tally by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which includes retired warheads -- not counted in the State Department's numbers -- the United States had 5,550 warheads, compared to 6,255 in Russia, 350 in China, 225 in Britain, and 290 in France.India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea have together around 460 nuclear warheads, according to the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reveals-nuclear-bomb-numbers-for-1st-time-in-4-years-after-trump-blackout-101633482864160.html

Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by China, which views the self-ruled democratic island as its territory to be retaken one day, by force if necessary.Tsai warned a failure to defend Taiwan would be “catastrophic” for both the island and the wider region in an article she wrote for Foreign Affairs published on Tuesday.“They should remember that if Taiwan were to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace and the democratic alliance system,” Tsai said.“It would signal that in today’s global contest of values, authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy.” Taiwan hopes for peaceful coexistence with China, she said, but “if its democracy and way of life are threatened, Taiwan will do whatever it takes to defend itself”.Tsai’s government on Monday urged Beijing to stop “irresponsible provocative actions” after a record 56 Chinese jets including nuclear-capable bombers crossed into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. Taiwan has reported 148 Chinese air force planes in the southern and southwestern part of its air defence zone over a four day period beginning on Friday, the same day China marked a key patriotic holiday, National Day.“Amid almost daily intrusions by the People’s Liberation Army, our position on cross-strait relations remains constant: Taiwan will not bend to pressure,” Tsai added.Premier Su Tseng-chang said in Taipei that, “Taiwan must be on alert. China is more and more over the top,” adding that “The world has also seen China’s repeated violations of regional peace and pressure on Taiwan.”Its defence ministry said Taiwan’s extra military spending of T$240 billion ($8.6 billion) over the next five years will go mostly towards naval weapons, including missiles and warships, warning that the threat from China was worse than ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-warns-against-chinese-provocations-101633479915682.html

Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 25,110 new confirmed cases on Tuesday and 895 new deaths - the country’s highest daily death toll in the pandemic.This month, records in fatalities came every other day: the previous record, of 890 deaths, was registered on Sunday, and the one before that, of 887 deaths, occurred on Friday.New Zealand said on Tuesday that it will start using vaccine certificates as proof of inoculation at large events and other high-risk settings from next month, as the country battles the spread of the Delta variant.Pfizer effectiveness fallsThe effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in preventing infection by the coronavirus dropped to 47% from 88% six months after the second dose, according to data published on Monday in the Lancet medical journal.The analysis showed that the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing hospitalisation and death remained high at 90% for at least six months.New York State’s largest health care provider, Northwell Health, has fired 1,400 employees who refused to get Covid-19 vaccinations.

06-10-2021||World||Facebook made ‘disastrous’ choices: Whistleblower Frances Haugen to US lawmakers||Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, on Tuesday told US lawmakers that the social media giant has made “disastrous” choices with regards to children, public safety, privacy and democracy and that the company needs “help” as it cannot fix these problems on its own.Asked specifically what needs to be done, Frances Haugen, who was a product manager with Facebook and handled democracy and misinformation issues, and on counterespionage as part of the civic misinformation team, suggested changes in a section of a 1996 law that protects online platforms from liability of their content to make Facebook reveal its decisions on algorithms and setting up a “dedicated oversight body”.“I used to work at Facebook. I joined Facebook because I think Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us. But I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy,” Frances Haugen said in her testimony at a hearing of the subcommittee on consumer protection, product safety, and data security. “The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes as they put their astronomical profits before people.”“Congressional action is needed. They won’t solve this crisis without your help,” she added.In response to a question about her work on counterespionage, Haugen said, “I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today.” Frances Haugen said the company was unable to investigate all the cases they detected because of understaffing.Frances Haugen left the company with thousands of documents on internal research that showed Facebook prioritised profits over safety as it pushed user engagement, by amplifying misinformation and hate-speech. She gave these documents to The Wall Street Journal, US Congress and regulators. In an interview to CBS 60 Minutes, she had said, the social media company prioritised “growth over safety”.“I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are. However, the choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children or our public safety, or our privacy and for our democracy. And that is why we must demand Facebook make changes,” Frances Haugen told lawmakers in her opening remarks.“The documents I have provided to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about its own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages,” she said.When asked what she would want Congress to do, Frances Haugen had two specific suggestions. One, reform Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act of 1996, which grants immunity from liability to online platforms for their content. But, she said, the reform must make Facebook reveal its “decisions about algorithms … Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritise growth, and virality and reactiveness over public safety”. And, two, there needs to be a “dedicated oversight body, because right now the only people in the world who are trained to analyse these experiments to understand what’s happening inside of Facebook are people who, you know, grew up inside of Facebook or Pinterest or another social media company”.There has been bipartisan concern in US Congress over big tech’s growing reach and influence, specially Facebook. The same subcommittee had a Facebook official over for a hearing last week. “Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children. And it’s not just that they made money, again, it’s that they value their profit more than the pain that they cause the children and their families,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, in his opening remarks, while whistleblower Frances Haugen nodded along. “Facebook exploited teens using powerful how algorithms and amplified their insecurities.”Senator Marsha Blackburn, the top Republican on the subcommittee, said, “Having seen the data that you’ve presented and the other studies that Facebook did not publicly share, I feel pretty confident that it is Facebook who has done the misrepresenting.”She added, “Here is what else we know - Facebook is not interested in making significant changes to improve kids’ safety on their platforms, at least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on posts or decreasing their ad revenues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-made-disastrous-choices-whistleblower-frances-haugen-to-us-lawmakers-101633452015500.html
06-10-2021||World||Not Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar could be the first to recognise Taliban cabinet||Pakistan and Qatar are jockeying for influence in Afghanistan and appear to be working towards recognising the Taliban setup in Kabul amid persisting security concerns within the world community, people familiar with developments said.Turkey, which has emerged as a key player in Afghanistan and played an important part in restoring operations at the Kabul airport, however, has linked any larger role in the war-torn country to the formation of an inclusive government by the Taliban.The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan and Qatar could well become the first two countries to recognise the Taliban’s interim cabinet. Both countries sent top leaders to Afghanistan following reports of differences within the Taliban ranks over the division of responsibilities and power-sharing.Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the chief of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, rushed to Afghanistan in early September, shortly after the first reports of differences within the Taliban leadership over the formation of a governing setup. Qatar’s foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani visited Kabul about a week later, and held talks with top Taliban leaders, including Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund.Lt Gen Hameed played a key role in helping put together the interim setup in Kabul, in which most of the important positions were given to hardliners from the Haqqani Network and the Kandahar faction of the Taliban, the people said. The move also led to the sidelining of Taliban leaders perceived as more moderate and outside the scope of Pakistan’s influence, such as Abdul Ghani Baradar.Both Pakistan and Qatar have also been lobbying the world community to engage with the Taliban. In a recent interview with Al-Jazeera, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the international community has to engage with the “new reality” in Kabul and unfreeze Afghanistan’s assets so that country can deal with a humanitarian crisis.Qatar’s emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, during his address to the UN General Assembly last month, too urged world leaders to engage with the Taliban. He stressed the “necessity of continuing dialogue with Taliban because boycott only leads to polarisation and reactions, whereas dialogue could bring in positive results”.A diplomat from a regional country, who declined to be named, said: “These are clear signs that Pakistan and Qatar are pressing others to take steps that will help their efforts to recognise the Taliban regime.”Turkey, which has emerged as a base for many former Afghan ministers and lawmakers following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15, has adopted a more nuanced position. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has linked even the taking over of operations at Kabul airport to the formation of an “inclusive” government in Afghanistan that embraces all factions and women.Also Read: Taliban face shift from war to policing streets“So long as that will be the question we won’t be present in Afghanistan, but if the government shall be more inclusive, we can be there, present, as Turkey,” he said last month.Turkey is also focused on protecting the interests of sizeable Turkic groups that account for a little more 10% of Afghanistan’s population.India has cautioned the world against rushing into recognising the Taliban setup, pointing out that it isn’t inclusive and was formed without negotiations. It is also wary about Pakistan’s role and influence with the Taliban.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it wouldn’t be surprising if Pakistan and Qatar recognise the Taliban setup, though other countries, including China, have adopted a wait-and-watch approach.“Since the formation of the Taliban’s interim cabinet, it has become clear that what Taliban elements in Doha were projecting was a facade. This setup belied the expectations of most countries, which don’t want to recognise a regime that includes UN-proscribed individuals. China, as a P5 member of the UN Security Council, is unlikely to do anything that complicates its quest for global leadership,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-turkey-pakistan-and-qatar-could-be-the-first-to-recognise-taliban-cabinet-101633438994577.html
