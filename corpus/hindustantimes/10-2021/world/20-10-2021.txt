The area served as a base for the Pakistani Taliban until a few years ago, when the army said it cleared the region of insurgents. But the violence has continued there.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attack.Senior police officer Abdul Samad Khan said two police officers and two soldiers were killed in the attack. He said troops launched a search operation in the region to find those who orchestrated the attack.Khan refused to speculate on who could be behind the attack.But suspicion fell of Pakistan’s own Taliban who have been emboldened by the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan, where thousands of Pakistani militants are still believed to be hiding.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 2,400-kilometer (1,500-mile) internationally recognized border known as the Durand Line, which was drawn in the 19th century when the British dominated South Asia. Kabul has never recognized the boundary.Before the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan often accused each other of turning a blind eye to militants operating along the porous frontier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-hits-security-vehicle-in-northwest-pakistan-killing-4-101634746295951.html

The Biden administration said that it has procured enough Covid-19 vaccine doses to support the vaccination of 28 million children if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorises Pfizer shots and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the same.“The vaccine will have packaging available in smaller configurations that will make it easier for physicians’ offices and other smaller, community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families,” the White House said in a statement.Vaccination for children will be available at more than 25,000 pediatric offices and other primary care centres across the United States, as per the plan. Apart from including more numbers of pediatric and primary care providers, the administration is working to provide vaccine supply in smaller package sizes to make it easier for physicians’ offices and community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families.About two-thirds of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated in the United States as the administration continues to expand its coverage. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the move to vaccinate children as several countries around the world are yet to vaccinate frontline workers and vulnerable populations, the US and other Western countries are moving swiftly to administer Covid shots to the younger population."The start of a vaccination program for children ages 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process and timeline, but our planning efforts mean that we will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation,” the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-details-plan-to-vaccinate-kids-age-5-11-as-pfizer-shots-clearance-nears-101634743291844.html
20-10-2021||World||US prepares to vaccinate 5-11 year olds against Covid-19||The United States on Wednesday rolled out a plan to administer Covid-19 vaccines to 28 million children in the 5-11 age group once it’s authorised and recommended by the health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The FDA meets on October 26 and the CDC on November 2-3 and approve the vaccine, Pfizer-BioNtech’s Comirnaty. Dosage will possibly be adjusted for children.Their go-ahead will make the United States the only country in the world to vaccinate children in the 5-11 age group against Covid-19. Many countries are vaccinating children 12 and older for SARS-CoV-2 or plan to, including India which may start inoculating at-risk children soon.“The start of a vaccination programme for children aged 5-11 will depend on the independent FDA and CDC process and timeline, but our planning efforts mean that we will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation,” the White House said in a fact-sheet.The Biden administration is ready to start rolling out vaccines for children in this age group after necessary authorisations are in as the White House listed out locations where the vaccine will be administered at - doctors’ offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centres, and school- and community-based sites. “If authorised by the FDA and recommended by the CDC, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 5-11 year olds will be a dose and formula specifically for this age group,” the fact-sheet said. “The vaccine will have packaging available in smaller configurations that will make it easier for physicians’ offices and other smaller, community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families.”Pending authorisation, the administration plans to distribute the vaccine in 10-dose vials in cartons of 10 vials each (100 doses total). It will be delivered in a newly updated product shipper, and the vaccine can be stored for up to 10 weeks at standard refrigeration temperatures and 6 months at ultra-cold temperatures, the White House said.The plans include supplying the vaccine with all the ancillary supplies that providers need to inoculate kids, including smaller needles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prepares-to-vaccinate-5-11-year-olds-against-covid19-101634743701985.html
20-10-2021||World||Parkland school shooter pleads guilty to 2018 massacre that left 17 dead||Nikolas Cruz pleaded guilty to murder on Wednesday in the 2018 high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.Cruz, 23, entered his pleas in a courtroom hearing attended by a dozen relatives of victims after answering a long list of questions from Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer aimed at confirming his mental competency. He was charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder for those wounded in the Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, located just outside Fort Lauderdale.A penalty trial will determine if Cruz will receive a sentence of death or life in prison without parole. Scherer plans to begin screening jurors next month in hopes testimony can begin in January.As several parents shook their heads, Cruz apologized, saying, “I'm very sorry for what I did. ... I can't live with myself sometimes." He also added that he wished it was up to the survivors to determine whether he lived or died.Several parents and other relatives of victims broke down in tears while listening to the court proceedings via a Zoom call.Cruz's attorneys announced his intention to plead guilty during a hearing last week.Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime died in the shooting, said he visited her grave this week to ask her for the strength to get through Wednesday's hearing.“She was the toughest, wisest person I ever knew," he said. “My daughter always fought for what was right. My daughter despised bullies and would put herself in the middle of someone being bullied to make it stop.”The guilty pleas will set the stage for a penalty trial in which 12 jurors will determine whether Cruz should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole. Given the case's notoriety, Scherer plans to screen thousands of prospective jurors. Hearings are scheduled throughout November and December, with a goal to start testimony in January.Following the pleas, Broward State Attorney Mike Satz recounted the details of the murders. Cruz killed the 14 students and three staff members on Valentine’s Day 2018 during a seven-minute rampage through a three-story building at Stoneman Douglas, investigators said. They said he shot victims in the hallways and in classrooms with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Cruz had been expelled from Stoneman Douglas a year earlier after a history of threatening, frightening, unusual and sometimes violent behavior that dated back to preschool.The shootings caused some Stoneman Douglas students to launch the March for Our Lives movement, which pushes for stronger gun restrictions nationally.Since days after the shooting, Cruz's attorneys had offered to have him plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, saying that would spare the community the emotional turmoil of reliving the attack at trial. But Satz rejected the offer, saying Cruz deserved a death sentence, and appointed himself lead prosecutor. Satz, 79, stepped down as state attorney in January after 44 years, but remains Cruz’s chief prosecutor.His successor, Harold Pryor, is opposed to the death penalty but has said he will follow the law. Like Satz, he never accepted the defense offer — as an elected official, that would have been difficult, even in liberal Broward County, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1.By having Cruz plead guilty, his attorneys will be able to argue during the penalty hearing that he took responsibility for his actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parkland-school-shooter-pleads-guilty-to-2018-massacre-that-left-17-dead-101634741709030.html
20-10-2021||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan accused of selling gifts received from other countries' heads||Pakistan's Opposition parties on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of selling gifts he received from other countries' heads, including an expensive watch worth USD 1 million.Gifts are routinely exchanged between heads of states or officers holding constitutional positions during a state visit. According to the gift depository (Toshakhana) rules, these gifts remain the property of the state unless sold at an open auction. Rules allow officials to retain gifts with a market value of less than ₹10,000 without paying anything, The Express Tribune newspaper reported."Imran Khan has sold the gifts he received from other countries," PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz tweeted in Urdu."Caliph Hazrat Omar (companion of Prophet Muhammad) was accountable for his shirt and robe and you (Imran Khan), on the other hand, looted foreign gifts from Toshakhana and you are talking of setting up a state of Madina? How can a person (Khan) be this insensitive, deaf, dumb and blind?" asked the daughter of deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif.Opposition alliance -- Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) -- president Maulana Fazlur Rehman said there are reports that prime minister Khan has sold a precious watch he received from a prince. "This is shameful," he said.Social media is rife with reports that Khan was gifted a watch worth USD 1 million by a prince of a Gulf country. The watch was allegedly sold in Dubai by Khan's close aide and USD 1 million was given to the prime minister. The prince reportedly knows the selling of the watch he gifted to Khan.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Punjab president Rana Sanaullah told a press conference on Wednesday that Pakistan was defamed because of the alleged selling of the gifts received by the premier from the heads of the states of other countries.Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication, Dr Shahbaz Gill, had earlier said the government was "maintaining secrecy" over details of gifts received by Prime Minister Khan from other heads of states as releasing their lists and "comparing them with those of other countries is considered inappropriate, especially by Islamic countries with whom Pakistan enjoys brotherly relations"."Usually PM Imran Khan deposits such gifts to the Toshakhana, however, if he desires to retain them with him, he has to pay an amount for it," he had said.Last month, the Pakistan government refused to make public details of gifts given to the prime minister by foreign heads of states, asserting that the disclosure can damage the country’s national interest and its relations with other states, after the Pakistan Information Commission sought details from the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in response to an application from a citizen on the issue.The PTI government challenged the matter in Islamabad High Court, arguing that details of the gifts received by the prime minister have been designated as “classified”, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-accused-of-selling-gifts-received-from-other-countries-heads-101634736971055.html
20-10-2021||World||Putin orders week-long paid holiday to curb rising Covid-19 cases in Russia||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday backed the Cabinet’s proposal to declare a non-working week and keep Russian workers away from their offices as coronavirus deaths surged to another daily record.The government task force on Wednesday reported 1,028 coronavirus deaths over the past 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. That brought Russia's total death toll to 226,353 which is by far the highest in Europe.Putin said Wednesday he supports the Cabinet’s proposal to introduce a nonworking period starting Oct. 30 and extending through the following week, when four of seven days already are state holidays. He added in some regions where the situation is the most threatening, the non-working period could start as early as Saturday.In some regions, mounting infections forced authorities to suspend medical assistance to the population as health care facilities were forced to focus on treating coronavirus patients.Russia's daily coronavirus mortality numbers have been surging for weeks and topped 1,000 for the first time over the weekend amid sluggish vaccination rates, lax public attitudes toward taking precautions and the government’s reluctance to toughen restrictions.About 45 million Russians, or 32% of the country’s nearly 146 million people, are fully vaccinated.Even though Russia in August 2020 became the first country of the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine and vaccines are plentiful, Russians have shown hesitancy about getting the shots, a skepticism blamed on conflicting signals sent by authorities.While extolling Sputnik V and three other domestic vaccines, state-controlled media were often critical of Western-made shots, a controversial message that many saw as feeding public doubts about vaccines in general.Until now, the Kremlin has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown like the one early on in the pandemic that dealt a heavy blow to the economy and sapped Putin’s popularity, empowering regional authorities across the country's 11 time zones to decide on local restrictions, depending on their situation.Many of Russia’s 85 regions already have restricted attendance at large public events and limited access to theaters, restaurants and other venues. Some have made vaccinations compulsory for certain public servants and people over 60.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted that the situation is “very sad,” noting that the level of vaccination in those regions was particularly low.In Moscow, however, life has continued as usual, with restaurants and movie theaters brimming with people, crowds swarming nightclubs and karaoke bars and commuters widely ignoring mask mandates on public transportation even as ICUs have filled in recent weeks.On Tuesday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said unvaccinated people over 60 will be required to stay home. He also told businesses to keep at least a third of their employees working remotely for three months starting Oct. 25.The government task force has registered a total of more than 8 million infections and its official COVID-19 toll ranks Russia as having the fifth-most pandemic deaths in the world behind the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico.However, state statistics agency Rosstat, which also counts deaths in which the virus wasn’t considered the main cause, has reported a much higher pandemic death toll — about 418,000 people with COVID-19 as of August. Based on that number, Russia would be the fourth hardest-hit nation, ahead of Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-orders-week-long-paid-holiday-to-curb-rising-covid-19-cases-in-russia-101634732980622.html
20-10-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth II, last seen with walking stick, 'advised to rest' on medical grounds||Queen Elizabeth II has taken ill and "has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days", Buckingham Palace informed on Wednesday. The announcement was made as the 95-year-old monarch cancelled a planned trip to Northern Ireland on medical grounds.Britain's domestic Press Association news agency, however, clarified that the decision was not related to the coronavirus and that she was resting at Windsor Castle in London, where she moved last year.She was also expected to attend events at the upcoming UN climate change summit in Glasgow next month, it added.The Queen was "in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements" the next two days to mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland, the palace said, as quoted by news agency AFP."The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future," the palace statement added.Queen Elizabeth II is Britain's longest-serving monarch, succeeded her father, King George VI, in 1952. She will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne next year. Her husband, Prince Philip, died aged 99 in April this year.The Queen appeared well on Tuesday evening, when she hosted a reception at Windsor for international business leaders, including the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, and senior British ministers, for a government investment summit.However, the latest palace statement will inevitably raise fears for her health. She was also seen for the first time at a major public event using a walking stick, AFP reported. Royal officials have denied its link to any health condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-last-seen-with-walking-stick-advised-to-rest-on-medical-grounds-101634730867016.html
20-10-2021||World||Europe aims to ease travel restrictions for fully vaccinated||European Union countries are trying to reach agreement on ways to ease pandemic travel restrictions within and into the bloc as leaders work to boost Covid-19 vaccination levels.One option under discussion ahead of a two-day EU summit in Brussels is a plan to effectively scrap the traffic-light system of green and red areas in the bloc that has been used to govern travel rules and instead allow anyone who has been vaccinated to travel freely, according to a European Commission informal proposal seen by Bloomberg.The plan would rely on the use of the widely adopted EU digital Covid passports, which have allowed travelers to cross borders without tests or quarantines since the summer if they can show they’ve been fully inoculated or recovered from the virus. Travelers without a Covid pass could be required to undergo tests after arriving in their destination.“Given the very sizable impact on the exercise of free movement, persons traveling within the EU should in principle no longer be required to quarantine save for very exceptional situations (e.g. new variants of concern),” the European Commission proposal says.Other jurisdictions have begun to open up rapidly in recent weeks after a slower start, with the U.K. simplifying its own traffic light system to a green and red list, with the latter now featuring only seven countries as of last week. The U.S., meanwhile, will admit vaccinated foreigners starting from Nov. 8, spurring demand on transatlantic routes that rank as the most lucrative for airlines and travel firms.At the same time, there are some worrying Covid trends that could slow the push to relax the rules. Tuesday saw the most single-day confirmed deaths in Europe since April, with the 7-day average also on the rise. A second option proposed by the commission would retain the traffic-light system, but refine the data used to produce the ratings. Member nations would be encouraged to implement simpler and more standardized rules for handling travelers from red or grey zones.The commission proposal would also maintain the use of the so-called emergency brake mechanism to be used to case of new variants of concern or outbreaks, but would aim to establish a common framework for when new restrictions should be triggered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-wants-to-make-travel-easier-for-the-fully-vaccinated-101634729109758.html

Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov addressed an international conference attended by the Taliban and said that his country noted the new administration in power in Afghanistan and their efforts to stabilise the political situation in the war-torn country.“A new administration is in power now,” news agency AFP quoted Lavrov as saying, during the meeting. “We note their efforts to stabilise the military and political situation and set up work of the state apparatus,” he further said.However, Lavrov also noted that several other extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) have been trying to exploit the security vacuum in the war-torn country and raise their profile.Also read | India, Taliban to meet today at Moscow Format in RussiaRussia further expressed regret that the US officials did not participate at the meeting in Moscow. The US earlier said it would not join this round of talks in Moscow, but expressed willingness to do so in the future, news agency Reuters reported.Expressing concerns over the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Russia also urged the international community to provide assistance to the country. “We are convinced that it is time to mobilise the resources of the international community to provide Kabul with effective financial humanitarian support, including to prevent a humanitarian crisis and reduce migration flows,” Reuters quoted Lavrov as saying.Meanwhile, the Taliban delegation was led by Afghanistan's deputy prime minister Abdul Salam Hanafi, who had also led the talks with other Western powers in the past. Last week, the Taliban had held discussions with the US and the European Union (EU), following which the EU pledged an assistance of one billion euros to prevent a 'humanitarian crisis' in Afghanistan. Following the Taliban’s takeover in August, several people were evacuated by the US and its allies while several others fled the country. The UN had previously warned of internal displacement of Afghan nationals after the militants took over the reigns.The talks came amidst the concerns expressed by Russian president Vladimir Putin about the gathering of IS fighters in Afghanistan and the possible disturbance of peace in Central Asian nations bordering Russia.Russia is one of the few countries that had not evacuated its diplomatic mission in Kabul despite the rapid and violent takeover of the country by the Taliban. However, the country is yet to officially recognise the Taliban regime and top officials have also hinted that no such discussions are currently in progress.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-recognises-taliban-s-efforts-towards-stability-in-afghanistan-calls-for-humanitarian-aid-101634729288316.html
20-10-2021||World||‘Technical glitch’ hits India’s strong response to China-led BRI at UN meet||India expressed strong opposition to the China-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) at a United Nations transport conference in Beijing last week despite a “technical problem”, which temporarily silenced the participating Indian diplomat’s microphone when delivering the speech.Priyanka Sohoni from the political section of the Indian embassy in Beijing was explaining New Delhi’s opposition to the BRI, the China-led intercontinental connectivity project, when her microphone went silent at the second UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference.The October 14-16 conference was organised by China in Beijing under the aegis of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).Minutes before Sohoni spoke, a Pakistani diplomat had heaped praise on the BRI, and its flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), calling it a “game changer” for the region in his speech.After talking on how “…expansion and strengthening of physical connectivity is an integral part of India’s economic and diplomatic initiatives,” Sohoni questioned the principles behind BRI.“There have been some references to the BRI at this conference. Here, I wish to say that as far as China’s BRI is concerned, we are uniquely affected by it. It’s inclusion of the so-called CPEC as a flagship project impinges on India’s sovereignty,” Sohoni said. “No country can support an initiative that ignores its core concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she said without naming either China or Pakistan.“This aside, there are also larger issues regarding how connectivity initiatives should be pursued. We are of the firm belief that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms. They must follow principles of openness, transparency and financial responsibility,” Sohoni said.It was at this juncture that her microphone stopped working, making it impossible for Chinese and international delegates to hear her.The connection was restored after DESA under-secretary general Liu Zhenmin - former Chinese vice foreign minister -- said it was a “technical problem” and asked Sohoni to “be patient”.Sohoni finished her speech after the connection was restored.“India for its part abides by these principles and stands ready to make collective efforts for sustainable developments through a human-centric approach,” she said at the end. “They must follow principles of openness, transparency and financial responsibility and be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty, equality and territorial integrity of nations.”The short interruption seemingly allowed the Chinese transport minister, Li Xiaopeng, present at the session, to respond to the Indian diplomat’s criticism of the BRI. “I would like to extend my apologies for the technical glitch just now when the Indian delegate spoke,” Li said in Mandarin.“I don’t want to be offensive. Just now you have mentioned a lot of topics. As for the topics you mentioned, I would like to make some complements,” Li said in what seemed to be a direct response to Sohoni’s statement.“The BRI is open and inclusive. We tried to improve the connectivity and seek the development of all countries. In the past eight years, all the international communities have welcomed this initiative. Up to now about 141 countries and 32 organisations have signed more than 200 agreements with China,” Li said.“A lot of important and practical projects have been implemented, which include a lot of important transport projects. I would like to invite all parties to contribute to the development of this (BRI) project,” Li said.A diplomat who has worked at the UN said that Li being allowed to seemingly respond to the Indian diplomat’s critical speech was a likely breach of UN protocol.President Xi Jinping had also mentioned the BRI in his speech to the conference on October 14. “China’s door of opening-up will only open wider, and will never be closed. China will continue to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen infrastructure connectivity with other countries, and develop a green Silk Road and a digital Silk Road at a faster pace,” Xi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/technical-glitch-hits-india-s-strong-response-to-china-led-bri-at-un-meet-101634729541741.html

It said that Europe was the only region in the world that reported a rise in cases, according to a report by news agency Associated Press.The WHO’s weekly assessment of Covid-19 which was released on Tuesday showed that there were 2.7 million new Covid-19 cases and more than 46,000 deaths last week globally. Europe recorded 1.3 million new cases and more than half the countries in this region reported a spike in the number of cases.The UK, Russia and Turkey were among the nations that accounted for the most number of Covid-19 cases. This is the third week in a row that the region has seen a rise in cases.Russia over the past week broke new daily records for new cases. Russia on Wednesday reported 1,028 Covid-19 deaths over the course of 24 hours, setting a new record. It also reported 34,073 new Covid-19 cases, up from 33,740 cases recorded on Tuesday. The rise in the number of cases led to the Russian government announcing a slew of restrictions in order to curb the spread of the disease.The UK reported 223 deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday - the highest single-day toll since March, according to news agency AFP. The report also said that the UK was averaging more than 40,000 new cases per day and there was also a rise in hospitalisations. Experts have asked the UK government to reinstate some of the Covid-19 restrictions in a bid to ease pressure on the hospitals.Turkey reported more than 25,000 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week and health officials have warned that the cases could rise further, according to a report by Turkish news agency Hürriyet Daily News. The nation reported 33,680 new cases over a period of 24 hours on October 12, reporting a rise for the first time since April 30 this year.Turkey and Russia also reported vaccine hesitancy among their citizens which could also exacerbate the pandemic-related situation in these nations.(with inputs from Reuters, Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-reports-7-rise-in-new-covid-19-cases-daily-deaths-in-russia-soar-101634725703718.html

It posted photographs of what appeared to be plumes of billlowing smoke, but it was not immediately possible for Reuters to geolocate the photographs.It was also not immediately possible to reach the Ethiopian government or the TPLF for comment. The two sides have been fighting a war for almost a year that has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million.The report of a strike comes two days after two airstrikes hit the city. Rebellious Tigrayan forces accused the Ethiopian government of launching the strikes. Though a government official initially denied any strikes, state-run media later reported the air force conducted an attack.The news follows intensified fighting in two other Ethiopian regions, where the central government's military is trying to recover territory taken by the TPLF, which recaptured Mekelle and most of the rest of Tigray several months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airstrike-hits-capital-of-ethiopia-s-tigray-second-time-this-week-101634717930039.html

The Board of Internal Economy, which administers functions of the house, and is chaired by its speaker, issued guidelines on Tuesday which stated that it has “determined’ that starting that day “individuals must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to be allowed within the House of Commons precinct”.The board’s current chair is outgoing speaker Anthony Rota. In the statement, he added that this “requirement will apply” to all those who wish to enter the precinct, including members and their staff, political research office employees, administration employees, members of the parliamentary press gallery, parliamentary business visitors, contractors and consultants.Exceptions will only be made for those who provide proof of a “medical contraindication” and they will have to furnish a negative Covid-19 test result before being allowed to enter.While the house functioned during the peaks of the pandemic since spring of last year, it has often been with reduced numbers due to the need for social distancing as well as a hybrid arrangement that included in-person attendance along with those joining in virtually.Mask and social distancing mandates will continue to be implemented. “These decisions were made to meet ongoing recommendations from public health authorities to help limit the spread of Covid-19 within the work environment,” the statement noted.This announcement comes as vaccine mandates are due to be enforced at the national level from the end of this month covering public sector employees.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the matter during a telephonic conversation with the leader of the Bloc Québécois, Yves-François Blanchet, ahead of the new session of parliament. A release from the prime minister’s office said Trudeau “emphasised the need for all members of parliament in the House of Commons to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-mps-must-be-fully-vaccinated-before-entering-house-of-commons-canadian-govt-101634708599102.html
20-10-2021||World||China’s transition to clean energy faster than expected: Study||The costs of solar and coal power in China could become comparable countrywide by 2023, a new US-China study has found, indicating that the country, the largest carbon emitter globally, could be at a tipping point towards transitioning to clean energy faster than expected.In two years, China will have the capacity to install solar power across the country at the same price as coal, and currently has that ability to do so in three-quarters of the country, the joint study found. “About 78.6% (79.7 PWh or petawatt-hour) of China’s technical potential will realise price parity to coal-fired power in 2021, with price parity achieved nationwide by 2023.”Solar energy could provide 43.2% of China’s electricity demands in 2060 at less than two-and-a-half US cents per kilowatt-hour, it found; for comparison, coal power tariffs in China ranged 3.6 to 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2019, researchers from Harvard, Tsinghua University in Beijing, Nankai University in Tianjin, and Renmin University of China in Beijing said in the study.The research forecast that “...nationwide parity is estimated to be achieved by 2023. Solar power in the North China, Northeast, East China, and Tibet grids is projected to achieve full price parity with coal in 2021, followed by the Central China, Northwest, and South China grids in 2023”.The research was published as the cover article of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer-reviewed science journal on Tuesday.“Today, subsidy-free solar power has become cheaper than coal power in most parts of China, and this cost-competitive advantage will soon expand to the whole country due to technology advances and cost declines,” Xi Lu from the School of Environment, Tsinghua University and co-corresponding author of the paper, said in a statement published by Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.The researchers, according to the Harvard statement, first found that the physical potential of solar PV, which includes how many solar panels can be installed and how much solar energy they can generate, in China reached 99.2 petawatt-hours in 2020.It was “…more than twice the country’s total consumption of energy in all forms, including not only electricity but also fuels consumed directly by vehicles, factories, building heating and more. The findings show solar PV is an enormous resource for China’s decarbonisation”.“They then demonstrated its cost-competitiveness, with 78.6% of the potential in 2020 equal to or lower than current prices of local coal-fired power, a share set to grow further. This cost advantage means China can invest in storage capacity, such as batteries, and still cost-effectively supply 7.2 petawatt-hours or 43.2% of country-wide electricity demand by 2060,” the statement said.“Our results demonstrate that the economic competitiveness of solar power combined with investments in storage systems could provide extra benefits for grid dispatch, which will be especially important for operation of future electric systems in China,” Xi, the Tsinghua university professor, said.China has the world’s largest solar power capacity, with 253 GW of installed capacity at the end-2020 compared with about 151 GW in the European Union, according to International Energy Agency data.China is expected to add up to 65 GigaWatts (GW) of solar power capacity in 2021, taking total solar installations beyond 300 GW by the end of the year, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) said at a conference in July this year.“Most now realise that climate change requires transitioning away from fossil energy use,” said Chris P Nielson, executive director of the Harvard-China Project and a co-author of the paper.“Not as many realise that decarbonising the power system is the linchpin, especially as more sectors become electrified, and that accommodation by the grid of renewable variability is the toughest part of the puzzle. It’s a huge breakthrough, and not just for China, if storage can make solar power grid-compatible at a competitive cost,” Nielson said.The report comes ahead of the global climate summit in Scotland beginning on October 31 as Beijing’s plans to change from coal-based energy will be a major factor in the world’s ability to limit climate change.Last week, President Xi Jinping pledged to accelerate the development of solar power in China. “[We will] step up our efforts in the development of renewable energy, and accelerate the planning of large-scale photovoltaic and wind power projects in [our] deserts and nearby areas,” he said, adding that the phase one of these projects with a combined installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts will begin construction soon.Xi has also pledged to peak carbon emission by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-transition-to-clean-energy-faster-than-expected-study-101634705778464.html
20-10-2021||World||Japan's Mount Aso erupts; Alert raised to level 3||Mount Aso, a volcano on Japan's main southern island of Kyushu, erupted on Wednesday, Japan's Meteorological Agency said, spewing volcanic ash 3,500 metres (2.17 miles) into the sky.The eruption took place at around 11:43 a.m. Tokyo time (0243 GMT), the agency said.There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage at the popular tourist destination.But, the meteorological agency raised the alert level for the volcano to level 3 on a scale of 5, telling people not to approach the mountain. It also warned of large volcanic blocks and pyroclastic flows scatterering within a range of approximately 1 kilometre from the mountain's Nakadake crater.Ash falls from one of the peaks of the 1,592-metre (5,222 feet) mountain in Kumamoto Prefecture will be detected in nearby towns until late afternoon on Wednesday, according to the agency.There was a small eruption at Mount Aso in 2019, and 63 people were killed on Mount Ontake in September 2014, which was the worst volcanic disaster in Japan for nearly 90 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-mount-aso-erupts-alert-level-raised-to-level-3-101634703493311.html

20-10-2021||World||Pakistan in deep economic crisis. Here's how much financial help it requires||Imran Khan, whose claim to political power was based on the promise of a new Pakistan, seems to be falling behind on one of his vows to make the country's economy stronger, as a recent media report claimed that Pakistan is now facing its biggest economic crisis in history. According to The News International, one of the largest English language newspapers in Pakistan, the country is in the throes of a deep financial crisis – with the Imran Khan-led regime ideally requiring gross external financing of $51.6 billion within a two-year period (2021-2023) in order to fulfill its needs.Also Read | End in sight for Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan' amid rising inflation in PakistanAs per the report, Pakistan's gross external financing requirement stands at $23.6 billion in 2021-22 and $28 billion in 2022-23. The development comes despite the very conservative estimates assessed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistani authorities are now reportedly trying to make a last-ditch effort to strike a staff-level agreement with the IMF to bridge the gap of external financing requirements.In a recent report, the World Bank noted that Pakistan has joined the list of top ten nations with the largest foreign debts. Citing the International Debt Statistics 2022, The News International reported earlier that there lies a “wide divergence” in the rate at which external debt is accumulated in individual DSSI-eligible countries – including the group's largest borrowers which include Pakistan. The World Bank report also pointed out that Pakistan's foreign debt increased by 8 per cent; in June this year, another report revealed that the Imran government had borrowed $442 million from the World Bank.However, with the suspension of program loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) now, Pakistan is further at risk of a monumental economic crisis – with the headache of the gross external financing requirement upon it – to deal with which it needs to anyhow strike a deal with the IMF under the existing $6 billion extended fund facility (EFF) during the ongoing parleys in Washington.Also Read | No more assistance to Pakistan, hold Imran Khan accountable now: Ex-US advisorMeanwhile, the WB and ADB will continue lending project loans but keeping in view the capacity to implement projects, the disbursement becomes dismally low. The credit rating agencies may further downgrade the country's ratings, so generating funds through the issuance of international bonds will become expensive, reported The News International.The IMF had been asking for the removal of distortions into the taxation system and also pointed out that different GST exemptions and rates should be aligned with the standard rate of 17 per cent, according to officials cited by the ANI news agency The standard GST rate of 17 per cent should be imposed on Petroleum Oil Lubricants (POL) products. The GST rate on fertilizer, tractors and other items should be brought at the standard rate of 17 per cent, as per the report. However, Pakistani authorities are opposing such proposals arguing that it would further marginalise the neglected agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-facing-deep-economic-crisis-here-s-how-much-financial-help-it-requires-101634695426803.html

20-10-2021||World||North Korea confirms submarine launch of new ballistic missile||North Korea test-fired a new, smaller ballistic missile from a submarine, state media confirmed on Wednesday, a move that analysts said could be aimed at more quickly fielding an operational missile submarine.The statement from state media came a day after South Korea's military reported that it believed North Korea had fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) off its east coast, the latest in a string of North Korean missile tests.The White House urged North Korea to refrain from further "provocations", with spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying on Tuesday the United States remained open to engaging diplomatically with North Korea over its weapons programs.Pyongyang so far has rejected those overtures, accusing the United States and South Korea of talking diplomacy while ratcheting up tensions with their own military activities.The "new-type" SLBM was launched from the same submarine involved in a 2016 test of an older SLBM, North Korea's state news agency KCNA said.North Korea has a large fleet of aging submarines, but has yet to deploy operational ballistic missile submarines beyond the experimental Gorae-class boat used in the tests.Photos released by KCNA appeared to show a thinner, smaller missile than North Korea's earlier SLBM designs, and may be a previously unseen model first showcased at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang last week.A smaller SLBM could mean more missiles stored on a single submarine, although with a shorter range, potentially putting nuclear-armed North Korea closer to fielding an operational ballistic missile submarine (SSB)."Though a smaller North Korea SLBM design could enable more missiles per boat, it could also enable smaller less challenging SSB designs, including easier integration/conversion on pre-existing submarines," Joseph Dempsey, a defence researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said on Twitter.Still, the development was expected to have only a limited impact on Pyongyang's arsenal until it made more progress on a larger submarine that has been seen under construction."It just means they're trying to diversify their submarine launch options," said Dave Schmerler, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California."It's an interesting development but with only one submarine in the water that can launch notionally one or two of these it doesn't change much."The new type SLBM featured advanced control guidance technologies including "flank mobility and gliding skip mobility," KCNA said."(The SLBM) will greatly contribute to putting the defence technology of the country on a high level and to enhancing the underwater operational capability of our navy," KCNA added.Schmerler said it was unclear exactly what KCNA meant by "flank mobility", but "glide skip" was a way to change a missile's trajectory to make it harder to track and intercept.North Korea has conducted a number of tests in recent years with short-range ballistic missiles that analysts say are designed to evade missile defence systems in South Korea.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was not reported to have attended Tuesday's test.The missile was launched from the sea in the vicinity of Sinpo, where North Korea keeps submarines as well as equipment for test firing SLBMs, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-confirms-submarine-launch-of-new-ballistic-missile-101634686185119.html
20-10-2021||World||India, Taliban to meet today at Moscow Format in Russia||An Indian delegation and Taliban officials will come face-to-face at the “Moscow Format” meeting hosted by Russia on Wednesday, with discussions expected to focus on the security situation and formation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan. The dialogue between the Taliban and 10 regional countries will be held a day after the US pulled out of a meeting of the “extended troika” hosted by Moscow on Tuesday. Only special representatives from Russia, China and Pakistan – the other members of the extended troika – participated in the meeting. The special representatives of Russia, China and Pakistan exchanged views on “common security threats [and] expressed their joint interest in providing Afghanistan with urgent humanitarian and economic assistance”, the Russian foreign ministry said. The US state department said on Monday the American special representative would not participate in the extended troika talks due to logistical reasons. On Tuesday, Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan who has taken some of the blame for the Taliban’s return to power, stepped down from the position. The Indian delegation to the third Moscow Format meeting will be led by JP Singh, the joint secretary who heads the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran desk in the external affairs ministry. The possibility of informal contacts between the Indian team and the Taliban on the margins of the meeting in Moscow has not been ruled out. The Moscow Format meeting, which will be attended by representatives from 10 countries of the region and the Taliban delegation, will be addressed by Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. The meeting will “discuss prospects for development of the military-political situation in Afghanistan and the formation of an inclusive government”, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday. “Participants will also touch upon the issues of consolidating efforts of the international community to prevent a humanitarian crisis in [Afghanistan]. Following the meeting, it is planned to adopt a joint statement,” the ministry added. The Moscow Format was established in 2017 as a six-party mechanism involving Russia, Afghanistan, India, Iran, China and Pakistan. It was later expanded with the inclusion of more countries and meetings were held in Moscow in 2017 and 2018. Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s special presidential envoy for Afghanistan, said on October 15 that Moscow intended to have a frank discussion with the Taliban during the Moscow Format meeting, but no “breakthrough decisions” were expected. The Russian side intends to “hold a sincere conversation behind closed doors with the representatives of the new Afghan leadership” and “convey our objections to the Afghan delegation”, Kabulov was quoted as saying by state-run TASS news agency. “We do not expect any breakthrough decisions, this is a long evolutionary process, we are proceeding from this understanding,” he said. Kabulov further said the discussions will focus on human rights issues and the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. He added that fighting drug trafficking and terror threats related to Afghanistan remain a priority for Russia and other countries. The Indian government has cautioned the world community against rushing to recognise the Taliban setup in Kabul, pointing out the change of power in Kabul was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-delegates-taliban-leaders-to-be-face-to-face-at-moscow-format-meet-in-russia-101634667714758.html
