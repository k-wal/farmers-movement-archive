23-10-2021||World||Singapore to permit entry of travellers from six countries, including India||Singapore will on Wednesday begin allowing the entry of travellers from six countries, including India, from which travel was barred, a move that is expected to benefit thousands of Indian students and professionals. The decision follows a review of Singapore’s Covid-19-related travel restrictions and is aimed at further opening up the country to international travellers. Singapore’s recent decision to open “Vaccinated Travel Lanes” for 11 countries, including Brunei, Germany, France, Italy and the UK, while excluding India had not gone down well with many Indians living and working in the city state. A statement issued by Singapore’s health ministry on Saturday said that, following a review of the Covid-19 situation in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all travellers with a 14-day travel history to these countries “prior to departure to Singapore will be allowed to enter and transit through Singapore” from October 27. Travellers from these six countries will still be subject to strict border measures, including a 10-day “stay-home notice” period at dedicated facilities.Singapore’s health minister Ong Ye Kung was quoted by the local media as saying at a news briefing that the situation in the six countries had stabilised for some time, and there was no longer a need for strict rules that barred travellers from these nations.Earlier, some Indians living and working in Singapore were irked that India had not been included in the list of countries with Vaccinated Travel Lanes. Indians living in Singapore had been unable to travel home for months. At the same time, Indians who had returned home in the early stages of the pandemic were unable to return to their jobs or educational courses because of the bar on travel from the six countries. The authorities in Singapore were aware of the growing anger on this count and had begun taking steps in recent weeks to address the matter, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Singapore will allow necessary workers and students to enter its borders in a safe and calibrated manner from November 1 on the condition that they are fully vaccinated before arrival. It will also facilitate the entry of more domestic workers to meet urgent domestic and caregiving needs of local households, while regulating the numbers carefully as the global situation evolves. Travellers from India and the five other countries will have to undergo pre-departure PCR tests within 48 hours, and an exit PCR test at the end of their “stay-home notice” (SHN) period. The charges for the 10-day SHN at a dedicated facility is $1,450.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-permit-entry-of-travellers-from-six-countries-including-india-101634996809942.html

The strait is regarded as international waters."The tasks of the patrols were the demonstration of the Russian and Chinese state flags, maintaining of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and guardianship of the subjects of maritime economic activities of the two countries," the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-hold-joint-patrols-in-the-pacific-japan-keeps-vigilance-101634984397748.html

This was the third jailbreak in the country this year. The authorities could not immediately ascertain the number of people who escaped the prison following the attack.The attack took place on late Friday night and the ongoing investigation into the incident is yet to reveal the extent of the damage.A handful of such attacks took place last year as well, with many raising alarm about the safety of detention facilities in the West African nation.“I can't ascertain the number of people that escaped or that were recaptured but I am telling you that the security has been beefed up around the custodial center and the town,” Olanrewaju Anjorin, a spokesman of the Oyo correctional centre in Oyo state, told the AP.With jailbreaks becoming more frequent recently, it has become difficult for the police to capture inmates who escape. Lagos-based online newspaper TheCable reported in July this year that at least 4,307 inmates had escaped from prisons since 2017, based on compiled media reports, according to the AP report.In 2021 alone, more than 2,000 inmates were freed in two earlier jailbreaks: on Sept 13 when 240 inmates were freed after gunmen attacked a detention facility in north-central Kogi state with explosives and on April 5 when at least 1,800 were freed in the southeast Imo state when another facility was also blown up.Even though the recent jailbreaks in the country seem to have no connection to each other, all of them have been carried out using explosives, said the AP report. Authorities succeeded in rearresting some escaped inmates, others reportedly returned willingly.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-jailbreak-in-nigeria-this-year-dozens-of-inmates-escape-101634979598850.html

23-10-2021||World||Pakistan asks TV channels to ban 'hug scenes', says 'disregard to culture': Reports||The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has asked local television channels to censor caress and hug scenes as the authorities have received several complaints against such elements in television dramas. The list of such objectionable content includes 'indecent dressing, caressing, bed scenes and gestures, sensitive or controversial plots and unnecessary detailing of events which are highly disturbing, distressing for the viewers and against the commonly accepted standards of decency," the order issued on Friday said. It comes in continuation of earlier directions from the authority issued from time to time, it said.Explaining the reason behind this move, the authorities said that they are not only receiving complaints from the general public but are also being chastised on WhatsApp groups. "A considerable stratum of the society believes that dramas are not depicting the true picture of Pakistani society. Hugs/Caress scenes/extramarital relations, vulgar/bold dressing, bed scenes and intimacy of married couple are being glamourised in utter disregard to Islamic teachings and culture of Pakistani society," it said."Forgoing in view, all satellite TV licensees are required to stop airing such content in dramas, henceforth, and ensure compliance of PEMRA laws in letter and spirit," it added.

The agreement, once formalised, would see American forces use Pakistan’s airspace for operations in the neighbouring Afghanistan, the report stated.Islamabad wants a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be signed in exchange for assistance with its own counter-terrorism efforts, CNN reported citing sources, adding that the terms of the deal, though not finalised yet, could still change. Discussions on the agreement are reported to have taken place during a recent visit of some US officials to Islamabad, though it is not yet known what Pakistan wants or how much is Washington willing to concede.Currently, the said airspace is used by American troops for their ongoing intelligence operations in Afghanistan. However, Washington needs a formal deal to ensure continued access to a critical air corridor within the airspace which is necessary for its forces to reach Afghanistan. The importance of this stretch is highlighted by the fact that it would become even more critical as and when the United States resumes its flights into Afghan capital Kabul to evacuate its Americans and others still left in the country.In the absence of any formal agreement, the US faces the possibility of Pakistan denying entry to the former’s military aircraft and drones moving towards Afghanistan.The exit of the US troops from Afghanistan brought to an end their 20-year-long military presence there. The Taliban, which seized power in Kabul on August 15, is ruling the nation for a second time.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nearing-deal-with-pakistan-to-use-airspace-for-military-operations-in-afghanistan-report-101634979591095.html

In capital Beijing, people living in some higher-risk areas of the Changping district, have been asked not to leave their residential compounds. Physical classes in schools close to these areas have been suspended, while nearby business areas have been directed to halt operations. This week itself, six local cases, including some due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, were detected in the Chinese capital.(2.) In the nearby Gansu province, long-distance bus services have been suspended in nearly a dozen cities. Trains connecting the provincial capital, Lanzhou, to Beijing have been halted, while only a single flight between the two cities is allowed. Some tourist attractions here have also been closed.(3.) Tourism destinations have also been suspended in provinces such as Qinghai and Ningxia. In the former, officials at an airport have halted services for passengers transferring flights. (4.) Travellers arriving from foreign countries, who have stayed in China for less than 28 days, will have to undergo tests for Covid-19 before entering Ningxia. Additionally, they will have to stay indoors for a week so that officials can monitor their health.(5.) In Xinjiang, railway authorities have halted the loading of cargo destined for some regions in the province till the end of the month. (6.) The latest outbreak was traced to an elderly couple, who were in a group of several tourists. The group started in Shanghai and, later, moved to different parts of the country. This led to the cluster spreading from north and north-western China to other areas, including Beijing.(7.) On October 22, there were 50 fresh Covid-19 cases, including 38 locally transmitted infections, the National Health Commission said, adding that a day ago, 28 people tested positive. The new cases were from Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Beijing, Ningxia and Yunnan.(8.) The total tally of cases detected in the country, since the pandemic first broke out in December 2019, stands at 96,715. With no new fatality, the death toll remains unchanged at 4636.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-curbs-to-control-fresh-covid-19-outbreak-all-you-need-to-know-101634970068482.html

The government is also drawing up rules for businesses with 100 or more employees to require vaccines or test unvaccinated staff at least once a week. The White House is set to issue additional guidelines in the near future.Adobe, the maker of Photoshop and Illustrator, said in a statement Friday that 94% of its U.S. workforce is “or will soon be fully vaccinated.” The San Jose, California-based company said it will consider accommodation requests for employees who aren’t vaccinated for religious or medical reasons.IBM issued a similar warning to staff earlier this month.

He also noted this is having “a dramatic impact on the human rights of the people inside the country", reported AP.North Koreans are facing food shortages and collapses in their livelihoods with the most vulnerable lot being children and elderly people who are at risk of starvation, Tomás Ojea Quintana told the General Assembly's human rights committee. He also highlighted the extent of hunger in political prison camps.For the unversed, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- the North's official name -- has closed its borders to prevent the pandemic. Other draconian steps taken by the government to prevent the spread of the viral disease in the nation include a policy of shooting individuals who attempt to enter or leave the country, Quintana said.The UN investigator further noted the closing of borders would have “a devastating impact” on the people's right to health as DPRK's health infrastructure suffers from underinvestment and a critical shortage of supplies caused by underlying human rights issues, according to the AP report.In his final report to the General Assembly after six years as the UN special investigator on human rights in the DPRK, Ojea Quintana added that “increased restrictions on freedom of movement and the shutting of national borders has choked market activity that has become essential for people's access to basic necessities, including food.”Even though North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has recognized the “grim” food situation and is investing in efforts to prevent starvation in the country, the border closure has put the lifesaving humanitarian work of the United Nations and other international actors on halt. The UN investigator said there are no United Nations international staff currently in the country and diplomats are continuing to leave.The UN investigator, in his report to the General Assembly, has recommended that in light of the pandemic, the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against the DPRK over its nuclear program “should re-evaluate the sanctions regime under these circumstances, and when necessary ease those sanctions.” While humanitarian aid to the DPRK is exempt from sanctions, Ojea Quintana said sanctions have had unintended consequences on ordinary people.As one example, he said, UN sanctions against the export of textiles and seafood -- industries where women are the predominant workers -- have resulted in women who are family bread-winners losing their jobs.In his report, Ojea Quintana also recognised the paradox of deteriorating social and economic rights in the DPRK while the government continues to test missiles, “probably diverting resources that should be allocated in those areas.”(With PTI, AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-koreans-facing-food-shortages-collapses-in-livelihoods-un-investigator-101634970710813.html
23-10-2021||World||Russia authorises simultaneous vaccination against Covid-19, influenza||Russia, which is currently facing an increased spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), authorised simultaneous vaccination against Covid-19 and influenza."Russia’s Health Ministry has authorized simultaneous vaccination against Covid and influenza, as corresponding changes have been made to the instructions for the medical use of the Gam-Covid-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine," the health ministry's press service said in a statement on Friday, the Tass news agency reported.The ministry, citing studies, said that the effectiveness of Covid-19 and flu vaccines is not reduced when they are administered at the same time.“The combination of Sputnik V with the influenza vaccine has been studied in preclinical trials, showing no decrease in immunogenicity of both vaccines when they are administered simultaneously,” the press statement said.It added that when these two vaccines are given simultaneously, the jab is injected in different parts of the body- for example in the left and right shoulder.Till now, Russia has recorded over 8.16 million cases due to the coronavirus disease including 228,453 deaths, 822,792 active cases and 7,117,060 recoveries. On Friday, the country saw a record surge in its cases and deaths at 37,141 and 1,064 respectively. Russia's Covid-19 death toll is currently the highest in the whole of Europe.The country has also recorded infections with a new variant (AY.4.2) which is said to be even more contagious than the Delta variant.In order to curb the rising number of cases, President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered a week-long paid holiday from October 30 till November 7, in order to keep people away from their offices and public transportation. Local authorities have been told to strengthen their own restrictions during this 7-day period.In some places where the pandemic situation is worrisome, Putin said the non-working week can start as early as Saturday and go on beyond November 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-authorises-simultaneous-vaccination-against-covid-19-influenza-101634964119007.html
23-10-2021||World||FDA says Pfizer Covid vaccine looks effective for young kids||Federal health regulators said late Friday that kid-size doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine appear highly effective at preventing symptomatic infections in elementary school children and caused no unexpected safety issues, as the US weighs beginning vaccinations in youngsters.The Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis of Pfizer's data ahead of a public meeting next week to debate whether the shots are ready for the nation's roughly 28 million children ages 5 to 11. The agency will ask a panel of outside vaccine experts to vote on that question.In their analysis, FDA scientists concluded that in almost every scenario the vaccine's benefit for preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 would outweigh any serious potential side effects in children. But agency reviewers stopped short of calling for Pfizer's shot to be authorized.The agency will put that question to its panel of independent advisers next Tuesday and weigh their advice before making its own decision.If the FDA authorises the shots, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention will make additional recommendations on who should receive them the first week of November. Children could begin vaccinations early next month -- with the first youngsters in line fully protected by Christmas.Full-strength Pfizer shots already are recommended for anyone 12 or older, but pediatricians and many parents are anxiously awaiting protection for younger children to stem infections from the extra-contagious delta variant and help keep kids in school.The FDA review affirmed results from Pfizer posted earlier in the day showing the two-dose shot was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in young children. Researchers calculated the figure based on 16 COVID-19 cases in youngsters given dummy shots versus three cases among vaccinated children. There were no severe illnesses reported among any of the youngsters, but the vaccinated ones had much milder symptoms than their unvaccinated counterparts.Most of the study data was collected in the US during August and September, when the delta variant had become the dominant Covid-19 strain.The FDA review found no new or unexpected side effects. Those that did occur mostly consisted of sore arms, fever or achiness.However, FDA scientists noted that the study wasn't large enough to detect extremely rare side effects, including myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose.The agency used statistical modeling to try to predict how many hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine would prevent versus the number of potential heart side effects it might cause.In four scenarios of the pandemic, the vaccine clearly prevented more hospitalisations than would be expected from the heart side effect. Only when virus cases were extremely low could the vaccine cause more hospitalisations than it would prevent. But overall, regulators concluded that the vaccine's protective benefits “would clearly outweigh" its risks.While children run a lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, COVID-19 has killed more than 630 Americans 18 and under, according to the CDC. Nearly 6.2 million children have been infected with the coronavirus, more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks as the delta variant surged, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.The Biden administration has purchased enough kid-size doses — in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine — for the nation's 5- to 11-year-olds. If the vaccine is cleared, millions of doses will be promptly shipped around the country, along with kid-size needles.More than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers already have signed up to get the shots into little arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-says-pfizer-covid-vaccine-looks-effective-for-young-kids-101634958069978.html

However, the airline also clarified that the operations will commence once approvals are received from Indian authorities.“Flights from Sydney to Delhi would make stoppage in Darwin, while, in the reverse direction, the journey would be non-stop. The flights would be operational thrice a week on the Airbus A330 aircraft,” the Sydney-based carrier said in a statement on  Friday, adding that the frequency would be increased by the end of the year, thus making it a daily service.The flights between Australia's largest city and India's national capital would initially function till at least March 2022, with an option to continue if the demand is sufficient, Qantas further said.Speaking on the development, Alan Joyce, CEO, Qantas Group, said, “Given the strong ties between our two countries, flights on the Sydney-Delhi route have been on our radar for some time, and we think that there will be a strong demand from people waiting to reconnect once borders reopen.”Scott Morrison, the Australian Prime Minister, announced earlier this month that ban on international travel will be lifted in November.

23-10-2021||World||US Supreme Court takes up Texas abortion law case, lets ban remain||The US Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on Nov. 1 a challenge to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on the procedure and lets private citizens enforce it - a case that could dramatically curtail abortion access in the United States if the justices endorse the measure's unique design.The justices took up requests by President Joe Biden's administration and abortion providers to immediately review their challenges to the law. The court, which on Sept. 1 allowed the law to go into effect, declined to act on the Justice Department's request to immediately block enforcement of the measure.The court will consider whether the law's unusual private-enforcement structure prevents federal courts from intervening to strike it down and whether the federal government is even allowed to sue the state to try to block it.The measure bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.Liberal Justice Sotomayor dissented from the court's deferral of a decision on whether to block enforcement of the law while the litigation continues. Sotomayor said the law's novel design has suspended nearly all abortions in Texas, the second most populous US state, with about 29 million people."The state's gambit has worked. The impact is catastrophic," Sotomayor wrote.The Texas dispute is the second major abortion case that the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has scheduled for the coming months, with arguments set for Dec. 1 over the legality of a restrictive Mississippi abortion law.The Texas and Mississippi measures are among a series of Republican-backed laws passed at the state level limiting abortion rights - coming at a time when abortion opponents are hoping that the Supreme Court will overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade that legalized the procedure nationwide.Mississippi has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the Texas attorney general on Thursday signaled that he also would like to see that ruling fall.Lower courts already have blocked Mississippi's law banning abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy.The Texas measure takes enforcement out of the hands of state officials, instead enabling private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the state.Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits under the law. Critics have said this provision lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters, a characterization its proponents reject.Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the abortion providers, said Friday's decision to hear their case "brings us one step closer to the restoration of Texans' constitutional rights and an end to the havoc and heartache of this ban."Alexis McGill Johnson, president of healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood, said it is "devastating" that the justices did not immediately block a law that already has had a "catastrophic impact" after being in effect nearly two months."Patients who have the means have fled the state, traveling hundreds of miles to access basic care, and those without means have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will," she added.Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Texas Right to Life anti-abortion group, praised the court's action, saying it "will continue to save an estimated 100 babies per day, and because the justices will actually discuss whether these lawsuits are valid in the first place."The Supreme Court only rarely decides to hear cases before lower courts have ruled, indicating that the justices have deemed the Texas matter of high public importance and requiring immediate review.The Justice Department filed its lawsuit in September challenging the Texas law, arguing that it is unconstitutional and explicitly designed to evade judicial review.Rulings in Texas and Mississippi cases are due by the end of next June, but could come sooner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-takes-up-texas-abortion-law-case-lets-ban-remain-101634949534981.html

I desperately hope that I am wrong," said UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Tom Andrews.More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in the country's bloody crackdown on dissent and more than 8,000 arrested since the coup, according to a local monitoring group.Andrews, who was presenting the findings of an annual human rights report on Myanmar to the General Assembly, said that he had received information that tens of thousands of troops and heavy weapons were being moved into restive regions in the north and northwest.The findings, he said, also indicated that the junta had engaged in probable crimes against humanity and war crimes."These tactics are ominously reminiscent of those employed by the military before its genocidal attacks against the Rohingya in Rakhine State in 2016 and 2017," Andrews said.About 740,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017 after security forces launched a clampdown that the UN has said may amount to genocide.Andrews urged countries to deny Myanmar's military junta the money, weapons and legitimacy it desired, citing a prisoner release earlier in the week as evidence that pressure was working.On Monday, Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing announced the release of more than 5,000 people jailed for protesting against the coup.The move came just days after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations delivered a major snub to the military regime, exclude the junta head from an upcoming summit of the 10-country bloc."ASEAN's announcement that the junta will not be welcome at its upcoming summit strikes at the heart," Andrews said.Andrews said that junta-controlled forces had displaced a quarter million people.

23-10-2021||World||Another whistleblower accuses Facebook of wrongdoing: Report||A former Facebook worker reportedly told US authorities Friday the platform has put profits before stopping problematic content, weeks after another whistleblower helped stoke the firm's latest crisis with similar claims.The unnamed new whistleblower filed a complaint with US financial regulator Securities and Exchange Commission that could add to the company's woes, said a Washington Post report.Facebook has faced a storm of criticism over the past month after former employee Frances Haugen leaked internal studies showing the company knew of potential harm stoked by its sites, prompting US lawmakers' to renew a push for regulation.In the SEC complaint, the new whistleblower recounts alleged statements from 2017, when the company was deciding how to handle the controversy related to Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election."It will be a flash in the pan. Some legislators will get pissy. And then in a few weeks they will move onto something else. Meanwhile we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine," Tucker Bounds, a member of Facebook's communications team, was quoted in the complaint as saying, The Washington Post reported.The second whistleblower signed the complaint on October 13, a week after Haugen's scathing testimony before a Senate panel, according to the report.Haugen told lawmakers that Facebook put profits over safety, which led her to leak reams of internal company studies that underpinned a damning Wall Street Journal series.The Washington Post reported the new whistleblowers SEC filing claims the social media giant's managers routinely undermined efforts to combat misinformation and other problematic content for fear of angering then US president Donald Trump or for turning off the users who are key to profits.Erin McPike, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the article was "beneath the Washington Post, which during the last five years would only report stories after deep reporting with corroborating sources."Facebook has faced previous firestorms of controversy, but that has not translated into substantial new US legislation to regulate social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-whistleblower-accuses-facebook-of-wrongdoing-report-101634941508499.html

Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires, last year went through 234 straight days of lockdown.In Melbourne, people were seen cheering and clapping from their balconies, while cars honked horns continuously at 11.59pm on Thursday when lockdown restrictions in place since early August ended.Many venues, including food outlets and even haircutters, opened at the unusual hour for the occasion.The reopening will be a boost for Australia’s Aus$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy after recent lockdowns pushed it to the brink of a second recession in as many years.In China, the capital city of Beijing is planning to test tens of thousands of people after four new Covid-19 cases were found in a suburban district on Friday, as a new outbreak prompted school closures and flight cancellations across the country.China has maintained a staunch zero-Covid strategy with strict border closures, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns. But the world’s most populous nation is now scrambling to tamp down dozens of infections in several provinces.The latest flare-up has prompted the grounding of hundreds of flights, the closure of scenic areas and schools and a flurry of stay-at-home orders in affected housing compounds.The outbreak was traced to an elderly couple who were in a group of domestic tourists who flew from Shanghai to Xi’an, Gansu province and to Inner Mongolia. Dozens of cases have since been linked to their trip.France vaccinates against both flu and Covid-19Worried that the flu and Covid-19 could trigger a winter-time double-whammy of new infections and deaths, France is forging ahead with a nationwide vaccination and booster-shot programme against both diseases, offering simultaneous jabs to millions of at-risk people.The annual flu vaccination campaign kicked off on Friday, four days earlier than initially planned, dovetailing with France’s Covid-19 vaccination programme that is providing booster shots to those in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbournes-lockdown-ends-beijing-plans-mass-testing-101634934126197.html
