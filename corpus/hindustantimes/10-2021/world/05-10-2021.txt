Here are some comments from the committee hearing:FRANCES HAUGEN, FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER"I'm here today because I believe Facebook's products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.""There is no one currently holding Mark (Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive) to account. The buck stops with Mark.""Yesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet. I don't know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."US SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN, REPUBLICAN FROM ALASKA"I think we're going to look back 20 years from now and all of us are going to be like 'what the hell were we thinking' when we recognize the damage that it (social media) has done to a generation."US SENATOR EDWARD MARKEY, DEMOCRAT FROM MASSACHUSETTS"Your (Facebook's) time of invading our privacy and preying on children is over. Congress will be taking action."KEVIN MCALISTER, FACEBOOK SPOKESPERSON, IN AN EMAIL"The very existence of internal research on tough and complex issues is being recast as an example that Facebook isn’t living up to its responsibilities. The opposite is true: this research is more proof that we invest heavily so our teams can improve our apps and the resources we provide."US SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR, DEMOCRAT FROM MINNESOTA"When they allowed 99% of violent content to remain unchecked on their platform including the lead-up to the Jan. 6 insurrection, what did they do? Now we know Mark Zuckerberg was going sailing."US SENATOR ROGER WICKER, REPUBLICAN FROM MISSISSIPPI"Children of America are hooked on their product. There is cynical knowledge on behalf of these Big Tech companies that this is true."US SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN, REPUBLICAN FROM TENNESSEE"The research was Facebook's internal research. So they knew what they were doing, they knew where the violations were and they know they are guilty.""Facebook is not interested in making significant changes to improve kids' safety on their platforms, at least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on posts or decreasing their ad revenues."US SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, DEMOCRAT FROM CONNECTICUT"The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation.""Big Tech now faces the Big Tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth.""Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity.

Some administrative procedures remained to be completed but the issues were not about the vaccine itself, he said.On Monday, Murashko added that “disagreements” with WHO had been resolved, and the production sites and registering company in Russia “should submit the entire package of documents within a week or a week and a half, and the further process will begin.”In a phone interview, WHO spokeswoman Daniela Bagozzi said Tuesday that only the WHO’s technical advisory group on emergency use listings — not the WHO director-general himself — has final say about whether a vaccine obtains emergency approval.Once WHO receives the full amount of data that it needs, when production sites have been inspected, and when the data is deemed to meet WHO criteria, the group can schedule a meeting to validate a candidate vaccine for an emergency use listing.No such meeting has been set for Sputnik V. The next vaccine on the group’s agenda is one from India’s Bharat Biotech, which is expected to be discussed this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-presses-bid-for-who-approval-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-101633455167466.html

They gave battle at a strategic point 80 miles north of the line.In the central sector, where Gen. MacArthur was assembling his main forces, North Koreans were reported manning their old positions a few miles above the Parallel. In South Korea Communist guerillas, operating in groups of ten to 1,000, have increased their activity in the last 48 hours, according to U.S. intelligence officers.A U.S. petrol van ran into a well-prepared ambush near the west coast recently. It was rescued by a column of infantry and tanks which fought off 300 Communists. Sabotage is continuing near the front lines, and mines have been placed on roads.British infantry were flown north to just below the Parallel during the day, while the rest of the British Commonwealth Brigade in Korea which consists of two British battalions and one Australian—moved up by road.Observers believed this hasty and expensive movement indicated that Gen. MacArthur was planning to order a composite force over the North-South Korean border soon. These would include the British Commonwealth troops, U.S. forces, already regrouped near the Parallel, and Fillipino troops who are expected to be moved up shortly.The North Koreans, who have put up little opposition till now to the South Koreans’ advance into their territory, picked a point three miles north of Changjon to stand and fight today.At this point the East Coast road is skirted by the sea and high mountains and the North Koreans had strong defence positions behind.Frontline reports said about 2,250 Communists gave no ground on the East Coast road to Wonsan, through the Southerners brought up reinforcements and called in powerful air strikes.The South Koreans were blocked by road mines and barbed wire in front of an extricate network of trenches in depth. The North Koreans were fighting bitterly.The Southern Third Division which yeaterday captured Kosong, 55 miles north of the Parallel, almost unresisted, had exxprected a Communist stand another 30 miles on at Wonsan, one of the few major towns of northern Korea.Some groups of well-equipped Communist troops up to 2,000 strong are reported still roaming the countryside, trying to break through to the North. But most of the fleeing Communists are without rifles, the intelligence officer said. –P.T.I.- Reuter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-october-6-1950-decisive-battle-in-north-korea-imminent-101633455504007.html

Taliban fighters also damaged the CCTV cameras. #KarteParwan pic.twitter.com/pvdC2rSPTuThere was no official word from the Indian side on the incident.Soon after the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15, hundreds of members of the Sikh and Hindu minorities had taken refuge in Gurdwara Karte Parwan. Taliban commanders visited the gurdwara soon after the takeover of the country and assured Sikh leaders about the safety of members of the community.Nearly 240 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were, however, barred from entering Kabul airport to board the last military evacuation flight from the Afghan capital.The Indian government has said it will take all steps to facilitate the evacuation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who want to leave Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-taliban-fighters-vandalise-kabul-s-gurdwara-karte-parwan-breaks-locks-101633448235434.html

Democrats so far are refusing, accusing the Republicans of taking the nation's financial standing hostage.President Joe Biden on Monday called Republican opponents "reckless and dangerous" for refusing to join Democrats in raising the debt limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-secy-yellen-says-us-debt-default-could-trigger-recession-report-101633440098714.html
05-10-2021||World||Facebook outage shows why we need our own social networks: Russia||Russian social networks reported a spike in activity during Monday's global Facebook outage which Moscow officials said showed that Russia was right to develop its own sovereign internet platforms and social networks.Russia has sought for years to assert greater sovereignty over its internet segment, putting pressure on foreign tech firms to delete content and store data in Russia. It has also improved its ability to block platforms that break its rules.Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said during the near six-hour outage of Facebook services on Monday evening that this "answers the question of whether we need our own social networks and internet platforms".Facebook blamed its outage, which kept its 3.5 billion users from accessing services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, on a faulty configuration change.Russia's largest home-grown social network, Vkontakte, has far more daily users in the country than Facebook and reported a spike in messages and users after Facebook's services dropped."The number of Vkontakte video views increased by 18% and the number of messages sent in messenger by 21%," the Izvestia newspaper cited Marina Krasnova, head of the social network, as saying.She said the site's audience had jumped by 19% in comparison with the day before.Odnoklassniki, another popular social network, said activity on its site had increased during the Facebook outage, the RIA news agency reported.Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki are owned by Russian tech firm Mail.Ru.Russia disconnected itself from the global internet during tests earlier this year, part of a push to shield the country from being cut off from foreign infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-outage-shows-why-we-need-our-own-social-networks-russia-101633438387839.html
05-10-2021||World||Russian actress, director blast off to film first movie in space||A Russian actress and director blasted off to the International Space Station on Tuesday in a historic bid to best the United States to film the first movie in orbit.The Russian crew is set to beat a Hollywood project that was announced last year by "Mission Impossible" star Tom Cruise together with Nasa and Elon Musk's SpaceX.Actress Yulia Peresild, 37, and film director Klim Shipenko, 38, took off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan at the expected time of 0855 GMT, with docking scheduled for 1212 GMT."Launch as planned," the head of the Roscosmos space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, said on Twitter.Led by veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, the film crew will travel in a Soyuz MS-19 spaceship for a 12-day mission at the ISS to film scenes for "The Challenge".A live broadcast on Russian TV showed the Soyuz spacecraft ascending into a cloudless sky."The crew is feeling well," Shkaplerov was heard saying in the broadcast several minutes after take-off.The movie's plot, which has been mostly kept under wraps along with its budget, was revealed by Roscosmos to centre around a female surgeon who is dispatched to the ISS to save a cosmonaut.Shkaplerov and two other Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS are said to have cameo roles in the film.The ISS crew, which also includes a French, a Japanese and three Nasa astronauts, will welcome the newcomers when the hatch opens at around 1410 GMT.- 'It was difficult' -"It was difficult psychologically, physically and emotionally... but I think when we reach our goal all the challenges won't seem so bad," Peresild -- who was selected out of 3,000 applicants for the role -- said at a pre-flight press conference on Monday.True to a pre-flight tradition religiously observed by cosmonauts, the crew said that on Sunday they watched the classic Soviet film "The White Sun of the Desert".Shipenko and Peresild are expected to return to Earth on October 17 in a capsule with cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who has been on the ISS for the past six months.If successful, the mission will add to a long list of firsts for Russia's space industry.The Soviets launched the first satellite Sputnik, and sent the first animal, a dog named Laika, the first man, Yuri Gagarin, and the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, into orbit.But compared to the Soviet era, modern Russia has struggled to innovate and its space industry is fighting to secure state funding with the Kremlin prioritising military spending.Its space agency is still reliant on Soviet-designed technology and has faced a number of setbacks, including corruption scandals and botched launches.Russia is also falling behind in the global space race, facing tough competition from the United States and China, with Beijing showing growing ambitions in the industry.- Russians 'lost interest' in space -Roscosmos was also dealt a blow after SpaceX last year successfully delivered astronauts to the ISS, costing Russia its monopoly for journeys to the orbital station.For political analyst Konstantin Kalachev, the space film is a matter of PR and a way to "distract" Russians from the "problems" that Roscosmos is facing."This is supposed to inspire Russians, show how cool we are, but I think Russians have completely lost interest in the space industry," Kalachev told AFP.In a bid to spruce up its image and diversify its revenue, Russia's space programme revealed this year that it will be reviving its tourism programme to ferry fee-paying adventurers to the ISS.After a decade-long pause, Russia will send two Japanese tourists -- including billionaire Yusaku Maezawa -- to the ISS in December, capping a year that has been a milestone for amateur space travel.Last month, SpaceX completed the first all-civilian mission to space that took four untrained astronauts on a three-day loop around the Earth's orbit.The trip followed the missions of billionaire Richard Branson, who spent several minutes in weightlessness in July, and of Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos completing a similar mission just days later.Later this month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, known for his portrayal of Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series, will fly to space on a mission with Bezos's Blue Origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/russian-actress-director-blast-off-to-film-first-movie-in-space-101633432597628.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid took to Twitter to inform about the decision related to the issuance of passports. "Council of ministers of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in its meeting on Monday instructed the Ministry of Interior to resume the issuance of passport and Tazkira or national ID card," Mujahid tweeted.The issuance of passports and national identity cards were halted after the Taliban took control of Kabul on August 15, hampering the plans of many Afghan citizens to flee the war-torn country in the wake of the return of Sunni Pashtun militants to power after two decades. The process had slowed even before the Taliban's return since the bloody conflict between the Afghan defence forces and the insurgents disrupted most of the government services. According to an official, the applicants will be provided with documents physically identical to those issued by the previous government, reported Reuters.Alam Gul Haqqani, acting head of the passport office, said that between 5,000 and 6,000 passports will be issued every day.  The official stressed that women employees will process the passports meant for female citizens, underlining the Taliban's plan to strictly enforce gender segregation as per their harsh interpretation of Sharia law.Meanwhile, Afghanistan's interior ministry spokesperson Qari Sayeed Khosti informed a media briefing that 25,000 applicants are in the final stage of payment for their passports. About 100,000 applications are pending in the earlier stages of the process, reported Reuters citing the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-to-resume-issuance-of-passports-id-cards-after-months-of-delay-101633428274954.html
05-10-2021||World||'Our commitment to Taiwan rock solid’: US warns China following airspace incursion bid||The United States termed the recent Chinese military activity near Taiwan as ‘provocative’. The White House in a statement said that it remains concerned regarding the recent incursions made by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army air force into Taiwan’s airspace.“We remain concerned by the People's Republic of China's provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilising risk miscalculations and undermines regional peace and stability,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during the daily press briefing.Washington asked Beijing to cease military, diplomatic and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan. “We have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Psaki further added.Beijing marked the founding of the People's Republic of China on Saturday by making the largest-ever incursion into China as it flew 38 Chinese aircraft in two waves on Friday, news agency Reuters reported citing Taiwanese defence ministry.Psaki said the Biden administration will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability. “We maintain our commitments, as outlined in the three communiques, Taiwan Relations Act, and the Six Assurances,” Psaki said.The Biden administration said that it has made its concerns regarding Taiwan and its opinion regarding China’s coercive tactics clear earlier on many occasions and will continue to watch the situation very closely. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the Chinese actions undermine regional peace and stability. “Our commitment to Taiwan is rock solid,” Price said.In a separate statement, Republican senator Marco Rubio said at least 145 Chinese warplanes flew into Taiwan’s airspace since Friday. The incursion occurred a few days ahead of the Taiwanese National Day celebrations. Rubio also asked Biden to work with allies to curb China’s recklessness in the region.“If Beijing’s recklessness is not met with international condemnation, Xi Jinping will think he has a green light for further aggression. President Joe Biden must work with our allies to ensure the People’s Republic of China respects the status quo and the sovereign territory of Taiwan and its neighbours,” Rubio said, according to news agency PTI. Rubio further added that these were messages Xi wanted to send to the rest of the free world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-commitment-to-taiwan-rock-solid-us-warns-china-after-airspace-incursion-101633430641068.html

We are fully deployed and prepared on our side."On being asked about Chinese Air Force capabilities near Ladakh, he said China's capability to launch multiple high altitude missions would remain weak.Chaudhari also said that the induction of Rafale, Apaches have significantly added to our combat potential.He said that the IAF is in the process of new combat systems to ensure that we retain an edge over our adversaries"The induction of Rafale, Apaches have significantly added to our combat potential. Our offensive strike capability has become even more potent with the integration of new weapons on our fleets," said IAF Chief.He further added that we have hardened our networks to avoid cyber attacks. Adequate safeguards are being taken to protect our critical infrastructure.IAF is keen on integration amongst the Armed Forces. The joint planning and execution of operations by the three Services will result in a maximum increase in our net combat capability, he added.Chaudhari took charge as the Chief of Air Staff from Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on September 30, 2021.An ace fighter pilot, he was earlier in charge of the Ladakh sector during the peak of the crisis with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-air-force-present-across-lac-we-re-fully-deployed-prepared-iaf-chief-101633428303846.html
05-10-2021||World||Chinese air intrusions over Taiwan challenges US military might in Indo-Pacific||The Chinese provocative actions against Taiwan this month to demonstrate its military clout before an exercising armada of US-UK-Japan warships in the vicinity are seen part of psychological operations by Beijing to challenge the West over self-declared control of Taipei.The Chinese ramped up aerial incursions over Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) with 149 sorties by PLAAF fighters and nuclear capable bombers in the first four days of October to apparently demonstrate it military capacity to take over Taiwan by force. The aerial intrusions came at a time when aircraft carriers USS Ronald Reagan, USS Carl Vinson, HMS Elizabeth along with Japanese, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian ships are exercising between Taiwan and the coast of Okinawa.While the region appears to be on the edge, top diplomats see the provocative maneuvers by China against Taiwan directed at the domestic audience rather than serious war threat to Taipei. With China facing a slew of domestic challenges, including a biggest real estate company drowning in debt to power crunch, inflation, and slowdown in manufacturing sector, the military response is aimed at diverting attention of the public and fire up nationalistic sentiments.Beijing watchers believe that the aim of the recent aerial intrusions is to wear down the Taiwanese by conveying the signal that no one will come to support of Taipei if China decides to militarily take over the strategic islands. The ramping up of aerial intrusions - 27 per cent increase from the number of flights in the previous month - is also a message to US allies in the region particularly Japan and Australia, who are key partners in Quad grouping.While Taiwan has not responded to the Chinese aerial aggression, time is really running out for the principal players in the South China Sea. The rising military clout of PLA, particularly in the sea dimension, is posing a threat to the US domination of Indo-Pacific as well as forcing Japan to move towards shedding of its pacificist doctrine. The window for China to seize Taiwan is also limited by the Japanese desire to match Beijing militarily. If China outmaneuvers US on Taiwan, then the credibility of the latter will take a further hit after the withdrawal disaster in Afghanistan.With state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national reunification as part of declared Chinese core interests in 2011, it is logical to assume that Chinese Communist Party (CCP) objectives after Taiwan are Senkaku Islands and so-called South Tibet land dispute with India. These are credible threats as the Chinese position on the Indian borders has not moved an inch after the definition of the 1959 line by former premier Zhou En-Lai. Breaching of Taiwan red line by China will open the Pandora’s box. Is Quad prepared for such eventuality?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-air-intrusions-over-taiwan-challenges-us-military-might-in-indopacific-101633427905097.html

These schools that often times instil a distorted, ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam still flourish uninhibitedly in Pakistan and Afghanistan".She said, "The Taliban and the dreaded Haqqani network were born from such Madrassas in Pakistan. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other terrorist organisations continue operating such terror factories in Pakistan under the protection of the country's powerful intelligence agency".In Pakistan and Afghanistan, there are numerous illegal `madrasas' or religious schools which force the youth towards `jihad' or holy war. They teach them hatred against other religions and motivate them towards gun culture.Heckendorff told UNHRC, "The International Community must not be appeased with the Taliban's false promises of education. What is schooling worth, if instead of raising a workforce capable of leading their country onto a path of peace and development, creates foot soldiers indoctrinated into a worldview defined by misogyny and hatred?""The lack of economic independence of the Taliban and their patron State next door has a silver lining: it gives leverage to the international community. Leverage that must be used to prevent the loss of another generation of young Afghans to Madrassa-bred radicalism", she said in her speech.The research analyst concluded by saying, "Placing conditions on diplomatic and economic engagement to ensure human rights-conform education, without which the right to development can hardly be realized, is the most meaningful investment we can make in Afghanistan's future".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madrasas-in-pak-afghanistan-becoming-breeding-grounds-for-terrorists-un-report-101633423813185.html
05-10-2021||World||N.Korea pursues weapons development programmes despite Covid blockade: Report||North Korea has continued to pursue its weapons development programmes despite facing a worsening economic situation due to its self-imposed coronavirus blockade, a new UN report has said.Pyongyang is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, which have seen rapid progress under current leader Kim Jong Un.The report's publication comes after Pyongyang sparked international concern with a series of missile tests in the span of a few weeks, prompting the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting.The report -- which was published online Tuesday Seoul time, and covers the period from February 6 to August 3 -- said the North continued to polish its weapons programmes."Despite the country's focus on its worsening economic travails, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued to maintain and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs," said the report, compiled by a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the isolated country.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of the North, which like the South last month saw the 30th anniversary of their simultaneous admission to the United Nations.Pyongyang has not carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile launch or nuclear test since 2017 but the report said tests "combining ballistic and guidance technologies" were conducted while activity continued at key sites related to the nuclear programme.In early 2020 the country closed its borders to try to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in neighbouring China, but has nonetheless "continued its illicit efforts to procure specific components from overseas and to seek opportunities to transfer its own products to its partners", the report added.It said the North's coronavirus blockade had continued "fundamentally to impact the movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit, within, into and out of the country".The import of consumer products, including luxury goods banned under UN sanctions, had "virtually stopped", the report said, but said it was investigating illicit transfers of luxury vehicles.Leader Kim has been seen using Lexus SUVs in recent months and the report highlighted an attempted shipment of more than $1 million-worth of luxury vehicles, including such models, allegedly from the United Arab Emirates to Ningbo, China, for onward delivery to the North.Pyongyang has stayed away from nuclear talks since the collapse of a second summit between Kim and then US president Donald Trump in Hanoi and has rebuffed South Korean efforts to revive dialogue.Under President Joe Biden, the United States has repeatedly declared its willingness to meet North Korean representatives, while saying it will seek denuclearisation.Last week, Kim decried Washington's repeated offers of talks without preconditions as a "petty trick", accusing the Biden administration of continuing the "hostile policy" of its predecessors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nkorea-pursues-weapons-development-programmes-despite-covid-blockade-report-101633424343781.html

All these are owned by Facebook and the outage caused the stocks of the social media giant to plummet.The California-based company said late on Monday that “the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change”, adding that it had "no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime."WhatsApp said on Twitter that it is back and running at 100 per cent. "Thank you to everyone around the world today for your patience while our teams worked diligently to restore WhatsApp. We truly appreciate you and continue to be humbled by how much people and organizations rely on our app every day," the company said in the tweet.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also apologised to those affected by the outage.Here's everything that happened in the dramatic day for the social media giant:• For the six hours when Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp were down, 3.5 billion users could not access the social media platforms and messaging services.• Facebook stocks plummeted almost 5% following Monday's outage.• The outage tracking site, Downdetector said it had received reports about almost 14 million disruptions in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, India and several other countries.• The New York Times reported that Facebook had deployed a team at its data centre in California to carry out a "manual reset" of the servers.• Users also flagged disruptions with service providers Vodafone, T-Mobile and Verizon in the UK, Italy, the US, Germany and other countries, according to Downdetector.• The issues appear to primarily impact internet use on cell phones or in gaming apps and other sites where Facebook is used to log-in. The ability to make phone calls or send text messages was not impacted.• Several tech experts, however, believe a DNS (domain name system) issue could be behind the crash, reported news agency DPA. The system converts website names typed out with letters into IP addresses that computers can process.• John Graham-Cumming, the chief technology officer of the cloud service Cloudflare, said that continued attempts by users to access the site have also led to overloading on DNS services.• A similar major outage hit Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram in April 2019 - but the platforms only stayed down for a few hours.• In July this year, issues at the internet network company Akamai also caused several major websites to briefly go down.

According to an investigation by Amnesty, the killings of the 11 Afghan national security forces and two civilians, among them a 17-year-old girl, took place in the village of Kahor in Daykundi province in central Afghanistan on August 30, a fortnight after the Taliban recaptured the country. “These cold-blooded executions (of the Hazaras) are further proof that the Taliban are committing the same horrific abuses they were notorious for during their previous rule of Afghanistan,” Amnesty's secretary general, Agnes Callamard, said, according to AP.Amnesty said Sadiqullah Abed, the Taliban-appointed chief of police for Daykundi, denied the killings and said that a member of the Taliban had been wounded in an attack in the province. Hazaras make up around 9 per cent of Afghanistan's 36 million people and are often targeted because they are Shiite Muslims in a Sunni-majority country.Also read | 3 ISIS-K terrorists killed by Taliban in Kabul: ReportAccording to the Amnesty report, the Taliban took control of Daykundi province on August 14 and that an estimated 34 former soldiers sought safety in Khidir district. The soldiers, who had government military equipment and weaponry with them, agreed to surrender to the Taliban. Mohammad Azim Sedaqat, who led the group's surrender, arranged to decommission the weapons in the presence of Taliban members. Nearly 300 Taliban fighters arrived in a convoy on August 30, close to Dahani Qul village, where the Afghan soldiers were staying, some with family members, according to Amnesty's report.Taliban fighters caught up with the leaving security force member and their families and opened fire on the crowd, killing a 17-year-old girl named Masuma. One soldier fired back, killing a Taliban fighter and wounding another. The Taliban continued to shoot as the families fled, killing two soldiers, according to the report. The report added that after nine soldiers surrendered, the Taliban took them to a nearby river basin and killed them. Amnesty said it verified photographs and video evidence taken in the aftermath of the killings.Also read | Taliban face shift from war to policing streetsAfter the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in a campaign that stunned the world, the Islamist fundamentalist group's leaders tried to assure Afghans that they will not attack those who supported the western-backed government of Ashraf Ghani and won’t impose the harsh rules followed during their last regime. However, renewed restrictions on women and girls and the appointment of an all-male government have been met with dismay by the international community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-killed-13-ethnic-hazaras-including-afghan-soldiers-says-amnesty-101633417275824.html
05-10-2021||World||Thousands of victims of sex abuse within France's Catholic Church: Report||Tens of thousands of people, and possibly more, are believed to have been victims of child sex abuse within France's Catholic Church over the past seven decades, according to a major report due to be published Tuesday.The 2,500-page document prepared by an independent commission comes as the Catholic Church in France, like in other countries, seeks to reckon with shameful secrets that were long covered up.The commission president, Jean-Marc Sauve, said in the French press that an estimated 3,000 child abusers — two-thirds of them priests — have worked in the church over the past 70 years.Olivier Savignac, head of victims' association “Parler et Revivre” (Speak out and Live again), who contributed to the probe, told The Associated Press that the estimated number of victims in the report reaches 216,000.“That is devastating, because the ratio between 216,000 and 3,000, it's one aggressor for 70 victims. That is terrifying for the French society, for the Catholic Church,” he said.The AP was not able to read the report ahead of its presentation and could not confirm the figure.The commission worked for 2 1/2 years, listening to victims and witnesses and studying church, court, police and press archives starting from the 1950s. A hotline launched at the beginning of the probe received 6,500 calls from alleged victims or people who said they knew a victim.Sauvé said 22 alleged crimes that can still be pursued have been forwarded to prosecutors. More than 40 cases that are too old to be prosecuted but involve alleged perpetrators who are still alive have been forwarded to church officials.The commission issued 45 recommendations about how to prevent abuse. These included training priests and other clerics, revising the Canon Law (the legal code the Vatican uses to govern the church) and fostering policies to recognize and compensate victims, Sauvé said.The report comes after a scandal surrounding now-defrocked priest Bernard Preynat rocked the French Catholic Church. Last year, Preynat was convicted of sexually abusing minors and given a five-year prison sentence. He acknowledged abusing more than 75 boys for decades.One of Preynat's victims, Francois Devaux, head of the victims' group La Parole Libérée ("The Liberated Word"), told The Associated Press that “with this report, the French church for the first time is going to the root of this systemic problem. The deviant institution must reform itself.”He said the number of victims the report was expected to list is “a minimum.”"Some victims did not dare to speak out or trust the commission,” he said, expressing concerns that the church in France still “hasn't understood” and has sought to minimize its responsibilities.The church must not only acknowledge events but also compensate victims, Devaux said. “It is indispensable that the church redresses the harm caused by all these crimes, and (financial) compensation is the first step.”The Preynat case led to the resignation last year of the former archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who has been accused of failing to report the abuses to civil authorities when he learned about them in the 2010s. France's highest court ruled earlier this year that Barbarin did not cover up the case.French archbishops, in a message to parishioners read during Sunday Mass across the country, said the publication of the report is “a test of truth and a tough and serious moment.”“We will receive and study these conclusions to adapt our actions,” the message said. “The fight against pedophilia concerns all of us ... Our support and our prayers will keep going towards all the people who have been abused within the church.”Pope Francis issued in May 2019 a groundbreaking new church law requiring all Catholic priests and nuns around the world to report clergy sexual abuse and cover-ups by their superiors to church authorities.In June, Francis swiftly rejected an offer from Cardinal Reinhard Marx, one of Germany's most prominent clerics and a close papal adviser, to resign as archbishop of Munich and Freising over the church's mishandling of abuse cases. But he said a process of reform was necessary and every bishop must take responsibility for the “catastrophe” of the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-victims-of-sex-abuse-within-france-s-catholic-church-report-101633412543217.html

What the discovery says||Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries on receptors for temperature and touch. The research done by David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian was conducted independently of each other in the late 1990s and 2000s.But, the groundbreaking work is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions, including chronic pain.Our ability to sense heat, cold and touch is essential for survival, the Nobel Committee said, and underpins our interaction with the world around us.What did they discover?The two US scientists identified receptors in the skin that respond to heat and pressure. Focussing on a field known as somatosenstation, Julius and Patapoutian decoded how the human body turns physical sensations into electrical pulses in the nervous system.Why is the discovery significant?According to experts, the discoveries show how little scientists knew about how our bodies perceived the external worlds before these discoveries - and how much there still is to learn. "While we understood the physiology of the senses, what we didn't understand was how we sensed differences in temperature or pressure," said Oscar Marin, director of the MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at King's College, London."Knowing how much our body sensed these changes is fundamental because once we know those molecules, they can be targeted. It's like finding a lock and now we know the precise key that will be necessary to unlock it," he added.What this means is that in the future, these discoveries could underpin how research into treating pain since the first heat sensor discovered (TRPV1) is also involved in chronic pain.The touch receptor, PIEZo2, has multiple roles, including regulating blood pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-in-medicine-how-we-sense-temperature-difference-what-the-discovery-says-101633412645530.html

05-10-2021||World||Facebook's longest outage yet was flagged by Downdetector. Here's how it works||As Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went dark on Monday night, Downdetector, surveying the internet for online service status information, let the users know that they are not alone in experiencing the outage and that it certainly was not a result of a poor WiFi connection or broken internet. Downdetector, which analyses tens of millions of daily problem reports, makes people everywhere aware that the rest of the world is experiencing a similar issue as well. Throughout Monday night, the website's servers stood on a strict vigil and kept updating in real-time the status of the Facebook outage, which lasted for nearly six hours before the services started gradually getting back online.With Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp now ‘entirely’ back online, here's a brief review of how the Downdetector service, the world's most popular platform for online service status information, works.Downdetector, according to its official website, offers real-time status information for more than 6,000 services across 45 websites representing 45 countries. When a service provider’s customers are experiencing problems, Downdetector aggregates and analyses this data to determine the potential nature of the issue and then works to alert both the company and community of possible issues.For ease of access to users, Downdetector usually marks a certain website with a red exclamation mark icon if a large volume of users reports that are facing potential problems with the said website. If there are no such reports, the icon will be absent. Moreover, enterprise users can also directly communicate with their customers via their company's page on Downdetector. In the example image above, the Webco team has sent a message for its users regretting the inconvenience caused due to the snag.Also Read | Why Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were all down. ExplainedTo make the reporting process easier, Downdetector has a ‘problem report button’, with which users can submit a problem report about a particular website to Downdetector, choosing from a predefined list of problem indicators about the type of issue they are experiencing.The most significant part of the page is the live outage map, which shows the ‘spikes’ in reports over time; it helps users gauge the kind of response the website is getting across the world. If there are a lot of spikes corresponding to the timestamps, like in the image above, it means users all over the world are experiencing similar problems with the website. Downdetector also has a daily historical view of problem reports compared to the baseline volume.How Downdetector collects status informationAs more and more users submit problem reports directly on a company status page on Downdetector, along with an indicator of the type of problem they are experiencing, the tracking service gathers data through Twitter and uses ‘sentiment analysis’ to detect issues for a given company and its location. It also looks at other key indicators from across the web to determine if an extraordinary volume of users is having issues with a monitored company or service.How Downdetector determines if there’s an incidentAccording to Downdetector, a small number of users reporting a problem does not constitute a large-scale incident. To make sure that incidents are correctly represented, the website calculates “a baseline volume of typical problem reports for each service monitored”, based on the average number of reports for that given time of day, measured over the previous year. Downdetector only reports an incident when the number of problem reports is significantly higher than the baseline.“Downdetector only accepts the first report for a specific company from a single user. Subsequent information about the issue is collected but is not counted as a new problem report,” as per the website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-longest-outage-yet-was-flagged-by-downdetector-here-s-how-it-works-101633406548418.html
05-10-2021||World||Global outage & whistleblower revelations: Facebook fights duel crises||Facebook battled dueling crises Monday as potentially billions of users were impacted when its dominant social network went offline for seven hours, and the company fought against a whistleblower's damning revelations.Many long-held fears and criticisms about the platform seem to have been backed up by Facebook's own research, which ex-worker Frances Haugen has turned over to authorities and the Wall Street Journal.But as US senators prepared for her highly anticipated Tuesday testimony on the documents, Facebook went offline in an outage that hit users across its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp."Billions of users have been impacted by the services being entirely offline today," tracker Downdetector wrote on its website.Facebook apologized in a tweet later Monday Silicon Valley time, just as the apps started to go back online."We've been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now," the company added.Facebook late Monday blamed the outage on configuration changes it made to routers that coordinate network traffic between its data centers."This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt," Facebook vice president of infrastructure Santosh Janardhan said in a post.Cyber security expert Brian Krebs described what happened as Facebook taking away "the map telling the world's computers how to find its various online properties."In addition to the disruption to people, businesses and others that rely on the company's tools, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a financial hit.Fortune's billionaire tracking website late Monday said Zuckerberg's personal fortune plunged by nearly $6 billion from the prior day to land at just under $117 billion.For Facebook's rivals, it was a good day, however.The messaging service Telegram went from the 56th most downloaded free app in the US to the fifth, according to specialist firm SensorTower.The encrypted messaging app Signal tweeted that "millions" of new users had joined, and added that it was "Signal and ready to mignal."It was not the only Twitter user to crack jokes over the outage, though others complained about being cut off from contacts, their sources of income or business tools.Some were philosophical, however -- such as Cindy Bennett, a baker in New York City, who told AFP: "I think the world would probably be a better place if everybody didn't know what everybody else was doing every second of every minute of every day."- 'Make body dissatisfaction worse' -Facebook has pushed back hard against the outrage regarding its practices and impact, but this is just the latest crisis to hit the business.US lawmakers for years have threatened to regulate Facebook and other social media giants to address criticisms that the platforms trample on privacy, provide a megaphone for dangerous misinformation and damage young people's well-being.After years of criticism directed at social media, without major legislative overhauls, some experts were skeptical that change was coming."This is a situation where there's going to be a lot of smoke, and a lot of fury, but not a lot of action," said Mark Hass, an Arizona State University professor"It's going to have to come down to the platforms, feeling pressure from their users feeling pressure from their employees," he added, noting authorities won't effectively be able to regulate content.Haugen, a 37-year-old data scientist from Iowa, has worked for companies including Google and Pinterest -- but said in an interview with CBS news show "60 Minutes" that Facebook was "substantially worse" than anything she had seen before.Facebook's vice president of policy and global affairs Nick Clegg vehemently pushed back at the assertion its platforms are "toxic" for teens, days after a tense, hours-long congressional hearing in which US lawmakers grilled the company over its impact on the mental health of young users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-outage-whistleblower-revelations-facebook-fights-duel-crises-101633406417432.html
05-10-2021||World||Facebook blames ‘faulty configuration change’ for hours-long outage||Social media giant Facebook Inc has blamed a "faulty configuration change" for the nearly six-hour outage on Monday that prevented the company's 3.5 billion users from accessing its services, including that of WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger."We want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change," Facebook said in a blog.Soon after the outage happened, Facebook acknowledged the trouble users were facing accessing its apps but did not provide any specifics about the nature of the problem.The error message on Facebook's webpage suggested an error in the Domain Name System (DNS), which allows web addresses to take users to their destinations.Several Facebook employees who declined to be named have told Reuters they believed the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems. They said the failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same network in order to work compounded the error. Security experts have said an inadvertent mistake or sabotage by an insider could be possible reasons.The Facebook outage is the largest-ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector. The outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritising profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.The shares of Facebook fell 4.9 per cent, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks on Monday. "To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I'm sorry," Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer wrote on Twitter, adding that it "may take some time to get to 100 per cent".(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-blames-faulty-configuration-change-for-hours-long-outage-101633403948415.html

A ‘strong’ message for China||US president Joe Biden on Monday held a phone conversation with Japan's new prime minister Fumio Kishida, who succeeded Yoshihide Suga after winning the ruling party elections late last month. Extending his greetings to the newly-anointed leader, the US president vowed to work in tandem with Japan to challenge the increasing threat that Beijing poses in the East China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region. They also promised to deal with the aggravating blitz of North Korea, which has launched multiple missiles in waters just off the coast of Japan in recent weeks. Moments after the conversation, Kishida told reporters that Biden provided a “strong statement about US commitment for the defense of Japan, including… Senkaku.”New Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that he received a 'strong' message from President Joe Biden about the United States' commitment to defending the disputed East China Sea islets known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan https://t.co/oDvyluRc8r pic.twitter.com/Iuz9yZIUm9The Senkaku Islands (also known as ‘Diaoyutai Islands’ in China) are a set of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea fuelling a territorial dispute which has marred diplomatic relations between Tokyo and Beijing since at least the early 2010s. China, which continues to claim the Senkaku Islands as the country's ‘inherent territory’, has rapidly built up artificial islands with military infrastructure in the region. In phone calls with the new Japanese premier, Joe Biden reaffirmed the United States' commitment to defending the Senkaku Islands in the face of China's increasing activity in the East China Sea.Also Read | Japan lawmakers vote Fumio Kishida as new prime ministerThe 20-minute phone conversation on Monday started with Biden congratulating Kishida on taking office. The leaders called each other by their first names – Joe and Fumio – and agreed to meet for their first in-person talks at an early date.Although he acknowledged the need to continue dialogue with China, an important neighbour and trade partner, Kishida told Biden that “we must speak up” against China’s attempt to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas.Kishida, a 64-year-old former foreign minister with an image as a consensus builder, is seen as a supporter of stronger Japan-US ties and partnerships with other like-minded democracies in Asia, Europe, and Britain, in part to counter China and nuclear-armed North Korea. Kishida has also pledged to strengthen Japan’s missile and naval defence capabilities, pointing out that acquiring the ability to strike enemy bases, a controversial step backed by Abe, was a viable option and that he would appoint an aide to monitor China's treatment of its Uyghur minority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-talks-to-japan-s-new-prime-minister-kishida-a-strong-message-for-china-101633402627627.html

"After working on this for a whole year and getting one negative result after another, the 72nd candidate ... wiped out this ability," he said at a press event.Armenian-origin Patapoutian, who grew up in war-torn Lebanon and came to the US aged 18, said it was hard for him to imagine the day would come he would win a Nobel.When the Nobel committee tried calling him at 2:00 am in California, his phone was on silent."They somehow got a hold of my 94-year-old father who lives in Los Angeles, and I guess even if you have 'Do not disturb' people in your favorites can call you," he said, adding it was a "very special moment."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chili-peppers-warm-hugs-what-inspired-the-nobel-winning-duo-behind-groundbreaking-medical-advancement-101633401568062.html

A selloff sent the social-media giant’s stock plummeting around 5 per cent on Monday, adding to a drop of about 15 per cent since mid-September.The stock slide on Monday sent Zuckerberg’s worth down to $120.9 billion, dropping him below Bill Gates to No. 5 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s lost about $19 billion of wealth since Sept. 13, when he was worth nearly $140 billion, according to the index.Also Read | After longest Facebook outage, Mark Zuckerberg issues a personal apologyOn Sept. 13, the Wall Street Journal began publishing a series of stories based on a cache of internal documents, revealing that Facebook knew about a wide range of problems with its products — such as Instagram’s harm to teenage girls’ mental health and misinformation about the Jan. 6 Capitol riots — while downplaying the issues in public. The reports have drawn the attention of government officials, and on Monday, the whistleblower revealed herself.In response, Facebook has emphasised that the issues facing its products, including political polarisation, are complex and not caused by technology alone. “I think it gives people comfort to assume that there must be a technological or a technical explanation for the issues of political polarization in the United States,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-facebook-goes-dark-zuckerberg-loses-7-billion-drops-down-in-billionaire-list-101633395280628.html

It is normal for websites and apps to suffer outages, though one on a global scale is rare. Users reported being unable to access Facebook in California, New York and Europe.Reuters could not immediately confirm the issue affecting the services. However, the error message on Facebook’s webpage suggested a Domain Name System (DNS) error.DNS allows web addresses to take users to their destinations.Downdetector, which only tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform, showed there were more than 50,000 incidents of people reporting issues with Facebook and Instagram.Meanwhile, the social-media giant’s instant messaging platform WhatsApp was also down for over 22,000 users, while Messenger was down for nearly 3,000 users. WhatsApp was also trending on Twitter, with more than 850,000 tweets.FB asks judge to dismiss US antitrust suit, againFacebook asked a judge on Monday to dismiss the US government’s revised antitrust case that seeks to force the social media giant to sell Instagram and WhatsApp after he threw out an earlier version in June.It said in a court filing that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had failed to provide a “factual basis for branding Facebook an unlawful monopolist” and that the FTC “had no basis for its...allegation that Facebook has or had a monopoly”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fb-whatsapp-instagram-hit-by-massive-global-outage-tracker-101633393920742.html

According to several security experts, the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram disruption could be the result of an internal mistake and added that sabotage by an insider would be theoretically possible.

According to Wired, an error in DNS records can make it impossible to connect to a website.Alex Stamos, a former chief security officer at Facebook, told Wired that the cause of the issue is “probably a bad configuration or code push to the network management system,” “This isn’t supposed to happen,” Stamos added. “Facebook's outage appears to be caused by DNS; however that's a just symptom of the problem,” Troy Mursch, chief research officer of cyberthreat intelligence company Bad Packets, told Wired. The fundamental issue, Mursch says—and other experts agree—is that Facebook has withdrawn the so-called Border Gateway Protocol route that contains the IP addresses of its DNS nameservers.Several internet infrastructure experts told Wired that the likeliest answer was a misconfiguration on Facebook’s part. “It appears that Facebook has done something to their routers, the ones that connect the Facebook network to the rest of the internet,” John Graham-Cumming, CTO of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-were-all-down-explained-101633393280540.html

At her age, it is not convenient to sit for hearings every day of the whole week,” Khin Maung Zaw said by phone. “She doesn’t have any disease nor specified sickness. It is not a concerning situation. She is just tired.”Asean disappointed at junta’s commitmentSoutheast Asian countries on Monday voiced disappointment about army-ruled Myanmar’s commitment to an agreed peace plan, with one foreign minister saying he was concerned about the junta leader attending a regional summit later this month. “There’s been no significant progress in Myanmar. The military has not given a positive response to what has been attempted by the special envoy,” Indonesian foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, told a news conference following a meeting of regional counterparts.“Most members expressed disappointment,” she said. “Some countries expressed that Asean cannot act business as usual... when looking into this development.”Meanwhile, a US journalist who has spent more than four months in pretrial detention in Myanmar has been charged with a second criminal offence, his lawyer said on Monday, while authorities refused to disclose the reason behind his arrest.

The agency said its decision came after studies showed that an extra dose of the vaccines increased people’s ability to produce antibodies against the virus that causes Covid-19 in organ transplant patients with weakened immune systems.“Although there is no direct evidence that the ability to produce antibodies in these patients protected against Covid-19, it is expected that the extra dose would increase protection at least in some patients,” the agency said in a statement.The World Health Organization’s chief had urged wealthy nations not to use booster doses this year, saying there is no scientific data that proves the shots are necessary.He said Covid-19 vaccines would be put to better use in developing countries, where many people still have not received their first vaccine shots.Lowest weekly global tollThe weekly number of coronavirus deaths worldwide has fallen to levels unseen for almost a year, according to an AFP count on Monday based on official national figures.The 53,245 deaths recorded worldwide between September 27 and October 3, an average of 7,606 each day, showed that the global pandemic continues the downward trend that began at the end of August, after a peak of around 10,000 deaths per day.The new weekly death toll figure is the lowest recorded since October 31-November 6, 2020.Over the last month, the number of Covid-19 related deaths has fallen by almost a quarter, as vaccination campaigns make progress.The Kremlin on Monday implored people to get vaccinated against Covid-19, calling it the only way to stop the virus’ spread, as Russian authorities mulled reintroducing health restrictions to cope with daily cases rising to their highest levels since January.“The vaccination rate, despite the complete preparedness of all infrastructure, leaves much to be desired,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.The 25,781 new infections reported nationwide on Monday was the most since January 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-regulator-okays-3rd-dose-of-pfizer-for-over-18s-101633388334537.html

Akamai Technologies faced a similar problem which led to multiple websites reporting downtime in July. Security experts told news agency Reuters that the outage may have been triggered by a configuration error, which could be the result of an internal mistake. No reports of sabotage by an external element was reported.Facebook earlier in March and July also reported similar outages but the services during those instances were resolved within a short period of time.

05-10-2021||World||Japan’s newly elected PM to seek fresh polls to deal with Covid-19||Newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday he will dissolve the lower house next week in preparation for October 31 elections as he seeks a fresh mandate to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the sagging economy and security threats from China and North Korea.Kishida was formally elected by parliament earlier Monday to replace Yoshihide Suga, who resigned after only one year in office. Suga’s support had plunged over his handling of the pandemic and insistence on holding the Tokyo Olympics as the virus spread.“Our fight against the coronavirus is continuing,” Kishida told his first news conference Monday night after taking office. “COVID-19 measures is the urgent and top priority, and I will handle the problem taking into consideration the worst-case scenario.” He said he will review the past virus handling and seek to set up a crisis management unit.He also pledged to push through with a large-scale recovery package to support those hit by the pandemic.“In order to take large-scale COVID-19 measures, I need to get the people’s mandate,” Kishida said, adding that he will pass up attending G-20 and COP-26 climate meetings in-person.A former foreign minister, Kishida, 64, used to be known as a moderate but turned hawkish on security and more conservative on gender equality and other issues, apparently to win over influential conservatives in his Liberal Democratic Party. His victory in last week’s vote to replace Suga as the party’s leader was seen as a choice for continuity and stability over change.Kishida replaced all but two of Suga’s 20 Cabinet members, and 13 will hold posts for the first time, according to the lineup announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno. Most of the posts went to powerful factions that voted for Kishida in the party election. Only three women are included, up from two in Suga’s government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-newly-elected-pm-to-seek-fresh-polls-to-deal-with-covid19-101633381100739.html
05-10-2021||World||Facebook chose profit over safety: Whistleblower||Facebook prematurely turned off safeguards designed to thwart misinformation and rabble rousing after Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in last year’s elections in a moneymaking move that a company whistleblower alleges contributed to the deadly January 6 invasion of the US Capitol.The whistleblower, former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen, also asserted during an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that a 2018 change to the content flow in Facebook’s news feeds contributed to more divisiveness and ill will in a network ostensibly created to bring people closer together.Despite the enmity that the new algorithms were feeding, Facebook found that they helped keep people coming back — a pattern that helped the company sell more of the digital ads that generate most of its advertising.“The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” said Haugen, who joined Facebook in 2019 after working at Google and Pinterest.“And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money.”Facebook’s annual revenue has more than doubled from $56 billion in 2018 to a projected $119 billion this year, based on the estimates of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Meanwhile, the company’s market value has soared from $375 billion at the end of 2018 to nearly $1 trillion now.Even before the full interview came out, a top Facebook executive was deriding the whistleblower’s allegations as “misleading”.“Social media has had a big impact on society in recent years, and Facebook is often a place where much of this debate plays out,” Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president of policy and public affairs wrote to Facebook employees in a memo sent on Friday.The “60 Minutes” interview intensifies the spotlight already glaring on Facebook as lawmakers and regulators around the world scrutinise the social networking’s immense power to shape opinions and its polarising effects on society.The backlash has been intensifying since The Wall Street Journal’s mid-September publication of an expose that revealed Facebook’s own internal research had concluded the social network’s attention-seeking algorithms had helped foster political dissent and contributed to mental health and emotional problems among teens, especially girls.After copying thousands of pages of Facebook’s internal research, Haugen leaked them to the Journal to provide the foundation for a succession of stories packaged as the “Facebook Files”.Haugen (37), has filed at least eight complaints with US securities regulators alleging Facebook has violated the law by withholding information about the risks posed by its social network, according to “60 Minutes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-chose-profit-over-safety-whistleblower-101633380834637.html
05-10-2021||World||How likely is a hack the reason behind Facebook, WhatsApp & Instagram’s outage ?||Popular social media platform Facebook and the company’s messaging service WhatsApp Messenger and its image and video sharing platform Instagram suffered a massive outage across the world on Monday night (IST). All three services have acknowledged the situation on Twitter and assured that they were working on solving the issues and they would be restored as soon as possible.However, the outage also comes at a time that has been particularly difficult for Facebook. The company has been the centre of a major controversy following a report by the Wall Street Journal, which said that the company did not act upon the findings of its own research teams about the ill effects its platforms had on young users, especially teenage girls.Also read | ‘Hello literally everyone’: Twitter after Facebook, WhatsApp, IG global outageMeanwhile, the exact reason behind the outage is not clearly known yet and the platforms themselves have not mentioned it too. The error message on Facebook’s website initially showed an issue with the Domain Name System (DNS) and later it said, “Sorry, something went wrong. We're working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.” The error message about DNS was displayed on Instagram’s website too.An internal configuration error could have been the likely reason behind the outage, news agency Reuters said in a report citing security experts who were aware of the situation. Further, the report also said that the outage could have been caused due to sabotage by an insider, calling the situation “theoretically possible.”Also watch | Whatsapp, Facebook, Insta down for hours in global outage; Meme fest on TwitterNotably, the report also showed that a hack or breach of the networks from outside was “less likely” as such a large-scale denial-of-service attack, which can overwhelm Facebook’s popular platforms, would require powerful criminal groups to coordinate or use very innovative techniques.The outage also came as a Facebook insider, Frances Haugen, earlier on Sunday said that the company prioritised profits over acting on hate speech and misinformation during an interview in a television show, several news reports showed.During the outage, which had affected millions of users across the world, several people took to Twitter to express their reactions. While many people shared memes about the scenario, others also shared their thoughts about moving on to other messaging platforms from WhatsApp Messenger. Also, #FacebookDown and #WhatsAppDown were trending on Twitter for a long time on Monday night (IST).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-likely-is-a-hack-the-reason-behind-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-s-outage-101633376003593.html

Meanwhile, the Pfizer booster doses can be inoculated to all adults at least six months after their second Covid-19 shot.In a statement, the European Medicines Agency cited studies showing that an extra dose of the coronavirus vaccine increases the ability to generate antibodies against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing the disease in “organ transplant patients with weakened immune systems.” “It is expected that the extra dose would increase protection at least in some patients,” the statement added.The move comes after the US authorities in August gave a go-ahead for Covid-19 booster shots, claiming that data available to them has made it “very clear” that protection against the virus begins to wear off over time after an individual is jabbed with the initial shots of the vaccine.Also Read | Joe Biden gets Covid-19 booster shot after authorisation“In association with the dominance of the Delta variant we are starting to see evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,” the country’s top officials, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky and US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, had said in a statement. Several EU member states such as Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Serbia, among others, have approved Covid-19 booster shots. Austria is going to commence a wider rollout from October 17 onwards, according to Reuters. Canada has recommended authorised mRNA Covid-19 booster shots to those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, the Reuters report added.The matter of Covid-19 booster doses have not gone down well with the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on the same, citing that several poor or less-developed countries are yet to inoculate the first dose of the vaccine to their nationals.

Katherine Tai, the top American trade official, said she plans to have “frank conversations” with her Chinese counterpart about “shortfalls” in Beijing meeting its commitments under Phase One agreement signed with the Trump administration in 2020.US trade representative Tai also made clear these talks were not intended to “inflame trade tensions” but America will be prepared and willing to “use the full range of tools we have, and develop new tools as needed to defend American economic interests from harmful policies and practices”.The resumption of trade talks comes as part of a new strategy based on a review of the bilateral trade relationship and the agreement that was signed by President Donald Trump and Chinese negotiators in January 2020 that ended months of tensions accompanied by an escalating tariff war between the world’s two largest economies.“I intend to have frank conversations with my counterpart in China that will include discussion over China’s performance under the Phase One agreement. We will also directly engage with China on its industrial policies,” Tai said in a widely anticipated speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a leading US think-tank.“Our objective is not to inflame trade tensions with China (but) durable coexistence requires accountability and respect for the enormous consequences of our actions,” she added.The official said “our objective is not to escalate trade tensions with China or double down on the previous administration’s flawed strategy” but the same time, we’re trying to continue to pursue an unfair endorser practices. We will use the full range of our tools to help ensure that the US China trade relationship works for American workers, our industries, and our supply chain”.Tai did not detail these “shortfalls” but indicated they may be in the commitments China made to purchase at least $200 billion of Americans goods and services over two years of the signing of the agreement. She also did not say when she expects to hold these conversations, except that they will be “soon”.Under the deal signed in January 2020, China had committed to buying at least $200 billion worth of American goods and services over the next two years, above the 2017 levels; stronger legal protections for patents, trademarks, copyrights, including improved criminal and civil procedures to combat online infringement, pirated and counterfeit goods; and pledged to desist from competitive currency manipulations.Tai said the 2020 agreement stabilised the market, especially for US agricultural exports, but “our analysis indicates that while commitments in certain areas have been met, there have also been shortfalls in others”.According to the Pietersen Institute for International Economics, a US think tank that runs a tracker of the Phase One deal, China has met only 62% of its purchase commitments for American goods.But the “shortfalls” will only be a part of the conversation as the US trade representative said the Phase One agreement was limited in size and scope. “The reality is this agreement did not meaningfully address the fundamental concerns that we have with China’s trade practices and their harmful impacts on the US economy.”Even with this agreement in place, China’s government “continues to pour billions of dollars into targeted industries, and continues to shape its economy, to the will of the state, hurting the interests of workers here in the US and around the world”.Katherine Tai practically ruled out a Phase Two agreement, which the Trump administration had planned to address structural issues in bilateral trade. Asked if there will be a Phase Two agreement, Tai said, “I’m not quite sure. You’ll have to ask my predecessor, and the previous administration in setting this up as Phase One, what they were thinking about as a Phase Two.”A senior Biden administration official, who previewed Tai’s speech on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said, “We are not looking to seek a Phase Two negotiation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frank-conversations-us-to-resume-trade-talks-with-china-101633369508991.html
