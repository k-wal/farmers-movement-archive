The two-day meet, which is taking place virtually, started on Wednesday.India is leading a session on resilience, Australia on disruption, the UK on virtual currency, and Germany on diplomacy.Lt General Rajesh Pant, the national cybersecurity coordinator, is leading the Indian delegation at the event aimed at combating ransomware.“Many governments have been indispensable in organising the meeting, and four countries in particular have volunteered to lead and organise specific thematic discussions: India for resilience, Australia for disruption, the UK for virtual currency, and Germany for diplomacy,” a senior official of Joe Biden’s administration said while reviewing the meeting for reporters.In all, 30 countries are participating in the meet, including Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UAE. The EU is also taking part in the event.The meet on tackling ransomware is a part of the Joe Biden administration’s four-part strategy to counter the scourge of ransomware.Colonial Pipeline, a major US oil distribution company, reportedly paid $4.4 million to a cybercriminal group DarkSide earlier in the year to get back control of its pipelines. And Toshiba, the Japanese electronics giant, had said the same group had hit the networks of its European division in France at the same time.The FBI, however, recovered $2.3 million of the ransomware that was paid by Colonial in Bitcoins.Ransomware attacks are a global menace. Ransomware payments reached over $400 million globally in 2020, the White House said in fact-sheet and topped $81 million in the first quarter of 2021, “illustrating the financially driven nature of these activities”.Disrupting ransomware infrastructure and actors as in the Colonial Pipeline case will the first of the four-part strategy to be announced by the Biden administration. “We’re bringing the full weight of U.S. government capabilities to disrupt ransomware actors, networks, financial infrastructure, and other facilitators,” the official said and went on to cite the Colonial case as an example.The second part of the strategy is to be bolster “resilience to withstand ransomware attacks”, addressing and fixing vulnerabilities in networks. The third is to prevent the “abuse of virtual currency” to launder ransom payments, and the fourth is to marshal international allies and partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cybersecurity-india-takes-lead-on-joe-biden-s-initiative-against-ransomware-101634149601493.html
13-10-2021||World||Facebook expands “involuntary” public figure option to journalists, activists. What it means||Facebook has decided that it will now consider activists and journalists as "involuntary" public figures on its platform so as to increase protection against harassment and bullying targeted at these groups, Facebook's global safety chief said in an interview with Reuters this week.Although it allows critical commentary of public figures and private individuals on the platform, Facebook, which has 2.8 billion monthly active users, went ahead and revamped its approach on the harassment of journalists and "human rights defenders", who it said are in the public eye due to their work rather than their public personas.The social media giant has already been under wide-ranging scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators for its content moderation practices and harms linked to its platforms, with internal documents leaked, forming the basis for a U.S. Senate hearing last week, as reported by Reuters.Facebook's "cross check" system has been in the spotlight lately after the Wall Street Journal reported that it has the effect of exempting some high-profile users from usual Facebook rules.The difference between public figures and private individuals in terms of the protections it affords them around online discussion, Reuters reported, is that users are generally allowed to call for the death of a celebrity on the platform.Earlier this year, Facebook had announced it would remove content celebrating, praising or mocking George Floyd's death, deemed an “involuntary” public figure.Facebook's Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis told Reuters that the company was expanding the types of attacks that would go against its policy for public figures on its platforms, in order to reduce any kind of violence disproportionately faced by women, people of color and the LGBTQ community.Facebook will also no longer allow severe and unwanted sexualizing content, derogatory sexualized photoshopped images, drawings or direct negative attacks on a person's appearance, for example, in comments on a public figure's profile, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-expands-involuntary-public-figure-option-to-journalists-activists-what-it-means-101634140774653.html
13-10-2021||World||Star Trek actor William Shatner becomes world's oldest space traveler at 90 after trip to space in Blue Origin rocketshi||Actor William Shatner soared aboard a Blue Origin rocketship on a suborbital trip and landed in the Texas desert on Wednesday to become at age 90 the oldest person ever in space as U.S. billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos's company carried out its second tourist flight.Shatner was one of four passengers to journey to the edge of space aboard the white fully autonomous 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters-tall) New Shepard spacecraft, which took off from Blue Origin's launch site about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.The four astronauts experienced about three to four minutes of weightlessness and traveled above the internationally recognized boundary of space known as the Karman Line, about 62 miles (100 km) above Earth. The crew capsule returned to the Texas desert under parachutes, raising a cloud of dust.The four astronauts, all wearing blue flight suits with the company's name in white letters on one sleeve, climbed into the crew capsule atop the spacecraft before the launch and strapped in after ascending a set of stairs accompanied by Bezos. Each rang a bell before entering the capsule, with Bezos then closing the hatch. Before that, they rode a vehicle with Bezos at the wheel to the launch pad.Winds were light and skies were clear for the launch, which was conducted after two delays totaling roughly 45 minutes.Joining Shatner - who embodied the promise of space travel in the classic 1960s TV series "Star Trek" and seven subsequent films - in the all-civilian crew were former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, clinical research entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin vice president and engineer Audrey Powers.It marked the second space tourism flight for Blue Origin, billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos's company founded two decades ago.The flight represents another important day for the nascent space tourism industry that, according to UBS, could reach an annual value of $3 billion in a decade. The flight, previously scheduled for Tuesday, was pushed back a day for wind-related reasons.Blue Origin had a successful debut space tourism flight on July 20, with Bezos and three others aboard, flying to the edge of space and back on a trip lasting 10 minutes and 10 seconds. On that flight, pioneering female aviator Wally Funk at age 82 became the oldest person to reach space. The previous record was set in 1998 when pioneering astronaut John Glenn returned to space as a 77-year-old U.S. senator.Bezos, the Amazon.com Inc founder and current executive chairman, formed Blue Origin two decades ago.Shatner, who turned 90 in March, has been acting since the 1950s and remains busy with entertainment projects and fan conventions. He is best known for starring as Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise on the classic 1960s TV series "Star Trek" and seven subsequent films about fictional adventures in outer space.As an actor, Shatner was synonymous with space voyages. During the opening credits of each episode of the series, he called space "the final frontier" and promised "to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""Beam me up," Shatner's character would tell the Enterprise's chief engineer Scotty, played by James Doohan, in a memorable catchphrase when he needed to be transported to the starship.Shatner said there is both irony and symmetry to his space trip, having played a space explorer for decades and now actually becoming one."Having played the role of Captain Kirk ... assigns me the knowledge that a futuristic astronaut would have, but I've always been consumed with curiosity," Shatner said in a Blue Origin video.Shatner's participation in the flight has helped generate publicity for Blue Origin as it competes against two billionaire-backed rivals - Elon Musk's SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc - to attract customers willing to pay large sums to experience spaceflight.Branson inaugurated his space tourism service on July 11, riding along on a suborbital flight with six others aboard his company's VSS Unity rocket plane. SpaceX, which has launched numerous astronauts and cargo payloads to the International Space Station for NASA, debuted its space tourism business by flying the first all-civilian crew to reach Earth's orbit in a three-day mission ending Sept. 18.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration two weeks ago said it will review safety concerns raised by former and current Blue Origin employees who have accused the company of prioritizing speed and cost savings over quality control and adequate staffing. (Reporting by Mike Blake; Additional reporting by Peter Szekely in New York and Eric M.

The United States said Cambodia had a year earlier turned down its offer to repair the base.Cambodia has repeatedly denied reports that it is planning to let China place its forces at the facility.Such a move would be significant for China in a region where the United States has for decades maintained a regional presence through bases it once operated or joint exercises in countries like Thailand and the Philippines.Phay Siphan, Cambodia's government spokesman, said Chinese construction at Ream was part of its development assistance."Our port is open to all when the construction is finished," Phay Siphan said, adding that China was not building a facility for its military."If there are other friends who want to help constructing, we allow and when the construction is finished, we welcome all countries to use it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-out-cambodia-for-non-transparency-over-chinese-activity-at-navy-base-101634133512129.html

It is also necessary to cause the international community to build a united front against terrorism by abandoning double standards and selective counter-terrorism so as to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a hotbed and harbour for terrorism again,” Wang said in his speech delivered via video link.Referring to the US’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in August, Wang said countries that have caused the current predicament in Afghanistan should learn the lessons and take responsibility to help avoid a humanitarian and refugee crisis.“Countries that still impose unilateral sanctions should lift them, and international financial organisations should increase financial support for Afghanistan’s poverty alleviation and infrastructure construction,” Wang was quoted as saying in the foreign ministry statement after the G20 special session.China has strongly criticised the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and have maintained close and frequent communication with the Taliban, which is now in power.It was one of the first countries to announce a 200 million yuan ($31million) aid for Afghanistan in September, and it has urged the international community, particularly the US, to provide assistance to Kabul.Beijing has also said that while it encourages Kabul to form an inclusive government and cut ties with terrorists, especially the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), it will not interfere in its domestic affairs.In late July, Wang had told a visiting Taliban delegation that it hopes the insurgent group will play a critical role in the reconstruction process of Afghanistan and had urged the insurgent group to crackdown on ETIM, an Islamic group it alleges is fuelling separatism in Xinjiang.In his speech on Tuesday, Wang said, “Today’s Afghanistan is at the crossroads of the rise and fall of governance, and there is still a long way to go to achieve peace and stability.”Wang urged G20 members to contribute to the peaceful development of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan on the basis of respect for its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.The virtual meeting was hosted by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the rotating president of the G20. US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Europe’s G20 leaders also took part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-talks-china-moots-tough-approach-to-terror-in-taliban-run-afghanistan-101634130520050.html

In a year, an estimate of 22,000 girls are losing their lives as a result of pregnancies and childbirth after an early marriage, the report further said.West and Central Africa accounted for nearly half (9,600) of all estimated child marriage-related deaths worldwide, according to the study. The region also has the highest rate of child marriages in the world and the highest teenage maternal mortality rate.In the South Asian region, at least 2,000, an estimate of six a day, child marriage-related deaths are taking place annually, the report found.South Asia is followed by East Asia and Pacific with 650 deaths and Latin America and the Caribbean with 560 annual deaths.worl.In the report, the organisation said the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the progress made against the practice of child marriage across the world. The virus pushed millions of people into poverty, which has eventually led to higher cases of violence against women. "A further 10 million girls are now expected to marry by 2030, leaving more girls at a risk of dying," the report further read."Childbirth is the number one killer of teenage girls because their young bodies aren't ready to bear children," said Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International.He urged governments around the world to focus on girls and bring norms to protect them from child marriage and premature child-births.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-marriage-killing-over-60-girls-a-day-worldwide-finds-study-101634119925245.html

13-10-2021||World||Billionaire Alibaba founder Jack Ma reappears in Hong Kong: Report||Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma, largely out of public view since a regulatory clampdown started on his business empire late last year, is currently in Hong Kong and has met business associates in recent days, two sources told Reuters.The Chinese billionaire has been keeping a low profile since delivering a speech in October last year in Shanghai criticising China's financial regulators. That triggered a chain of events that resulted in the shelving of his Ant Group's mega IPO.While Ma made a limited number of public appearances in mainland China after that, as speculation swirled about his whereabouts, one of the sources said the visit marked his first trip to the Asian financial hub since last October.Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of its regular business hours. Comments from Ma typically come via the company.The sources declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.Ma, once China's most famous and outspoken entrepreneur, met at least "a few" business associates over meals last week, said the people.Ma, who is mostly based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, where his business empire is headquartered, owns at least one luxury house in the former British colony that also houses some of his companies' offshore business operations.Alibaba is also listed in Hong Kong, besides New York.The former English teacher disappeared from public view for three months before surfacing in January, speaking to a group of teachers by video. That eased concern about his unusual absence from the limelight and sent Alibaba shares surging.In May, Ma made a rare visit to Alibaba's Hangzhou campus during the firm's annual "Ali Day" staff and family event, company sources have said.On Sept. 1, photographs of Ma visiting several agricultural greenhouses in the eastern Zhejiang province, home to both Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant, went viral on Chinese social media.The next day, Alibaba said it would invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) by 2025 in support of "common prosperity", becoming the latest corporate giant to pledge support for the wealth sharing initiative driven by President Xi Jinping.Alibaba and its tech rivals have been the target of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on issues ranging from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights. The e-commerce behemoth was fined a record $2.75 billion in April over monopoly violations.Earlier this year, regulators also imposed a sweeping restructuring on Ant, whose botched $37 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market would have been the world's largest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billionaire-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-reappears-in-hong-kong-report-101634105306294.html

Downdetector reports brief outage for users||Twitter services went down for several users on Wednesday morning, according to the online service status tracker Downdetector. According to the tracker which analyses tens of millions of daily problem alerts, the reports from Twitter users complaining of services going down peaked around 8 this morning; however, the graph soon showed a reduction in the number of complaints indicating that the services were soon restored.As per the Twitter status report page on Downdetector, there were as many as 455 reports at 8:03am, the second such peak in a day which also had the baseline peaking with reports at around 5am. Around 52 per cent of users complaining of Twitter services going down specified the issue as relating to the Twitter website, while 38 per cent of users reported that the issue was with the Twitter app. Meanwhile, 10 per cent of users said that the Twitter snag was a result of an error in the server connection.The reported technical snag on Twitter comes days after the Facebook family of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, went dark on earlier this month for nearly six hours before services began to be gradually restored.How does Downdetector work?Downdetector, according to its official website, offers real-time status information for more than 6,000 services across 45 websites representing 45 countries. When a service provider’s customers are experiencing problems, Downdetector aggregates and analyses this data to determine the potential nature of the issue and then works to alert both the company and community of possible issues.The live outage map, which shows the ‘spikes’ in reports over time, helps users gauge the kind of response the website is getting across the world. If there are a number of spikes corresponding to the timestamps, like in the image above, it means other users too are experiencing similar problems with the website and it's not just a singular case of bad internet. Downdetector also has a daily historical view of problem reports compared to the baseline volume.As more and more users submit problem reports directly on a company status page on Downdetector, along with an indicator of the type of problem they are experiencing, the tracking service gathers data through Twitter and uses ‘sentiment analysis’ to detect issues for a given company and its location. It also looks at other key indicators from across the web to determine if an extraordinary volume of users is having issues with a monitored company or service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-down-downdetector-reports-brief-outage-for-users-101634094446412.html
13-10-2021||World||US senator asks Mark Zuckerberg to retain all records related to Facebook whistleblower testimony||Senate commerce committee chair Maria Cantwell on Tuesday called on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to preserve all documents related to testimony last week from company whistleblower Frances Haugen.“The testimony ... raises significant concerns about whether Facebook has misled the public, federal regulators, and this committee,” said Cantwell, a Democrat. “This committee will continue its oversight and work to pursue legislation to protect consumers’ privacy, improve data security, and strengthen federal enforcement to address the digital harms that are the subject of these hearings.”She asked Facebook to preserve and retain internal Facebook research referenced by Haugen and Facebook’s evaluation of the research; ranking or composition systems; experiments or recommendations to change those ranking systems and the impact of Facebook’s platforms on children and teenagers under the age of 18.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in response the company has “absolutely no commercial incentive, no moral incentive, no company-wide incentive to do anything other than to try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook.”Cantwell's letter cited “the potential danger that social media platforms pose for spreading divisive content was demonstrated, with horrifying consequences, by the role the Facebook platform played in fomenting ethnic violence against the Rohingya.”She added, “the role of Facebook’s platform in the Rohingya tragedy illustrates the horrible consequences that failing to effectively limit the spread of divisive content on social media platforms can have in inflicting public harm.”Last month, a US judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down, rejecting its argument about protecting privacy as “rich with irony.”Last week, the Commerce Committee harshly criticised Facebook, accusing Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety, and demanded regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children's mental health and stokes divisions.Zuckerberg defended the company, saying the accusations were at odds with Facebook's goals.Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them.Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-asks-mark-zuckerberg-to-retain-all-records-related-to-facebook-whistleblower-testimony-101634093666684.html
13-10-2021||World||US to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated||The US will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the country moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel, such as trade, since the earliest days of the pandemic. The new rules, to be announced Wednesday, will allow fully vaccinated foreign nationals to enter the U.S. regardless of the reason for travel starting in early November, when a similar easing of restrictions is set to kick in for air travel into the country. By mid-January, even essential travelers seeking to enter the U.S., like truck drivers, will need to be fully vaccinated.Senior administration officials previewed the new policy late Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to speak ahead of the formal announcement.Both Mexico and Canada have pressed the U.S. for months to ease restrictions on travel that have separated families and curtailed leisure trips since the onset of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month's announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel, and instead require vaccination for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.Both policies will take effect in early November, the officials said. They did not specify a particular date.The new rules only apply to legal entry to the U.S. Officials cautioned that those seeking to enter illegally will still be subject to expulsion under so-called Title 42 authority, first invoked by former President Donald Trump, that has drawn criticism from immigration advocates for swiftly removing migrants before they can seek asylum. One of the officials said the U.S. was continuing the policy because cramped conditions in border patrol facilities pose a COVID-19 threat.According to the officials, travelers entering the U.S. by vehicle, rail and ferry will be asked about their vaccination status as part of the standard U.S. Customs and Border Protection admissions process. At officers' discretion, travelers will have their proof of vaccination verified in a secondary screening process.Unlike air travel, for which proof of a negative Covid-19 test is required before boarding a flight to enter the U.S., no testing will be required to enter the U.S. by land or sea, provided the travelers meet the vaccination requirement.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. will accept travelers who have been fully vaccinated with any of the vaccines approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, not just those in use in the U.S. That means that the AstraZeneca vaccine, widely used in Canada, will be accepted.Officials said the CDC was still working to formalize procedures for admitting those who received doses of two different vaccines, as was fairly common in Canada.The delay in the vaccination requirement for essential cross-border travel is meant to provide truck drivers and others with additional time to get a shot and minimize potential economic disruption from the vaccination mandate, officials said.All told, the new procedures move toward a policy based on the risk profiles of individuals, rather than less targeted country-based bans.The vaccination requirement for foreign nationals comes as the White House has moved to impose sweeping vaccination-or-testing requirements affecting as many as 100 million people in the U.S. in an effort to encourage holdouts to get shots.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Labor completed the initial draft of an emergency regulation that will require employers of 100 workers or more to demand their employees be vaccinated against Covid-19 or tested weekly. The Office of Management and Budget is now reviewing the order before its implementation.Mexico has not put in place any Covid-19 entry procedures for travelers. Canada allows entry of fully-vaccinated individuals with proof of vaccination against Covid-19 as well as proof of a negative test conducted within 72 hours of entry to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-reopen-land-borders-in-november-for-fully-vaccinated-101634093942018.html

We are fearful that the death toll might rise further,” Jeevan Lamicchane, Inspector at Karnali province police office, told ANI over the phone.As per the official, a rescue operation was carried out in the steep terrain with help of the Nepali army and their chopper along with a private airlines flight was used to rescue the injured ones who were in critical condition. “The bus seems to have gone off the road down the cliff to about 300 meters. We have speculated brake failure to be the reason behind it. We still are continuing our operation,” Rom Bahadur Mahat, chief district officer of Mugu informed.A total of 39 people were on board the bus.

The chemicals, which can be found in hundreds of products such as toys, clothing, and shampoo, have been known for decades to be "hormone disruptors," affecting a person's endocrine system. The toxins can enter the body through such items and are linked to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, said the study published in the journal Environmental Pollution.The research, which was carried out by New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and includes some 5,000 adults aged 55 to 64, shows that those with higher concentrations of phthalates in their urine were more likely to die of heart disease.However, higher concentrations did not appear to increase the risk of death by cancer."Our findings reveal that increased phthalate exposure is linked to early death, particularly due to heart disease," said study lead author Leonardo Trasande."Until now, we have understood that the chemicals connect to heart disease, and heart disease, in turn, is a leading cause of death, but we had not yet tied the chemicals themselves to death."Trasande cautioned, however, that the study does not establish a direct cause and effect relationship between phthalate exposure and death, in part because the specific biological mechanisms of that relationship are unclear."Our research suggests that the toll of this chemical on society is much greater than we first thought," Trasande said, adding that it "is undeniably clear that limiting exposure to toxic phthalates can help safeguard Americans' physical and financial wellbeing."Other studies have already linked phthalates to more than 10,000 deaths per year associated with reduced testosterone levels in adult men.The study added that the economic loss due to phthalates is between $40 billion and $47 billion -- more than four times what was previously estimated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-makeup-to-shampoo-widely-used-chemical-linked-to-100-000-us-deaths-a-year-101634091847135.html
13-10-2021||World||US hopes Abraham Accords will help Israeli-Palestinian issue: Officials||The United States is working to expand normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab nations, known as the Abraham Accords, and hopes restoring such ties can be leveraged to advance progress on the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, senior State Department officials said on Tuesday.In a briefing with reporters previewing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meetings on Wednesday with his Israeli and Emirati counterparts, officials repeated that the Abraham Accords were not a substitute for the two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians."We continue to welcome the economic cooperation between Israel and all countries in the region. We hope that normalisation can be leveraged to advance progress on the Israeli-Palestinian tracks," a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity said.Blinken will first meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and United Arab Emirates Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan separately at the State Department on Wednesday. He will then host a trilateral meeting with both of them, the first of its kind.The leaders of Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed the Abraham Accords at the White House last September. The following month, Israel and Sudan announced they would normalize relations, and Morocco established diplomatic ties with Israel in December, after U.S. President Joe Biden defeated his predecessor Donald Trump in the election.Palestinian officials said they felt betrayed by their Arab brethren for reaching deals with Israel without first demanding progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state. Until last year, only two Arab states - Egypt and Jordan - had forged full ties with Israel.The U.S. officials did not say precisely how Washington aimed to use the normalisation agreements as a tool to make progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue."Biden administration has started out with a clear commitment to the two-state solution. We continue on with that commitment. We seek to advance as we can, when we can, as best we can," one of the U.S. officials said.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a nationalist atop a cross-partisan coalition, opposes Palestinian statehood.The three countries will also be setting up two new working groups at the meeting, U.S. officials said, with one group focusing on religious coexistence and the other on water and energy issues."These working groups will seek to realise that promise to link up to important U.S. partners in the region and find new ways to solve old problems together, in Israel and the UAE but also across the region," one of the U.S. officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopes-abraham-accords-will-help-israeli-palestinian-issue-officials-101634091441035.html
13-10-2021||World||Pakistan: Things tense between Imran Khan and army chief? Govt says no conflict||The Pakistan government on Tuesday maintained that there is no conflict between prime minister Imran Khan and General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the influential chief of the country's armed forces, over the recent appointment of Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the new director-general of the notorious Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the top spy agency of Pakistan. The buzz over differences in opinion between prime minister Khan and the Pakistani army chief originated last week after the appointment of Nadeem Ahmed Anjum as the ISI chief was announced. No relevant notification was issued by Imran Khan's office, which led to renewed speculations about a conflict between the civilian government and the army.Also Read | Who is Lieutenant general Nadeem Anjum, replacing Faiz Hameed as new ISI chief?For context, Pakistan's law states that the prime minister has the right and prerogative to appoint the ISI chief in consultation with the army chief. Pointing this out, the country's information minister Fawad Chaudhry said during a press conference last week that prime minister Imran Khan and army chief Bajwa discussed the matter in a “long sitting” and the premier had subsequently taken the Cabinet into confidence over the issue.However, Pakistani media publications indicate that things may not have gone as smoothly as Chaudhry claims. According to reports, Bajwa made it clear to Khan that the prime minister should not exceed his brief by interfering in military matters and that Lt General Faiz Hameed, who Khan wanted to retain as the ISI chief, could be given an extension till November 15 but not beyond that date. Senior Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi said on a TV show that the prime minister's stance on the issue has resulted in a standoff, and this is the reason why a notification has still not been issued by his office.Also Read | Former DG (ISI) could succeed Gen Bajwa as Pakistan Army ChiefIt was first reported by Hindustan Times on October 7 that Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the former chief of Pak ISI, is in the reckoning to succeed General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who used to be his senior at the Baloch regiment, as the next chief of the Pakistani armed forces. The former spymaster is now the Peshawar Corps commander, a move which Pakistan watchers say was carefully crafted to build up towards Hameed's future position as the army chief, a mandatory requirement being the experience commanding a Corps level formation for at least one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-things-tense-between-imran-khan-and-army-chief-govt-says-no-conflict-101634087936421.html

London ambulance crews took a woman and a child to the hospital for treatment.“Crews were faced with a lot of smoke issuing from the top of a block of flats on arrival," station commander Pete Johnson said. “There was also lots of visible flame, which has prompted a high number of calls to our control officers."Photos from the scene showed flames from the top of the building and a dark plume of smoke drifting into the sky.“I heard a bang and glass smashing. I went out and saw there was glass on the floor. Then I heard a bang and looked up and saw fire," student Ishika Deb, who lives in a neighboring apartment building, told reporters.The fire brigade said the cause of the blaze was not yet known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-erupts-on-20th-floor-of-london-high-rise-injuring-2-101634087494847.html
13-10-2021||World||Finance ministers of G20 nations to meet today in Washington||The finance ministers of G20 (Group of 20) nations are all set to meet on Wednesday in the capital city of the United States, Washington DC, to discuss matters related to the international economy and global health, specifically focusing on efforts geared towards the promotion of more sustainable growth. The ministers will be joined by central bank governors as part of the meeting known as the annual G20 finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBGs) meet.According to an official statement issued by G20, the Wednesday meeting will be held as part of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank Group (WBG) annual meetings. In the third FMCBG meet held in Venice three months ago (the first such in-person finance track meeting since February 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic), the ministers and the governors discussed international taxation matters and financial sector issues.In the fourth FMCBG meeting, the G20 ministers and the central bank governors are slated to discuss the Covid-19 global recovery, thanks to the vaccines against the coronavirus disease, but with a special focus on how recuperation still remains uneven across and even within several countries. According to the agenda of the meeting issued beforehand, the ministers and governors will exchange views on how to continue to sustain the economic recovery and address the adverse consequences of the pandemic, especially on the most impacted groups of the society.This takes special significance since the last FMCBG meeting had seen the ministers and governors have a “very fruitful exchange of views” on the support to the most vulnerable countries. To help countries in critical conditions, the meet is expected to discuss ways to channel a share of the special drawing rights (SDRs) of the $650 billion allocated by the IMF for this purpose. “Exchange of views will also continue on the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and the International Development Association replenishment,” the G20 statement added.Moreover, climate change is also likely to take up an important spot in today's G20 FMCBG meet. Following up on the previous session's commitment to “promote transitions towards greener, more prosperous and inclusive economies and societies”, the dignitaries attending the meet will decide on ways to synergise and build an effective policy mix to move towards carbon-neutral economies. “In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the membership is expected to endorse the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which has been prepared by the Sustainable Finance Working Group,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finance-ministers-of-g20-nations-to-meet-today-in-washington-101634085149217.html
13-10-2021||World||US: 3 dead, including gunman, after postal service worker opens fire at facility||Two US postal service workers were fatally shot Tuesday at a postal facility in Memphis and a third employee identified as the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. It was the third high-profile shooting in or near that west Tennessee city in weeks. US postal inspector Susan Link said the three postal workers were found dead after the shooting at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in a prominent Memphis neighborhood. FBI spokeswoman Lisa-Anne Culp said the shooting was carried out by a third postal service worker, who shot him or herself.No identities or motives were released by Link or Culp at a brief news conference late Tuesday afternoon.The shooting occurred at a post office facility in the historic Orange Mound neighborhood, southeast of downtown Memphis. The carrier annex is only used by employees.The street leading to the complex was blocked by police Tuesday afternoon following the shooting, and the FBI, the US Postal Inspection Service, and other federal authorities went to investigate. Bystanders watching the police activity talked near a convenience store at an intersection. Nearby, officers had blocked the street with yellow crime scene tape and barricades. Some cars slowed down as they drove past police and reporters.A white four-door car was towed from the scene, but it was not clear who it belonged to.“The Postal Service is saddened at the events that took place today in Memphis," USPS said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with the family members, friends, and coworkers of the individuals involved. The Postal Service will be providing resources to all employees at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in the coming days and weeks.”The violence follows other shootings in the Memphis area in recent weeks. The franchise owner of a sushi counter inside a Kroger grocery store in the suburb of Collierville fatally shot one person and wounded 14 others before killing himself on Sept. 23, investigators said. A week later, a teenage boy was shot and critically wounded inside a Memphis school and police detained a second boy believed to be the shooter.US Rep. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat, called the post office “the latest site of gun violence” in the Memphis area.“Today’s shooting at the postal facility in Orange Mound is yet another example of why I am concerned that too many guns are out there and in possession of people who aren’t able to control their anger,” Cohen said in a statement. "I express my profound condolences to all those affected by this terrible event.”Tuesday's incident comes 11 years after another fatal post office shooting in West Tennessee. On October 18, 2010, two mail workers were fatally shot during a robbery at a post office in the rural town of Henning, located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Memphis. That post office was named in honor of slain employees Paula Robinson and Judy Spray last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-3-dead-including-gunman-after-postal-service-worker-opens-fire-at-facility-101634084280734.html

Italy currently holds the rotational presidency of the group. The regular summit of G20 leaders is scheduled for later this month in Rome.“The leaders discussed the critical need to maintain a laser focus on our enduring counterterrorism efforts, including against threats from ISIS-K (another name for IS-K), and ensuring safe passage for those foreign nationals and Afghan partners with documentation seeking to depart Afghanistan,” the White House said.The leaders also “reaffirmed their collective commitment to provide humanitarian assistance directly to the Afghan people through independent international organisations”, and to promote fundamental human rights for all Afghans, including women, girls and members of minority groups.The White House further said that the US “remains committed to working closely with the international community and using diplomatic, humanitarian and economic means to address the situation in Afghanistan and support the Afghan people”.The White House readout did not give details of the American president’s own remarks at the G20 meeting.Biden’s decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan in August paved the way for the Taliban to return to power, jeopardising the gains of the past 20 years, especially rights of women and minorities.The US president has faced severe criticism from allies at home and around the world for having abandoned Afghanistan in a move that has been seen as being driven by domestic political expediency.UN chief: Afghans face ‘make-or-break moment’Warning that Afghanistan is facing “a make-or-break moment”, the UN chief has urged the world to prevent the country’s economy from collapsing.
