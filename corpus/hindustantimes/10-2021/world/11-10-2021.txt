Without them, there is no way the Afghan economy and society will recover," the UN chief warned.Guterres also spoke at length about the challenges faced by Afghanistan's economy. The country's assets held abroad have been frozen, and development aid has been suspended."We need to find ways to make the economy breathe again. This can be done without violating international laws or compromising principles," he said."I urge the world to take action and inject liquidity into the Afghan economy to avoid collapse."According to UN officials, it is possible for international funds or money from blocked Afghan assets to be paid to UN agencies and nongovernmental organizations that then pay salaries to Afghans on the ground.This practice, with bank exemptions authorized by the United States in particular, has already been used in the past for other countries including Yemen.But Guterres warned the international community was moving too slowly to give aid to Afghanistan, where the humanitarian and economic crisis affect at least 18 million people -- about half the population.International humanitarian aid has thus far been delivered to different parts of the country without obstruction from the Taliban, and even with their cooperation and security assistance, he said."The number of incidents during humanitarian operations has been in constant decline," Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-guterres-slams-broken-taliban-promises-made-to-women-and-girls-101633973608323.html

He showed no public sign of illness himself and emerged after two weeks to hold an in-person meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Sept. 29. Since then, however, he’s continued to hold most of his public meetings by videoconference. Nationally, Russia is suffering another surge in Covid-19 cases, with daily reported deaths hitting record highs, as officials blame low vaccination rates for the rise in infections.Total deaths in Russia linked to Covid-19 since the epidemic began rose above 400,000 in August, according to the latest monthly assessment by the Federal Statistics Service released late Friday. July and August have been the deadliest months to date, with a total of 100,000 deaths recorded.(Updates with Russia deaths data, graphic in last paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-worry-everything-s-fine-putin-says-while-repeatedly-coughing-at-a-meet-101633971979731.html

In a televised address, Prayut said the coronavirus quarantine requirement will end for at least 10 countries including the United Kingdom, Singapore, Germany, China and the United States."When they arrive, they should present a (negative) Covid test... and test once again upon arrival," AFP further quoted the prime minister as saying.After getting a negative test, "they can travel freely like Thais," he said.Currently, vaccinated tourists need to undergo at least seven days of quarantine in a hotel after their arrival in Thailand. Thailand also has a so-called "sandbox" scheme which allows vaccinated tourists to move freely around Phuket for a fortnight and afterwards travel to the mainland without quarantine.There is a curfew in place in Bangkok and other areas from 10pm. to 4am. to check a third wave of the coronavirus that began in April this year.Prayut said visitors outside of Thailand's designated 10 low-risk countries are welcome, “but they have to be in quarantine”, he added. He said more nations would be added to the 'green list' in December.Acknowledging that his decision can lead to a spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, Prayut said people will not be able to stand it if they lose a second chance at this business opportunity.Around 40 million tourists visited Thailand every year before the pandemic, with tourism making up almost 20 percent of its national income. However, Covid-related restrictions left the economy battered. Today's announcement comes as a relief for people in the tourism sector who have suffered losses in their businesses during the ongoing pandemic.Last year, Thailand suffered losses of about $50 billion in tourism revenue as foreign arrivals plunged 83 percent to 6.7 million, from a record 39.9 million two years ago.Currently, the Southeast Asian kingdom has more than 1.7 million cases, and has recorded 17,751 deaths related to Covid-19 infection.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-to-end-quarantine-for-vaccinated-visitors-from-low-risk-nations-november-1-onward-101633962041659.html

Putin takes pains to avoid even mentioning his name.Navalny's movement suffered a new blow in June when a court ruled its activities to be extremist. Many of his allies have had their homes raided or their freedom of movement restricted, and some have fled abroad. Last month Russia opened a new criminal case against Navalny that could keep him in jail for a further decade.RIA news agency said a Moscow court on Monday rejected an action by Navalny against the prosecutor's office over the blocking of his YouTube channel. The channel had advised Russians how to vote in a parliamentary election that went on to be won by the pro-Putin United Russia party.Some of Navalny's supporters have criticised last week's award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov, saying Navalny would have been a more deserving winner. Muratov dedicated the prize to six of his paper's journalists murdered for their work while also saying he would have given it to Navalny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremist-terrorist-navalny-on-how-prison-in-russia-has-changed-his-status-101633965762868.html

The Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) has claimed the suicide bombing at the mosque on October 8. Hundreds of Shia men gathered for Friday prayers when the bomber struck. Dozens of people were injured in the deadly attack. “India strongly condemns the terrorist attack on a Shia mosque in Kunduz, Afghanistan in which more than 100 Afghans were reported to have lost [their] lives and several others injured,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “We extend our condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims during their difficult time,” it said. India said the attack had once again highlighted the need to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The statement said, “India stands committed in the fight against the scourge of terrorism and reiterates the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan. We stand with the people of Afghanistan and hope that perpetrators of this attack would be identified and brought to justice expeditiously.” Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, India has repeatedly insisted that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism. The Indian government has also cautioned the world community against rushing into recognising the Taliban setup, saying the change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and was done without negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-condemns-suicide-attack-on-mosque-in-afghanistan-101633965308727.html
11-10-2021||World||What are ‘natural experiments’ which fetched the 2021 Economics Nobel?||Three US-based economists won the 2021 Economics Nobel Prize for pioneering ‘natural experiments’, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Monday. The Prize was split two-way. One half went to Canadian-born David Card of the University of California at Berkeley while the other half was awarded to Israeli-American, Joshua D Angrist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dutch-American Guido W Imbens from Stanford University. Peter Fredriksson, who chairs the Economic Sciences Committee, said in a media statement: “Card’s studies of core questions for society and Angrist and Imbens’ methodological contributions have shown that natural experiments are a rich source of knowledge.” “Their research has substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit for society.” What are natural experiments? Let us look at the definition provided by The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. “Natural experiments or quasi-natural experiments in economics are serendipitous situations in which persons are assigned randomly to a treatment (or multiple treatments) and a control group, and outcomes are analysed for the purposes of putting a hypothesis to a severe test; they are also serendipitous situations where assignment to treatment ‘approximates’ randomized design or a well-controlled experiment.” In a rough-and-ready sense, it stands for real-world situations that are studied for their effects on individuals. “Natural persons” or “events” are randomly divided in an experiment between a controlled group and a treatment group. The key to these observational experiments is that the results are often “serendipitous”, or ones leading to new surprising discoveries. Canada-born economist Card used this approach to assess the impact of minimum wage increases. Those who argue against increasing floor wages, a labour-welfare measure, cite unemployment as an unwanted side-effect (since employers have to pay more in wages, they hire less). Card’s experiment showed that this needn’t be the case always. Natural experimental approaches are based on “exclusively natural events as instruments”, according to a 2000 paper published in the Journal of Economic Literature by Mark R Rosensweig and Kenneth Wolpin. Natural experiments weren’t always a conventional approach in the study of Economics, but have a rich history of at least four decades. For instance, Wolpin did use some of this approach in a study on India entitled, “A New Test of the Permanent Income Hypothesis: The Impact of Weather on Income and Consumption of Farm Households in India,” published in the International Economic Review in 1982. The natural event in this study was of course weather patterns.“Natural experiments are everywhere,” Eva Mörk, a member of the Prize Committee for the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was quoted as telling a news conference by Reuters on Monday. The Economics Prize is officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. Winners are awarded a sum of US $1.14 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-natural-experiments-which-fetched-the-2021-economics-nobel-101633960447508.html

This report suggests so||Russian spies stole the formula for the vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) AstraZeneca developed with Oxford University researchers and used it to create its own Sputnik V jab, The Sun has reported. The British tabloid cited security services as saying that they have proof one of the Russian spies swiped the vital data from the drugs firm—including the blueprint for the Covid-19 vaccine—and used it to create Sputnik V. It also reported that the blueprint and vital information was stolen by a foreign agent in person. Russia’s Sputnik V jab uses similar technology to the Oxford designed vaccine, which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and being used in the vaccination drive by the Centre. The United Kingdom’s security minister Damian Hinds did not confirm the report but said cyber attacks were becoming more sophisticated. Hinds was asked on LBC Radio about the claim in The Sun that British security chiefs believe Russia stole the formula for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. “I can’t comment specifically but it’s fair for your listeners to assume that constantly there are foreign states who would like to get their hands on sensitive information, including sometimes commercial secrets, sometimes scientific, intellectual property, constantly trying to get hold of it and in the cyberspace that is done in a very different way from how things use to happen and we need to be exceptionally vigilant towards it.” "We live in aworld, I am afraid, where there is state activity seeking to engage in industrial espionage and economic espionage, there are cyber attacks that happen and so on.”Also read | Centre permits export of 4 million doses of Sputnik Light vaccine to RussiaThe Sun also said in its report that last year spies pointed the finger at President Vladimir Putin and said they were “more than 95 per cent” sure that Russian state-sponsored hackers targeted the UK, the US and Canadian bodies developing a Covid-19 vaccine. “We are very careful in terms of calling these things out, ensuring we can have that confidence in attribution. We believe we have this here,” the late security minister James Brokenshire said at the time, according to the Sun.However, Sputnik denied the claim late on Monday, saying the report was “another fake news and blatant lie based on anonymous sources.” “They also make absolutely no sense scientifically as Sputnik V and AstraZeneca use different platforms. Sputnik V is based on a well-studied human adenoviral platform whose efficacy and safety have been proven over decades,” it said in a statement.

With only bottle caps to moisten lips and no food, about 500 of the ethnic minorities are transported at a time from freight stations with more than 100 passengers in each carriage, the former law enforcer said."We gather them together, put hoods on their head, two people handcuffed together, to prevent them from escaping," the man, who wanted to be identified as only as Jiang, was quoted as saying in the report."To keep order, we don't let them go to the toilet. They reach their destinations in two days. They reach Xinjiang," he further said.Also read | Warming relations between China, Taliban cause fear among Uyghurs: ReportJiang also spoke about a 2019 drone footage that seemed to reveal blindfolded and shacked Uyghur prisoners being unloaded from a train -- their heads shaved.He said the clipping most likely showed detainees being transferred from various centres to a larger central facility, because of their different uniform.Jiang told Sky News that worked as a detective in a local public security bureau after having served as a soldier.However, the Chinese government has denied the allegations when confronted during a news conference in Beijing.A spokesperson for the Xinjiang government said the revelations of the “so-called local policeman could not happen"."China is a country ruled by law. Police act and handle crimes in accordance with relevant PRC laws. It's forbidden to imprison people illegally and torture people to coerce a statement. Police must protect all the suspect's rights. So the things said by the man that officials didn't let them go to toilets and that they had no water to drink, and so on, do not exist,” Elijan Anayat, the spokesperson, was quoted as saying in the report.China has so far refuted all reports of human rights abuse and repression of the ethnic minority group in Xinjiang and referred to them as "the lie of the century".Also read | China uses coercive policies in Xinjiang to drive down Uyghur birth rates: ReportHowever, Jiang said the authorities did not see ordinary people as human beings. “They do things that you don't do to human beings," he said. Describing the tactics employed in the camp, Jiang said, "In cases related to politics, jeopardising the regime, cases involving overthrowing the regime - you're allowed to beat people.  It's ok, to make them turn in other people's names.""You use various methods to put pressure -- two people use sticks to weigh down their legs, tie him up and trample their arm; shackle their hands, pour cold water - put a water pipe into their mouth and tie them up," he added."How to say, under this kind of management in the re-education centre, beating somebody to death, for sure, it happens," the defector further said.“If accidents occur, it's normal that some people die. That's just how you get used to saying it. Please do not blame me.”"They have problems with their thoughts," said Jiang and grounds for suspicion and detention included differing opinions on the Communist government, seeking help from higher authorities, or not selling alcohol and cigarettes, all of which could be considered "ideological issues" that justified “re-education”.He said there was, however, a distinction between those sentenced to prison and those sent to re-education centres.“Those who actually contacted other people and planned to rebel, they can be sentenced. But people in the re-education centres are not severe enough to be sentenced.”Jiang left China in 2020, but he was disillusioned with the regime before he was sent to Xinjiang. Having seen much of life, he said his defection and revelations were not about betraying the motherland. "It's a way for me to free myself."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-food-bottlecaps-to-moisten-lips-ex-chinese-cop-reveals-uyghur-travel-woes-101633953282927.html

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak of the operation on the record.Jassem worked with al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006. He assumed various security positions in Iraq, and moved to Syria in 2015, after the Islamic State group, an al-Qaida offshoot, declared its caliphate in 2014 and became the deputy of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the extremist group's leader.Al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S.-led raid in northwestern Syria in 2019, under former U.S. President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-says-it-arrested-top-islamic-state-leader-sami-jasim-101633949637970.html

The ruling Communist Party of China heralded the 2021 relaxation as a major milestone but women were wary it would only exacerbate the existing inequalities.Chinese citizens took to Weibo a day after this policy change was announced on May 31, complaining of rising education expenses, long work hours, lack of access to proper child care services, and sky high real estate prices. The Chinese government promised to help families with child care and education costs but so far little has been done in this regard.“Our government is very good at empty talk,” Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist activist told the New York Times after the three child policy was released, adding that “It’s meaningless to just look at a few things they said.”The Chinese President Xi Jinping has however tried to make good of his party’s promise by dealing a lethal blow to the Chinese online tutoring industry by imposing a ban on for-profit tutoring, in a bid to reduce education cost for parents who spend their last penny into getting their children ready for highly competitive Chinese universities.CCP has also initiated bans on online gaming and restricted the amount of time children can spend playing video games to three hours, and banned online celebrity fan clubs. All these moves, critics opine, belong to the ‘Xi Jinping school of thought’ which aims to impose stricter control on Chinese social life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-women-speak-out-on-weibo-against-three-child-policy-101633949341030.html

South Korea and European countries are among the favorite destinations, he said. “Demand has been overwhelming,” Wong said. “Singaporeans are travel-starved and they are really looking forward to an overseas holiday and some of them may think this is long overdue.”Singapore Airlines said it has seen “very high demand” for flights and may take longer to respond to queries from customers. Fares on some travel lane routes have increased, the carrier’s website shows. The airline’s shares jumped as much as 9.6% Monday, their biggest gain in 11 months. “Our website temporarily experienced technical issues for a few minutes on Oct. 9,” a spokesperson for the airline said. “Customers have since been able to access the Singapore Airlines website and check on our flight schedules and book flights.”The company’s website shows direct flights from Singapore to Los Angeles for S$2,364 ($1,747) in the vaccinated travel lane, compared with S$1,519 for those that involve a leg not under the agreement.  Singapore has moved away from a Covid-Zero approach and is opening its borders to several countries including the U.S. and U.K., backed by its high vaccination rate -- more than 80% of the population is fully inoculated against the virus. The government on Saturday expanded its list of countries to qualify for quarantine-free travel to nine more places. Vaccinated travelers from the U.S., U.K., France, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain and Denmark will be allowed in without having to quarantine from Oct. 19. Those from South Korea will be able to visit via a so-called vaccinated travel lane from Nov. 15. Singapore started similar arrangements with Germany and Brunei last month.Singapore also halved the number of tests that people arriving need to take to two from four, which has made travel more affordable, Wong said. Transport Minister S. Iswaran said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday that more capacity could be added.

But she said the deals, known as the Abraham Accords, did not erase the need for Israel to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians.“We must not lose sight of the right of the Palestinians to have a chance to live,” she said. “Therefore one should under no circumstances, even as it becomes more and more difficult because of the settlements, lose sight of the issue of a two-state solution,” Merkel told a panel at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.Backers of the Abraham Accords, which were brokered by the Trump Administration, have praised them as breaking the long-standing belief that Israel could not forge ties with the Arab world before reaching an agreement with the Palestinians.Israel’s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, a hard-liner who opposes a Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied lands, has ruled out peace talks with the Palestinians. Instead, he has advocated what he says is a more pragmatic approach of improving living conditions for the Palestinians as a way of lowering tensions. His government, a patchwork of dovish, nationalist and Arab parties that took office in June, so far has not announced any major changes in policy.Merkel welcomed Bennett’s intentions but said such an approach would not be enough.“I think that such a long-running issue (the conflict with the Palestinians) will not disappear from the agenda, even if there are improved relations with neighboring Arab states,” she said.Throughout Merkel's visit, she was welcomed as a “true friend” of Israel. Her agenda included meetings with Israeli leaders and a stop at Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem.She repeatedly professed Germany’s commitment to Israel’s security and said she was confident that her country's next government — to be determined in lengthy coalition talks following an inconclusive election last month — would take a similar stance.A key issue on the agenda was Iran's nuclear program. Germany was one of the world powers that negotiated the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.The deal fell apart after then-President Donald Trump, with Israel’s support, withdrew in 2018. The Biden administration has been trying to revive that deal over Israeli objections.Israel considers Iran its greatest enemy, citing the country’s military presence in neighboring Syria and its support for hostile militant groups across the region. It accuses Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons — a charge Iran denies — and believes that international deal did not contain sufficient safeguards.In the meantime, Iran has marched forward with its nuclear activities, such as increased uranium enrichment - a step that can move it closer to building a bomb.Merkel said that disagreements among the world powers that negotiated the original deal have weakened their position and allowed Iran to buy time and expand its military activities across the region.“Iran knows this, and therefore we face a very serious situation,” she said. She acknowledged that she does not have a solution, but called on key players, including Russia and China, to take a stronger public stance against Iran."The more countries make it clear that they don’t accept the ambitions and aggression of Iran, the better for the region,” she said.Israel was formed in the wake of the Holocaust in 1948 and the two countries only established diplomatic ties in 1965. But over the decades, those ties have warmed and Germany is one of Israel's closest and most important international allies and trade partners.Merkel was scheduled to visit in August, but the trip was postponed after the crisis in Afghanistan in which the Taliban seized power. She then delayed the visit until after last month’s German election. She now remains in office in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed, a process that could take weeks or even months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-lose-sight-of-the-issue-of-a-two-state-solution-merkel-tells-israel-101633942373585.html

Travellers have to be vaccinated with a World Health Organization (WHO) approved jab, its guidelines said.The Singapore government’s VTL scheme covers seven European countries - Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Germany - along with United States and Canada. The only Asian country in the list is Brunei. China, India, and Indonesia have not been included so far. In addition to this, vaccinated travellers from South Korea will also be allowed to enter the country from November 15, reported ANI.To avail the VTL scheme travellers have to fly to Singapore in a VTL-designated flight flown by Singapore Airlines or Lufthansa. The government will be adding other carriers to the list over time. Singapore Airlines is expanding VTL flight services to 14 cities, with more points on special designated services to be announced in coming weeks, the carrier said in a statement.Also Read: Singapore set on reopening despite new Covid-19 travel curbsTravellers will also need to carry proof of their vaccination and undergo RT-PCR test not more than 48 hours before their departure and also on their arrival at Singapore’s Changi airport. Previously, travellers had to take four such tests to gain entry.This announcement comes days after Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s push to live with Covid-19 without being paralysed by fear. During a televised address on Saturday, Loong said that the delta variant has shown that Covid-19 is not going away anywhere. However, with vaccinations, social distancing measures and careful monitoring, it will be possible to live with the "new normal". "It will take us at least three months, and perhaps as long as six months, to get there," he cautioned.Loong justified the move to resume connectivity with countries reporting stable numbers of Covid-19 cases insisting that the move would "keep us connected to global supply chains and help to preserve Singapore's hub status".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-allow-quarantine-free-travel-for-11-countries-india-not-included-for-now-101633930585285.html

11-10-2021||World||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un calls for improved living conditions||North Korea said Monday leader Kim Jong Un urged officials to overcome a “grim situation” facing the country and make stronger efforts to improve the food and living conditions of his people.But state media didn’t mention any specific comments toward Washington and Seoul while reporting on Kim’s speech marking the 76th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party’s founding.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s denuclearization steps.The country has ramped up its missile testing activity in recent weeks while making conditional peace offers to Seoul, reviving a pattern of pressuring South Korea to get what it wants from the United States.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim during his speech on Sunday said his party is determined to achieve the economic goals set during the party’s congress in January, when he acknowledged his previous economic plans weren’t succeeding and issued new development plans for the next five years.The agency said Kim confirmed the determination of the party to efficiently carry out the five-year plan to boost “the national economy and solving the people’s food, clothing and housing problems.”The KCNA said Kim analyzed the “unprecedented difficulties” facing the North and called for the party’s single-minded unity in developing the state economy in face of the “grim situation.”Analysts say Kim is facing perhaps the toughest moment of his near decade in power. He failed to win badly needed sanctions relief in his summitry with then-President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, then the coronavirus pandemic caused North Korea to close its borders and unleashed further economic shock after decades of mismanagement and sanctions over Kim’s nuclear weapons program.The World Health Organization said last week some of its Covid-19 medical supplies had arrived at a North Korea port, an indication the North was easing one of the world’s strictest pandemic border closures to receive outside help.Kim has so far rejected the Biden administration’s offers to restart dialogue without preconditions, saying that Washington must first abandon its “hostile policy,” a term the North mainly uses to refer to sanctions and U.S.-South Korea military exercises.But the North in recent weeks have also restored communication lines with the South and said it could take further steps to improve bilateral relations if Seoul abandons its “double-dealing attitude” and “hostile viewpoint.”Analysts say North Korea is using the South’s desire for inter-Korean engagement to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul and to pressure the South to extract concessions from the Biden administration on its behalf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-calls-for-improved-living-conditions-101633918042313.html
11-10-2021||World||Trump adviser Fiona Hill reveals sexist nickname given to her by officials||Fiona Hill, a former adviser to ex-US President Donald Trump, has revealed that she was given a racist nickname by the officials in the previous administration. Hill worked as a senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council in the Trump White House."I discovered that I was known as the Russia bitch. This underscored that fact that most women were not paid attention to," Hill told CNN during an interview."And the recent statement by the former President that he doesn't know me at all again underscores the misogyny that if you are a woman, or a certain kind of woman that's not in the immediate entourage, then you are pretty much nothing. You are a non-player in his world," she added.In her recently released memoir "There is nothing for you here", Hill said that for Trump and those around him, it was all about the look, the image, not who you were and what you did.She rose to prominence in November 2019, while testifying at the Trump impeachment hearings. She warned warned Republicans against promoting the "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 US elections.Hill was among the two witnesses who testified before the house intelligence committee, which conducted the first leg of the impeachment inquiry against Trump.Hill, a British-born coal miner's daughter who became a US citizen in 2002, worked for Republican and Democratic administrations. She said she joined the Trump White House because she shared the Republican president's belief that relations with Russia needed to improve. Still, she was adamant that Russia was gearing up to intervene again in the 2020 US election.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led US House of Representatives over charges he abused the power of his office by enlisting a foreign government to investigate a political rival ahead of the 2020 election and obstructed Congress in its investigation. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-adviser-fiona-hill-reveals-sexist-nickname-given-to-her-by-officials-101633916773154.html

China's sovereignty and territorial integrity has never be partitioned and will never be partitioned," reported CGTN.Tsai, during her National Day address, also stated that Taipei is no longer seen as the orphan of Asia, but as an "Island of Resilience" that can face challenges with courage."But the more we achieve, the greater the pressure we face from China. So I want to remind all my fellow citizens that we do not have the privilege of letting down our guard," she added.Her remarks came amid the rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei as recently 150 Chinese military aircraft breached the airspace of Taiwan over a period of four days.China claims full sovereignty over Taiwan despite the island's self-governance for more than seven decades. Taipei has countered Beijing's aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwanese-president-s-remarks-incite-confrontation-distorts-facts-china-101633912440279.html
11-10-2021||World||US couple arrested for selling nuclear warship information: Justice Department||A US couple has been arrested in the state of West Virginia for allegedly selling information on nuclear warships to what they believed was a foreign state, the Justice Department said Sunday.Jonathan Toebbe, who worked as a nuclear engineer for the US Navy, and his wife Diana -- both in their forties -- were arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents on Saturday and charged with violating the Atomic Energy Act in a criminal complaint, the Justice Department said in a statement.For nearly a year, the couple "sold information known as restricted data concerning the design of nuclear powered warships to a person they believed was a representative of a foreign power," the statement said, adding that the recipient of the information was, in fact, an undercover FBI agent.Jonathan Toebbe, who had access to restricted data on nuclear-powered warships through his work, collaborated with his wife to exchange data on submarine nuclear reactors for around $100,000 in cryptocurrency, the complaint affidavit alleges.The affidavit says Toebbe in April 2020 mailed a package to a foreign government "containing a sample of restricted data and instructions for establishing a covert relationship," according to the statement.According to the complaint, the FBI intercepted the package, and the undercover agent posed as a representative of the foreign government in order to establish a relationship with the couple.The agent sent Jonathan Toebbe, who used the pseudonym "Alice," an email offering him a gift as thanks for the data. But Toebbe responded with caution, asking instead to set up a "dead drop" location and to be paid in cryptocurrency.The couple in following months transferred multiple SD cards of data to the agent. In the first dead drop, "the SD card was wrapped in plastic and placed between two slices of bread on a half a peanut butter sandwich," the agent said in the complaint.Other SD cards were hidden in a chewing gum package and a sealed Band-Aid wrapper, with the Band-Aid still inside.The couple was arrested Saturday after leaving another SD card at a dead drop location.US Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the agencies involved for "thwarting the plot" and "taking this first step in bringing the perpetrators to justice," the statement said.The Department of Defense declined to comment when contacted by AFP.The couple is due to appear in West Virginia federal court on October 12.US nuclear-powered submarines have been the subject of recent attention when Australia and Britain in September unveiled a new defense contract for such subs, negotiated secretly over several months.In order to join the pact, Australia tore up a landmark multimillion-dollar contract with France, sparking an international row that saw Paris recall its ambassador to Canberra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-couple-arrested-for-selling-nuclear-warship-information-justice-department-101633909749551.html
11-10-2021||World||International Day of the Girl Child: History, importance, and how to contribute||The International Day of the Girl Child is observed annually on October 11, a date set by the United Nations to urge the global community to embolden gender equality impacts. This year, the UN urges the world to bridge the gender digital divide that exists in diverse skills and jobs – a challenge that society is increasingly facing due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “The gender digital divide in connectivity, devices, and use, skills and jobs is real,” the UN said in an official statement detailing the significance of the International Day of the Girl Child 2021. “It is an inequity and exclusion gap across geographies and generations that is our challenge to address if the digital revolution is to be for all, with all, by all.”International Day of the Girl Child: HistoryA blueprint for a proper framework of recognising girls' rights first began to take shape in 1995 at the World Conference on Women in China. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which was unanimously adopted by all the countries present, was since regarded as “the most progressive blueprint ever for advancing the rights of not only women but girls.”Later, on December 18, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) declared October 11 as the International Day of the Girl Child, to recognise the unique challenges that girls face around the world, which may share links but also be completely different from the kind of challenges that women face.International Day of the Girl Child: SignificanceAdolescent girls go through an exceptionally important phase where they can be empowered with the right tools to change the world by ensuring a safe, educated, and healthy lifestyle. They have the potential to be both the empowered girl of today as well as tomorrow’s worker, mother, entrepreneur, mentor, household head, or political leader. According to the United Nations, “An investment in realising the power of adolescent girls upholds their rights today and promises a more equitable and prosperous future, one in which half of humanity is an equal partner in solving the problems of climate change, political conflict, economic growth, disease prevention, and global sustainability.”The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by world leaders in 2015 embody a roadmap for progress that is sustainable and leaves no one behind. Each of the 17 goals is integral to achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment.International Day of the Girl Child: How to be involvedAccording to the UN, there are more than a few ways one can get involved with promoting the International Day of the Girl Child. One can share stories, blogs, and videos of inspiring adolescent girls who are tech trailblazers while collectively amplifying the call to action to expand these pathways for every girl, everywhere.Moreover, people can also make themselves more aware of the ways to address the gender digital divide and further amplify the means to achieving meaningful and sustainable change in a digital revolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-the-girl-child-history-importance-and-how-to-contribute-101633852651006.html
