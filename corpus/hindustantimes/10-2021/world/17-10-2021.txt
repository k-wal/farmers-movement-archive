Notably, ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the bombing incident that took the lives of 47 people while leaving 70 more injured.Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that the recognition of the Taliban regime in the country and support in the form of international assistance would pave the way to recovery for Afghanistan’s economy.However, Muttaqi refuted any concerns that the ISIS-K posed any threat to Afghanistan.Also Read | Death toll rises to 32 in multiple blasts at Kandahar mosque in AfghanistanMeanwhile, Ariana News reported the Taliban minister as saying that freezing of Afghan foreign reserves by the United States violated international law and human rights. “The real question is, why was this money blocked? What did the citizens of Afghanistan do?” he told Ariana News.On one hand, Muttaqi said, the US and other countries talk about the need to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and respect human rights, on the other hand, “they leave the Afghan people with a population of about 40 million without basic necessities.”His statements come only days after the US-European Union (EU) delegation pledged $1.2 billion in aid to Afghanistan during the Islamist group’s first in-person talks with the international community in Qatar. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen announced the aid package, aimed at averting a “major humanitarian and socio-economic collapse,” at a virtual G20 summit hosted by Italy, AFP reported.Leyen, however, had highlighted that the aid is “direct support” for Afghans and not the interim Taliban government because the EU does not recognise them.Most countries have been against recognising the Taliban regime in Afghanistan owing to their history of brutalities during their earlier rule in the 90s.Meanwhile, the ISIS-K that currently remains the biggest threat to Afghanistan’s road to peace achievement, has issued a warning to Shia Muslims, saying that they will be targeted by the terrorist group everywhere, including their homes and centres. The ISIS-K’s weekly ‘Al Naba’ has published the warning, mentioning that Shia Muslims are perilous. Taliban’s commander of police in Kandahar, Abdul Ghafar Muhammadi, said that his forces will work alongside local volunteers to safeguard the Shia mosques in the province.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nonrecognition-of-our-govt-in-afghanistan-benefitting-isis-k-taliban-101634494004768.html

FDA also recommended a third dose of the Modern vaccine as a booster shot to high-risk adults.Also Read: US will see a drop in Covid-19 deaths this winter: Anthony FauciBoth Pfizer-BioNTech SE and Moderna vaccines are based on mRNA technology while the J&J shot uses adenovirus like India’s Covishield. Experts opine that mix-and-match of vaccines if sanctioned will give individuals greater flexibility in deciding which booster shot they should opt for to help battle waning immunity against the virus.The infectious disease expert had said towards the end of September that efficacy data on the pairing of vaccines will be available in the first two weeks of October, months after the National Institutes of Health started a mix-and-match trial of Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J shots on roughly 150 adults on June 1. All the participants were given a booster shot of a different vaccine three to four months after completing their first vaccine regimen.Fauci also said individuals will have the freedom to choose which booster shot they would like to go for. “I believe there’s going to be a degree of flexibility of what a person who got the J&J originally can do, either with J&J or with the mix-and-match from other products,” he said.For any mix-and-match vaccine regimen to be approved by both FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports suggest might come as early as this week.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-us-may-mix-and-match-different-covid-19-vaccines-for-booster-dose-101634491972422.html

17-10-2021||World||Bill Clinton released from Southern California hospital after being treated for urological infection||Bill Clinton was released Sunday from the Southern California hospital where he had been treated for an infection.The former president was released around 8 am from the University of California Irvine Medical Center.Clinton, 75, was admitted Tuesday to the hospital southeast of Los Angeles with an infection unrelated to Covid-19, officials said.Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña had said Saturday that Clinton would remain hospitalized one more night to receive further intravenous antibiotics. But all health indicators were “trending in the right direction,” Ureña said.“President Clinton has continued to make excellent progress over the past 24 hours,” Ureña said.Hillary Clinton has been with her husband at the hospital and accompanied him as he left Sunday.President Joe Biden said Friday night that he had spoken to Bill Clinton, and the former president “sends his best.”“He’s doing fine; he really is,” Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut.Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to Covid-19, Ureña said.“He is in great spirits and has been spending time with family, catching up with friends, and watching college football,” said Ureña’s Saturday statement.An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn’t receiving ICU care.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-clinton-released-from-southern-california-hospital-after-being-treated-for-urological-infection-101634484477003.html

17-10-2021||World||UK MP David Amess murder: Suspect of Somali descent, planned the stabbing for over a week||The killing of British Conservative MP David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times to death in his constituency on October 15, has thrown open some serious questions about political violence and harassment or intimidation of politicians. As British police detectives continue to question the individual who is suspected of fatally stabbing the UK lawmaker, some interesting facts have come to light.Also Read | UK MP David Amess's killer was referred to counter-terrorism scheme: ReportSuspect: British man of Somali descentThe BBC reported, citing Whitehall officials, that the suspect’s name is Ali Harbi Ali – a 25-year-old British Muslim of Somali heritage who a few years ago was referred to ‘Prevent’, the UK's scheme for those who were thought at risk of radicalisation.Meanwhile, the Daily Mail newspaper also cited people familiar with the matter and reported that Ali was the son of Harbi Ali Kullane, a former communications adviser to the prime minister of Somalia. Kullane has confirmed that his son was in police custody and that he was ‘traumatised’ by the arrest. The same was also confirmed by The Sunday Times newspaper in its correspondence.Suspect's residence: High-profile north London neighbourhoodAccording to the Mail, Ali planned the fatal stabbing of Sir David for more than a week and even booked an appointment for surgery or an open meeting at the Tory MP's Southend West constituency in Essex, before he ended up stabbing the lawmaker 17 times. Ali may have lived in the area at some time in the past, the report said, adding that his present residence is situated in a high-profile north London neighbourhood “in a street of £2 million three-storey townhouses where neighbours include broadcaster Giles Coren and, formerly, the late actor Roger Lloyd Pack, who played Trigger in Only Fools And Horses.”Potential links to ‘Islamic extremism’Meanwhile, the Scotland Yard was reported to have taken over the investigation, and the AFP news agency said citing police officials that “a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism” is being probed.

The spaceship will land on the steppes of Kazakhstan.Peresild, 37, and Shipenko, 38, arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on October 5.They blasted off from the Russia-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, travelling to the ISS with Anton Shkaplerov, another veteran cosmonaut.But they belatedly docked at the ISS at 5.52 pm IST after Shkaplerov switched to manual control. “Welcome to the ISS!” Russia’s space agency Roscosmos said on Twitter.The movie Challenge is about a surgeon played by Yulia Peresild, who is dispatched to the ISS to save a crew member who needs an urgent operation in orbit. Oleg Novitskiy plays the role of the ailing cosmonaut in the movie. Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, cosmonauts aboard the ISS, are also said to have cameo roles.“There are only 12 hours left before the spacecraft undocks and returns to Earth. I will miss the space views. Thanks to the subscribers for following our expedition. It was very interesting for me to share with you moments from life at the station and receive feedback,” Novitskiy tweeted on Saturday.If the movie project is successful, Russia will defeat a Hollywood project which was announced in 2020 by actor Tom Cruise together with American space agency Nasa and Elon Musk's SpaceX. For years, the United States and Russia locked horns in what was called a space race. Both the countries utilised their resources to the maximum to achieve superiority in spaceflight capability.While Russia became the first-ever country to launch the first satellite and send an animal, a man and a woman into orbit; the United States created history by sending cosmonauts on the Moon.However, the space race between Russia and the US also led to the creation of several conspiracy theories including lost cosmonauts and the fake moon landing.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-filming-first-movie-in-space-russian-crew-heads-for-earth-101634436796959.html

A lawyer for the men said he doesn’t know where they were being taken.The so-called Citgo 6, for the Houston subsidiary of Venezuela’s state owned oil company, were lured to Caracas in 2017 for a meeting when masked police busted into a conference room and took them into custody on embezzlement charges tied to a never-executed deal to refinance billions in Citgo bonds.The apparent retaliatory move came after Saab was put on a chartered US Justice Department flight from Cape Verde, a West African archipelago, where he was arrested 16 months ago while making a stop on the way to Iran for what Maduro's government later described as a diplomatic humanitarian mission.A US official, speaking on condition he not be named, confirmed the flight's departure. A public relations firm representing Saab said in an email that the Colombian businessman was taken from his home without his lawyers being notified.Saab's arrival in the US is bound to complicate relations between Washington and Caracas, possibly disrupting fledgling talks between Maduro's government and its US-backed opposition taking place in Mexico.Maduro’s government has vehemently objected to Saab’s prosecution as a veiled attempt at regime change by Washington. US prosecutors say Saab amassed a fortune wheeling and dealing on behalf of the socialist government, which faces heavy US sanctions.American authorities have been targeting Saab for years, believing he holds numerous secrets about how Maduro, the president's family and his top aides siphoned off millions of dollars in government contracts for food and housing amid widespread hunger in oil-rich Venezuela.However his defenders, including Maduro's government as well as allies Russia and Cuba, consider his arrest illegal and maintain that Saab was a diplomatic envoy of the Venezuelan government and as such possesses immunity from prosecution while on official business.In a statement Saturday, Venezuela’s government again denounced the “kidnapping” of Saab by the US government “in complicity with authorities in Cape Verde."“The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela repudiates this grave violation of human rights against a Venezuelan citizen, invested as a diplomat and representative of our country before the world,” the statement said.The argument failed to persuade Cape Verde's Constitutional Court, which last month authorized his extradition after a year of wrangling by Saab's legal team, which includes former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón and BakerHostetler, one of the US' biggest firms.Federal prosecutors in Miami indicted Saab in 2019 on money-laundering charges connected to an alleged bribery scheme that pocketed more than $350 million from a low-income housing project for the Venezuelan government.Separately, Saab had been sanctioned by the previous Trump administration for allegedly utilizing a network of shell companies spanning the globe — in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Hong Kong, Panama, Colombia and Mexico — to hide huge profits from no-bid, overvalued food contracts obtained through bribes and kickbacks.Some of Saab’s contracts were obtained by paying bribes to the adult children of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, the Trump administration alleged. Commonly known in Venezuela as “Los Chamos,” slang for “the kids,” the three men are also under investigation by prosecutors in Miami for allegedly forming part of a scheme to siphon $1.2 billion from Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, two people familiar with the US investigation told The Associated Press.But while in private US officials have long described Saab as a front man for Maduro, he is not identified as such in court filings.The previous Trump administration had made Saab’s extradition a top priority, at one point even sending a Navy warship to the African archipelago to keep an eye on the captive.On Saturday. Colombian President Iván Duque lauded the extradition of Saab in a tweet, calling it a “triumph in the fight against drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption led by the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro.”In response, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodiríguez tweeted that “Alex Saab is an innocent Venezuelan diplomat, a victim of kidnapping and human rights violations who has served our country face with an immoral imperial blockade.”However, the Biden administration has downplayed the importance of Saab's problems, saying he can defend himself in US courts and that his case shouldn't affect ongoing negotiations sponsored by Norway aimed at overcoming Venezuela's long running economic crisis and political tug of war.The government last month appointed Saab to its negotiating team and fellow envoys arrived to Mexico carrying signs reading “Free Alex Saab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuelan-prez-maduro-s-ally-extradited-to-us-on-money-laundering-charge-101634433297187.html
17-10-2021||World||International Day for Eradication of Poverty today: History, theme||International Day for the Eradication of Poverty is observed every year on October 17 and aims to raise awareness about people living in poverty. According to the United Nations’ website, the day is a chance to acknowledge the efforts and struggles of people living in poverty, a chance for them to make their concerns heard, and a moment to recognise that poor people are the first ones to fight against poverty.The day also reflects the willingness of those living in poverty to utilise their expertise to contribute towards its eradication, according to the UN Website.History of International Day for Eradication of PovertyThe observance of this day goes back to 1987 when more than 100,000 people gathered at the Trocadéro in Paris to honour the victims of extreme poverty, violence and hunger at the unveiling of a commemorative stone by a French priest and humanitarian activist Joseph Wresinski. Proclaiming that poverty is a violation of human rights, such people affirmed the need to come together to ensure that these rights are respected.Four years after Wresinski’s demise in 1988, the general assembly, through a resolution adopted on 22 December 1992, declared October 17 as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. All states were invited to present and promote activities regarding the eradication of poverty and destitution.Theme for International Day for Eradication of PovertyThis year’s theme is “Building forward together: Ending Persistent Poverty, Respecting all People and our Planet.”Covid-19 pandemic and povertyAccording to the World Bank, the coronavirus pandemic, which struck the world in 2020, pushed between 88 and 115 million people into poverty “with the majority of the new extreme poor being found in South Asian and Sub-Saharan countries where poverty rates are already high.” And this year the number might have increased to 143 and 163 million.UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that extreme poverty is on the rise at present, adding that the pandemic wreaked havoc on economies and societies across the globe. “A lopsided recovery is further deepening inequalities between the Global North and South,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-for-eradication-of-poverty-today-history-theme-101634432733162.html

He added that protesters demanded “the death sentence” for those responsible for the images.Separately, in a nearby intersection, about 1,000 Hindus protested the attacks on temples and the killing of two Hindu devotees in another district where several temples were vandalized by Muslim mobs.Police said at least two Hindus were killed in Friday’s attacks.Communal tensions have risen as the minority Hindus celebrate their largest religious festival, the Durga Puja. About 9% of Bangladesh’s 160 million are Hindu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-cumilla-incident-massive-protests-in-bangladesh-against-enemies-of-islam-101634431092036.html

On June 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to complete reunification with self-ruled Taiwan and vowed to smash any attempts at formal independence for the island.Recently, Taipei has also expressed that it will not start a war with China but 'it is prepared for it'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-asks-us-to-speed-up-delivery-of-f-16-fighters-as-china-threat-looms-large-101634428398345.html
17-10-2021||World||China tests space capability, launches nuclear-capable missile: Report||China has tested a new space capability with a hypersonic missile, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.The report, citing multiple sources familiar with the test, said Beijing in August launched a nuclear-capable missile that circled the Earth at low orbit before descending toward its target, which three sources said it missed by over 20 miles (32 kilometers).FT sources said the hypersonic glide vehicle was carried by a Long March rocket, launches of which it usually announces, though the August test was kept under wraps.The report added that China's progress on hypersonic weapons "caught US intelligence by surprise."Along with China, the United States, Russia and at least five other countries are working on hypersonic technology.Hypersonic missiles, like traditional ballistic missiles which can deliver nuclear weapons, can fly at more than five times the speed of sound.But ballistic missiles fly high into space in an arc to reach their target, while a hypersonic flies on a trajectory low in the atmosphere, potentially reaching a target more quickly.Crucially, a hypersonic missile is maneuverable (like the much slower, often subsonic cruise missile), making it harder to track and defend against.While countries like the United States have developed systems designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles, the ability to track and take down a hypersonic missile remains a question.China has been aggressively developing the technology, seeing it as crucial to defend against US gains in hypersonic and other technologies, according to a recent report by the US Congressional Research Service (CRS).The reported test comes as US-China tensions have mounted and Beijing has stepped up military activity near Taiwan, the self-ruling US-aligned democracy that Beijing considers a province awaiting reunification.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on the FT report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-space-capability-launches-nuclear-capable-missile-in-space-report-101634426984857.html

Durst has been hospitalized and put on a ventilator after catching the coronavirus, said DeGuerin."He was having difficulty breathing and he was having difficulty communicating," DeGuerin told the Times. "He looked worse than I've ever seen him and I was very worried about him."Durst, a multi-millionaire who was the subject of an explosive HBO documentary entitled "The Jinx," has always denied the charges against him.But he muttered to himself "Killed them all, of course" while the microphone remained switched on during a break in the recording of the final episode of the film.md/dw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/real-estate-mogul-durst-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-placed-on-ventilator-101634425342335.html
17-10-2021||World||UK MP David Amess's killer was referred to counter-terrorism scheme: Report||The attacker who fatally stabbed British lawmaker David Amess was referred to a official counter-terrorist scheme for those thought to be at risk of radicalisation, according to media reports.Police said late Saturday that detectives had until Friday, October 22, to question the suspect after he was detained under the Terrorism Act, which allowed them to extend his detention.Veteran Conservative MP David Amess, 69, was talking with voters at a church in the small town of Leigh-on-Sea east of London when he was stabbed to death on Friday.Police have said they are investigating "a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism". The investigation is being led by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command.The BBC said it had received confirmation from Whitehall officials that the man's name is Ali Harbi Ali.Ali, a British citizen of Somali heritage, had been referred to Prevent, the UK's scheme for those thought at risk of radicalisation a few years ago, the BBC reported.'Fast-paced investigation'Ali is believed not have spent long on the programme, which is voluntary in nature, and was never formally a "subject of interest" to MI5, the domestic security agency, said the BBC.Police and security services believe the attacker acted alone and was "self-radicalised", The Sunday Times reported, while he may have been inspired by Al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda-linked Islamists in Somalia.Ali's father Harbi Ali Kullane, a former adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, confirmed to The Sunday Times that his son was in custody, adding: "I'm feeling very traumatised."Police said they have been carrying out searches at three addresses in the London area in a "fast-paced investigation".The Sun tabloid reported that the attacker stabbed Amess multiple times in the presence of two women staff, before sitting down and waiting for police to arrive.The Daily Mail newspaper reported that he had booked an appointment a week ahead.Candle-lit vigilOn Saturday evening, hundreds of mourners attended a candle-lit vigil at a sports field near the scene of the crime, holding a minute's silence in the MP's memory.Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier visited the crime scene to pay his respects on Saturday, laying floral wreaths outside the church with the leader of the opposition, Labour leader Keir Starmer in a rare show of unity.Local residents including members of the Muslim community also heaped bouquets next to the police tape.Britain's politicians were stunned by the highly public attack, which recalled the murder of a pro-EU lawmaker ahead of the Brexit referendum.In June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, prompting demands for action against what lawmakers said was "a rising tide" of public abuse and threats against elected representatives.Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday ordered police across the country to review security arrangements for all 650 MPs and The Sunday Times reported that every MP could be granted security protection when meeting the public.'Cannot be cowed' "We will carry on... We live in an open society, a democracy. We cannot be cowed by any individual," Patel told journalists after laying a wreath for her fellow Essex MP.Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP who tried to save a stabbed police officer during a 2017 terror attack near the Houses of Parliament, on Twitter urged "a temporary pause in surgeries, or face-to-face meetings with constituents, until the security review is complete.House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle in The Observer wrote that "we need to take stock" and review whether security measures introduced after Cox's murder are "adequate to safeguard members, staff and constituents, especially during surgeries".Increasing threatsMPs and their staff have been attacked before, although it is rare.But their safety was thrown into sharp focus by Brexit, which stoked deep political divisions and has led to often angry, partisan rhetoric.Cox's killer repeatedly shouted "Britain first" before shooting and stabbing the 41-year-old MP outside her constituency meeting near Leeds, northern England.Amess was at the other end of the political spectrum and backed Brexit.A specialist police unit set up to investigate threats against MPs in the aftermath of Cox's murder said 678 crimes against lawmakers were reported between 2016 and 2020.Amess himself wrote about public harassment and online abuse in his book "Ayes & Ears: A Survivor's Guide to Westminster", published last year."These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians," he said.MPs have had to install security cameras and only meet constituents by appointment, he added.Unlike some MPs, Amess publicised meeting times for constituents on Twitter and held them in public places, while asking people to book ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mp-david-amess-s-killer-was-referred-to-counter-terrorism-scheme-report-101634425146553.html
17-10-2021||World||Ex-US president Bill Clinton to spend 1 more night in California hospital||Bill Clinton will spend one more night at a Southern California hospital where he is recovering from an infection, a spokesman said Saturday.“President Clinton has continued to make excellent progress over the past 24 hours,” spokesman Angel Ureña said in a statement.Clinton will remain overnight at University of California Irvine Medical Center “to receive IV antibiotics before an expected discharge tomorrow,” the statement said.Hillary Clinton has been with her husband at the hospital southeast of Los Angeles. She returned Saturday with her daughter Chelsea Clinton around 8 a.m. Saturday in an SUV accompanied by secret service agents.President Joe Biden said Friday night that he had spoken to Bill Clinton and the former president “sends his best.”“He’s doing fine; he really is,” Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut.Clinton, 75, was admitted on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to COVID-19, Ureña said.“He is in great spirits and has been spending time with family, catching up with friends, and watching college football,” said Ureña's Saturday statement.An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn't receiving ICU care.In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exus-president-bill-clinton-to-spend-1-more-night-in-california-hospital-101634424308123.html
