Today’s talks will add strength to the robust friendship between India and Spain. We had fruitful discussions on diverse subjects including commerce, technology and the environment," Modi posted on Twitter after the meeting.The two leaders welcomed the growing bilateral trade and investment linkages including the recent signing of the contract to procure 56 C295 aircraft from Airbus Spain, 40 of which will be ‘Made in India’ in collaboration with Tata Advanced Systems, the ministry of external affairs said in a press release accessed by the PTI.The two leaders agreed to further expand bilateral cooperation in areas such as e-mobility, clean technology, advanced materials and deep sea exploration.Modi invited Spain to invest in various sectors including green hydrogen, infrastructure and defence manufacturing and further take advantage of India’s National Infrastructure Pipeline, Asset Monetisation Plan and the Gati Shakti Plan, the release said.The two leaders discussed India-European Union relations as well as cooperation on climate action and priorities at upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. They also exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest including Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific, it said.India has voiced concern over the situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August. India has underlined the need for Afghanistan's territory not to be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist attacks.India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the resource-rich region.Modi also said he looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Sanchez in India next year. Earlier, the Prime Minister's Office tweeted that both leaders had fruitful talks on ways to deepen ties between India and Spain."The two nations are cooperating extensively in areas such as trade, energy, innovation and more,” it said.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that Modi invited Spain to invest in various sectors in India, including green hydrogen, infrastructure and defence manufacturing.On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Prime Minister Modi interacted with several world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and South Korean President Moon Jae-in among others.Italy has been holding the presidency of the G20 since December last year.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/modi-bats-for-spanish-investments-in-india-during-meeting-with-sanchez-in-rome-101635696930825.html

And we stand by that. The president does sit by that strongly".“We want to make sure that no one takes any unilateral action that would disrupt the status quo with regard to Taiwan. That hasn’t changed,” Blinken said.Wang told Blinken that Taiwan is the most sensitive issue between China and the United States. “We require the United States to pursue a real one China policy, not a fake one China policy,” Wang was quoted by the ministry as saying.Blinken and Wang did not discuss a recent Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defences, the State Department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-china-against-any-unilateral-changes-to-status-quo-around-taiwan-101635698064353.html

A man in his 60s was unconscious and in critical condition after being stabbed, while witnesses also said the attacker had spread fluid around the train and started a fire, according to media.One video uploaded on Twitter and broadcast on NHK showed a steady stream of people running away from a train car where, seconds later, a small explosion caused a fire. Another video showed passengers rushing to squeeze out of the train's windows and onto the platform where the train had made an emergency stop."I thought it was a Halloween stunt," one witness told the Yomiuri newspaper, recalling the moment he saw other passengers running in a panic towards his train car. "Then, I saw a man walking this way, slowly waving a long knife." He said there was blood on the knife. The attack occurred on the Keio express line bound for Shinjuku, the world's busiest rail station, at around 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), media said.Partial service on the Keio line remained suspended late on Sunday, when Japanese voters went to the polls in a lower house election. TV footage showed scores of firefighters, police and emergency vehicles outside the station where the train had stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-in-batman-s-joker-costume-terrorises-tokyo-train-10-injured-101635688941426.html

31-10-2021||World||G20 agrees on keeping global warming to 1.5 degree celsius above pre-industrial levels: Report||G20 countries have agreed on the need to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, in language tougher than the 2015 Paris accords, several sources said Sunday.Three sources told AFP that diplomats had approved language for a final summit communique going beyond what was agreed six years ago, when the landmark climate deal called for capping global warming at well below 2 degrees, and ideally closer to 1.5 degrees.The declaration, expected to be released later Sunday, will talk about keeping the 1.5 degrees target "within reach", one source said, without elaborating.Earlier drafts seen by AFP suggested that G20 countries were going to fall short of a firm pledge on the 1.5 figure, but officials worked through the night to toughen up the language ahead of crucial UN talks on climate starting in Glasgow Sunday.The Group of 20 major economies emit nearly 80 percent of carbon emissions, and a promise of action on their part would provide a much-needed boost to the make-or-break COP26 summit.Opening the formal discussions on climate on the second and final day of the Rome summit Sunday, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi urged counterparts to aim high."The decisions we make today will have a direct impact on the success of the Glasgow summit and ultimately on our ability to tackle the climate crisis," he said.He added: "We need to set long-term goals which are consistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement and make short-term changes to achieve them."Experts say meeting the 1.5 degree target -- the most ambitious goal in the 2015 Paris climate deal -- means slashing global emissions nearly in half by 2030 and to "net-zero" by 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-agrees-on-keeping-global-warming-to-1-5-degree-celsius-above-pre-industrial-levels-report-101635681445372.html
31-10-2021||World||Japan's ruling coalition to retain power but lose seats: Report||Japan's ruling coalition is on track to retain power but lose seats in parliament, media predictions said after polls closed in Sunday's general election, the first major test for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.In forecasts based on exit polls, public broadcaster NHK said the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito would win between 239-288 of the 465 seats in the lower house.TV Asahi said the coalition was expected to win 280 seats, down from its previous total of 305 -- weakening the dominance of the LDP, which has held power almost continuously since the 1950s.Kishida, 64, became party leader a month ago after Yoshihide Suga resigned just a year into the job, partly due to public discontent over his response to the Covid-19 crisis.Cases have dropped precipitously since a record wave that pushed the Tokyo Olympics behind closed doors, but voters in the capital said the pandemic was a major factor in their decision."The economy is suffering because of the coronavirus, so I compared the politicians' responses," said Chihiro Sato, 38, a housewife and mother of a toddler.But engineer Hiroyasu Onishi, 79, said he was more concerned by "the military threat from China".Kishida has pledged to issue a fresh stimulus package worth tens of trillions of yen to counter the impact of the pandemic on the world's third-largest economy.He has also outlined plans to tackle inequality heightened by the neo-liberal policies of Suga and his predecessor Shinzo Abe, saying he will distribute wealth more fairly under a so-called new capitalism, although the details remain vague.Japan's 106 million voters have "struggled to get excited about the new prime minister", said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics."Kishida will need to convince the public and younger members of his party that continuity does not mean status quo, but rather maintaining what has worked and improving on what has not."Revolving-door riskKishida had set a comfortable target of winning 233 lower-house seats, a simple majority including LDP and Komeito lawmakers.The LDP previously boasted a commanding majority of 276 seats on its own. NHK predicted the party would hang on to between 212-253 seats on Sunday, while TV Asahi said it would win 243, still a simple majority without Komeito.Kishida has not enjoyed a political honeymoon, with approval ratings around 50 percent, the lowest in two decades for a new administration in Japan.In recent decades, votes against the LDP have been split between multiple major opposition parties, but this time five rival parties boosted cooperation in a bid to dent its stranglehold.The LDP wants to put a tumultuous year behind it, but "the fact that they are still having to fight so hard is, for them, highly embarrassing", said Michael Cucek, assistant professor of Asian studies at Temple University."If (Kishida) leads the party into a loss of seats, a clock starts ticking in the minds of his rivals in the party, saying 'maybe he is only a one-year prime minister'," he told AFP.Only five politicians have hung on to the prime minister's office for five years or longer since World War II, including Abe, who was in power from 2012 to 2020 after a previous one-year term.Turnout stood at 31.6 percent as of 6 pm on Sunday, higher than the 30.0 percent at the same time during the 2017 general election, when overall turnout reached 53 percent.As well as vowing to tackle the pandemic and working to boost the middle class, the LDP has said it will aim to increase defence spending to counter threats from China and North Korea.Meanwhile, some opposition parties have emphasised their support for social causes that Kishida has so far distanced himself from, such as same-sex marriage and allowing married couples to have different surnames."I focused on the candidates' policies on same-sex marriage and LGBT issues. I have many friends in gay or lesbian couples. I hope public understanding on these issues will deepen," said 18-year-old Eko Nagasaki as she voted for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-ruling-coalition-to-retain-power-but-lose-seats-report-101635680035218.html
31-10-2021||World||Israel, US likely behind cyberattack on gas stations, Iran says||An Iranian general said Israel and the U.S. were probably behind an Oct. 26 cyberattack that paralyzed gasoline stations across Iran, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.Initial investigations show “the U.S. and the Zionists” are likely to have been responsible for the “highly complicated” assault, General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran’s passive defense organization, said in an interview to state TV on Saturday, according to IRNA. A final identification will be determined after all assessments are completed, Jalali said, adding that investigators were also looking into whether any Iranian institutions were involved.Jalali said the attack bore similarities to cyber strikes on Iran’s rail network and the Shahid Rajaee port, a major trade terminal on the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Iranian officials also blamed the U.S. and Israel for those attacks. Tuesday’s cyberattack targeted software that controls an online payment system used by tens of millions of drivers in Iran to buy state-subsidized fuel at gasoline stations. The strike came near the anniversary of widespread and violent protests against a hike in fuel prices in mid-November 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-us-likely-behind-cyberattack-on-gas-stations-iran-says-101635670556225.html
31-10-2021||World||Five to watch: the big numbers in Japan's general election||Japan's new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, faces his first major test on Sunday as Japan holds a general election that could see his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lose its majority in the powerful lower house.Here are five numbers to watch as Kishida's LDP and junior partner Komeito seek a fresh mandate.233 seats for a majorityKishida has said he wants to maintain a majority - or 233 seats of the 465-member lower chamber - for the ruling coalition, a low-ball target given that the LDP alone held 276 seats before the election was called this month.The coalition is expected to remain in power, but the focus is on whether the LDP can retain a majority by itself.It is expected to lose some seats because of disapproval of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and lacklustre support for Kishida. Some polls show the LDP could lose its majority, a result that would raise questions about Kishida's ability to hang in for the long term and weaken him ahead of next year's upper house election.261 for stabilitySome media polls suggest the ruling coalition could reach the so-called absolute stable majority of 261 seats - enough for it to take all the parliamentary committee chairs and maintain a majority on each committee, making it easy to push through bills.Treble for Japan Innovation PartyThe reform-minded Japan Innovation Party (JIP) could treble the number of its lawmakers as its support base expands from the western city of Osaka and surrounding areas to the rest of the country, several surveys have shown.The JIP, which held 11 lower house seats before the election was called, could win up to 36 seats, an outcome that could make it the third-biggest party in the chamber, the Asahi daily said, bolstering its influence in national politics.Although the JIP is in opposition, like Kishida's LDP it is in favour of revising the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution and letting the defence budget break away from a narrow range around 1% of GDP to increase Japan's security posture.A strengthened JIP could also put more national focus on Japan's drive to build casinos. The party is in favour of casinos and Osaka last month picked MGM Resorts International and partner Orix Corp to build what could be Japan's first casino.10% Female lawmakersWomen accounted for 10% of lower house lawmakers before the chamber was dissolved this month, far behind France's 40% and 27% in the United States.Japan comes 120th in the World Economic Forum's global gender gap report, due mainly to limited presence of women in political leadership.Thirty-three women are on the LDP ticket, accounting for 10% of its candidates in the election, while the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan has fielded 44 female candidates or 18% of its candidates.53.7% - Voter turnout last timeVoter turnout came in at 53.7% in the 2017 general election, the second-lowest in post-war Japan, meaning nearly half of the electorate failed to exercise their right to vote.A higher turnout typically favours the opposition. Polls have suggested turnout will be slightly higher than the post-war record low of 52.7% in 2014.The youth turnout was particularly low in 2017, with only three out of every 10 people in the 20-24 age bracket casting votes. As a result, lawmakers tend to pay more heed to the needs of the elderly, who are far more likely to vote in ageing Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-to-watch-the-big-numbers-in-japan-s-general-election-101635677723275.html

31-10-2021||World||COP26: World leaders set to kick off UN climate summit in Glasgow||The UN climate summit in Glasgow formally opens Sunday, a day before leaders from around the world gather in Scotland’s biggest city to lay out their vision for addressing the common challenge of global warming.The meeting will see negotiators from almost 200 countries try to tackle issues left hanging since the 2015 Paris climate accord was forged, and find ways to ratchet up their efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century compared with pre-industrial times.Scientists say the chances of meeting that goal, agreed in the French capital six years ago, are slowly slipping away. The world has already warmed by more than 1.1C and current projections are for it to hit 2.7C by the year 2100.The amount of energy unleashed by such planetary warming would melt much of the planet's ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, experts warn.Many of the issues being discussed during the Oct. 31-Nov. 12 talks have been on the agenda for decades, including how rich countries can help poor nations tackle emissions and adapt to a hotter world. The slow pace of action has angered many environmental campaigners, who are expected to stage loud and creative protests during the summit.The opening day of the talks is expected to focus on procedural issues. One big worry is that not all the delegates will be able to meet in person, as the venue and room capacities have been limited due to COVID concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-world-leaders-set-to-kick-off-un-climate-summit-in-glasgow-101635670945241.html
31-10-2021||World||Japan votes in national election as PM Kishida seeks public mandate||Voters in Japan headed to the polls on Sunday to elect a new lower house of the national parliament where Prime Minister Fumio Kishida seeks to maintain his party's majority.The election is a test for the new premier who took over as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party a month ago.Kishida became party leader and prime minister after Yoshihide Suga resigned just one year into the job.The LDP-led government has faced criticism for its mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.The new government will face the task of steering the world's third-largest economy battered by the pandemic, tackle a fast-aging and dwindling population and security challenges from China and North Korea.Kishida called the election soon after taking the top job to shore up his mandate in the 465-seat lower house.Electoral victory with setbacks?The LDP currently holds 276 seats, but opinion polls show it may be on the brink of losing its sole majority in the lower house for the first time since 2009.While Kishida is expected to remain prime minister, observers say the ruling party will likely lose seats and may have trouble retaining its commanding majority.The 64-year-old premier did not have a political honeymoon, with his approval rating lagging at around 50%, the lowest for a new administration in two decades.He has promised to issue a fresh stimulus package worth tens of trillions of yen to counter the impact of the pandemic.Stability or return to revolving-door era?A weakened majority for the LDP could mean further losses in the upper house election next summer.While the LDP has held power almost continuously since the 1950s, only five politicians have hung on to the prime minister's office for five years or longer.A poor showing could embolden Kishida's rivals within the party, threatening to return Japan to an era of short-lived administrations.The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the biggest opposition group, is expected to gain seats but will be nowhere close to toppling Kishida's coalition.Handling of the pandemicThere has been a major public discontent over the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.Japan initially lagged behind other developed nations in the vaccination drive. But it soon caught up and now more than 70% of the population is fully vaccinated.While infections have dropped sharply, some voters remain wary."It's hard to say the pandemic is completely snuffed out and society is stable, so we shouldn't have any big changes in coronavirus policy," said Naoki Okura, a doctor, after voting in Tokyo."Rather than demanding a change in government, I think we should demand continuity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-votes-in-national-election-as-pm-kishida-seeks-public-mandate-101635664329202.html

But the situation was quickly exacerbated by limited staffing levels and then snowballed over several days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-airlines-cancels-hundreds-of-flights-over-staff-shortage-101635650389373.html

31-10-2021||World||If non-recognition of Afghanistan govt continues...: Taliban's message to US||The Taliban called on the United States and other countries on Saturday to recognise their government in Afghanistan, saying that a failure to do so and the continued freezing of Afghan funds abroad would lead to problems not only for the country but for the world.No country has formally recognised the Taliban government since the insurgents took over the country in August, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets and funds abroad have also been frozen, even as the country faces severe economic and humanitarian crises."Our message to America is, if unrecognition continues, Afghan problems continue, it is the problem of the region and could turn into a problem for the world," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told journalists at a news conference on Saturday.He said the reason the Taliban and the United States went to war last time was also because the two did not have formal diplomatic ties.The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 following the Sept. 11, 2001, attack after the then-Taliban government refused to hand over al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden."Those issues which caused the war, they could have been solved through negotiation, they could have been solved through political compromise too," Mujahid said.He added that recognition was the right of the Afghan people.While no country has recognised the Taliban government, senior officials from a number of countries have met with the movement's leadership both in Kabul and abroad.The latest visit was by Turkmen Foreign Minister Rasit Meredow, who was in Kabul on Saturday. The two sides discussed the speedy implementation of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline, Mujahid said earlier on Twitter.China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, met Taliban officials in Qatar earlier this week. Mujahid said on Saturday that China had promised to finance transport infrastructure, and to give Kabul's exports access to Chinese markets via neighbouring Pakistan.Mujahid also spoke at length about the issues facing border crossings, particularly with Pakistan, which have seen frequent closures and protests in recent days. The crossings are crucial for landlocked Afghanistan.He said serious talks on the matter were held when Pakistan's foreign minister had travelled to Kabul last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-unrecognition-of-afghanistan-govt-continues-taliban-s-message-to-us-101635643659492.html
31-10-2021||World||‘First target is Pakistan’: ISIS-K aims to go global, impose Sharia law, says report||Afghanistan's ISIS Khorasan (ISIS-K) also known as Daesh, has said that its hardline goal remains the implementation of Sharia law and warned that whoever in the world went against Islam and the Quran will have to face the terror group's wrath."Our first target is to destroy Pakistan because the main reason for everything in Afghanistan is Pakistan. When the Taliban were here (even as the previous government still reigned), they were saying that we control 80 per cent of the country, but they were not implementing Islamic rulings. That's why we stood up in we started (ISIS-K) over here in this area," knewz quoted Nazifullah, a member of ISIS-K as saying.According to him, Afghanistan has gone from bad to worse since the Taliban - who he accuses of "destroying the country" took the helm some two-and-a-half months ago."We want to implement Shariah Law. We want to implement the way our Prophet was living, the way he was clothed, the dressing hijab was there. Currently, we don't have much to fight. But if you give me anything, I am going to fight Pakistan now," knewz quoted Nazifullah as saying.Knewz notes that Nazifullah is wanted by everyone from US troops and the now-defunct Afghan Security Forces and the Taliban.Since August 15, ISIS-K has waged a deadly spate of suicide attacks and targeted bombings across multiple provinces and claimed dozens of lives. While some assaults have targeted the Taliban, the vast majority have been inflicted upon innocent civilians, particularly the minority Shia population.Most of the recruits of the ISIS-K "are believed to have defected from the Taliban branches in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan, seeking an even more extreme interpretation of Islam with more international rather than domestic-centered goals of 'caliphate' control."Like others who have joined ISIS-K, Nazifullah said he too joined as he was tired of the lack of truthfulness of the Taliban."We kept asking the Taliban to show us a video of Mullah Omar, but we couldn't get any. That is why Daesh here was created. They seemed truthful and said they were going to implement Shariah Law, so that is why I joined them," knewz quoted Nazifullah as saying.Notably, the founder of the Taliban had died in 2013 which was kept a secret for nearly two years. The supreme leader of the Taliban, Haibatullah Akhundzada is being kept under the veil as well.Nazifullah, 24, further said that ISIS-K has the ability to wreak havoc on the state of Afghanistan despite being outnumbered by the Taliban, according to knewz. The number of Taliban operatives on Afghan soil is estimated to be nearly around seventy thousand whereas the ISIS terrorists are believed by the US intelligence to be around two thousand mark.To establish this point, ISIS has started the targeted attacks not only on the Taliban but also on the civilians after the Taliban takeover on August 15. The biggest such instance was the suicide attack on the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul.However, the ISIS member said that he was unclear about the number of ISIS terrorists in Afghanistan as he was locked in the Bagram prison, arrested by the Afghan government until he was freed by the Taliban after sweeping into power.The terrorist further revealed that he had pledged his allegiance to Abu Bakr Baghdadi who is now reportedly dead.Upon becoming a Daesh, members are sent for training to eastern Nangahar province and Nazifullah revealed that the group has been joined by an international cadre of jihadists coming from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Russia.The Taliban, however, has been denying the presence of ISIS on Afghan soil and claims that they have been defeated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-target-is-pakistan-isis-k-aims-to-go-global-impose-sharia-law-says-report-101635641775126.html

Gunmen introducing themselves as Taliban attacked the wedding in Shamspur Mar Ghundi village of Nangarhar province on Friday night."Two suspects have been taken into custody by the Taliban in connection with the incident and one who escaped is still being pursued. The perpetrators of the incident caught, who have used the name of the Islamic Emirate to carry out their personal feud, have been handed over to face Sharia law,” Taliban government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said, according to news agency AFP.According to AFP, a relative of the victims said the Taliban men opened fire while music was being played. "The young men were playing music in a separate room and three Taliban fighters came and opened fire on them. The injuries of the two wounded are serious," the witness told reporters.Also read | ‘Not right away’: Russia signals not ready to let Taliban into United NationsWhen the Taliban ruled Afghanistan the last time between 1996 and 2001, they banned music. While the new government has not yet issued such a decree, its leadership still frowns on its use in entertainment and sees it as a breach of Islamic law."In the ranks of the Islamic Emirate no one has the right to turn anyone away from music or anything, only to try to persuade them. That is the main way," Mujahid told a news conference earlier.Also read | Pak allows Taliban-appointed envoys to take charge in Afghan embassies: Report"If anyone kills someone by himself, even if they are our personnel, that is a crime and we will introduce them to the courts and they will face the law," he said.The previous Taliban government imposed a very strict interpretation of Islamic law and harsh public punishments. However, since recapturing Afghanistan in August after overthrowing the US-backed government, the Taliban have tried to show a more moderate face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-arrest-2-after-3-wedding-guests-killed-over-music-in-nangarhar-101635639721050.html

The report was given to President Joe Biden in August. ODNI oversees 18 intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency.The slim 17-page document bears out the key findings that were widely reported back in August: that the Sars-CoV-2 emerged and infected humans through a small exposure no later than November, 2019, and the first cluster of infections was reported in December; the virus was not developed as a biological weapon or genetically engineered, and the Chinese did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the outbreak.But, the community remains unclear on the key question of the origin of the pandemic—the main task assigned to them by Biden in May.The report also gives details of the discussion and disagreements within the intelligence community on the findings, without identifying the agencies.Four of them and the National Intelligence Council assess with “low confidence” that initial infection was most likely caused by “natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus—a virus that probably would be more than 99 per cent similar to SARS-CoV-2”.One agency assessed with “moderate confidence” that the first human infection “most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident”, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is at the centre of the controversy.Analysts at three agencies remained unconvinced about either hypotheses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-probe-impossible-without-china-s-help-us-intel-101635615422439.html
