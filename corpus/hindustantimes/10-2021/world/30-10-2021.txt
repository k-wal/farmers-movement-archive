Nearby residents' windows were smashed.Aden is the temporary home of Yemen's internationally-recognised government, which has as part of a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia been fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group for around seven years.But tensions have also for years simmered within Aden itself between the government and southern separatist groups.The government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) are nominal allies under the Saudi-led coalition.Earlier this month a car bomb in Aden targeting a convoy carrying the city's governor - an STC member - killed at least six people and wounded others. The governor survived.Instability in the south complicates United Nations-led peace efforts to end the war in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of people and left 80% of the population needing help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-near-yemen-s-aden-airport-kills-12-101635613274783.html
30-10-2021||World||Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia call for punishable measures against Lebanon||Lebanese politicians were in contact with foreign officials Saturday to try find a solution to a crisis between Lebanon and Gulf nations led by Saudi Arabia, triggered by comments of a Cabinet minister regarding the war in Yemen.Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates followed the Saudis with punishable measures against Lebanon, increasing pressure on the small, crisis-hit country badly in need of foreign assistance to help it ease a crippling economic and financial crisis.On Saturday afternoon, Saudi ambassador to Beirut Waleed Bukhari flew home after he was recalled by his government, according to airport officials in Beirut. Bukhari’s departure came a day after Saudi Arabia ordered Lebanon’s ambassador to Riyadh to leave within 48 hours and banned all imports from Lebanon.Saudi Arabia has for decades been a huge market for Lebanese products.The moves came as the Arab League chief expressed concerns about the deterioration of ties between Lebanon and wealthy Gulf countries over statements made by Information Minister George Kordahi.Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib said Prime Minister Najib Mikati is in contact with foreign officials who asked him not to think about resigning. The minister added that he is in contact with the Americans to help solve the crisis.Kordahi described — on a TV program filmed in August and aired this week — the war in Yemen as an aggression by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. He called the war “absurd,” saying it must stop because he is opposed to wars between Arabs.Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014, when the Iran-backed Houthi rebels captured the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north of the country. That forced the internationally recognized government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed by the United States, to try to restore the government to power. Despite a relentless air campaign and ground fighting, the war has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.On Saturday evening, Kordahi visited Cardinal Bechara Rai, the head of Lebanon's Maronite Catholic church, and discussed the matter with him. Kordahi did not speak to journalists after the meeting. He earlier refused to apologize, saying his comments meant no offense to Saudi Arabia.Earlier in the day, Kuwait followed Saudi Arabia and Bahrain by ordering the Lebanese charge d’affaires on Saturday to leave the emirate within two days. Later Saturday, the United Arab Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency said on Twitter that it would withdraw its diplomats from Lebanon in solidarity with Saudi Arabia.The tweet also said Emiratis would be ”prevented” from traveling to Lebanon. Travel bans have happened previously to Lebanon over politics in the past.In Beirut, several government officials met Saturday to discuss the crisis that is likely to have major repercussions on Lebanon. The meeting was briefly attended by the US embassy’s Deputy Chief of Mission Richard Michaels at the foreign ministry in Beirut, according to Bouhabib.“They can help in solving these problems,” Bouhabib said about the United States.Bouhabib canceled his visit to Glasgow, Scotland, where he was supposed to attend a UN climate summit, to deal with the crisis with the oil-rich Gulf nations. He said Mikati will go to Glasgow where he will discuss the crisis with foreign dignitaries.President Michel Aoun said in a statement Saturday that Lebanon wants the best relations with Saudi Arabia and its neighbors.On Friday night, Mikati and Aoun discussed the Saudi decision and asked Kordahi to make the “appropriate decision,” an apparent call for him to resign in hopes it will ease the tension.Kordahi, a former TV show host, made the comments on a TV program before he was chosen for the post in September. Kordahi is close to the Christian Marada Movement, an ally of the militant Hezbollah group.Marada leader Sleiman Frangieh told reporters Saturday that it is up to Kordahi to decide whether he will resign or not. He added that Kordahi contacted him and asked whether he should resign “but I refused because he did not make any mistake. Still I am with any decision he takes.”In Cairo, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit said the crisis caused by Kordahi’s comments has led to a “great setback” to Lebanon’s relationship with the Gulf countries.He urged Lebanon’s president and prime minister to take “necessary steps” to ease the tension, especially with Saudi Arabia. He did not elaborate which steps should be taken.Aboul-Gheit also called on Gulf officials to review measures that could have negative consequences on Lebanon’s already battered economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-uae-saudi-arabia-call-for-punishable-measures-against-lebanon-101635610681376.html

The incident happened after an argument broke out between the Islamist militant group and the guests over music being played at the party.Ariana News reported that Taliban forces barged into the wedding party and asked for the music to be stopped. However, they eventually resorted to firing at the guests.Taliban’s Nangarhar governor’s spokesman, Qazi Mullah Adel, confirmed the incident to AFP. Meanwhile, the group’s government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid although couldn’t confirm the matter, he promised that the Taliban’s policy is not to execute music lovers.“In the ranks of the Islamic Emirate, no one has the right to turn anyone away from music or anything, only to try to persuade them,” Mujahid told a press conference in Kabul, adding that probe into the matter is underway and it’s yet unclear how it happened.He further stated that if an individual kills someone on their own, “even if they are (Taliban’s) personnel, that is a crime” and the group will introduce them to the courts to face the law.Also Read | Taliban to cut hands of thieves, reveals punishment for 'illegal intercourse'This comes close on the heels of another incident on Tuesday when a man was injured after an armed Taliban man opened fire to disperse a crowd that had made a queue to buy air tickets at the Kabul airport, Sputnik reported.Quoting an eyewitness, the Sputnik report added that the Taliban man had his “finger on the trigger” when he dispersed the crowd at the airport, and that the group’s forces often have a cartridge in the chamber of the gun without the safety on."A man was injured. A Taliban man had his finger on the trigger when he dispersed the crowd, and they often have a cartridge in the chamber and the safety is off," Sputnik quoted an eyewitness as saying. This news comes at a time when the Islamist group is vying for recognition of their interim government in Afghanistan from the international community more than two months after recapturing the country. Although the European Union (EU) recently announced an aid package worth $1.2 billion for Afghanistan, the bloc had made it clear that the fund was meant for “direct support” for the Afghans and not the Taliban as it doesn’t recognise it.Also Read | Ensure Afghan territory is not used to attack any nation: India, US urge TalibanNotably, banning music was among the several diktats that the Taliban had imposed in Afghanistan during their earlier regime in the 90s. World leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden, among others, have repeatedly stressed that recognition of the Taliban government in Afghanistan will be decided on the basis of their actions and how accurately the group lives up to its promises of creating a peaceful environment in the country. Notably, soon after recapturing Afghanistan following the withdrawal of the US and other foreign-led forces, the Taliban had vouched for women and children’s rights to education and work, human rights and not allowing the country to become a safe haven for terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-open-fire-at-wedding-party-over-argument-for-playing-music-kill-2-101635608529025.html
30-10-2021||World||UK could trigger EU dispute over French fish row: Boris Johnson||Britain's Boris Johnson complained to EU chief Ursula Von Der Leyen on Saturday that French threats over fishing were "completely unjustified" as he held out the option of invoking a Brexit dispute tool for the first time.For her part, she tweeted that the European Commission was "intensively engaging for finding solutions" on both the fishing row and another linked row with Brussels over the Brexit pact for Northern Ireland.During talks on the sidelines of the G20 in Rome, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson "raised his concerns about the rhetoric from the French government in recent days over the issue of fishing licences", his office said.Johnson "stressed that the French threats are completely unjustified and do not appear to be compatible" with a pact governing Britain's divorce from the European Union.France is incensed that Britain and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey have not issued some French boats licences to fish in their waters post-Brexit.France has warned that unless licences are approved it will ban UK boats from unloading their catches at French ports from next week and impose checks on all products brought to France from Britain.Johnson earlier said that, in response to the deal, he has not ruled out invoking an as-yet untested dispute settlement process allowed under the terms of Britain's divorce from the European Union."No of course not, I don't rule that out," Johnson told Sky News in Rome, after Britain on Friday warned it may implement new checks on all EU fishing boats.However, Johnson has also emphasised his close personal ties with French President Emmanuel Macron -- and their body language at the G20 suggested friendly relations.At a side meeting Saturday on Iran with the US and German leaders, Johnson and Macron exchanged friendly pats on the back.As they arrived for the leaders' "family photo" at the start of the summit, Johnson gave Macron a mock-combative fist bump, although they did not appear to speak to one another.A brief tete-a-tete is intended at some point over the weekend."What I think everybody wants to see is cooperation between the European allies and Emmanuel Macron," Johnson said.Meanwhile, Macron said that Britain's "credibility" was on the line in the dispute, accusing London of ignoring the Brexit deal agreed after years of tortuous negotiations."When you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility," he told the Financial Times.In his Sky interview, Johnson retorted: "If there is a (French) breach of the treaty or we think there is a breach of the treaty, then we will do what is necessary to protect British interests."But in the buildup to COP26, he stressed that the fishing dispute "is quite frankly small beer, trivial, by comparison with the threat to humanity that we face".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-could-trigger-eu-dispute-over-french-fish-row-boris-johnson-101635607081029.html

Speaking at the 16th Group of 20 Leaders' Summit via a video link, Xi proposed a global vaccine cooperation initiative that included suggestions like encouraging vaccine companies to transfer technology to developing countries.“Treat all kinds of vaccines fairly, and promote mutual recognition of vaccines based on the World Health Organization's vaccine emergency use list,” Xinhua quoted the Chinese president as saying.Xi said that China has already provided over 1.6 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to more than 100 countries and international organisations and is working with 16 countries for joint vaccine production. He called for increasing the supply of vaccines to developing countries and implementing the global vaccination target set by the UN health agency.“China is willing to work with all parties to improve the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries and make positive contributions in building a global vaccine defence line,” Xi added.Of the all Covid-19 vaccines China has developed, two of them, one from Sinovac Biotech and one from Sinopharm, have been included in the WHO's emergency use list. The other Covid-19 vaccines approved for use by WHO are Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford/AstraZeneca AZD1222, Covishield, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Ad26.COV2.S.While China has administered Covid shots to about 1.07 billion of its 1.41 billion population, according to the national health commission (NHC) data, several provinces have reported fresh virus outbreaks.On Friday, Mainland China reported 59 new local cases of infection, its highest number of daily new cases since September 16.

Almost every other nationality, barring some like those holding Pakistani passports, can apply for an e-visa, Canadians still don’t have that option.A senior Indian official told the Hindustan Times the e-visa “suspension remains in place for Canadians in response to the testing restrictions” that Canada continues to subject travellers from India to. Canadian transport minister Omar Alghabra made a series of announcements on Friday in which he said that it was mandatory to be fully vaccinated to board a flight from Canada starting from October 30. He did not mention any relaxations for passengers arriving by air from India.For those taking direct flights, they still only have the option of getting a mandatory negative RT-PCR test result from a single laboratory at the international airport in Delhi before being allowed to board for a Canada flight. For those flying via a third country, the stipulation is that they will have to obtain the necessary negative result at the point of departure, which is the country where the connecting flight is leaving from.These restrictions came into place in September, even as Canada allowed direct flights from India, which had been suspended in April due to concerns over the surge in Delta-driven coronavirus cases in India. While that ban was finally lifted on September 27, the Canadian Government put in place the restrictive testing regimen.New Delhi has retaliated to the developments by retaining the e-visa suspension for Canada even as discussions continue over relaxations, including expanding the list of testing centres in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-tit-for-tat-move-india-retains-e-visa-suspension-for-canadians-101635596999854.html

Hafiz Mohibullah, Mullah Ghulam Rasool and Mullah Muhammad Abbas took charge of the consulates in Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi.This move by the Pakistan government to grant visas to the appointed “diplomats” comes despite the nation not recognising the Taliban as the legitimate government in Afghanistan.Sardar Muhammad Shokaib effectively is now the charge d’affaires in Islamabad.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has been without an ambassador since July. The former envoy under the government led by former PM Ashraf Ghani, Najibullah Alikhil, left because of controversy due to alleged abduction of his daughter Silsila Alikhil, news agency PTI reported.A report by Voice of America said that Shokaib was an ethnic Pashtun from Zabul province who served in the information and cultural department in southern Kandahar and was also part of a Taliban magazine. He also worked as a Taliban spokesman under the name of Qari Yousaf Ahmadi and was arrested in Pakistan. He was a resident of Peshawar for several years, the report highlighted.Pakistan said the appointment of the Taliban-appointed envoys was an ‘administrative matter’. “With regard to the appointment of new staff in the Afghan embassy, this is an administrative matter and is meant to enable the embassy to perform its functions, primarily the consular functions as you are aware there are millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and there are visa issues as well,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said while trying to play down the appointments.Most world leaders are sceptical about the Taliban fulfilling the promises it made when it took over Kabul forcing the Ashraf Ghani-led out.

The convict purportedly wrote a letter expressing his apprehension on the extension given to General Bajwa and asked for his resignation, ANI reported, citing The News International report which in turn relied on BBC Urdu Service.The military court convicted Hassan Askari, son of Maj Gen (R) Zafar Mehdi Askari, under treason charges for his criticism over the Pakistan Army chief's extension.

30-10-2021||World||China in dark over what damaged US nuclear submarine in South China Sea: Report||The Chinese military is still in the dark over what damaged the US nuclear submarine when it was on the prowl in the disputed South China Sea early this month, while satellite photos of the moored vessel showed that the sub may have had a head-on collision, rendering it “deaf and blind”, according to a media report on Saturday.A recent satellite image suggests that the damage to the American submarine, the USS Connecticut may have been caused by a head-on collision with a pint-sized submerged object in the South China Sea (SCS), according to Chinese military experts.The incident four weeks ago may have occurred in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands in the SCS controlled by China, indicating the Chinese Navy could have detected the American sub on its way to Guam but was not aware of its damaged condition, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.Earlier this month, media reports said that the US nuclear-powered submarine was damaged after it struck an object underwater in the SCS.Eleven sailors on board the USS Connecticut were injured in the accident. None of the injuries were life-threatening, an announcement by the US Pacific Fleet said.It is unclear what the Seawolf-class submarine may have hit as the US Navy’s announcement of the accident days later did not give further details such as the extent of the damage, what the sub had collided with or the specific location.Reacting to the incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on October 8 that “China is severely concerned about this accident” and asked the Pentagon to provide an explanation.“The US as the side involved in this incident should inform the relevant details including the location, purpose of this navigation, details of the accident and what did the submarine run into and whether any nuclear leakage has taken place and whether local maritime environment was harmed,” he had asked.After the incident, the submarine managed to travel to the US Navy’s base in Guam and the first publicly available image of the moored vessel showed that the sonar dome of the Seawolf-class sub’s nose had been taken out, suggesting its bow sonar system was damaged in the incident on October 2, the Post report said.The satellite photos of the submarine USS Connecticut were captured by the American private Earth imaging company Planet Labs on October 20, and published by American technology and military site The Drive.“It’s almost certain that the USS Connecticut was hit in a head-on collision that cracked its sonar dome, the most important sensor system, meaning the sub became effectively blind and deaf underwater and had to escape immediately,” Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Tong said.Twelve days earlier, Beijing-based maritime think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, posted a low-resolution satellite image on Twitter and said a suspected Seawolf-class submarine had been spotted sailing 43 nautical miles (80 kms) southeast of Paracel Island on October 3, the day after the apparent collision.Paracel Island of the SCS is called Xisha islands by China.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.Beijing is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.The US has been periodically sending its naval and air patrols through the SCS, challenging China’s claims of sovereignty over the area and also to assert the freedom of navigation.Cao Yanzhong, a researcher with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Science has claimed that the US warships and planes carried out over 2,000 close spying missions aimed at China this year as rivalry between the two countries heightened.The targets of these missions included Chinese controlled islands and reefs in the SCS as well as the coastal area of the Chinese mainland, Cao told the 10th Xiangshan forum, an annual Chinese military conference recently.Wong further said that information suggested that the collusion of the US submarine could have happened close to the exclusive economic zone claimed by China around the disputed islands, even if the US did not recognise such a zone when conducting freedom of navigation operations in what it says are international waters.“The collision may have happened less than 43 nautical miles from the Paracels, and a sub-operation is much more sensitive than those of surface vessels, pushing the US Navy to keep a low profile and avoid alerting their Chinese counterparts.“The fact that the American sub could stay underwater for so long suggests that the damage was not serious,” Wong told the Post.The resource-rich South China Sea is the world’s busiest waterway for military and commercial vessels. Beijing is building a massive underwater observation network, dubbed the “underwater Great Wall”, for maritime science and national security applications.Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie said that the Chinese Navy may have been aware of the American sub’s route through the region but did not establish where the incident occurred and just let it pass.The damage could have been caused by something the size of an underwater drone, rather than another submarine, the expert said.“This accident reminded the People’s Liberation Army Navy to further beef up China’s underwater surveillance capability, as well as its defensive strength in the region,” Li added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-dark-over-what-damaged-us-nuclear-submarine-in-south-china-sea-report-101635585573555.html

The government, meanwhile, assured that more vulnerable LGBT+ people from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the UK in the coming months.“Britain is a fierce champion of freedom and the right of all people to be themselves and love who they want free from persecution. We played a key role getting these people out and will continue to do all we can to help at-risk Afghans leave the country,” UK foreign minister Truss was quoted as saying by the official statement on Saturday.Safe houses are being established for Afghans who arrived on Friday, Sebastian Rocca, chief executive of Micro Rainbow, a charity supporting LGBT+ refugees, told Reuters.British gay rights group Stonewall and Canada’s Rainbow Railroad were a part of the evacuation efforts.“However, our work is not yet done. We will continue advocating for international support for LGBTQ+ Afghans, including those that remain in Afghanistan, and we will also continue to work with the UK Government to ensure that the LGBTQ+ Afghans who arrive in the UK are given the support they need to thrive,” Nancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, said.Under the UK’s Operation Pitting, which ended in late August, the government has assisted more than 1,300 people, including Afghan civilians and British nationals, to leave Afghanistan, the official also said.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-evacuates-first-group-of-lgbt-afghans-since-taliban-s-takeover-101635573945093.html
30-10-2021||World||US watchdog says Pentagon, State Dept concealing Afghanistan data||A US government watchdog on Friday accused the State Department and Pentagon of suppressing information that lawmakers and the public need to understand the collapse of Afghanistan's former government and military and the chaotic US troop pullout."The full picture of what happened in August - and all the warning signs that could have predicted the outcome - will only be revealed if the information that the departments of Defense and State have already restricted from public release is made available," said John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR).A State Department spokesperson said the department had requested "some reports be temporarily removed to redact identifying information from public records and protect the identities of Afghans and Afghan partner organizations" due to security concerns about the evacuation effort."The identifying information are the only details intended to be shielded," the spokesperson said, adding that SIGAR has the authority to restore the reports.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Addressing reporters, Sopko said that after the Taliban seized Kabul, the State Department asked him to temporarily suspend online access to certain reports he issued to ensure the safety of US-affiliated Afghans.The department "was never able to describe any specific threats to individuals that were supposedly contained in our reports," said Sopko, who added he "reluctantly" barred access to the documents.The State Department, he continued, recently sought redactions of some 2,400 items remaining on SIGAR's website.Some requests were "bizarre," such as excising former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's name from reports, Sopko said.After a review, his agency found only four items meriting redaction, and left the remainder accessible.Noting that Congress tasked him with investigating the collapse of the US-backed Afghan government and military, he said the Pentagon has since 2015 barred from public release a range of data purportedly at the former Ghani government's request.Most of that information, including casualty data and unit strengths, was "all you needed to know to determine whether the Afghan security forces were a real fighting force or a house of cards," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-watchdog-says-pentagon-state-dept-concealing-afghanistan-data-101635568569388.html

30-10-2021||World||12 states sue Biden administration over Covid-19 vaccine rule||Eleven states filed lawsuits Friday to stop President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors, arguing that the requirement violates federal law.Attorneys general from Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming signed on to the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court in Missouri.The states asked a federal judge to block Biden’s requirement that all employees of federal contractors be vaccinated against the coronavirus, arguing that the mandate violates federal procurement law and is an overreach of federal power.“If the federal government attempts to unconstitutionally exert its will and force federal contractors to mandate vaccinations, the workforce and businesses could be decimated, further exacerbating the supply chain and workforce crises,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, said in a statement. "The federal government should not be mandating vaccinations, and that’s why we filed suit today – to halt this illegal, unconstitutional action.”New Hampshire’s Republican Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that COVID vaccines are safe, effective and encouraged but that the benefits “do not justify violating the law."That lawsuit, along with one filed Friday by Texas and Thursday by Florida, brings to 12 the number of states challenging the Biden administration mandate in three federal courts.Biden has argued that sweeping vaccine mandates will help end the deadly pandemic, but Republicans nationwide have opposed the vaccination requirements and have threatened to bring similar legal challenges.Texas filed a similar lawsuit Friday in a federal district court in a federal court in Galveston, Texas, seeking to block enforcement of the mandate.“The Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed its disdain for Americans who choose not to get a vaccine, and it has committed repeated and abusive federal overreach to force upon Americans something they do not want,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, in a statement. “The federal government does not have the ability to strip individuals of their choice to get a vaccine or not. If the President thinks his patience is wearing thin, he is clearly underestimating the lack of patience from Texans whose rights he is infringing.”Another group of states led by Georgia announced Friday that they would file a similar federal lawsuit in that state to try to block the contractor requirements. Other states that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said are joining the case include Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, West Virginia and Utah, as well as South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.The suit had not been filed when it was announced, and Georgia officials did not immediately provide a copy of the complaint.“We will not allow the Biden administration to circumvent the law or force hardworking Georgians to choose between their livelihood or this vaccine,” Kemp, a Republican, said in a statement.The Democratic Party of Georgia called the lawsuit a “dangerous political stunt.”Florida filed a separate lawsuit against the federal mandate on Thursday. That lawsuit also alleged the president doesn’t have the authority to issue the rule and that it violates procurement law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-states-sue-biden-administration-over-covid-19-vaccine-rule-101635565225150.html
30-10-2021||World||US spy agencies say they may never be able to identify Covid-19 origins||US intelligence agencies said on Friday that they may never be able to identify the origins of Covid-19, as they released a new, more detailed version of their review of whether the coronavirus came from an animal-to-human transmission or leaked from a lab.The Office of the US Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a declassified report that a natural origin and a lab leak are both plausible hypotheses for how SARS-COV-2 first infected humans. But it said analysts disagree on which is more likely or whether any definitive assessment can be made at all.The report also dismissed suggestions that the coronavirus originated as a bioweapon, saying proponents of this theory "do not have direct access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology" and have been accused of spreading disinformation.The report issued on Friday is an update of a 90-day review that President Joe Biden's administration released in August, amid intense political infighting over how much to blame China for the effects of the global pandemic rather than governments that may not have moved quickly enough to protect citizens.China responded on Friday by criticizing the report."The US moves of relying on its intelligence apparatus instead of scientists to trace the origins of Covid-19 is a complete political farce," Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement."... It will only undermine science-based origins study and hinder the global effort of finding the source of the virus," the statement said.Former Republican President Donald Trump - who lost his bid for re-election as the deadly pandemic ravaged the US economy - and many of his supporters referred to Covid-19 as the "China virus."Some US spy agencies had strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. But there has been little corroboration and over recent months the virus has spread widely and naturally among wild animals.The ODNI report said four US spy agencies and a multi-agency body have "low confidence" that Covid-19 originated with an infected animal or a related virus.But one agency said it had "moderate confidence" that the first human Covid-19 infection most likely was the result of a laboratory accident, probably involving experimentation or animal handling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.US spy agencies believe they will not be able to produce a more definitive explanation for the origin of Covid-19 without new information demonstrating that the virus took a specific pathway from animals to humans or that a Wuhan laboratory was handling the virus or a related virus before Covid-19 surfaced.The report said US agencies and the global scientific community lacked "clinical samples or a complete understanding of epidemiological data from the earliest Covid-19 cases" and said it could revisit this inconclusive finding if more evidence surfaces.China has faced international criticism for failing to cooperate more fully in investigations of Covid's origins.The embassy statement also dismissed that criticism."We have been supporting science-based efforts on origins tracing, and will continue to stay actively engaged. That said, we firmly oppose attempts to politicize this issue," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-spy-agencies-say-they-may-never-be-able-to-identify-covid-19-origins-101635563447918.html
30-10-2021||World||Prince Andrew never sexually assaulted American, says lawyer||Lawyers for Prince Andrew asked a New York judge Friday to throw out a lawsuit accusing the prince of sexually abusing an American when she was 17, saying the prince “never sexually abused or assaulted” the plaintiff.In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, an attorney for Andrew said the plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, may well be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of financier Jeffrey Epstein.“However, and without diminishing the harm suffered as a result of Epstein’s alleged misconduct, Prince Andrew never sexually abused or assaulted Giuffre. He unequivocally denies Giuffre’s false allegations against him,” according to arguments signed by attorney Andrew Brettler.Brettler asked that the lawsuit be thrown out or that lawyers for Giuffre be required to refile the lawsuit with a more definitive statement of her allegations.“Accusing a member of the world’s best known royal family of serious misconduct has helped Giuffre create a media frenzy online and in the traditional press. It is unfortunate, but undeniable, that sensationalism and innuendo have prevailed over the truth,” the filing said.“Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense and at the expense of those closest to him. Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre does not justify her public campaign against Prince Andrew,” the written arguments said.The submission also challenged a temporary New York state law that has since expired that let survivors of sex abuse incurred during childhood to sue their alleged abusers no matter how much time had passed.Giuffre claimed in her August lawsuit that the prince abused her on multiple occasions in 2001. Andrew has said even before the court papers were filed Friday that he never had sex with her.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they choose to come forward publicly, as Giuffre has.An attorney for Giuffre, Sigrid McCawley, called Andrew's request to dismiss the lawsuit “outrageous" and credited Giuffre for helping to reveal Epstein's alleged sex trafficking that they say Andrew participated in.On the subject of money, McCawley said, "the only party to this litigation using money to his benefit is Prince Andrew."Brettler, who has called the lawsuit “baseless,” had included in the arguments a copy of a 2009 settlement agreement that he believes protects his client from being sued.According to the arguments on Andrew’s behalf, Giuffre’s 2009 settlement of sex trafficking and sexual abuse claims against Epstein included a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities.“To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit -- or lack thereof -- to any such claims,” the papers said.The pages of the settlement reached between Giuffre and Epstein were blacked out when they were included in Friday’s submission as “Exhibit A.” The financier was found dead at age 66 in his cell in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial at a New York federal jail. His death was ruled a suicide.Earlier this week, Brettler said in a written submission to the judge that the agreement “releases Prince Andrew and others from any purported liability arising from the claims Ms. Giuffre asserted against Prince Andrew here.”When he requested that the documents be filed under seal, Brettler said neither he nor lawyers for Giuffre believed that it was necessary to keep the 2009 settlement agreement secret except for the fact that it is under seal in another civil litigation in Manhattan federal court.A hearing in the case is scheduled for next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-never-sexually-assaulted-american-says-lawyer-101635563110433.html

This campaign started on October 16 in 14 Provinces. It started in the Southern region a day later," Al-Janabi said,He further stated that "In the remaining provinces, it will start in the next 2 -3 days. Currently, almost 40,000 people are being vaccinated daily. This massive campaign will continue until we utilize 1.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson available in stock."Afghanistan has received about 5.25 million doses of different types of vaccines both through Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility and bilateral donations, he added."According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 155,985 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 7,257 deaths in Afghanistan. As of October 23, a total of 2,925,490 vaccine doses have been administered," Sputnik reported citing the Al-Janabi as saying.The Taliban took over Afghanistan in mid-August and the US military ended its 20 years of military presence in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-40-000-people-inoculated-daily-against-covid-19-in-afghanistan-101635561296123.html
30-10-2021||World||US clears Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine was cleared by US regulators for children ages 5 to 11, a long-awaited pandemic milestone that opens a new phase of the immunization campaign. The emergency authorisation, announced on Friday in a statement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), brings the US a step closer to shots being administered at schools, pediatricians’ offices, and pharmacies around the country. The formulation for young kids is one-third the dose of the adult shot.Before youngsters can begin to receive the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization advisory committee will also meet to make more specific recommendations about who should get it and how to administer it. The panel is currently scheduled to convene on Nov. 2 and 3. The CDC director Rochelle Walensky will then need to sign off on the advisers’ guidance.The FDA’s action on Friday allows shipments of the doses to begin -- the first time the US has distributed anything other than the regular Pfizer dose for teens and adults. The shipments would position the shots at pediatricians’ offices, pharmacies, and other locations across the country so that inoculations can begin promptly after any CDC clearance.“Vaccinating younger children against Covid-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,” acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock said in the statement. “Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.”Pfizer shares rose 1.3 per cent at the close in New York. BioNTech’s American depositary receipts lost 1.9 per cent. Officials at hospitals and clinics have been discussing the rollout for children. In Washington, for example, health officials plan to make newly authorized doses for kids available at clinics and pharmacies such as those of CVS Health Corp. and Walmart Inc. The city will also host pop-up clinics at elementary schools and Children’s National Hospital plans to distribute the shots to children at its eight primary care locations and via a mobile unit canvassing the community.New York’s Westchester Medical Center has served as a coordinator for the distribution of vaccines throughout the Hudson Valley. Michael Gewitz, physician-in-chief at the center’s Maria Fareri Children’s Hospital, said the process of vaccinating 5- to 11-year-olds will be different from earlier campaigns. That means they’ll focus vaccination efforts on pediatricians’ offices in their network as well as at a small vaccine site on the medical center’s campus.“For the children in the 5-to-11 age bracket, we want to administer it in a more friendly, personal environment,” Gewitz said. “We think it will be a better environment for children, especially young children.”CDC ExpertsMany doctors are looking to hear what the experts on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend for the vaccine’s use, said Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program.“I think the desire is for pediatricians to begin having those conversations with families, answering questions that the parents might have, and then waiting for what the ACIP provides guidance on next week,” said Creech, who’s helped conduct a trial of Moderna Inc.’s Covid vaccine in children.Megan Ranney’s son Clark is anxiously awaiting his shot. Her 10-year-old is jealous of an elder sister who’s already been vaccinated and can do more socializing, said Ranney, an emergency physician and researcher at Brown University in Rhode Island.Sleepover Key“Our family rule is you could do sleepovers the summer going into third grade, and he missed that because of Covid,” she said. “He’s never done a sleepover and he really wants to.” She didn’t make the decision on immunization lightly, she said, given the risk of a rare form of heart inflammation called myocarditis that’s associated with the vaccine in some adults, particularly males. The data show the shot is safe, she said.“The risk of myocarditis from the vaccine, even for boys, is lower than the risk of myocarditis from Covid itself,” she said. “Covid is one of the top 10 leading causes of death this year in children. I do a lot of things to protect my kids from injury and illness that are less common than Covid. This seems like a no-brainer.”President Joe Biden’s administration has said they have enough vaccines for all 28 million kids in the 5 to 11 age group, and they’re ready to ship the shots.“Upon FDA authorization of the vaccine, millions of doses will be shipped immediately to tens of thousands of pediatricians, family doctors, children’s hospitals, community health centers, rural health clinics, and pharmacies –– providers parents and kids know and trust,” Jeff Zients, Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, said Wednesday at a press briefing. “We will be ready immediately following FDA and CDC’s decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly, easily, and conveniently.”The recent surge in infections fueled by the delta variant and the return of in-person learning have increased calls for younger children to be immunized. While FDA advisers unanimously recommended approval of the shot, some expressed concern about a lack of data on side effects, the prevalence of Covid in children, and other issues.  The advisers supported the vaccine in part because so many children with Covid don’t show risk factors before catching the disease, said Peter Marks, head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, during a media briefing following the announcement.“Trying to limit it to just a high-risk group could create issues, including issues of making sure that the general population was protected,” he said. It may be a few months until authorities consider shots for children under age 5, Marks said. “As we get down to younger children the benefit-risk gets to be even more of a careful consideration because the youngest children are affected the least directly in terms of severe Covid-19,” he said. The US has been focusing on ways to bolster its defenses and prevent another virus surge. Just last week, the FDA paved the way for millions of recipients of Moderna Inc. and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to receive their Covid boosters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-clears-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-aged-5-to-11-101635560978874.html

A report claimed that Beijing is making billions of dollars on the black market by forcibly harvesting the organs of its vulnerable minorities – an alarming allegation that, if proved true, would expectedly lead to a call for action from the international community.Also Read | No food, only bottlecaps to moisten lips: Ex-Chinese cop reveals Uyghur travel woes and moreThe recent report regarding the alleged Uyghur abuses was featured, according to the ANI news agency, in the Herald Sun – a morning tabloid newspaper based in Australia's Melbourne. As per the agency, the report contains many gruesome details about how a “healthy liver fetches around USD 160,000” in the organ shacks of the black market, and that this trade churns out an annual turnover of “at least USD 1 billion” for China.Notably, this is not the first time that allegations have been raised regarding organ harvesting in the detention centres of China. In June earlier this year, the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) said that its human rights experts were “extremely alarmed” by reports of “alleged ‘organ harvesting’ targeting minorities, including Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims and Christians, in detention in China.”The UN human rights experts said they have received credible information that detainees from ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities may be forcibly subjected to blood tests and organ examinations such as ultrasound and X-rays, without their informed consent; while other prisoners are not required to undergo such examinations. The results of the examinations are reportedly registered in a database of living organ sources that facilitates organ allocation.In its recent report, the Herald Sun daily elaborated on the procedures, including forced organ harvesting and sterilisation, that the Uyghur and other minorities are allegedly subjected to in China. The hospitals that carry out the organ transplant, the report said, are reportedly found not too far away from the detention centres. It revealed that the number of performed operations in the hospitals and the short waiting lists indicate there has been “forced organ harvesting” for a very long time on a large scale.Nearly 80,000 Uyghurs were trafficked to factories across the country between 2017 and 2019, the newspaper reported, citing a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). “In factories far away from home, they typically live in segregated dormitories, undergo organised Mandarin and ideological training outside working hours, are subject to constant surveillance, and are forbidden from participating in religious observances,” the ASPI report stated.Also Read | China: CPC leader sanctioned for violations in Xinjiang takes charge of TibetCiting an investigation published in the Taiwan News, the newspaper reported that the assets worth $84 billion were seized from the Uyghurs in recent years, real estate comprising the majority of such assets.According to the allegations received by the United Nations earlier this year, the most common organs removed from the prisoners are reportedly hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers. "This form of trafficking with a medical nature allegedly involves health sector professionals, including surgeons, anaesthetists and other medical specialists,” the UNHCR noted.UN human rights experts, however, pointed out the issue to the Chinese government in 2006 and 2007. The government, in turn, responded with statements that lacked data such as waiting times for organ allocation or information on the sources of organs. “In this context, the lack of available data and information-sharing systems are obstacles to the successful identification and protection of victims of trafficking and effective investigation and prosecution of traffickers,” the UN said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liver-on-sale-for-160k-uyghur-organs-harvested-in-china-s-black-markets-101635556908589.html
30-10-2021||World||Covid-19: Needle-free vaccine patches are on the way, say manufacturers||Effective vaccines, without a needle: Since the start of the Covid pandemic, researchers have doubled down on efforts to create patches that deliver life-saving drugs painlessly to the skin, a development that could revolutionize medicine.The technique could help save children's tears at doctors' offices, and help people who have a phobia of syringes.Beyond that, skin patches could assist with distribution efforts, because they don't have cold-chain requirements -- and might even heighten vaccine efficacy.A new mouse study in the area, published in the journal Science Advances, showed promising results.The Australian-US team used patches measuring one square centimeter that was dotted with more than 5,000 microscopic spikes, "so tiny you can't actually see them," David Muller, a virologist at the University of Queensland and co-author of the paper, told AFP.These tips have been coated with an experimental vaccine, and the patch is clicked on with an applicator that resembles a hockey puck. "It's like you get a good flick on the skin," said Muller.The researchers used a so-called “subunit” vaccine that reproduces the spikes that dot the surface of the coronavirus.Mice were injected either via the patch over the course of two minutes or with a syringe.The immune systems of those who got the patch produced high levels of neutralising antibodies after two doses, including in their lungs, vital to stopping Covid-19, and the patches outperformed syringes.The researchers also found that a sub-group of mice, who were given only one dose of vaccine containing an additional substance called an adjuvant used to spur immune response, "didn't get sick at all," said Muller.Easy to applyWhat makes them more effective?Vaccines are normally injected into our muscles, but muscle tissue doesn't contain very many immune cells needed to react to the drug, explained Muller.In addition, the tiny spikes cause localized skin death, which alerts the body to a problem and triggers a greater immune response.For the scientist, the logistical advantages couldn't be clearer.First, when dry-coated on a patch, the vaccine is stable for at least 30 days at 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and one week at 40C (104F), compared to a few hours at room temperature for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.This offers a major advantage, particularly for developing countries.Second, "it's very simple to use," said Muller. "You don't necessarily need highly trained medical professionals to deliver it."Burak Ozdoganlar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in the US city of Pittsburgh, has also been working on the technology since 2007.He sees yet another advantage: "Less amount of vaccine delivered precisely to the skin can activate an immune response similar to intramuscular injection," he told AFP. It's an important factor as the developing world struggles to procure enough Covid vaccines.Ozdoganlar can produce around 300-400 patches a day in his lab but hasn't been able to test them out on mRNA vaccines, which have come to the fore during the pandemic, because he hasn't been authorized by Pfizer or Moderna.‘The future’The patch used in the study published on Friday was made by Australian company Vaxxas, which is the furthest along. Human trials are planned from April.Two other American companies are also part of the race: Micron Biomedical and Vaxess.The latter, founded in 2013 and based in Massachusetts, is working on a slightly different type of patch, with microneedles that dissolve in the skin.They say this approach has the benefit of requiring fewer spikes per patch – just 121 – made of a protein polymer that is biocompatible.“We're working on a seasonal Covid-19 and flu combination product that will be mailed directly to patients' homes, for self-administration,” CEO Michael Schrader told AFP.The Covid vaccine they are using is produced by the company Medigen, already authorized in Taiwan.Vaxess has just opened a factory near Boston, with funding from the US National Institutes for Health. They aim to produce enough patches to vaccinate 2,000 to 3,000 people in clinical trials, which are to be launched next summer.The main challenge right now is production, with no manufacturers yet able to make enough patches en masse.“If you want to launch a vaccine you have to produce hundreds of millions,” said Schrader. “We do not have that scale as of today – no one really has that scale.”But the pandemic has given a push to the nascent industry, which is now attracting more investors, he added.“This is the future, in my opinion, it is inevitable,” said Schrader. “I think you're going to see over the next 10 years, this (will) pretty dramatically reshape the way that we get vaccines around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-needle-free-vaccine-patches-are-on-the-way-say-manufacturers-101635553513807.html
