Under the programme, 0.9 million students of classes 9 to 12 ---- the crucial years when students decide on their future career paths --- will be connected with mentors from various professional and academic backgrounds to help them in their overall growth and personality development by sharing knowledge, skills and expertise. The mentors will engage with their mentees over the phone for 10-15 minutes every day, and interested citizens from across the country can join the effort by registering on the Desh ke Mentors app. During the launch of the programme, Mr Kejriwal said that other than helping the students with their educational needs, the programme could motivate people to start seeing beyond the fault lines of caste, creed, and religion.

Except that these internal elections will take place over the next 11 months, and the new Congress president will be elected only by the end of September 2022. If Rahul Gandhi had not resigned as party president right after the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, and remained president, the end of 2022 is when his five-year term according to the party constitution would have been ending in any case. So, the Congress is almost proceeding as if nothing has changed in the interim — even though, in this period, after it lost a second successive Lok Sabha election, it failed to win back power in Haryana and Assam; got decimated in West Bengal; lost its most important troubleshooter and political manager in Ahmed Patel; has been managing internal crises in Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and a part-rebellion in Delhi; lacks a clear leader or road map for the 2024 election; and is facing a challenge from others in the Opposition in multiple states.
