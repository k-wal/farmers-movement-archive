For his part, the NHRC chair, Justice (retired) Arun Mishra, echoed the PM’s critique of selective deployment of the idea of human rights, claimed terrorists must not be defended in the name of rights, and hailed the government, especially home minister Amit Shah, for steps in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast.
