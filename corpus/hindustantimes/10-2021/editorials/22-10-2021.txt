A young, long-haired captain who engineered the improbable, edgy victory, gave the country a new phenomenon â€” the rise to the top of cricketers who did not come with big city privileges. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, over the next decade, heralded a new era for Indian cricket, even as the World Cup firmly established the newest version of the game, which had till then stumbled along with a whiff of irrelevance. It led directly to the wild and unprecedented success of the Indian Premier League (IPL) launched the very next year.
