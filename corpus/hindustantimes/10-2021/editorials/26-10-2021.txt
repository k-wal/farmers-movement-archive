26-10-2021||Editorials||LAC: India must stay vigilant||Two developments along the disputed border with China are clear portends that Beijing has no intention of working with New Delhi to ensure a speedy resolution to the military standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). First, the Indian military has picked up ample signs that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has intensified patrolling and area domination activities across the contested border in Arunachal Pradesh. Second, last week, China adopted a new law that strengthens the PLA’s ability to work with civilians to defend the country’s borders. This law allows the State to combat all acts that undermine land boundaries, build border infrastructure, and nurture frontier towns. Coming close on the heels of the Chinese side’s refusal to act on India’s forward-looking proposals to end the military face-off at remaining friction points in the Ladakh sector during the last meeting of the senior military commanders, these developments make it clear that India is in for the long haul and cannot afford to let its guard down even an inch.
