29-10-2021||Editorials||Facebook enters the Metaverse||Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a new name for his company this week: Meta. All of Facebook’s products — the eponymous social media service, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, will continue under a new corporate parent. The move mirrors what Google did in 2015 when it set up Alphabet as the umbrella entity. Mr Zuckerberg said Meta represents the next stages of Facebook’s evolution into a “metaverse” company. Zuckerberg demonstrated use cases, depicted by computer-generated imagery (CGI), of how it will bring people together in virtual reality to “play, work, shop, create” and more. He announced some projects and products, most of which appeared centred around improvements to the Oculus Quest, a virtual reality (VR) headset, and its ecosystem that Facebook has developed.
