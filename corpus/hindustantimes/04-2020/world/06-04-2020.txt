His Indian father was a doctor in Britain’s National Health Service and his mother was a nurse; the family moved in the 1970s to Ireland, where Varadkar was born.He remains the prime minister while parties negotiate to form a coalition government.Reports from Dublin said Varadkar, who practiced medicine for seven years before joining politics, rejoined the country’s medical register in March to work a session a week.Varadkar is helping with phone assessments of people who may have been exposed to Covid-19 and are assessed initially over the phone rather than in person to curb the spread of the virus. His partner, Matthew Barrett, and his two sisters and their husbands, also work in the health services, the daily reported.Ireland’s Health Service Executive appealed in March for healthcare professionals not working in the profession to register in a mass recruitment drive to deal with the crisis. Some 50,000 people applied in less than three days, The Irish Times reported.In the UK, Nadia Whittome, the Indian-origin MP from Nottingham East and the youngest at the age of 23, has also returned to her former work as a carer in a retirement village in Nottingham.“I’m back in my old team in a retirement village complex in Nottingham that houses 500 residents, 50 of whom receive the whole range of care; from medication and food through to personal and end-of-life care”, she said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-pm-varadkar-returns-to-hospital-duty-to-help-covid-19-patients/story-QPw55NRvlgOm3Iym7GUs0J.html
06-04-2020||World||Covid-19: British PM Boris Johnson is in hospital, but ‘still in charge’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson was said to be “still in charge” of the UK government on Monday after he was hospitalised on Sunday night as a precautionary step for tests, 10 days after he tested positive for coronavirus that isolated him in Downing Street.A spokesperson on Monday dismissed as ‘disinformation’ reports that Johnson is on ventilator, but did not deny that he received oxygen on Sunday night. He was described as being in “good spirits”, having spent a “comfortable night” in hospital, where he will stay another day.Johnson’s move to a London hospital was announced on Sunday night soon after Queen Elizabeth delivered a rare message to the Commonwealth, reassuring people that “we will succeed” in the fight against the pandemic, and that “better days will return…we will meet again”.Johnson’s hospitalisation prompted a fall in the pound’s value and apprehension in various quarters that authorities were not disclosing the full extent of Johnson’s ailment that needed the move to hospital, after he was said to have minor symptoms.Downing Street previously announced if he were unable to perform prime ministerial functions, foreign secretary Dominic Raab would lead the government, but housing secretary Robert Jenrick insisted on Monday that he remains in charge. Raab chaired Monday’s meeting on coronavirus-related developments.Jenrick said, “We hope that as a result of these tests (the prime minister) will be able to come back to Downing Street as soon as possible. He’s been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated. That’s going to continue.”“I’m sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Boris who wants to be hands on running the government from the front, but nonetheless he’s still very much in charge of the government,” he added.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, home secretary Priti Patel and business secretary Alok Sharma were among several leading figures across the political spectrum to wish Johnson speedy recovery.The Downing Street spokesperson said on Sunday night: “On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus”.“The Prime Minister thanks National Health Service staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, also tested positive but is said to be recovering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-british-pm-boris-johnson-is-in-hospital-but-still-in-charge/story-QeJmtG17mEzeTKlfo6YhvK.html
06-04-2020||World||China testing Wuhan residents to find out actual rate of Covid-19 infection, antibodies||China is carrying out a large-scale “seroprevalence” survey to check for Covid-19 antibodies in the population of Wuhan where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year before spreading rapidly in three months to trigger a global pandemic.It was initiated in March under China’s national health commission (NHC), the central ministry coordinating the country’s control and containment measures against the outbreak.A seroprevalence study is carried out by collecting blood samples from a large population sample across age groups to check for antibodies against particular disease – in this case, Covid-19.Besides the general population, the “sero” investigation is likely focussing on high-risk groups like those who worked in wet markets in Wuhan, and people who dealt and traded in wildlife.The result will aid in separating the confirmed and symptomatic cases from the asymptomatic ones or those individuals, who have been infected, do not show any symptom but could infect others.In simple terms, the survey results will reveal for the first time the total number of Covid-19 infections in Wuhan, and not just the number of the disease cases.China has so far not made public any information about the study, which could have potentially been done on hundreds of thousands of Wuhan residents, the first epicentre of the pandemic and a city of around 11 million people.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – which works under the NHC – and the office of respiratory expert, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, who heads the top experts’ team advising the government on fighting the outbreak did not respond to HT’s questions on the survey.HT’s questions were sent out through the information department of China’s cabinet, the State Council.Wuhan has so far accounted for over 2500 deaths and more than 50000 infections in China’s tally of 81708 confirmed cases and 3331 deaths.China has only started to share the number of asymptomatic patients in the country from last week.The WHO is not part of the survey but is aware that it is being conducted, the WHO’s china representative, Gauden Galea, told HT earlier.“We know that China is now doing a ‘sero’ survey. This is a survey to look at antibodies in the blood of people in Wuhan,” Galea said.Galea explained both the survey and its importance.“I distinguish between infection and disease. So, being infected is the process of getting the infection and it taking hold inside the body. And, then it manifests as the disease Covid-19. But the disease is distinct from the infection but when people are infected, their immune system reacts and develops antibodies,” Galea explained.Why is it important?“…there’s a big question in the world how many asymptomatic people are there who got infected but don’t (show symptoms)…you hear very many estimates…but seroprevalence survey would give the answer. It would tell you,” Galea said.In a recent medical paper on Covid-19 titled “Estimating the ascertainment rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan”, an expert on epidemiological surveillance and intervention, Theodore Lytras, from the Athens-based National Public Health Organisation wrote about the importance of seroprevalence surveys.“That’s the most important conclusion that should be drawn for our study. We urgently need seroprevalence surveys, which involves testing blood from a population sample to find out whether they have antibodies to the coronavirus, and thus how many of them had been infected,” Lytras told HT.Lytras’ and his colleagues’ modelling suggested that most of the population in Wuhan became infected (probably with little to no symptoms), and although the lockdown obviously helped, the outbreak stopped because there were few uninfected people left for the virus to infect.“This (seroprevalence survey) will give us definite answers about how many people are actually infected with the coronavirus. Our modelling for Wuhan suggests that nearly every one got infected, but we could be wrong. Only a seroprevalence survey will tell,” Lytras added.The WHO’s Galea said the results of the survey – when published – will be avidly followed by governments, researchers and planners all around the world.“This (China) is the first country that has experienced a wave of community transmission, at least in Wuhan. Therefore (the seroprevalence survey) will give you the shape of the infection curve, and not just the disease curve, which is what we have been able to see up to now,” Galea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-testing-wuhan-residents-to-find-out-actual-rate-of-covid-19-infection-antibodies/story-wXOg8LCnB3ixgB4Y7sfOOI.html
06-04-2020||World||Iran will never ask United States for coronavirus help: Report||Iran will never ask the United States for help in the fight against the new coronavirus, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected offers from Washington’s for humanitarian assistance to Iran, the Middle Eastern country so far most affected by the coronavirus, with 3,603 deaths and 58,226 people infected.“Iran has never asked and will not ask America to help Tehran in its fight against the outbreak ... But America should lift all its illegal unilateral sanctions on Iran,” Mousavi said in a televised news conference.Tensions between the two countries have been running high since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump quit a 2015 agreement that lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear programme. Washington reimposed sanctions which have crippled the Iranian economy.Iranian authorities say U.S. sanctions have hampered their efforts to curb the outbreak, urging other countries and the United Nations to call on the United States to lift them.“They (the U.S.) are trying to force Tehran to accept negotiations with America,” Mousavi said. Trump says the nuclear deal was not strong enough and wants to apply “maximum pressure” on Iran to accept tougher curbs to its nuclear programme, halt its ballistic missile work and end its support for proxy forces in the Middle East. Iran has long said it will not negotiate unless Washington lifts sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-will-never-ask-united-states-for-coronavirus-help-report/story-KIOZRdqW2GXzIjtB2ZLX0J.html
06-04-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson ‘doing well’ in hospital, stays in charge of COVID-19 response||The UK government on Monday said Prime Minister Boris Johnson is “doing well” after staying overnight in hospital for some “routine tests” related to his COVID-19 diagnosis.UK housing and communities secretary Robert Jenrick said Johnson remains in charge of the UK’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and is expected back at No.10 Downing Street soon.“This wasn’t an emergency admission. It was a planned admission to undergo some routine tests. He is doing well, I am told, and we look forward to him being back at No. 10 soon,” the Cabinet minister told the BBC on Monday morning.The update on the 55-year-old prime minister’s health came following his admission to a National Health Service (NHS) hospital in London on Sunday evening for tests after he showed “persistent symptoms of coronavirus”, including a temperature, even 10 days after testing positive for the disease.His hospitalisation was described as a “precautionary step” taken on the advice of his doctor, a Downing Street spokesperson said on Sunday.“This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus,” the spokesperson said. “The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,” the spokesperson said.Downing Street said that it was considered sensible for doctors to see the UK prime minister in person given he has ongoing symptoms but he remains in charge of the government and in contact with ministerial colleagues and officials.UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab, the First Secretary of State, is the UK PM’s chosen second-in-command and stepped in to chair the daily coronavirus response meeting, dubbed the COVID-19 war cabinet, on Monday morning.Johnson has until last Friday continued to chair the daily meetings remotely via video conference from his self-isolation in his private quarters in Downing Street since his diagnosis 10 days ago. The British prime minister was last seen, still looking quite poorly, when he made a brief appearance at Downing Street on Thursday night to join the national “clap for carers” applause in appreciation of the hardwork of National Health Service (NHS) workers on the frontline of the fight against the outbreak.“Remember that incredible clapping again last night for our fantastic NHS. We’re doing it to protect them and to save lives. Let’s focus on doing everything we can. Stay at home folks, protect our NHS, save lives,” he said. Johnson posted his last Twitter video message on Friday in which he said he was still displaying minor symptoms. He had extended self-isolation on Friday, which should have marked the end of the stipulated seven-day self-isolation period after his COVID-19 diagnosis last week.He said he still has a temperature, one of the symptoms associated with coronavirus, and would therefore have to stay in isolation for longer.“Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom. I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes. But we’re working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus,” he said in the video message.The UK has reported over 48,000 cases of COVID-19. On Sunday, the Department of Health said 621 more people died in hospitals in the UK over 24 hours after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total death toll to 4,934 in the country.US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending “our nation’s well wishes” for Mr Johnson’s “own personal fight with the virus”.“All Americans are praying for him. He’s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,” Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is “a strong person”.Newly-elected Labour Party leader Keir Starmer also wished Johnson well, saying he hoped for a “speedy recovery”. Over the weekend, Johnson’s pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds had revealed her own coronavirus symptoms as she said that she was “on the mend” and feeling stronger.“I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend,” said the 32-year-old, who has been self-isolating separately at her south London flat.UK health secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for coronavirus and returned from self-isolation after seven days last Thursday to host the daily Downing Street press briefing.The UK government’s chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms, as has Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-doing-well-in-hospital-stays-in-charge-of-covid-19-response/story-01GZsS6Oq9HhGureEuXc8I.html

A giant protective dome was put in place over the fourth reactor in 2016.Fires are common in the forests near the disused power plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radiation-spike-as-forest-fire-hits-chernobyl-nuclear-zone/story-kJ7Ou5WYCSIIaQvBNPSIBO.html

06-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Across West Asia, life in lockdown is a study in contrast||In the early days of March, a striking image of Mecca’s Al Haram Mosque went viral. The popular Saudi mosque was empty. Its white floor stood out in contrast to the towering Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site.In contrast to many countries around the world where lockdowns came too late, the Saudis had swung into action ahead of time in February end, decisively closing doors to tourists and pilgrims.The measures came even before the kingdom reported its first case of coronavirus disease Covid-19.“Other countries that didn’t take matters seriously should have followed all the measures taken by the kingdom to protect its people,” G Sultan, a resident of Riyadh, told HT. “If you go to the supermarkets, you find what you want and in very abundant quantities, and the prices haven’t changed.”Sultan lives at home with his family, closely following up on his children, who are studying through distance education.“The government has instituted strict measures to prevent people from leaving home, yet you can get what you want by using electronic requests,” he says.Today, Saudi Arabia is the worst-hit among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) group of Arab oil monarchies. It had reported 2,179 cases of confirmed infections till Saturday and 29 deaths. The first case positive coronavirus case the country was a Saudi national returning from Iran through Bahrain.Iran was Middle East’s focal point in the first days of the coronavirus epidemic, where the hotspot was the country’s holiest city of Qom. The virus quickly spread to other cities across the country and its neighbours, including several of its regional allies, suffered outbreaks that were linked to Iran.“I don’t think they (the government) are doing enough - at all,” said an Iranian man who lives in Hormozgan. He wished not to be named. “There haven’t been quarantines, no roads have been closed, people are free to travel, there are still planes coming and going. It’s the people who are taking care of each other.”“In Iran, it has been disaster after disaster - the killings of protesters, the shooting of the Ukrainian plane, and now the outbreak. It has just been a never-ending nightmare. I am just happy to be alive, and I try everything I can to protect the people I care about,” he added.The death toll in Iran from the outbreak has reached 3,603, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement broadcast live on state TV on Sunday. 151 people have died in the past 24 hours, he said. The Islamic Republic, the Middle Eastern country worst-hit by the epidemic, now has a total of 58,226 infections.Iran has been accused of covering up the crisis in the country. On March 12, the Washington Post published satellite images of a mass grave near Qom, the epicentre of Iran’s outbreak, indicating that the death toll is likely much higher than the state is publicly admitting. Iran has denied these claims.The story is nearly the same across the border in Iraq. The health ministry says Covid-19 has killed 56 Iraqis and infected more than 800 others. But many suspect the real numbers to be much higher, as only a few thousand people from a population of 40 million have been tested.Iraq on Friday suspended the work of Reuters news agency for three months, following a report by the agency the previous day that said the Iraqi government was underreporting confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. The Reuters report said the true number ranged from 3,000 to 9,000.Baghdad resident Zainab laments the country was too late to react. “They were late in closing the airports. They allowed Iranian visitors to come in,” says the 23-year-old engineer.“Curfew procedures are not serious. Plus, the government hasn’t been firm with some religious groups who insist on gathering for rituals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-across-west-asia-life-in-lockdown-is-a-study-in-contrast/story-kqcLFvfHxGpiScYgtu5uRJ.html

It is tough and smart, but we are tougher and smarter,” Trump tweeted ahead of a White House briefing on tackling the coronavirus pandemic. We are learning much about the Invisible Enemy. It is tough and smart, but we are tougher and smarter!The United States has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, with thousands dying of the Covid-19 disease across the country. Senior official on Sunday warned of the “hardest” week ahead, but some saw glimmers of hope from a slight slowing of fatalities.New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.“Maybe that’s a good sign,” Trump later told reporters at a White House briefing, referring to the drop in fatalities in New York.Trump also said the United States was “very far down the line” on developing vaccines for the coronavirus. “We’ll see what happens,” he said. But he offered no specifics.Louisiana has become a hot spot for the virus, reporting a jump in deaths to nearly 500 and more than 13,000 cases. The governor predicted the state would run out of ventilators by Thursday.Places such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Washington, DC, are also starting to see rising deaths.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that new hospitalisations had fallen by 50 per cent over the previous 24 hours. He cautioned that it was not yet clear whether the crisis was reaching a plateau in the state, which has a total of 4,159 deaths and more than 122,000 cases, by far the most of any US state.

06-04-2020||World||Tiger at NYC’s Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus||A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the new coronavirus, in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere, federal officials and the zoo said Sunday.The 4-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia — and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill — are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn’t yet showing symptoms, the zoo said. The first animal started showing symptoms March 27, and all are doing well and expected to recover, said the zoo, which has been closed to the public since March 16 amid the surging coronavirus outbreak in New York.The test result stunned zoo officials: “I couldn’t believe it,” director Jim Breheny said. But he hopes the finding can contribute to the global fight against the virus that causes COVID-19.“Any kind of knowledge that we get on how it’s transmitted, how different species react to it, that knowledge somehow is going to provide a greater base resource for people,” he said in an interview.The finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which confirmed Nadia’s test result at its veterinary lab, says there are no known cases of the virus in U.S. pets or livestock.“There doesn’t appear to be, at this time, any evidence that suggests that the animals can spread the virus to people or that they can be a source of the infection in the United States,” Dr. Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official, said in an interview.The USDA said Sunday it’s not recommending routine coronavirus testing of animals, in zoos or elsewhere, or of zoo employees. Still, Rooney said a small number of animals in the U.S. have been tested through the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and all those tests came back negative except Nadia’s.The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say.There have been a handful of reports outside the U.S. of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus, and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.The American Veterinary Medical Association and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals — advice that the veterinary group reiterated after learning of the tiger’s test result.In general, the CDC also advises people to wash their hands after handling animals and do other things to keep pets and their homes clean.At the Bronx Zoo, Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed dry coughs, and some of the cats exhibited some wheezing and loss of appetite, said Dr. Paul Calle, the zoo’s chief veterinarian.The staff figured there could be a relatively routine explanation for the cats’ symptoms but tested Nadia for coronavirus out of “due diligence and an abundance of caution,” Breheny said. Only Nadia was tested because it takes anesthesia to get a sample from a big cat, and she had already been knocked out to be examined.The seven sickened cats live in two areas at the zoo, and the animals had contact with the same worker, who is doing OK, zoo officials said. They said there are no signs of illness in other big cats on the property.Staffers who work with the cats will now wear infection-protection garb, as primate keepers have done for years because of the animals’ closer genetic ties to human beings, Breheny said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiger-at-nyc-s-bronx-zoo-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-8pvDsuVAC6RRzR6TLYZQ8N.html
06-04-2020||World||Wuhan, once epicentre of Covid-19, gets ready for life after lockdown||China reported 30 new cases of coronavirus disease Covid-19 on Sunday, including five locally transmitted infections, even as nine of the 13 administrative districts of virus-hit Wuhan city were declared ‘low-risk areas’ signifying a gradual return to normalcy, officials said.China’s National Health Commission (NHC) in its daily report said other than the 30 new confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in the mainland on Saturday, 47 new asymptomatic cases were also reported.Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptom and have the potential to cause sporadic infection clusters.The mass quarantine will be officially lifted in Wuhan on Wednesday. This means that trains will be able to leave, the airport will resume flights out, and cars blocked from exiting as the pathogen roared through Wuhan can take to the highways again.People, however, move around cautiously, keeping their distance. Everyone, without exception, is wearing masks.While factories in this Chinese city are allowed to re-start, workers are slow to return and supply chains are in disarray. Shopping malls have re-opened, but they’re largely empty, most people still too scared to go out for anything but essentials.With more than half of China’s officially reported virus cases and deaths, Wuhan is both where Covid-19 began, and where it left the deepest wound. Once a regional powerhouse where gross domestic product growth for last year was expected to have come in at 7.8 per cent, it’s now grappling with the challenges of starting again.Early signs indicate it will be a slow and painful process, with the shock of the epidemic still lingering and fears of a second virus wave keeping businesses from resuming full operations.“Our goal for 2020 is first to survive physically,” Ma Renren, 33, who runs a small marketing agency, told Bloomberg. “Second is for our businesses to survive.”Three deaths were reported on Saturday - all from virus epicentre Hubei Province - taking the coronavirus death toll in China to 3,329 people.The overall confirmed cases in the mainland reached 81,669 on Saturday, including 1,376 patients undergoing treatment and 76,964 others discharged from hospitals after recovery.On March 27, Wuhan’s coronavirus risk evaluation was downgraded from ‘high risk’ to ‘medium risk’. Now, Hubei Province has no cities or counties marked as ‘high risk’.Signifying the slowdown of the virus in the country, China on Saturday held a nationwide memorial for martyrs and victims of the coronavirus in the country.Chinese President Xi Jinping led the national mourning from Beijing. Three minutes’ silence was observed all over the country and flags flew half-mast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-once-epicentre-of-covid-19-gets-ready-for-life-after-lockdown/story-e1zPpuSxvKODbmDazAKjhM.html

In their own homes,” Guterres said in a statement and a video released with subtitles in several languages.“Over the past weeks as economic and social pressures and fear have grown, we have seen a horrifying global surge in domestic violence. “I urge all governments to make the prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for COVID-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-urges-govts-to-protect-women-during-coronavirus-lockdown/story-CsbDdMZFYgn2qvHi63O2YI.html

Osaka and Hyogo prefectures may also be under emergency, it said. Calls for more stringent measures to contain the deadly virus had been growing, as a recent spike in infections sparked concerns Japan is headed for a crisis on the levels seen in the U.S. and several countries in Europe.The Japan Medical Association warned last week that the jump in cases in the nation’s most populous cities is putting more pressure on medical resources and that the government should declare a state of emergency. A poll conducted by broadcaster JNN showed 80% of respondents said the declaration should be made.Tokyo reported 143 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, its largest single day. It marked the second straight day the city’s daily infection tally exceeded 100.Japan Worries Country on ‘Brink of the Brink’ of Virus Surge (1)Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has said an emergency declaration by the government will provide the legal background to implement a policy to prevent further spread. Abe told parliament Friday that the situation didn’t yet warrant an emergency declaration, but said he wouldn’t hesitate to do so if that time comes.Declaring a state of emergency hands powers to local governments, including to urge residents to stay at home. By contrast with some other countries though, there is no legal power to enforce such requests. Japan’s confirmed cases exceeded 3,000 over the weekend -- excluding those related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship -- a jump from less than 500 just a month ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-declare-emergency-in-tokyo-as-coronavirus-cases-hit-1000-in-the-capital-report/story-khWa5td7OM5XOFZIKGKBLO.html
06-04-2020||World||US navy captain fired for voicing coronavirus concern tests positive: Report||The US naval commander whose widely publicized plea for help for his coronavirus-affected crew led to his dismissal has reportedly himself tested positive for the disease.Captain Brett Crozier’s COVID-19 test result was reported Sunday by the New York Times, just hours after US Defense Secretary Mark Esper defended the captain’s firing.Esper told ABC that Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had “made a tough decision, tough call” in deciding to fire Crozier from his command of the aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt, now docked in Guam.Asked about a report that President Donald Trump wanted Crozier fired, Esper replied, “This was the secretary’s call. He came and briefed me ... It was the secretary’s call. I told him I would support it.”The firing was widely condemned as a callous and unfair punishment of a respected officer who was looking out for the welfare of his crew when he implored his superiors to let him quickly vacate the ship after it docked in Guam.“We are not at war,” Crozier wrote in a letter that leaked to the press. “Sailors do not need to die.” But some senior Pentagon officials said Crozier erred by letting his plea go public.Crozier “demonstrated extremely poor judgment in the middle of a crisis,” needlessly worrying family members and undermining the chain of command, Modly said.Trump, speaking in a news conference Saturday, supported the dismissal. “He shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter,” he said of Crozier. “I thought it was terrible what he did.”The Times, in reporting Crozier’s test result, cited two of his former classmates at the US Naval Academy. It said he had begun exhibiting symptoms before leaving the ship on Thursday.Hundreds of sailors cheered Crozier as he left the ship, as seen in video that quickly went viral. Some called him a hero.Democrats have also sharply criticized the dismissal.Joe Biden, the leading Democratic candidate for president, condemned the firing on Sunday, telling ABC it was “close to criminal.” “I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired,”the former vice president said.And a statement from Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said Crozier might not have handled the matter perfectly, but that his dismissal was an “overreaction.”Protection and readiness Esper declined Sunday to say whether other Pentagon leaders agreed with the firing, pointing to an ongoing investigation.He told CNN that more than half the Roosevelt’s 4,800-member crew had now been tested for the coronavirus. In all, 155 sailors tested positive but none required hospitalization, he said.Crozier’s dismissal came as the Pentagon struggles, amid the spreading pandemic, to maintain the readiness of its air, sea and ground forces worldwide. “We have had to cancel exercises. We’ve had to constrain basic training, for example,” Esper said, before adding, “We think those are all manageable.”Esper pointed to the particular challenges facing the military -- it is impossible to respect social distancing in a crowded bomber plane or in the confinement of a nuclear submarine, he told ABC.He said the military overall was “ahead of the curve” in balancing troops’ health and military readiness.The military has also been called to help the fight against the coronavirus inside the US.Trump said Saturday that 1,000 military personnel, mostly doctors and nurses, would be deployed to help in New York City, the epicenter of the US outbreak.Troops have already been helping out at the Javits Convention Center, which has been transformed into an enormous hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-captain-fired-for-voicing-coronavirus-concern-tests-positive-report/story-GCuGvbniswA7eu17daYNZK.html

We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again”, the monarch added.Noting crises overcome in the past, she said the coronavirus challenge is different: “This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal”.Besides the annual Christmas Day broadcast, the special message, recorded in close consultation with Downing Street and by crew in protective equipment, was the fourth such special message during her 68-year reign.

This comes after an attempt by Estonia to have the UNSC discuss the pandemic with more transparency and accountability was blocked by China, Russia and South Africa  who argued that the coronavirus spread was not a peace and security issue and hence outside the UNSC’s mandate.According to diplomatic sources in Washington and Delhi, the demand for informal consultation on the pandemic, made as it impacts the peace and security of the world, was pushed by UNSC President Dominican Republic on Friday. It was backed by Vietnam, Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Niger and Tunisia.It is understood that UN Secretary General Guterres will first address the UNSC through video conference and then announce the date for informal consultations this week. Guterres is expected to brief the member countries on the status of the pandemic and measures taken to control the killer disease.There is, however, a huge question on the possible outcome of the discussions on the disease that originated in China’s Wuhan city before it rapidly spread across the world. China is expected to be supported by Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is yet to take a stand. But the Trump administration has of late adopted a softer stand on China, particularly after Beijing supplied 1,000 ventilators for New York.France and the United Kingdom are likely to be in favour of an outcome at the informal consultations.As per John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen has infected 1.2 million people across the world and killed 66,542.The US has reported the maximum number of cases with over 3,12,000 Covid-19 patients and over 8,500 deaths.Experts believe that the virus will destroy a lot more lives than it will take. Governments across the world have ordered lockdowns to slow the pandemic and minimise the lives that it takes, forcing the global economy into a recession that may take years to get over.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants a global ceasefire to be announced so that member countries can focus on the fight against the virus and the global misery that will follow. But this may not be accepted by Russia which has stakes in the Syrian civil war and the Libyan strife.To be sure, little is expected of the informal consultations on Covid-19 at UNSC. But permanent member China, which is riled up at any description of the disease as Wuhan virus, will have to allow itself to be targeted by other UNSC members.UNSC members also surely expected to raise questions on the role of World Health Organisation that failed to recognise the disease as a pandemic earlier and Beijing’s initial denials when the outbreak took place as early as November 17, 2019||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hurdle-out-of-the-way-unsc-to-discuss-covid-19-pandemic-this-week/story-fE1GV73hbr1U5zD2hf1ajO.html
