A total of 21 of these dormitories have been designated as isolation areas as the Coronavirus was continuing to affect migrant workers.“I thanked PM Modi for India’s help when we brought home some Singaporeans from India recently. I assured him that we will care for Indian migrant workers here, just as we care for Singaporeans,” Lee wrote in the Facebook post.“The migrant workers made personal sacrifices to come to work here. They have made many contributions to Singapore, so we have a responsibility for them,” he added.Lee also said he appreciated Modi’s “affirmation of our efforts in looking after the migrant workers, and his assurance that they will not forget this”.Modi tweeted that he had exchanged views on the Covid-19 pandemic with Lee and “thanked him for the support and care being extended to Indian citizens in Singapore”. The India-Singapore strategic partnership can contribute to stability and prosperity in the post-Covid world, he added.Lee noted that Singapore was in the midst of a “circuit breaker” while India had implemented a nationwide lockdown since late March, “not a simple decision in a huge country of 1.3 billion people”.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed the Covid-19 crisis and ways to overcome the pandemic during phone conversations with his counterparts from the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Brazil on Thursday.“The changing world of #corona era diplomacy. Strong friendships thrive even virtually. A busy day talking to Foreign Ministers of Russia, Brazil, United States, Saudi Arabia and Oman,” Jaishankar tweeted.He said he and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had discussed the Covid-19 responses of the two countries and the “importance of international cooperation” and working closely on the implications and consequences of the pandemic. They also exchanged views on the Afghanistan situation, he said.State department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Pompeo and Jaishankar discussed bilateral and international cooperation to contain and mitigate Covid-19, including “ensuring the availability of pharmaceutical and medical supplies”. Jaishankar tweeted that he and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the forthcoming BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) foreign ministers’ meeting and reviewed recent developments pertaining to Afghanistan. “Our cooperation on #coronavirus reflects our special friendship,” he said.During his conversation with Oman’s foreign minister Yusuf bin Alawi, Jaishankar expressed his appreciation for Oman taking care of Indian expatriates and assured him of India’s support in the collective fight against the Coronavirus. The conversation also assumed significance as an Omani princess clarified on Wednesday she had no connection to a fake tweet posted by a person impersonating her.Jaishankar thanked Saudi Arabian foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan al Saud for taking care of the Indian community in the kingdom and discussed “our shared interest in ensuring health and food security”.In his phone conversation with Brazil’s foreign minister Ernesto Araujo, Jaishankar reviewed the follow up of President Jair Bolsonaro’s visit to India in January and exchanged notes on global issues, including the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-lee-assures-pm-modi-that-singapore-will-care-for-indian-workers-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-m2ysvoiSwZe1HrQM7xQBAP.html

This would include opening of the health assembly, address by Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that would be focused on Covid-19 preparedness and response and the formal election to the 10 seats on the executive board that will fall vacant.Hindustan Times has accessed the document.The session would begin on 18 May and end the next day. A fuller version of the assembly would be held later.The only items to be taken up would be what were described as “uncontroversial items” such as resolutions and decisions recommended by consensus by the WHO’s executive board. These would be considered to have been cleared by the health assembly if no country objects to them.During the virtual session, member countries will 2 minutes each to make their point. Regional and group statements have been limited to 4 minutes but they can all submit written submissions that would be uploaded to the WHO website.Information about the WHO opting for the abridged version came days after US President Donald Trump took sharp swipes at the global health body for what he described as its flawed recommendations on the Covid-19 outbreak in China. The US believes that the WHO-led by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus sided with China to play down the disease that originated in China’s Wuhan city. It is an allegation that Tedros Adhanom, a former foreign and health minister of Ethiopia, has denied.But the WHO chief hasn’t been able to convince many of his critics.On Thursday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared that his country would push for an international investigation into the pandemic at the meeting of the decision-making body of the WHO.“The World Health Assembly is coming up in May. There are opportunities to pursue that matter there and that is our first port of call,” Morrison said, according to news agency Reuters..Australia sits on the executive board of the assembly, which determines WHO policies. Next month, it will be India’s turn. Besides, New Delhi will also get the position of the executive board’s chairperson.Morrison had already phoned leaders in France, Germany and the United States to lobby support and could call Britain and Canada next,Australia has overcome the worst of its coronavirus outbreak, which is why it has moved on to lobbying other countries to support its call for an enquiry, but it understood that other nations were still dealing with high death rates, government, Reuters said, quoting unnamed sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilloried-over-covid-19-response-who-opts-for-truncated-annual-meet-in-may/story-wfE7aJ8yok0ylGXTkuppSO.html

A Pew research center study said of the nearly 1 million Green Cards issued in 2017, 126,000 went to applicants from India; followed by Mexico, China and Cuba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-immigration-curb-spares-healthcare-workers-dependents-investors/story-yo6ClR4lzgD6KnjXZ5ky7L.html
23-04-2020||World||Nearly 500 of Indian-origin dead in UK as Covid-19 curbs set to stay||The Boris Johnson government on Thursday announced what it called a ‘major long-term study’ for antibody testing involving nearly 3 lakh people, as senior medical advisors dampened down normalcy expectations, insisting curbs are needed “for a very long time”.New figures of hospital deaths show UK-wide 18,738 deaths and 138,078 cases. In England, the dead include 492 people of Indian origin, constituting 3% of the 16% non-white people who passed away due to the virus. London boroughs with large numbers of people of Indian origin such as Brent, Barnet, Harrow and Ealing are among the most affected.The study, intended to track the spread of Covid-19 in the general population, will continue for a year, with the aim that it will help improve understanding around the current rate of infection and how many people are likely to have developed antibodies to the virus.Chris Whitty, chief medical officer of England, said the UK will have to live with some disruptive social measures for at least the rest of the year, adding that it is “wholly unrealistic” to expect life would suddenly return to normal soon.As the University of Oxford human trial for a vaccine was set to begin on Thursday, Whitty said the ideal way out of the pandemic would be via a highly effective vaccine or drugs, but he warned that the chance of having those within the next calendar year was “incredibly small”.He said: “This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear…So we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally... for the foreseeable future”.On the study, officials said participants will provide samples taken from self-administered nose and throat swabs and answer a few short questions during a home visit by a trained health worker. The swab tests will show whether or not participants currently have the virus.They will be asked to take further tests every week for the first 5 weeks, then every month for 12 months. In total, 25,000 people will take part in the pilot phase of the survey, with plans to extend it to up to around 300,000 over the next 12 months.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “This survey will help to track the current extent of transmission and infection in the UK, while also answering crucial questions about immunity as we continue to build up our understanding of this new virus”.“Together, these results will help us better understand the spread of the virus to date, predict the future trajectory and inform future action we take, including crucially the development of ground-breaking new tests and treatments”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-500-of-indian-origin-dead-in-uk-as-covid-19-curbs-set-to-stay/story-wF3fu0NVrpGm78jWYxvk4O.html
23-04-2020||World||Millions of Americans join unemployed ranks as coronavirus ravages economy||A stunning 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks, confirming that all the jobs gained during the longest employment boom in U.S. history have been wiped out as the novel coronavirus savages the economy.The labor market slaughter added to collapsing oil prices, retail sales, manufacturing production, homebuilding and home sales in reinforcing economists’ contention that the economy entered recession in March. As the economic slump deepens protests have risen against nationwide lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House in November’s general election, has been anxious to restart the paralyzed economy. Trump on Wednesday applauded steps taken by a handful of Republican-led states to begin reopening their economies, despite warnings from health experts of a potential new surge in infections.“Today’s report shows the labor market is almost certainly pushing into new territory, jolting the unemployment rate up above the Great Recession’s 10% peak and wiping out more jobs than we’ve gained in the recovery,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, a website recruitment firm.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 810,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.427 million for the week ended April 18, the government said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 8,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, reducing the count for that period to 5.237 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 4.2 million in the latest week.All told, 26.453 million people have filed claims for jobless benefits since March 21, representing 16.2% of the labor force. The economy created 22 million jobs during the employment boom which started in September 2010 and abruptly ended in February this year.The Labor Department said “the COVID-19 virus continues to impact the number of initial claims.” Last week’s claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April’s employment report. Economists are forecasting as many as 25 million jobs were lost in April after the economy purged 701,000 positions in March, which was the largest decline in 11 years.The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.WORST OVER?Though weekly jobless filings remain very high, last week’s data marked the third straight weekly decline, raising hopes that the worst may be over. Weekly claims appeared to have peaked at a record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.U.S. stocks opened higher as investors focused on the decline in claims. The dollar was slightly higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading lower.“While layoffs and furloughs are likely to continue across a number of industries in coming weeks, we are cautiously optimistic that the peak in layoffs following initial widespread closures has occurred,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York. Some of the decline in claims has been attributed to a historic $2.3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for small businesses to access loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved $484 billion in a fresh relief package, which mainly expands funding for loans to small businesses.With claims expected to gradually decline in the coming weeks as more small enterprises access funding, attention will shift to the number of people on unemployment benefits rolls. The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and is considered a better gauge of unemployment. Continuing claims jumped 4.064 million to a record 15.976 million in the week ending April 11.Next week’s continuing claims data will offer some clues on the magnitude of the anticipated surge in the unemployment rate in April. Continuing claims have not increased at the same pace as initial jobless applications. Economists believe some people thrown out of work because of state-mandated “stay-at-home” orders found employment at supermarkets, warehouses and delivery services companies. They expect the unemployment rate will shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. The jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest single-month change since January 1975, to 4.4% in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-join-unemployed-ranks-as-coronavirus-ravages-economy/story-SwuYinwXstxRYBkJXS9mpL.html
23-04-2020||World||World Bank warns coronavirus pandemic could pressure food supply chain||The coronavirus outbreak and government policies to limit the disease could disrupt food supply chains, potentially threatening food availability, even as prices remain stable in 2020, the World Bank cautioned Thursday.Prices of agricultural commodities are likely to hold up better than oil, metals and other industrial materials that have seen demand plummet amid lockdowns and other measures to combat COVID-19, the World Bank said in a report.“Agriculture prices are less tied to economic growth, and saw only minor declines in the first quarter of 2020, except for rubber, which is used in transportation,” the report said. But while prices are expected to remain “broadly stable” this year “as production levels and stocks of most staple foods are at record highs,” the bank warned that producers could “face disruptions to the trade and distribution of inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, and labor availability.”John Baffes, a World Bank economist and co-author of the report, said exports of flowers to Europe from Kenya and Tanzania have “collapsed” and that North African fruit and vegetable suppliers also are suffering.“We can see how complex those supply chains are,” Baffes told AFP.Other countries have set up barriers to trade, with Russia limiting wheat exports and Vietnam restricting rice shipments, while the Philippines is among the countries that has conducted “excess” buying of rice.“Although these measures have not yet been used widely, they could lead to problems if they are used extensively,” the report said.Meanwhile, the World Bank expects energy prices to fall 40 percent in 2020 before experiencing a “sizeable rebound” in 2021.Oil prices are expected to average $35 a barrel in 2020, down from $61 a barrel last year.Metal prices, which also are linked to global growth, are seen dropping 13 percent, with copper and zinc especially hit, according to the report.The authors also sees the potential for “lasting effects” on commodity markets. A shift towards remote work would dent oil demand, while a “near-shoring” of key supply chains could alter demand for raw materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-warns-coronavirus-pandemic-could-pressure-food-supply-chain/story-uWioEjRFP9TrMT88uhvBAJ.html
23-04-2020||World||Weekly US jobless claims 4.4 mn, virus total hits 26.4 mn||Job losses from the coronavirus pandemic deepened last week with data Thursday showing another 4.4 million US workers filed new claims for jobless benefits, bringing the total to 26.4 million since mid-March.The total for the week ending April 18 is a drop from the initial claims filed in the previous three weeks, but remains at staggeringly high levels due to government-ordered shutdowns to stop the pandemic from spreading and intensifying.The outbreak in the US has grown into the world’s largest, with deaths reaching 46,583 on Wednesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.Meanwhile, lawmakers in the US House of Representatives were set to vote on a $480 billion coronavirus relief package that builds upon a massive $2.2 trillion CARES act passed in late March.The new package would provide another $320 billion for small businesses to keep their doors open and pay their workers, after the initial $349 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program was drained in just two weeks.The claims figures for last week show that the layoffs continued for a fifth week, despite the help from Congress.Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics noted the decline but said it is not falling as quickly as he had hoped. He called the total “horrendous.”“We anticipate a further decline in claims next week, but the rate of fall of Google searches for ‘file for unemployment’ has slowed, suggesting it will take several more weeks before claims drop below one million,” Shepherdson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weekly-us-jobless-claims-4-4-mn-virus-total-hits-26-4-mn/story-9R2y3BQsDhNMKaLawuXUbJ.html
23-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: US was ‘attacked’, Donald Trump says as layoffs and fatalities mount||The United States was “attacked”, President Donald Trump has said of the novel coronavirus epidemic has rendered 26.4 million Americans jobless since mid-March with 4.4 million more filing for unemployment benefits last week, according to new data released Thursday; and killed more than 46,000.Economists assess unemployment rate to have climbed to somewhere between 15% and 20%, which is far higher than the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and briskly creeping up on 25% the peak reached during the Great Depression of 1929, which was the has been the worst slowdown in US history.Businesses continue to shutter as frustration mounts and people take to the streets demanding the reopening the economy, despite pleas from experts to let current mitigation efforts run their course as it has been successful in keeping fatalities lower than it had been feared earlier.US congress is set to pass later Thursday a legislation adding $480 billion to the $2.2 trillion passed earlier; the package includes $320 billion more in relief to small businesses, who account for 48% of the US workforce, under a government program to allow them to retain their employees.“We were attacked,” President Trump told reporters at the daily briefing of the coronavirus task force Wednesday, when asked if he worries about the impact of the stimulus package on US national debt. “We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy -- better than China, better than any place.”“And then one day, they came and they said,” he added, pointing to members of his coronavirus task force, “You have to close it.”Most US states are under varying degrees of stay-at-home restrictions and lockdown. But pressure has been mounting on governors to ease restrictions, with protests taking place across the country, which have been backed and encouraged by Trump. He is just as keen to reopen the country, if not more.South Carolina and Georgia, both Republican-ruled states, have already announced lifting of some restrictions that have been found worrying by public health officials around the who fear a rebound. President Trump himself weighed in Wednesday to urge Georgia to hold on to restrictions a little longer.More states want to reopen their businesses as the situation has looked better in recent days with the country going past the peak in new infections, hospitalization rates dropping and the hotspots increasingly stabilizing. But numbers continued to grow as a grim reminder tat the crisis is not over.New infections went up by 27,679 in the past 24 hours to 542,624 and fatalities by 2,139 to 46,785. The toll in New York state, the epicenter of the US epidemic that has stabilized lately, to 19,453; New York city accounted for most of them with 15,074.But the exact extent of the US epidemic is still evolving, with “hidden outbreaks” that had previously escaped official counts. While New York city, Seattle, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco had reported only 29 confirmed cases between them by March 1, the actual number is projected to have been around 28,000, the New York Times reported citing a new model developed by researchers Northwestern University.On Tuesday, officials in California had announced the death of two individuals of the coronavirus on February 6 and February 17, much earlier than on February 29, the previously first fatality.The virus has also shown it can spread from humans to animals. The first case was of the infection of a lion at a New York zoo. Two cats in New York city became Wednesday the first pets to catch the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-us-was-attacked-donald-trump-says-as-layoffs-and-fatalities-mount/story-iEuE8VRKyoDAANV4a4crsJ.html

23-04-2020||World||China close to launching the world’s first digital currency in small pilot projects||Amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and global financial gloom, China seems set to launch the world’s first digital currency in the weeks ahead.The central bank digital currency or digital yuan, is officially referred to as the digital currency/electronic payment (DC/EP) project.It’s not a new currency but a digitised version of the existing Chinese currency yuan, which will be disbursed via a digital wallet.The wallet doesn’t need to be linked to any bank account or card.Five years in development, the DC/EP project has been largely shrouded in secrecy. Until now.A number of articles in Chinese media this month indicate that the currency could be launched as early as next month in restricted, small pilot projects.The government-affiliated Star Market Daily reported earlier this month that China’s big four state-owned banks, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Bank of China have begun testing the digital currency.On Thursday, another state media report gave details about the upcoming cautious launch of the currency.“The Chinese central bank’s digital currency DC/EP project will be tested in Xiongan New Area in north China’s Hebei province, with a trial run in local catering and retail industries including US coffee chain Starbucks, fast food chain McDonald’s and the Qingfeng Baozi (stuffed bun) restaurant chain,” the state-run tabloid Global Times reported.Employees from selected companies will be allowed to open digital wallets and operate them within the Xiongan New Area, a new development coming up about 100 km from Beijing.Three other cities — Shenzhen in southern China’s Guangdong province, Suzhou in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, and Chengdu in southwest China’s Sichuan province — will also test the central bank-backed digital currency. The new digital currency falls in China’s way toward becoming a cashless society where hundreds of millions make payments via WeChat or Alipay, which are linked to bank cards.“The DCEP will be powered partially by blockchain technology and dispersed through digital wallets. What sets it somewhat apart, however, are features that allow the central bank to track the movement of the currency and even supervise transactions,” the Reuters said in a report on DC/EP late last year.The head of the Chinese central bank’s digital currency research institute, Mu Changchun, told a public forum last year that it was “almost ready”.“However, in September, Chinese central bank chief Yi Gang said there was no timetable for its rollout and that it still needed to meet requirements, such as anti-money laundering,” the Reuters report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-close-to-launching-the-world-s-first-digital-currency-in-small-pilot-projects/story-sta1sevP2LyI9s21y8o7dK.html

The enhanced support amid the coronavirus crisis is clear since Trudeau’s popularity has jumped 21% since February this year.As ARI noted, “...more than one month into an unprecedented national shutdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Prime Minister’s front-and-centre presence at daily briefings has caused his approval ratings to do something they have not done in nearly two years: crack the majority mark.” While Trudeau is leading a minority government, he is unlikely to use the new-found surge in support to announce snap elections given not only the restrictions that remain as the country to battle Covid-19 but also as his personal approval ratings do not translate into an upswing in the fortunes of his Liberal Party, and it remains in a statistical tie with the principal opposition Conservative Party.Trudeau has also announced more measures to ease the impact of Covid-19 on post-secondary students in the country, a move that will benefit nearly 200,000 students from India, many of whom are stranded in Canada.Trudeau announced a package to support college and university students as well as recent graduates. This support will cost CA $ 9 billion, and will include CA $ 1250 to students per month under a new Canada Emergency Student Benefit. Trudeau said, while making the announcement, “The future of our economy and our country relies on the opportunities and support we provide to Canadian students today..”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-appreciated-for-handling-covid-19-crisis-approval-ratings-increase/story-vIJuu6eamCLlmtcyAWeLIO.html
23-04-2020||World||‘Fear we don’t start treating Covid-19 patients on road’: Pakistan doctors say they are running out of beds||The doctors in Pakistan have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could worsen in the country in the coming weeks, and warned people to follow social distancing norms especially during the month of Ramzan.“This is a medical problem which has its resulting economic and social effects. But we need to understand that this is nonetheless primarily a medical issue,” Dr Saad Niaz, a gastroenterologist, said at a press conference in Karachi on Wednesday.He added that the country has seen 30-40 per cent increase in the number of Covid-19 patients in the last four days, and said it’s very unfortunate that people are not considering this as a serious issue.“The severity is much more than we think and the numbers will continue to rise,” said Dr Niaz. “If a lockdown wouldn’t have been imposed, the situation would have been different. And if we don’t act now, two weeks down the line, the situation would be very different.”He also highlighted that the country’s medical infrastructure is already stretched, and said there are no beds for patients. “We will have great difficulty in the coming days such as refusal to admit patients because of no beds,” said Dr Niaz.“The projected figures of potential Covid-19 infection is 70,000, and if even 10 per cent of those are serious, we don’t have capacity to accommodate those. There are no ventilators,” said Dr Niaz.“What I fear is that we start treating patients on the road. That we don’t have to decide from among your (people’s) relatives that who is a 35-year-old and who is 55 and give preference to the younger one,” he added.According to media reports, the doctors have also written a letter pleading with the clerics to reverse the decision of leaving mosques open during Ramzan warning it could result in an explosion of Covid-19 cases as numbers are already on the rise at an increased rate throughout the country.Pakistan President Arif Alvi had last week announced that neither the state machinery nor clerics would stop citizens from visiting mosques as the government accepted almost all demands of the clerics related to the holding of Friday, Taraweeh and daily congregational prayers with the condition of social distancing and other precautionary measures.A sharp increase in Covid-19-related deaths has been recorded in Pakistan this week. More than 200 people have died, with over 10,513 infections recorded as of Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fear-we-don-t-start-treating-covid-19-patients-on-road-pakistan-doctors-say-they-are-running-out-of-beds/story-qWzqJvpv6BPXJEhDN76YdN.html

It was just another day at the office,” McGee added.Johnson, 55, was taken to Guys and St Thomas’ hospital on April 5 after his symptoms for COVID-19 worsened and he was moved into intensive care the following day, remaining there until April 9.On being discharged on April 12, Johnson said in a video message, “the NHS saved my life, no question”. He named and thanked the nurses who had cared for him, including “Jenny from New Zealand”.When Johnson sent that public message, McGee said in the interview, she was getting ready for her nightshift and a friend texted her the update.“My first reaction was that it was a joke,” she said.As McGee carried out intensive care duties, she and said she and the prime minister “spent a lot of time together and we talked away about NZ”, particularly about her home city of Invercargill, which she said he took an interest in.After shifts caring for the British leader, she said she would get in her car and “hear things about Boris Johnson on the news that was very surreal because I thought ‘wow, I’ve been looking after him’“.“But I really wasn’t fazed by looking after Boris Johnson,” she added.Johnson wasn’t the only national leader to congratulate McGee, who acknowledged she took longer than planned to respond to a message from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, saying “it’s very surreal to have a message from Jacinda. She’s a hero of mine.”Once the nurse did respond to the New Zealand leader, the two shared “a little bit of banter which again was surreal, (and) a couple of emojis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-another-patient-new-zealand-nurse-tells-of-treating-british-pm-for-virus/story-GsVId2XZ4OlolegnRlAqVN.html

23-04-2020||World||WHO warns ‘long way to go’ in coronavirus crisis||The global coronavirus crisis will not end any time soon, with many countries still in the early stages of the fight, health experts have warned as researchers revealed the first US deaths from the disease came weeks before the alarm was raised there.The Covid-19 pandemic has killed more than 180,000 people and infected more than 2.6 million, and nations are struggling to check its spread with social distancing measures and lockdowns, while trying to repair their virus-ravaged economies.Some have started to slowly ease restrictions as pressure mounts on governments to find ways to reopen their societies after tens of millions of jobs were wiped out.But World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday cautioned that the struggle is far from over.“Make no mistake: we have a long way to go. This virus will be with us for a long time,” he said.“Most countries are still in the early stages of their epidemics. And some that were affected early in the pandemic are now starting to see a resurgence in cases.” The comments came after the director of the US Centers for Disease Control asked Americans to prepare for a second, possibly more devastating, wave of coronavirus infections.The United States is the hardest-hit country on the planet, with more than 46,500 coronavirus deaths and nearly 840,000 infections.Researchers have now revealed that the first Covid-19 fatalities in the country happened weeks earlier than previously thought -- meaning the current US tally is likely far short of reality.The newly confirmed Covid-19 deaths on February 6 and February 17 were in California’s Santa Clara county, where Stanford University researchers found that the true number cases was at least 50 times higher than the confirmed official figure.The explosion of coronavirus cases across the United States has overwhelmed healthcare facilities, from the most developed parts like New York City to the Native American territory of the Navajo Nation in the southwest, where a lack of running water and poor infrastructure has made the situation worse.“Right here in the middle of the most powerful nation, the United States of America, our citizens don’t have the luxury of turning on a faucet to wash your hands with soap and water,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez told AFP.Vaccine trialsThe WHO and other health experts have warned that strict containment measures like lockdowns should remain until there is a viable treatment or vaccine for the coronavirus.There was a ray of hope on that front in Europe, where Germany announced Wednesday that human trials for a vaccine will start by next week.It is only the fifth such effort to have been authorised worldwide, and is a significant step in making a vaccine “available as soon as possible”, Germany’s regulatory body said.But even at the current, rapid pace of development, an effective prophylactic could be several months away.In Europe -- where the death toll climbed past 110,000 -- some countries have slightly eased coronavirus measures, but bans on large gatherings have been extended.Finland said it would maintain a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people until the end of July, while hard-hit Spain said it did not expect to lift its strict lockdown until mid-May.“We must be incredibly careful in this phase,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.‘I feel helpless’The pressure on governments everywhere to ease the economic pain is growing by the day, with tens of millions unemployed and several countries at risk of famine.With movement and travel severely restricted, sectors from small business to tourism and aviation have been hammered.Providing more evidence of the scale of devastation, the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization said Wednesday the pandemic could mean 1.2 billion fewer passengers worldwide, with hundreds of billions of dollars slashed off airline revenues.The economic pain is intense for the people of Dharavi, the largest slum in India, who have been unable to leave home to eke out a living as factory workers or maids and chauffeurs to the well-heeled residents of Mumbai.Home to an estimated one million people, the massive slum has been under a strict lockdown, with police drones patrolling overhead to make sure no one goes outside.“I feel helpless at times and worry about my family and neighbourhood,” one Dharavi resident, in hospital for Covid-19 treatment, told AFP.“Looking at so many people losing lives due to infections makes me feel terrible. Will we ever recover from this?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-long-way-to-go-in-coronavirus-crisis/story-28BdjVidmJYWbZtd0YxVPP.html
23-04-2020||World||Theory of 5G spreading Covid-19 ‘a hoax that has no technical basis’: UN ICT agency||The latest high-speed broadband technology 5G is not responsible for the spread of the Covid-19 and any theory of a link between it and the coronavirus is “a hoax that has no technical basis”, UN agency for information and communications technology has said.As the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the world almost four months ago, 5G phone masts have reportedly been damaged or destroyed in several European countries, including Ireland, Cyprus and Belgium. In the UK, dozens of towers were targeted and engineers abused on the job, a UN News report said.A spokesperson for International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Monika Gehner told the UN News on Wednesday that the theory of a link between 5G and Covid-19 is “a hoax that has no technical basis”.“The coronavirus is not being spread by radio waves. It’s a real shame, during this time when there are real concerns about the health and well-being of the general public, and the economic toll that the fight against this pandemic is taking, that any time or energy has to be put into fighting this and other false rumours,” she said.The 5G is the next generation cellular technology with download speeds stated to be 10 to 100 times faster than current 4G networks.The 5G reliably connect an extremely large number of devices. This allows future users to access a wide variety of services, including industrial and professional applications, the ITU said.During the current pandemic, communication technology is playing an essential role in ensuring that health services, many of which are facing unprecedented demand due to the pandemic, are able to respond function efficiently: this was underlined when a phone mast supplying voice and data traffic to a hospital built in response to the pandemic, in the UK’s Birmingham city, was reportedly set alight in April.The scale of the problem prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO), the UN agency which is leading the response to the pandemic, to add the 5G conspiracy to its Covid-19 myth busters article, which noted that “viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. Covid-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks”.In a statement published in February, the WHO noted that “to date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies”.It also noted that “provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated”.The ITU, the WHO and the UNICEF are working with telecommunication companies to text people directly on their mobile phones with vital health messaging to help protect them from Covid-19, reaching billions of people without internet access. The Global Education Coalition, an ITU/UNESCO initiative, is ensuring that learning never stops for the over 1.5 billion students and youths across the planet affected by school and university closures.The Global Network Resiliency Platform helps policy-makers, regulators and industry players ensure that networks are kept resilient and telecom services are available to as many people as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/theory-of-5g-spreading-covid-19-a-hoax-that-has-no-technical-basis-un-ict-agency/story-rOt6ilwi0ZFUPB7HcuWBaL.html
23-04-2020||World||North Korean capital sees ‘panic buying’ of food: Report||Consumers in North Korea’s capital this week have been “panic buying” food staples, causing some store shelves to empty, according to a news service that specializes in the country.The purchases may be due to stricter coronavirus measures on the way for Pyongyang and don’t appear related to reports this week that leader Kim Jong Un may be seriously ill, NK News reported, citing people who live in Pyongyang and were able to communicate outside the country. Shortages were initially limited to imported fruit and vegetables and then moved on to other goods, it said.Radio Free Asia also reported last week that the prices of food staples in North Korea were rising sharply because of panic buying.North Korea closed its borders in January when coronavirus cases in neighboring China began to skyrocket. Kim’s regime has said it has no confirmed infections from the virus but the US is “fairly certain” it has cases because of a noticeable lack of military activity, General Robert Abrams, commander of US Forces Korea, told reporters in a teleconference briefing in March.Food shortages are common in North Korea, which is one of the world’s poorest states. In the 1990s, a famine killed as much as 10% of the population, according to some estimates.The virus could make things worse. The United Nations’ World Food Program warned this week that economic hardship caused by the pandemic may lead to starvation in the developing world. The WFP, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”Kim was conspicuously absent from birthday celebrations on April 15 of his grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung. He has not been seen since a politburo meeting on April 11, raising speculation about his condition.The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim on Wednesday sent a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Letters of this sort are reported frequently.US officials said Monday they were told Kim was in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery last week and they were unsure of his current health. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected.The health of North Korea’s leader is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the isolated state, known only to a few people in its inner circle. US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he doesn’t know about Kim’s health, adding that he might reach out to check on him.General John Hyten, the vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Washington on Wednesday he couldn’t confirm or deny the reports, adding “I assume that Kim Jong-un is still in full control of the Korean nuclear forces and the Korean military forces. I have no reason not to assume that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-capital-sees-panic-buying-of-food-report/story-KWNkOANHgRsIP0PydRLtLK.html
23-04-2020||World||US signals growing unease with Pakistan, tightens export of nuclear byproducts||The United States has suspended the export of nuclear byproducts under a blanket general licensing system to Pakistan, whose history of nuclear proliferation has been a concern and has led to the blacklisting of many of its government agencies and private contractors.The decision announced in the government gazette called the Federal Register on Wednesday does not prohibit export of these nuclear materials — that are used as radionuclides embedded in devices — altogether, but make it mandatory for exporters to seek government’s permission every time and for every specific consignment. Also read: After proxy war in Kashmir, Pak launches cyber war against India and PM ModiRadionuclides are radioactive elements used widely, among other fields, in medicine and for irradiation of food. “The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an Order suspending the general license authority under NRC regulations for exports of byproduct material to Pakistan,” said the announcement in the register. “Exporters are no longer authorized to use the general license to export byproduct material to Pakistan and now must apply for a specific license pursuant to NRC regulations.”It did not ascribe any specific reason other than that the Trump administration has determined that the suspension is “necessary to enhance the common defense and security of the United States and is consistent with the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act”.The order did not say so, but under relevant rules, a country’s proliferation record can be ground for cancellation of export license. “The Commission will closely monitor these countries and may at any time remove a country from a general license in response to significant adverse developments in the country involved,” says the code of federal regulations for the energy sector. “A key factor in this regard is the nonproliferation credentials of the importing country.”A response was awaited from the US Nuclear Regulator Commission (NRC) to a request for the reasons for the suspension.Also read: Optics aside, Pakistan and US ties are still fragile | Opinion The announcement came after President Donald Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan talked on phone about the coronavirus pandemic. Trump mentioned the call at the daily briefing of the White House task force but gave no details. It would not be ascertained if the nuclear export development figured in their discussion.Pakistan’s history of nuclear proliferation has been a major concern for the United States, as for the rest of the world. The nuclear black market established by AQ Khan, who built Pakistan’s nuclear bomb with stolen technology that he then passed on to Iran, Libya and North Korea, is thriving.The Trump administration has continued to pursue Pakistani government agencies, private contractors and fronts, who have sought to find a way around US rules and conditions, with unmitigated urgency and unchanged priority.The immediate trigger for Wednesday could not be ascertained. But Joshua White, a former top White House official for South Asia who first flagged the Federal Register announcement, said, “We can’t be certain what prompted this move by the NRC. It may have been undertaken in response to a series of technical violations or regulatory oversights, or it may be in response to broader US concerns related to Pakistan’s nuclear programs or non-proliferation commitments.”The US justice department indicted five Pakistani and Pakistani-descent men in January for using front companies to procure American goods for Advanced Engineering Research Organization and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, both Pakistani government agencies that are on the US “Entity List” of exporting destinations whose activities have been declared “contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests”.In 2018, seven Pakistani organizations were added to the US “Entity List”, a US commerce department blacklist of governments, government agencies, private companies and individuals viewed as a threat to US national security and the export of sensitive US material to whom are tightly controlled and are subject to specific government clearance.The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a non-partisan, and non-profit body that seeks to end proliferation by tightening export control regimes in source countries such as the United States, said in a report in September 2019, that since 2014, the US commerce department has added 40 Pakistani or Pakistani-related entities to that list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-signals-growing-unease-with-pakistan-tightens-export-of-nuclear-byproducts/story-TUqwuYUWCGJJ6kRSgN5ftJ.html
23-04-2020||World||Pompeo renews criticism of China over wildlife wet markets, calls for closure||U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hit out at Beijing again on Wednesday over the coronavirus outbreak and accused it of taking advantage of the pandemic to bully neighbors, even as he welcomed China’s provision of essential medical supplies. Pompeo told a news briefing that the United States “strongly believed” Beijing had failed to report the outbreak in a timely manner, in breach of World Health Organization rules, and had failed to report human-to-human transmission of the virus “for a month until it was in every province inside of China.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicPompeo also said China had halted testing of new virus samples, “destroyed existing samples” and failed to share samples with the outside world, “making it impossible to track the disease’s evolution.”The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which began late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has grown into a global pandemic. The outbreak has killed around 180,000 people globally, including more than 45,000 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally. Even after Beijing notified the WHO of the outbreak, Pompeo said, “It did not share all of the information it had. Instead it covered up how dangerous the disease is.”President Donald Trump last week suspended U.S. funding of the WHO, accusing the U.N. agency of promoting China’s “disinformation” about the outbreak. WHO officials have denied this and China has said it has been transparent and open.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakPompeo said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom failed to use his ability “to go public” when a member state failed to follow the rules. He said the WHO had an obligation to ensure safety standards were observed in virology labs in Wuhan and its director-general had “enormous authority with respect to nations that do not comply.” Pompeo repeated allegations that China was exploiting the world’s focus on the pandemic with “provocative behavior” to erode autonomy in Hong Kong, exert military pressure on Taiwan and coerce neighbors in the South China Sea.“The United States strongly opposes China’s bullying, we hope other nations will hold them to account,” he said. Pompeo also expressed concern over a U.S. government-funded study that said China’s Mekong River dams held back large volumes of water during a drought in downstream countries last year despite China having higher-than-average water levels upstream. Beijing has disputed the study’s findings. The Secretary of State spoke later on Wednesday with counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and said the United States has called on China to close its wildlife wet markets permanently, citing links between the markets and zoonotic diseases, which can jump from animals to humans. The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in such a market in Wuhan late last year. While the Trump administration has stepped up criticism of China as the pandemic worsens, the crisis has exposed U.S. reliance on China for essential medical supplies.Asked about recent reports that supplies were being held up in China, Pompeo said: “The good news is we have seen China provide those resources; sometimes they’re from U.S. companies that are there in China, but we’ve had success. ... We appreciate that.“We are counting on China to continue to live up to its contractual obligations and international obligations to provide that assistance to us and to sell us those goods ... in a way consistent with all of the international trade rules.”White House adviser Peter Navarro, like Pompeo a persistent critic of Beijing, charged on Monday that China may be withholding data about early coronavirus infections because it wants to win the commercial race to create a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-renews-criticism-of-china-over-wildlife-wet-markets-calls-for-closure/story-CePLMaDE0OkFkkpVgVx0gI.html
23-04-2020||World||26 US Navy ships reported confirmed Covid-19 cases onboard||There are 26 US Navy warships currently who have reported positive coronavirus cases onboard, while 14 other ships were also hit by the deadly virus but the crew members have who contracted the contagion have recovered, a senior Navy official told CNN on Wednesday.The 26 ships with current cases are in port or maintenance yards, the official stressed.The Navy is not releasing the names of the individual ships impacted or the exact number of cases because Defense Department policy states that it would risk operational security if the details became public.There are currently 90 ships at sea with no reported cases and the Navy currently has 297 active duty warships.As of Wednesday morning, 3,578 US service members have tested positive for the virus, including two deaths. Nearly 800 of those cases have come from the outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier where one sailor also died.More than 4,000 sailors on the Roosevelt had been moved ashore and were scheduled to begin returning to the ship this coming weekend after finishing a 14-day isolation period but that process has been paused because 120 previously asymptomatic sailors tested positive.As a result the Navy has decided to keep all personnel already ashore in place until it can learn more about how the virus remains active in an asymptomatic person.In a message to his forces obtained by CNN, Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral John Aquilino directed the halting of the release of crew members from “isolation and quarantine” over concerns some may test positive after being released. He added that “that this will delay progress” towards “deploying units” and emphasized “we must take this action to ensure we get underway with healthy crews.”The Roosevelt’s commander Capt. Brett Crozier was fired earlier this month for what the then acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning about the spread of virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving him a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.Last week the Navy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched an investigation into the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt.That inquiry will look to establish the origin of the outbreak and understand how it spread rapidly on board the ship.The results of a separate Navy investigation into the circumstances of Crozier’s memo is expected soon and it is possible he could be reinstated.“This is a stealthy virus in many ways and this outbreak investigation is an important medical weapon to understand its behaviour so that we can better protect the crew, their shipmates on other vessels and ultimately the nation,” Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, US Navy Surgeon General said on Friday.To carry out the investigation, crew members are being asked on a voluntary basis to complete a survey and provide two new specimens -- blood and nasal swabs -- for laboratory testing, according to the Navy. It hopes to get 1,000 volunteers which is what it believes is needed for representative sampling. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

23-04-2020||World||‘Felt like I was dying’: Wuhan man tests positive after testing negative thrice||Trader He Ximing in the Chinese city of Wuhan says he has no idea how or where he caught the coronavirus or why repeated nucleic acid tests showed he didn’t have it.He was not a coronavirus patient, doctors told him, even though he had been having difficulty breathing with what he described as smothering chest congestion from early February.But his condition worried the authorities enough to get him sent to a quarantine centre. Still, he did not challenge the three negative tests at the time. After all, his wife did not fall sick. But he could not shake off the nagging suspicion that he had the coronavirus and in late March went to a hospital in Wuhan for more tests, including one for antibodies.This time he tested positive.“I didn’t expect it,” the 52-year-old vegetable seller said as he showed Reuters a copy of his test results - positive for antibodies showing exposure to the coronavirus.Finally, at least, he had an explanation for why he felt so terrible. “I felt like I was dying. You can’t imagine how it feels.”His case is not unique. Similar instances in China and elsewhere have compounded concern over the accuracy of coronavirus testing, even as authorities push for testing as key to handling the crisis.Unreliable testing could undermine strategies not just for stopping the virus but for opening up locked-down economies, as pressure grows on governments around the world to ease restrictions.More than 2.5 million people have been infected with the coronavirus globally and about 177,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally.Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged late last year, has recorded 50,333 cases and 3,869 deaths as of April 21, accounting for the majority of China’s cases.Nucleic acid testing, on samples swabbed from the back of a patient’s throat or respiratory tract, for the virus’ genome, is the main way cases are detected.The test is not easy to administer and, experts say, and mistakes do happen, such as if too small a sample is taken or if the swab misses a virus-hit spot. “The limitations of these tests need to be recognised, and the need to run regular tests if we want assurance that someone is truly negative, and that they remain so over a period of time,” said Andrew Preston, a lecturer in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath.TESTING TIMESThere is little consensus on what proportion of nucleic acid tests yield false negatives.A survey by Chinese doctors in February looking at samples from 213 patients suggested a false-negative rate of about 30%.Media has also reported cases of people testing negative repeatedly before finally getting a positive result.In February, the People’s Daily newspaper reported on a woman who had fallen ill with pneumonia but tested negative for the coronavirus four times. A fifth test was positive. Wuhan authorities have started testing residents for antibodies. China is conducting an epidemiological survey in nine regions in an effort to determine the full extent of asymptomatic infections and immunity levels. He said he first got tested on March 1 when his chest congestion worsened though he had no fever or cough.X-rays showed his lungs had white blotches, similar to those found in coronavirus patients, but his nucleic acid test was not positive so a hospital declined to admit him. As a precaution, a committee that manages his housing compound put him in quarantine for 14 days.Later, two more hospital tests came back negative so he turned to traditional Chinese medicine and other drugs.Finally, on March 28, he took a fourth nucleic acid test, which was again negative, but he was also tested for antibodies and got confirmation.“I told my story to a doctor and he said ‘you’re so lucky you didn’t die’,” he said in his apartment, where boxes of various medicines were scattered about.His wife, who he lives alone with, has shown no coronavirus symptoms though she has not been tested.He said he believed he was immune and not infectious, though he’s taking no chances and wears an N95 mask and a face shield when going out.“If there’s any possibility that I’ll infect others, I’ll harm them,” he said. “That’s why I’m taking these precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/felt-like-i-was-dying-wuhan-man-tests-positive-after-testing-negative-thrice/story-qq3pOnQ5IkitlIRYqlaBAJ.html
23-04-2020||World||China’s asymptomatic Covid-19 cases mount to 984 with 27 new infections||China has reported 27 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, taking their total to 984, while a high-level committee headed by Premier Li Keqiang asked health officials to remain focussed on the targeted containment of the deadly virus.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested Covid-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others. Besides the 27 asymptomatic patients, 10 new confirmed Covid cases, including six from Chinese returning from abroad, were reported in the country on Wednesday. The four other patients -- three from Heilongjiang province bordering Russia and one in Guangdong province -- were domestically transmitted, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Thursday.No death was reported on Wednesday, the NHC said.As of Wednesday, the overall confirmed Covid-19 cases in China increased to 82,798, including 4,632 fatalities and 1,616 imported cases, it said. Of the total imported cases, 37 are in critical condition, the NHC said. But more concerning factor for the Chinese authorities is the steady increase of asymptomatic cases among locals. The 27 new asymptomatic cases, including one from abroad, were reported on the mainland, the NHC said, adding that 984 such asymptomatic patients, including 166 from abroad, were still under medical observation.In a meeting on Wednesday, the Central Leading Group headed by Premier Li said considering the new circumstances and challenges at home and abroad, health official should stay focussed on targeted containment and detecting and reinforcing areas of weakness to forestall any resurgence of infection.The Central Leading Group is supervising the Covid-19 containment efforts since January.The meeting noted the recent occurrence of case clusters and cross infections in hospitals in a few Chinese cities, an official press release here said. It directed competent authorities to promptly send a working group consisting of disease control and medical experts to cities concerned to supervise local efforts in ascertaining causes and releasing information.The meeting also called for all-round progress in restarting work and full-capacity production and restoring normal life and work on the basis of regularized containment measures. Meanwhile, as of Wednesday, 1,033 confirmed cases, including four deaths, were reported in Hong Kong. Macao registered 45 Covid-19 cases and Taiwan 426, including six fatalities. A total of 678 patients in Hong Kong, 26 in Macao and 236 in Taiwan have been recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-mount-to-984-with-27-new-infections/story-DuNDBVzPylcpCg11eWmfgL.html

This would turn out to be one of the alarming ways the virus ravages the body, as doctors there and elsewhere were starting to realize.At Mount Sinai, nephrologists noticed kidney dialysis catheters getting plugged with clots. Pulmonologists monitoring COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilators could see portions of lungs were oddly bloodless. Neurosurgeons confronted a surge in their usual caseload of strokes due to blood clots, the age of victims skewing younger, with at least half testing positive for the virus. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“It’s very striking how much this disease causes clots to form,” Dr. J Mocco, a Mount Sinai neurosurgeon, said in an interview, describing how some doctors think COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, is more than a lung disease. In some cases, Mocco said, a stroke was a young patient’s first symptom of COVID-19. As colleagues from various specialties pooled their observations, they developed a new treatment protocol. Patients now receive high doses of a blood-thinning drug even before any evidence of clotting appears. “Maybe, just maybe, if you prevent the clotting, you can make the disease less severe,” said Dr. David Reich, the hospital president. The new protocol will not be used on certain high-risk patients because blood thinners can lead to bleeding in the brain and other organs.“FUNNY YOU MENTIONED THAT”In the three weeks beginning mid-March, Mocco saw 32 stroke patients with large blood blockages in the brain, double the usual number for that period.Five were unusually young, under age 49, with no obvious risk factors for strokes, “which is crazy,” he said. “Very, very atypical.” The youngest was only 31. At least half of the 32 patients would test positive for COVID-19, Mocco said.Meanwhile, Dr. Hooman Poor, a Mount Sinai lung specialist, found himself working a late shift with 14 patients on ventilators. The ventilator readings were not what he expected. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe lungs did not seem stiff, as is common in pneumonia. Instead, it seemed blood was not circulating freely through the lungs to be aerated with each breath.    Poor ran into a kidney doctor that night, who remarked that dialysis catheters were often getting blocked with clots.     “And I said, ‘It’s funny that you mentioned that because I feel like all these patients have blood clots in their lungs,’“ Poor recalled.     Reich, the hospital president, told Poor about the surge in strokes seen by Mocco and said the two doctors should team up, setting off days of discussions and meetings with the hospital’s department heads.    At 2:46 a.m. on Easter Sunday, Poor sent Mocco his first draft of what would become the new treatment protocol. DOCTORS SHARE FINDINGS     As their wards began to overflow with COVID-19 patients, the Mount Sinai doctors read papers describing similar findings from doctors in China’s Hubei province and other hard-hit areas, and discussed them with their peers in phone calls and webinars.Mocco called neurosurgeons he knows elsewhere in the country. At Philadelphia’s Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Dr. Pascal Jabbour had begun to see a similar surge in strokes among people with COVID-19. The way his patients’ blood congealed reminded him of congenital conditions such as lupus, or certain cancers.“I’ve never seen any other viruses causing that,” Jabbour said.In Boston, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center began a clinical trial earlier this month to see if tPA, an anti-clotting drug, could help severely sick COVID-19 patients.    Clotting can develop in anyone who gets very sick and spends long periods of time immobile on a ventilator, but doctors say the problem seemed to show up sooner in COVID-19 patients as a more direct consequence of the virus.    At Mount Sinai, patients in intensive care often receive the blood-thinning agent heparin in weaker prophylactic doses. Under the new protocol, higher doses of heparin normally used to dissolve clots will be given to patients before any clots are detected. The treatment joins a growing toolbox at the hospital, where some patients are receiving the antibody-rich plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients or experimental antiviral drugs.    The American Society of Hematology, which has also noted the clotting, says in its guidance to physicians that the benefits of the blood-thinning therapy for COVID-19 patients not already showing signs of clotting are “currently unknown.”     “I certainly wouldn’t expect harps to play and angels to sing and people to just rip out their intravenous lines and waltz out of the hospital,” said Reich. “It’s likely going to be something where it just moderates the extent of the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-in-us-say-covid-19-causes-thick-clots-in-lungs-kidneys-and-brain/story-IZflqLbmN7g8zDEukM5HbI.html

This was an attack. This wasn’t just the flu by the way. Nobody has ever seen anything like this, 1917 was the last time,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on Wednesday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here He was responding to a question about the growing US national debt as a result of the multi-trillion dollars stimulus packages that his administration has come up with to help people and businesses in distress as a direct fallout of the pandemic.“We have no choice. Do we have a choice? I’m always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem,” he said. “We had the greatest economy in the history of the world... Better than China, better than any place,” he said.“We built it in the last three years and then one day, they came and they said you have to close it. Now, we’re going to open it again and we’re going to be just as strong or stronger but you have to spend some money to get it back open,” he said. “We saved our airlines. We saved numerous companies that are great companies that two months ago were having the best year they’ve ever had.

They are going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area are now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific... Detroit has passed its peak,” he said.“These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. That’s very exciting,” he asserted. Trump said that his administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus if they’re so inclined to use the testing apparatus, including strategies for older individuals, low income Americans, minorities, and Native Americans. “I’ll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored. I really believe that we’re going to lift those numbers higher than ever before, and it will be as long as people might think,” he said.“A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they’re betting. You just have to look at what’s going on with the stock market,” he added.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  The administration so far has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies. The FDA, the NIH, and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time. More than 1600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-wasn-t-just-a-flu-us-was-attacked-donald-trump-amid-struggle-to-restore-normalcy/story-ZzS9G8FAilTVFAOqIMOyvK.html

President Donald Trump last week announced a temporary halt to US funding for the UN agency, alleging a WHO cover-up and missteps handling the outbreak.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The US is the Geneva-based agency’s biggest donor, providing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of support each year. In Washington, officials said on Wednesday the halt involved new funding for the WHO, and was expected to continue for 60 to 90 days. A group of Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives last week suggested that Trump should condition any voluntary US contributions to the WHO this year on Tedros’ resignation. Asked about whether he was considering that, Tedros said: “I will continue to work day and night because this is a blessed work, actually, and responsibility saving lives, and I will focus on that.” Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies chief, said the US pause would impact core agency activities like child immunizations, efforts to eradicate polio, and “essential health services and trauma management in some of the most vulnerable populations in the world.” “I very much hope that ... this is a 60-day stay on funding,” and no more, he said. “That’s why you don’t see me complaining, because we just need to get on with it.” ‘Click here for complete coronavirus coverage At a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new tranche of US assistance to specific countries, bringing the total of virus aid this year to more than USD 700 million.

23-04-2020||World||2 cats in New York become first US pets to test positive for virus||Two pet cats in New York state have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases in companion animals in the United States, federal officials said Wednesday.The cats, which had mild respiratory illnesses and are expected to recover, are thought to have contracted the virus from people in their households or neighborhoods, the US Department of Agriculture and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.The finding, which comes after positive tests in some tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo, adds to a small number of confirmed cases of the virus in animals worldwide.US authorities, including the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, say that while it appears some animals can get the virus from people, there’s no indication pets are transmitting it to human beings.“Now, obviously, is that impossible? I mean, biologically, no, anything is possible,” Fauci said. “But there’s no evidence whatsoever that we’ve seen from an epidemiological standpoint that pets can be transmitters within a household.”Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh, a CDC official who works on human-animal health connections, stressed that there’s no need for pet owners to panic, or rush to test their animals.“We don’t want people to be afraid of pets,” Barton Behravesh said. “There’s no evidence that pets are playing a role in spreading this disease to people.”Still, the CDC is recommending that people prevent their pets from interacting with people or animals outside their homes -- by keeping cats indoors and dogs out of dog parks, for instance.Coronavirus testing for pets isn’t recommended unless an animal has been exposed to a person with Covid-19 and the animal has symptoms of the disease — and tests have ruled out more common possible causes, said Dr. Jane Rooney of the USDA. Veterinarians who think testing is warranted are supposed to contact state officials to decide.Barton Behravesh said the animal tests are done at veterinary labs and use different chemicals than human tests, which have been in short supply during the crisis.The American Veterinary Medical Association says pets can stay in homes where a person has Covid-19, so long as the animal can be cared for.“In this emergency, pets and people each need the support of the other,” the group said in a statement Wednesday.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal.Scientists studying the virus have been looking closely at links between human and animals. While a consensus is still evolving, the leading theory is that infection among humans began at an animal market in China, probably from an animal that got the virus from a bat.Scientists are working to understand the potential for transmission to animals in homes, farms and elsewhere. So far, it doesn’t appear that livestock or poultry are susceptible, Rooney said.The two cats live in different parts of the state; the USDA and CDC wouldn’t say where specifically.The first cat fell ill about a week after a person in its household had a short respiratory illness, though the person’s ailment wasn’t confirmed to be Covid-19, Barton Behravesh said. The animal goes outdoors at times and might have come into contact with an infected person in the area, she said.The second cat’s owner tested positive for Covid-19 before the cat became sick, officials said. Another cat in the same home hasn’t shown any signs of illness.The cats’ symptoms included coughing and slightly runny noses, officials said.The agencies have recommended that any pet owners with Covid-19 avoid petting, snuggling or other contact with their animals as much as possible, including wearing a face covering while caring for them.There have been a handful of reports outside the U.S. of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.A tiger at the Bronx Zoo had what was believed to be the first confirmed coronavirus case in an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere. The 4-year-old Malayan tiger, named Nadia, was tested after starting to showing signs of illness on March 27, 11 days after the zoo closed to the public because of the virus.Three other tigers and three lions later showed symptoms. Tests subsequently confirmed they all had the virus, as did another tiger that shares their exhibit but didn’t show any signs of illness, the zoo said Wednesday.All the affected cats are doing well, with good appetites and much less coughing, the zoo said.Zoo officials said they believe the animals were exposed by a keeper who had the virus but wasn’t showing symptoms at the time. Staffers who work with the cats have since started wearing infection-protection garb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-cats-in-new-york-become-first-us-pets-to-test-positive-for-virus/story-sX7SXLJkEkNdIlZpEvcp6N.html

Research director Professor Sarah Gilbert estimated that it has around an 80 percent chance of being successful. The institute aims to develop a million doses of the vaccine by September, so as to distribute it as quickly as possible after approval. The Oxford trial is part of a nationwide effort in the UK which since Friday has been spearheaded by a government taskforce. Also read: Covid-19 deaths could be much higher than known, say reportsIn Germany, meanwhile, the PEI said its approval of the Biontech trial marked a “significant step” in making a vaccine “available as soon as possible”.In the first phase, it will see “200 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 55 years” vaccinated with variants of the vaccine, while the second phase could see the inclusion of volunteers who belonged to high-risk groups. On Wednesday, Biontech CEO Ugur Sahin told a press conference that tests would begin “at the end of April”.He added that the firm expected to have collected first data by “the end of June or beginning of July”. Biontech also said that they and Pfizer hoped to gain regulatory approval soon to test the same vaccine candidate in the US. The PEI meanwhile claimed that “further clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates will start in Germany in the next few months”.‘Normalcy’There are currently no approved vaccines or medication for the COVID-19 disease, which has killed more than 170,000 people worldwide and infected more than two million.Experts estimate that it will take at least 12 to 18 months to develop a new vaccine. Last week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a vaccine was the only thing to return “normalcy” to the world, and called for development projects to be accelerated.A UN resolution adopted on Monday, meanwhile, called for “equitable, efficient and timely” access to any vaccine that might be developed.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayAside from Biontech and Oxford, three other clinical trials on humans have been approved worldwide since mid-March, with Chinese and US developers among the first to move. Beijing approved the first trial for a vaccine developed by the military-backed Academy of Military Medical Sciences and Hong Kong-listed biotech firm CanSino Bio on March 16.That day the US drug developer Moderna said it had begun human tests for their vaccine with the US National Institutes of Health.Another US lab, San Diego-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals, began first phase human trials on April 6.Yet while Biontech hailed what it called a “global development program” on Wednesday, the search for a vaccine has also been a cause of friction between countries.

23-04-2020||World||Trump ‘disagrees strongly’ with Georgia’s plan to reopen||President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he “disagreed strongly” with the decision by Georgia’s Republican governor to reopen salons, gyms and other nonessential businesses later this week, saying, “It’s just too soon.”Trump’s comments at a daily White House briefing marked an abrupt shift in tone. Just last week, the president urged his supporters on Twitter to protest against statewide closures in three Democratic-led states — at the same time that mostly Republican governors like Brian Kemp were taking steps to lift stay-at-home restrictions.Kemp announced earlier this week that as of Friday, elective medical procedures could resume in Georgia, and that barbershops, nail salons and gyms could reopen with restrictions. Limited in-restaurant dining is scheduled to resume on Monday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe announcement immediately prompted pushback by Atlanta’s Democratic mayor, other political opponents and health experts who warned that the state has not yet taken the steps recommended under federal guidelines to reopen the economy safely.Georgia ranks in the bottom 10 U.S. states in per capita testing for the coronavirus. Officials are struggling to increase testing for new infections and boost tracking of those in contact with infected people. If that isn’t done, health officials said, the state risks a quick rebound of COVID-19.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“The virus moves faster than government does,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “So if I had to bet on who would come out of the gate faster, it would be the virus.”Trump has been stressing the importance of reopening states sooner than later to get the US economy back on track and his administration recently announced a three-phase plan for making that happen. He also had health experts working with his administration present a lengthy briefing last week to show that states would have the testing capacity necessary to track and contain infections and start lifting restrictions.But on Wednesday, he said he told Kemp that he had misgivings over the governor’s plan to reopen quickly. He also said that he would not stand in his way.“I want him to do what he thinks is right,” Trump said. “But I disagree with him on what he’s doing. ... I think (opening) spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one ... it’s just too soon.”Kemp responded in a tweet Wednesday night that he appreciated Trump’s guidance but would move forward with his plan.“Our next measured step is driven by data and guided by state public health officials,” the governor said. “I am confident that business owners who decide to reopen will adhere to minimum basic operations, which prioritize the health and well-being of employees and customers.”Trump’s reopening guidelines recommend 14 days of declining new infections before moving to the reopening phase that Kemp has called for. That means testing health care workers and people showing symptoms, as well as screening others not showing symptoms.The number of tests administered in Georgia had plateaued between 3,500 to 4,000 a day. However, on Wednesday, the state reported almost 6,000 tests over 24 hours, with Kemp saying on a conference call with Republican US Sen. Kelly Loeffler that Georgia was “really ramping up” its capacity.State Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey said the state will expand its ability to “aggressively” trace the contacts of infected people.“This is the way we’re going to keep spread from occurring, even as we begin to gradually open up the state,” Toomey said.As of Wednesday, more than 21,000 people in Georgia had been infected with the virus and more than 840 had died, according to the state Department of Public Health.Sean Bear, an epidemiologist with the department’s eight-county district that includes Savannah, said intensive contact tracing has likely helped slow infections in his region. Bear said the coastal district kept tracking contacts, unlike areas where rising caseloads forced officials to largely stop.The state hasn’t said how many people are tracing contacts now, how many it seeks, or how quickly the state’s 18 public health districts can ramp up.Toomey and Kemp said the state will use a cellphone app to track infected people, and ask those people to voluntarily share cellphone data so that the state can find other contacts.In announcing his reopening plan, Kemp remarked, “There are a lot of people that are hurting really bad right now on the financial end of things — our hard-working Georgians. And we’re trying to do all we can to allow them to start moving back into the work force in a limited and safe way.”Many businesses and workers are holding back for fear of illness.Dewond Brown, 42, was laid off in March from an Atlanta-area restaurant as a line cook making $16.40 hourly.Worried about his high blood pressure, he said he wouldn’t go back if his employer reopened. He said he would want to know coworkers tested negative and see a sharp drop in new cases.“I understand everybody wants to get back to normal, but you hear the medical people say everyday it’s not time yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-disagrees-strongly-with-georgia-s-plan-to-reopen/story-4Hm7kAiesbmX29kHuZmDkL.html

On several occasions, U.S. Navy ships fired warning shots at Iranian vessels when they got too close.“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump wrote in a tweet, hours after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had launched the country’s first military satellite into orbit.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile the Navy has the authority to act in self-defense, Trump’s comments appeared to go further and were likely to stoke tensions between Iran and the United States.In a briefing at the White House later on Wednesday, Trump said the military would not be changing its rules of engagement.“We’re covered, we’re covered 100 percent,” Trump saidSenior Pentagon officials said that Trump’s comments on Iran were meant as a warning to Tehran, but suggested that the U.S. military would continue to abide by its existing right to self-defense instead of any changes to its rules.“The president issued an important warning to the Iranians, what he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense,” Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist told reporters at the Pentagon.The United States should focus on saving its military from the coronavirus, an Iranian armed forces spokesman said on Wednesday.Earlier this month, the U.S. military said 11 vessels from the IRGCN came close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf, calling the moves “dangerous and provocative.”At one point, the Iranian vessels came within 10 yards (9 m) of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui.While such interactions at sea occurred occasionally a few years ago, they had stopped recently.Tensions between Iran and the United States increased earlier this year after the United States killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a drone strike in Iraq.Iran retaliated on Jan. 8 with a rocket attack on Iraq’s Ain al-Asad base where U.S. forces were stationed. No U.S. troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury, but more than 100 were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tells-navy-to-destroy-iranian-gunboats-if-they-harass-american-ships/story-I1BPGV9eh5vRRsZPRWM4OM.html

It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad,” he said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe executive order, a copy of which was released by the White House, said the new provisions apply to foreign nationals outside the US who do not have an immigrant visa that is valid on the effective date of proclamation.It also applies to those foreign nationals who do not have an official travel document other than a visa that is valid on the effective date of proclamation or issued on any date thereafter that permits him or her to travel to the US and seek entry or admission. The suspension, the executive order said, does not apply to those foreign nationals already inside the country on a green card. It provides exemptions to healthcare workers, or seeking to enter the US as a legal permanent resident under investment category.Spouses of a US citizen, 21 years and younger kids of American nationals, or those who are under the process of being adopted are also exempted from this temporary suspension of immigration.Also read| Covid deaths could be much higher than known: ReportsTrump said he was determined that, without this measure, the US faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labour supply outpaces labour demand. “Excess labour supply affects all workers and potential workers, but it is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment, who are typically ‘last in’ during an economic expansion and ‘first out’ during an economic contraction,” he said in his executive order.“In recent years, these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups, including African Americans and other minorities, those without a college degree, and the disabled.These are the workers who, at the margin between employment and unemployment, are likely to bear the burden of excess labour supply disproportionately,” he said. The White House in a statement said that this is a temporary pause demanded by the crisis being faced as a nation. “The pause will be in effect for 60 days, and the administration will continue to monitor the labour market to amend or extend the proclamation if needed,” it said. “There will be exemptions for medical and other essential workers to combat the outbreak, spouses and minor children of American citizens, and certain other aliens,” it said.Trump is also asking his administration to review guest worker programmes to assess whether additional measures should be taken to protect American workers. The White House further said that mass migration of low-skilled labour into the US disproportionately harms historically disadvantaged Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-executive-order-temporarily-suspending-immigration-into-us/story-ZvmaJBXJTtJLuLCNhAxw9N.html
23-04-2020||World||World could face many famines of biblical proportions: UN||The head of the UN food agency has warned that, as the world is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, it is also “on the brink of a hunger pandemic” that could lead to “multiple famines of biblical proportions” within a few months if immediate action isn’t taken.World Food Programme executive director David Beasley told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that even before Covid-19 became an issue, he was telling world leaders that “2020 would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II”. That’s because of wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, locust swarms in Africa, frequent natural disasters and economic crises including in Lebanon, Congo, Sudan and Ethiopia, he said. Beasley said 821 million people go to bed hungry every night all over the world today, and a new WFP analysis shows that as a result of Covid-19, an additional 130 mn people “could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.”He said WFP is providing food to nearly 100 mn people on any given day, including “about 30 mn people who literally depend on us to stay alive”. Beasley, who is himself recovering from Covid-19, said if those 30mn people can’t be reached, “our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period” - and that doesn’t include increased starvation due to the coronavirus pandemic.“In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in fact, in 10 of these countries we already have more than one million people per country who are on the verge of starvation.” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-could-face-many-famines-of-biblical-proportions-un/story-6appZ3W8mb9GKvS5uHWo5J.html
23-04-2020||World||Drug touted by US president has no benefit, warn experts||A panel of experts called by US government’s top agency on infectious diseases on Tuesday recommended against the use of a combination of an antimalarial drug and an antibiotic that US President Donald Trump has been touting as a potential “game-changer” in the hunt for a treatment for Covid-19.The experts’ panel said in guidelines for treatment that except for the purposes of clinical trials, it “recommends against” the use of the antimalarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus Azithromycin, an antibiotic, “because of the potential for toxicities”.But the US body left open the use of HCQ or another version of it, chloroquine, saying there is insufficient data to recommend for or against their use. The panel warned clinicians that if they did administer HCQ or chloroquine, they should “monitor the patient for adverse effect”.Also, an analysis published on Tuesday on the use of HCQ to treat coronavirus patients in US Veteran Affairs hospitals showed no benefits and caused more deaths. Researchers and experts have said the study was not rigorous enough and more data is required.The panel of experts that issued the guidelines was convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a federal agency headed by Anthony Fauci, a member of Trump’s White House task force on the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-touted-by-us-president-has-no-benefit-warn-experts/story-iY8y6ZN0b9NEHD8IUFG1zL.html
23-04-2020||World||Covid deaths could be much higher than known: Reports||There may be tens of thousands of more deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic around the world than currently established, according to reports by the New York Times and the Financial Times that analysed cumulative mortality figures.The estimation is based on the “all cause excess mortality”, which looks at the rise in deaths due to any cause compared with a historic average for that particular period.In the case of the UK, the total missing Covid-19 deaths could be more than double the actual number, according to the FT, which cited official data showing a 75% increase in deaths in the week ending April 10. The pandemic has already caused as many as 41,000 deaths, the report claimed, on a day when the official Covid-19 fatality figure was pegged at a little over 17,000.The NYT said that the analysis of all cause mortality data from 11 countries, including the UK and the US, showed that 25,000 more deaths may have taken place in the last month than acknowledged officially.“In the last month, far more people died in these countries than in previous years, the New York Times found. The totals include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated as hospitals became overwhelmed, the report said.Total death numbers offer a more complete portrait of the pandemic, the report added citing experts, because most countries report only those Covid-19 deaths that occur in hospitals.These numbers are usually delayed or hard to come by, both reports noted. In the case of Indonesia, for example, the NYT assessment used the average number of burials for its calculations.“Whatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate,” NYT quoted Tim Riffe, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany, as saying. “In a lot of places, the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was,” said Riffe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-deaths-could-be-much-higher-than-known-reports/story-sPzRaTzaR997AiD6s5MglN.html
